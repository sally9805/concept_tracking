PROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY FALK . // UNPUBLISHED FACTS RELATING TO THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON . BY JOHN M. SCHOFIELD , LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. A. DURING nearly the entire history of the government of the United States the relations between the general-in-chief , or nominal commanding general of the army , and the War Department have been the cause of discord , sometimes descending to bitter personal controversy , and in a few instances leading to very serious results . The differences between General Scott and the Secretary became so serious that the general removed his headquarters from Washington to New York , and remained away from the capital several years , until the time when civil war was imminent . General Sherman also found it necessary to escape from an intolerable situation by removing to St. Louis , and did not return to Washington until the condition of the War Department led to the impeachment of the Secretary of War . During their long absence from the capital neither of these generals could exercise any appreciable influence over either the administration or the command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that during one of those periods of absence of the general-inchief the military resources of the country were mostly placed within easy reach of those about to engage in an effort to break up the Union , and that during the other period corruption in the War Department led to impeachment . It is no reflection upon the many eminent , patriotic citizens who have held the war portfolio to say that the very few men who have proved unworthy of that great trust would have been much less likely to do serious harm to the public interests if they had been under the watchful eye of a jealous old soldier , like Scott or Sherman , who was not afraid of them . As hereafter explained , the controversy between General Grant and the Secretary of War finally led to the impeachment of the President of the United States . The cause of this trouble has seemed to be inherent in the form and character of the government . An essential provision of the Constitution makes the President commander-in-chief of the army and navy . It is manifestly indispensable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clothed with this authority . Yet the President is not , as a rule , a man of military education or experience . The exigencies of party politics also seem to require , in general , that the Secretary of War be a party politician , equally lacking with the President in qualifications for military command . The art of war has in all ages called forth the highest order of genius and character , the great captains of the world having been esteemed as among the greatest men . So , also , arid in continually increasing degree in modern times , the military art has called for scientific education of the very highest character , supplemented by practical experience . It can not be questioned that the military profession requires ability , education , and practical training no less than the legal or any other profession . A Supreme Court of the United States composed of merchants and bankers would be no more of an anomaly than a body of general and staff officers of like composition . The general policy of our government seems to be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national military academy and other military schools inferior to none in the world , and well-organized staff departments which are thoroughly efficient in war as well as in peace . The laws also provide a due proportion of subordinate general officers for the command of geographical departments in time of peace , or of divisions and brigades in the field in time of war . But no provision is made for an actual military commander of the entire army either in peace or in war . During only one single year since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States has this not been the fact . In pursuance of a special act of Congress and the orders of President Lincoln , General Grant in fact commanded ( ( all the armies of the United States ) ) during the last year of the Civil War ; but at no other time has there been an actual military commander of the army or armies whose authority as such was recognized by the War Department . Why , it may be asked , this strange departure from the recognized rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why provide educated and trained experts for all subordinate positions , and none for the head or chief , vastly the most important of all ? In the first place , it is important to observe that the matter rests absolutely in the hands of the President : Congress has no power in the matter . To create by law a military head for the army would be a violation of the essential provision of the Constitution which makes the President commander-in-chief . In the case of General Grant , Congress fully recognized this fact , saying : ( ( Under the direction and during the pleasure of the President ) ) he * command the armies of the United States . Even this , if intended as conveying authority to the President , was superfluous , and if intended as more than that would have been unconstitutional . In fact , it was only a suggestion , intended to be entirely within the limits of constitutional propriety , of what was the general opinion of the people and of Congress , that after three years of failure the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the armies . The President then went far beyond the suggestion of Congress , and even to the extreme limit of military abdication . He not only gave General Grant absolute , independent command , placing at his disposal all the military resources of the country , but he even denied to himself any knowledge whatever of the general 's plans . In this patriotic act of extreme self-abnegation President Lincoln undoubtedly acted in exact accord with what he believed to be the expressed popular opinion , and probably in accord with his own judgment and inclination ; for no one could have been more painfully aware than he had by that time become of the absolute necessity of having a military man actually in control of all the armies , or more desirous than he of relief from a responsibility to which he and his advisers had proved so unequal . But it must be admitted that in this President Lincoln went beyond the limit fixed by his constitutional obligation as commander-in-chief . He would have more exactly fulfilled that obligation if he had endeavored faithfully to comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chosen and trusted general-in-chief , guarding the latter against all possible interference , theretofore so pernicious , from the War Department or any other source . By such means the President could have actually exercised the chief command imposed upon him by the Constitution , sharing in due measure with his chief military officer the responsibilities imposed by their high offices . In no other way , it is believed , can the duties imposed upon a constitutional commander-in-chief who is not possessed of military education and experience be fully and conscientiously performed . Indeed , such is the method pursued by great military sovereigns all over the world , except in the few instances where the monarch believes himself , either truly or falsely , superior in military ability to his chief of staff . It is only in this country , where the chief of state has generally no military training , and his war minister the same , that a chief of staff of the army is supposed to be unnecessary . While it is easy to understand the reasons which led to the action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less easy to understand why some reasonable approximation to that course , as above suggested , and in accord with the practice of all military nations , has never been adopted as a permanent system in this country . Perhaps it may be like the case of that citizen of Arkansas who did not mend the roof of his house when it was not raining because it did not then need mending . But it would seem the part of wisdom to perfect the military system so far as practicable in time of peace rather than continue a fruitless controversy over the exact location of an undefined and undefinable line supposed to separate the military administration from thecommand inthe army , or the functions of the Secretary of War from those of the commanding general . The experience of many years had shown that the Secretary was sure to get on both sides of that line , no matter where it was drawn . But it is encouraging to note that some experiments made in more recent years , in the direction of the generally recognized sound military system , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the military administration and the command once gave rise to one of the most dangerous crises in American history . The facts in respect to the origin of that crisis soon became obscured by other events , and have never been correctly published . The assassination of President Lincoln occurred a very short time before the end of the Civil War . It appears that his successor in the Presidential office did not withdraw any part of the supreme authority which had been conferred upon General Grant by President Lincoln a year before . Nevertheless , Secretary Stanton , who had very reluctantly // yielded to President Lincoln 's order , began , soon after the end of hostile operations , to resume the exercise of those functions which had formerly been claimed as belonging to the War Department , and which had been suspended by President Lincoln . By this General Grant was deeply offended , and finally declared that the action of the Secretary of War was intolerable . Early in August , 1867 , ' in Richmond , Virginia , General Grant in most emphatic terms announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the President either remove Secretary Stanton or accept his ( General Grant 's ) resignation . A very few days later the President 's order was published suspending Secretary Stanton and appointing General Grant Secretary of War ad interim . Up to this time General Grant 's relations with the President had not been unfriendly , and it seems more than probable that his demand was used as a sufficient reason for doing what would not otherwise have been done , namely , the removal of Secretary Stanton . But events connected with the return of Stanton to the War Department , after the Senate had declined to concur in his suspension , produced intense bitterness of feeling between President Johnson and General Grant . This overshadowed entirely the former difference between Grant and Stanton , so that they became practically friends and allies in their common hostility to Johnson . Thus the original cause of Stanton 's removal , which led to Johnson 's impeachment , was lost sight of and never became public . Of the impeachment and trial of President Johnson it is not my province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cause , above referred to , and its termination , both intimately connected with the history of the War Department , the necessities of which department , real or supposed , constituted the only vital issue involved in the impeachment trial . The following memorandum , made by me at the time , and now published with the consent of Mr. Evarts , explains the circumstances under which I became Secretary of War in 1868 , and the connection of that event with the termination of the impeachment trial : ( ( MEMORANDUM . ( ( May , 1868 . ( ( In compliance with a written request from Mr. W. M. Evarts , dated Tuesday , April 21 , 1868 , 2 P. M. , I called upon that gentleman in his room at Willard 's Hotel , Washington , 1 Three or four days before the suspension of Stanton . a few minutes before three o'clock P. M. of the same day . ( ( Mr. Evarts introduced conversation by saying something about the approaching trial of Mr. Jefferson Davis , but quickly said that was not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he wished to see me was of vastly greater importance , involving the safety of the country and the maintenance of the Constitution . Mr. Evarts then asked General Schofield 's consent that the President might at any time before the close of the impeachment trial send my nomination to the Senate as Secretary of War in place of Mr. Stanton . General Schofield asked upon what ground , and for what reasons , the proposition was made , which question was then answered in part , and in the evening of the same day more fully , as hereafter related . It having been announced that General Grant was waiting at the door for me , this first interview was cut short with an agreement to renew it about eight o'clock the same evening . Before separating I asked Mr. Evarts whether I was at liberty to mention the subject to any other person . Mr. Evarts replied : ( I suppose you mean General Grant . ) I said : ( Yes ; my relations with General Grant , and his with the President , are such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without consulting him . ) Mr. Evarts said he could not give consent that any person should be informed that such a proposition had been made on behalf of the President , and suggested some objections to consulting General Grant on the subject , for the reason of his being a candidate for the Presidency , but finally intimated that it might be well to talk to General Grant about it incidentally , and thus learn his views . ( ( While walking with General Grant after dinner the same day , I said to him , in effect , that I had reason to believe that a proposition like the one referred to above would probably be made to me , and that upon the theory , as I understood , that the President would not be convicted by the Senate , and I asked General Grant 's opinion in regard to it . General Grant replied that he had supposed there was no reasonable doubt of the President 's removal , but if that was not the case , or if it were , he ( General Grant ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War during the remainder of the term ; that Mr. Wade would have some difficulty in making up a cabinet for so short a portion of a term . ( ( About eight o'clock P. M. of the same day ( April 21 ) I again called upon Mr. Evarts at // the hotel , when a long conversation took place upon the subject referred to in the morning . The substance of what Mr. Evarts said was as follows : He was fully satisfied that the President could not be convicted upon the evidence ; if he was removed , it would be done wholly from supposed party necessity ; that this was the opinion and feeling of a considerable number of the ablest lawyers and statesmen among the Republican senators ; that it was his and their opinion that if the President was removed , it would be not really from anything he had done , but for fear of what he might do ; that he ( Mr. Evarts ) did not believe the President could possibly be convicted in any event , but that senators were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party as to what the President would do in case of acquittal , unless the War Department was placed in a satisfactory condition in advance . He said : ( A majority of Republicans in both houses of Congress and throughout the country now regret the commencement of the impeachment proceedings , since they find howslight is the evidence of guilty intent . But now the serious question is , how to get out of the scrape ? A judgment of guilty and removal of the President would be ruinous to the party , and cause the political death of every senator who voted for it as soon as the country has time to reflect upon the facts and appreciate the frivolous character of the charges upon which the rerrioval must be based . The precedent of the impeachment and removal of the President for political reasons would be exceedingly dangerous to the government and the Constitution ; in short , the emergency is one of great national peril . ) He added that this was the view of the case entertained by several among the most prominent Republican senators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination as Secretary of War be sent to the Senate , in order that the Senate might vote upon the President 's case in the light of that nomination . Mr. Evarts believed that I was so named because my appointment would be satisfactory to General Grant , and would give the Republican party a sense of security as to the President 's future action in reference to the War Department and the military districts of the South ; that it was not with anybody a question of friendship or hostility toward the President personally , for he really had no friends . That while the Democrats in the Senate would of course vote for his acquittal , and do their whole duty in the case , just so soon as he was removed they would rejoice that it was done , feeling confident that it would cause the overthrow of the Republican party and the defeat of General Grant . Mr. Evarts was not at liberty to mention names of senators holding these views and originating the proposition of my nomination . " I suggested a number of objections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public character , to giving my assent to the proposed nomination , in reply to which objections many of the above statements by Mr. Evarts were made . I then said I would again talk with General Grant upon the subject , and give a definite reply the next morning . About eleven o'clockthe same night ( April 21 ) I informed General Grant at my house that the proposition above named had been ( or it would be ) made to me ; that it originated with Republican senators ; and I gave in substance the reasons above stated as what I understood to be the grounds upon which the proposition was made . I did not give any names of senators , nor the channel through which my information or the proposition came . My remarks to General Grant were prefaced by the statement that while I would be glad of General Grant 's advice if he felt at liberty to give it , I did not wish to ask General Grant to commit himself in so delicate a matter unless he desired to do so ; but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it my duty to tell him all about it , and what I believed I ought to do , and leave General Grant to advise or not , as he thought best . I said that although the statement of the views and wishes of senators above referred to came to me indirectly , they came in such a way as not to permit me to doubt their correctness , and 1 believed it my duty to yield to the request . General Grant at once replied that under those circumstances he did not see how I could do otherwise . General Grant said he did not believe in any compromise of the impeachment question . The President ought . to be convicted or acquitted fairly and squarely on the facts proved . That if he was acquitted , as soon as Congress adjourned he would trample the laws under foot and do whatever he pleased ; that Congress would have to remain in session all summer to protect the country from the lawless acts of the President ; that the only limit to his violation of law had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very slight heretofore , but would be vastly increased by his escape from punishment . General Grant said he would not believe any pledge or promise Mr. Johnson // might make in regard to his future conduct . In his opinion , the only safe course , and the most popular one , would be to remove the President . He could understand the grounds of apprehension in the minds of some leading Republicans , but he did not agree with them . He believed the safest and wisest course was the bold and direct one . In this General Grant was very emphatic ; he said he would not advise me to enter into any project to compromise the impeachment question , but if the facts were as represented that I could not well do otherwise than to acquiesce in the nomination . ( ( The next morning ( April 22 ) , about ten o'clock , I called upon Mr. Evarts at Willard 's Hotel , and informed him that I had considered the matter as carefully as I was able to do , and that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what would be the policy of the President during the remainder of his term , in the event of his being acquitted . I mentioned some of the President 's recent acts , such as the creation of the Military Division of the Atlantic , disregard of military usage in sending orders to army officers out of the regular channels , etc. ,  --  acts for which no good reason could be given , and which at least tended to create discord and trouble . Mr. Evarts replied that he could not tell anything about those matters , but presumed that such annoying irregularities would disappear with the removal of their cause , namely , hostility between the President and the Secretary of War . Mr. Evarts said he did not see howl could satisfy myself on that subject without a personal interview with the President , which would not be advisable in the circumstances . I then said I did not expect any pledge from the President , and did not expect to receive any communication from him on the subject , either directly or indirectly ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor with any other person except Mr. Evarts , on the subject ; but that I wished the President to understand distinctly the conditions upon which I was willing to accept the appointment , and desired Mr. Evarts to inform the President of these conditions . If the nomination was then made , General Schofield would take it for granted that the conditions were satisfactory . I then said I had always been treated kindly by the President , and felt kindly toward him ; that I had always advised him , whenever any excuse had been given for offering advice , to avoid all causes of irritation with Congress , and try to act in harmony with the legislative department ; that I regarded the removal of Mr. Stanton , in the way it was done , as wrong and unwise ; that I understood this proposition as coming originally from the Republican side of the Senate , and as being accepted by the President in the interest of peace , and for the purpose of securing harmony between the legislative and executive departments of the government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reconstruction Acts . I added : ( And if the President knows from General Schofield 's acts what he means by this ,  --  if , after these conditions have been fully stated to the *resident , he sends my name to the Senate , - I will deem it my duty to say nothing on the sub ject of accepting or declining the appointment until the Senate has acted upon it . ( ( Mr. Evarts intimated that the above was satisfactory , and the interview then ended . ) ) I returned to Richmond on Thursday , April 2:3 , being then in command in Virginia , executing the Reconstruction Acts . On the 24th the President sent to the Senate the nomination of General Schofield as Secretary of War . On the morning of the 26th I received a confidential letter dated April 25 from General Grant advising me under the circumstances to decline the Secretaryship in advance.1 To the above letter General Schofield sent the following letters in reply : ( ( Confidential . ) ) RICHMOND , VA. , April 26 , 1868 . DEAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . I have already promised not to decline the nomination in advance of any action of the Senate . Yours very truly , J. M. SCHOFIELD , GEN . GRANT , Bvt . Maj.-Gen . Washington , D. C. RICHMOND , VA. , April 26 , 1868 . DEAR GENERAL : I see from the papers that the President has nominated me to the Senate as Sec'y of War . You are aware that I do not want that office ; yet under existing circumstances , if the Senate should wish me to serve I could not decline . I presume my nomination will not be confirmed , but have no right to act upon such presumption . Yours very truly , GEN'L GRANT , J. M. SCHOFIELD , Washington , D. C. Bvt . Maj.-Gen . I have no means of knowing to what extent , if any , the Senate was influenced by this 1 General Schofield makes no attempt to explain General Grant 's change of attitude , but from all the circumstances it is fair to assume that it was owing to General Grant 's opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeachment proceedings. - EDITOR. // nomination , but anxiety about the ultimate result seemed to be soon allayed . About a month later a vote was taken in the Senate , and the impeachment ' failed ; my nomination was then confirmed , as stated at the time , by a nearly unanimous vote of the Senate . I entered upon the duties of the office as Secretary of War on the first day of June , and continued to discharge them until afew days after General Grant 's inauguration in March . I was greeted very cordially by the President , by all the members of his cabinet , by General Grant , and by a large number of sena*rs who called upon me at the War Department . The duties devolved upon me were often of a very delicate character , and it required at times no little tact to avoid serious trouble . President Johnson 's views were sometimes in direct conflict with those which I felt compelled to maintain under the acts of Congress affecting the States lately in rebellion ; but it is due to the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time require me to do anything cohtrary to my interpretation of the acts of Congress , and that he in general acquiesced without objection in all the measures I deemed necessary to preserve the peace and secure a fair vote of the newly enfranchised citizens of the Southern States in the Presidential election . The cordial assistance of Mr. Evarts as Attorney-General was a great help to me in such matters . When he was present I had little difficulty in respect to the law involved in any question ; but when he happened to be absent , and I was compelled to stand alone against all the cabinet , or all who chose to take any interest in the question , it was hard work . But I always carried the day-at least , in act if not in argument . The President never decided against me . He thus fulfilled to the letter the implied promise made when he submitted my nomination to the Senate . If there ever had been any real ground for the wide-spread apprehension of criminal purpose on the part of President Johnson , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his impeachment and the settlement of the long-standing controversy respecting the War Department . The so-called Reconstruction Laws , which the President so emphatically condemned as being unconstitutional , were carried out without further objection from him ; the Presidential election in the Southern States was conducted with perfect good order ; a free ballot and a full count were secured under the supervision and protection of the army  --  a thing supposed to be so dangerous to the liberties of a free people . This and many other examples in the history of this country , from the time when Washington surrendered his commission to the Continental Congress down to the present time , show that a ( ( free people ) ) have nothing to fear from their army , whether regular , volunteer , or militia ; the soldiers are , in fact , among the most devoted and loyal citizens of the republic , and thoroughly imbued with the fundamental principle of subordination of the military to the civil power . With General Grant my relations while in the War Department were of the most satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as President-elect , he naturally desired to be as free as possible from the current duties of his office as general of the army , and he was absent from Washington much of the time , his chief of staff , General Rawlins , remaining there to promulgate orders in his name . Thus it devolved upon me to exercise all the functions of ( ( coinmander-in-chief of the army* - functions which it is usually attempted to divide among three ,  --  the President , the Secretary of War , and the general-in-chief ,  --  without any legal definition of the part which belongs to each . Of course ( ( the machine ) ) ran very smoothly in the one case , though there had been much friction in the other . In compliance with the wish of General Grant , I remained in office under him for a few days , for the purpose of inaugurating the system which he hoped would end the long-standing controversy between the War Department and the headquarters of the army . The order which was issued assigning General Sherman to command the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by me under General Grant 's instructions , and the draft of the order was approved by him as expressing the views he had maintained when he was general-in-chief . As President he very soon adopted opposite views , and caused the order to be amended accordingly . That General Sherman then entertained views of his authority which were too broad , as General Grant had also done , is no doubt true ; but it ought not to have been very difficult to correct such errors . It was easier to take away all administrative authority and all command over the general staff of the army , and the latter course was adopted . The ancient controversy was up to 1888 no nearer settlement than it was in 1869 , though in General Sheridan 's time some progress had // been made in the persistent efforts to deprive the general-in-chief of the little authority which had been left to General Sherman . General Sheridan had , with his usual gallantry and confidence , renewed the contest , but had been worsted in his first encounter with the Secretary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ( ( command of the army** in 1888 , I determined to profit so far as possible by the unsatisfactory experience of Generals Scott , Grant , Sherman , and Sheridan-at least so far as to avoid further attempts to accomplish the impossible , which attempts have usually the result of accomplishing little or nothing . In fact , long study of the subject , at the instance of Generals Grant and Sherman , earnest efforts to champion their views , and knowledge of the causes of their failure , had led me to the conclusion heretofore suggested , namely : that under the government of the United States an actual military commander of the army is not possible , unless in an extreme emergency like that which led to the assignment of Lieutenant-General Grant in 1864 ; and that the general-in-chfef , or nominal commanding general , can at most be only a ( ( chief of staff , ) ) - that or nothing ,  --  whatever may be the mere title under which he may be assigned to duty by the President . As the first step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in writing to the adjutant-general , directing him never , under any circumstances , to issue an order dictated by me , or in my name , without first laying it before the Secretary of War ; and I made it known to all the staff that I disclaimed the right to issue any order to the army without the knowledge of the President or the Secretary . I also forbade the issuing of any order in my name without my knowledge . The first rule was easy , the latter very difficult , to enforce . I found , with no little surprise , that the office of the " commanding general ) ) usually learned for the first time of routine orders issued in his name by seeing them published in the New York papers the next day ; and it was quite difficult at first to make it distinctly understood that such a practice could not be tolerated . In fact , it became necessary to call attention to the question of veracity involved in such a use of the general 's name . Such was the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of issuing nearly all orders to the army without the knowledge of any one of his superiors  --  the President , the Secretary of War , or the general-in-chief . In fact , the adjutant-general had in practice come very near being ( ( commander-in-chief . ) ) Some time and much patience were required to bring about the necessary change , but ere long the result became very apparent . Perfect harmony was established between the War Department and the headquarters of the army , and this continued , under the administrations of Secretaries Proctor , Elkins , and Lamont , up to the time of my retirement from active service . During all this period , namely , from 1889 to 1895 , under the administrations of Presidents Harrison and Cleveland , the method I have indicated was exactly followed by the President in all cases of such importance as to demand his personal action , and some such cases occurred under both administrations . The orders issued were actually the President 's orders . No matter by whom suggested or by whom formulated , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent to the army in his name by the commanding general , thus leaving no possible ground for question as to the constitutional authority under which they were issued , nor of the regularity of the method , in conformity with army regulations , by which they were communicated to the army . It is , I think , to be hoped that the system thus begun may be fully developed and become permanent , as being the best practicable solution of a long-standing and dangerous controversy , and as most in accord with the fundamental principles of our constitutional government , under which the President , whether a soldier or a civilian , is in fact as well as in name the commander-in-chief of the army and navy . John M. Schofield . // BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER . PREPARING FOR THE LAST CAMPAIGN . CAPTURE OF FORT FISHER . S soon as General Grant obtained accurate information in regard to the circumstances and conditions at Fort Fisher , he decided to send another expedition , and to put it in charge of an efficient officer , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As there had been a lack of precaution on the part of the officers engaged in the previous expedition to keep the movement secret , the general-in-chief at first communicated the facts regarding the new expedition to only two persons at headquarters . Of course he had to let it be known to the Secretary of War ; but as the Secretary was always reticent about such matters , there was a reasonable probability that the secret could be kept . Directions were given which tended to create the impression that the vessels were being loaded with supplies and reinforcements for Sherman 's army , and studious efforts were made to throw the enemy off his guard . Of course every one who knew the general 's tenacity of purpose felt sure that he would never relinquish his determination to take Fort Fisher , and would immediately take steps to retrieve the failure which had been made in the first attempt ; and as soon as Butler returned I suggested to the general that , in case another expedition should be sent , General A. H. Terry would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in command . We had served together in the Sherman-Du Pont expedition which in 1861 took Hilton Head and captured Fort Pulaski and other points on the Atlantic coast , and I knew him to be the most experienced officer in the service in embarking and disembarking troops upon the sea-coast , looking after their welfare on transports , and intrenching rapidly on shore . General Grant had seldom come in contact with Terry personally , but had been much pleased at the manner in which he had handled his troops in the movements on the James River . A suggestion , too , was made that as Terry was a volunteer officer , and as the first expedition had failed under a volunteer , it would only be fair that another officer of that service , rather than one from the regular army , should be given a chance to redeem the disaster . The general seemed to listen with interest to what was said about Terry , particularly as to his experience in sea-coast expeditions , but gave no hint at the time of a disposition to appoint him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another expedition to Fort Fisher : but on January 2 he telegraphed to Butler , ( ( Please send MajorGeneral Terry to City Point to see me this morning . ) ) Grant considered the propriety of going in person with the expedition , but his better judgment did not approve such a course , for he would be too far out of reach of communication with City Point , and as Butler was the senior army commander , it would leave him in supreme command of the armies operating against Petersburg and Richmond . When Terry came the general-in-chief told him simply that he had been designated to take command of a transfer by sea of eight thousand men , and that he was to sail under sealed orders . Terry felt much complimented that he should be singled out for such a command , but had no idea of his destination , and was evidently under the impression that he was to join Sherman . On January 5 Terry was ready to proceed to Fort Monroe , and Grant accompanied him down the James River for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded some distance from City Point , the general sat down with Terry in the after-cabin of the steamer , and there made known to him the real destination and purposes of the expedition . He said : ( ( The object is to renew the attempt to capture Fort Fisher , and in case of success to take possession of Wilmington . It is of the greatest importance that there should be a complete understanding and harmony of action between you and Admiral Porter . I want you to consult the admiral fully , and to let there be no misunderstanding in regard to the plan of cooperation in all its details . I served with Admiral Porter on the Mississippi , and have a high appreciation of his courage and judgment . I want to urge upon you to land with all despatch , and intrench yourself in a position from which 584 // you can operate against Fort Fisher , and not to abandon it until the fort is captured or you receive further instructions from me. * Full instructions were carefully prepared in writing , and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captains of the transports were given sealed orders , not to be opened until the vessels were off Cape Henry . The vessels soon appeared off the North Carolina coast . A landing was made on January 13 , and on the morning of the 14th Terry had fortified a position about two miles from the fort . The navy , which had been firing upon the fort for two days , began another bombardment at daylight on the 15th . That afternoon Ames 's division made an assault on Lhe work . Two thousand sailors and marines were also landed for the purpose of making a charge . They had received an order from the admiral , in the wording of which facetiousness in nautical phraseology could go no further . It read : ( ( Board the fort in a seamanlike manner . ) ) They made a gallant attack , but were met with a murderous fire , and did not gain the work . Amess division , with Curtis 's brigade in advance , overcame all efforts of the defenders , and the garrison was driven from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hand-to-hand contests , in which individual acts of heroism surpassed almost anything in the history of assaults upon well-defended forts . The battle did not close until ten o'clock at night . Then the formidable work had been fairly won . The garrison was taken prisoners , the mouth of the Cape Fear River was closed , and Wilmington was at the mercy of our troops . The trophies were 169 guns , over 2000 stands of small arms , large quantities of ammunition and commissary stores , and more than 2000 prisoners . About 600 of the garrison were killed or wounded . Terry 's loss was 110 killed , 536 wounded , and 13 missing . After the news of the capture of the fort was received , I was sent there by General Grant with additional instructions to Terry ; and upon my arrival I could not help being surprised at the formidable character of the work . No one without having seen it could form an adequate conception of the almost insurmountable obstacles which the assaulting columns encountered . DUTCH GAP CANAL . DURING the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had conceived the notion that there were many advantages to be gained by making a canal across a narrow neck of land , known as Dutch Gap , on the VOL . LIV. - 74 . James River , which would cut off four and three quarter miles of river navigation . This neck was about one hundred and seventyfour yards wide . The name originated from the fact that a Dutchman had many years before attempted a similar undertaking , but little or no progress had been made . The enterprise involved the excavation of nearly eighty thousand cubic feet of earth . Butler had been somewhat reluctantly authorized to dig the canal , and work upon it had been begun on August 10 . The enemy soon erected heavy rifle-guns , and afterward put mortars in positions which bore upon it ; and our men were subjected to a severe fire , and frequently had to seek shelter in ( ( dugouts ) ) constructed as places of refuge . Under the delays and difficulties which arose , the canal was not finished until the end of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Butler saying : ( ( We propose to explode the heading of Dutch Gap at 11 A. M. to-morrow . I should be happy to see yourself and friends at headquarters . We must be near the time because of the tide . ) ) The general-in-chief replied : ( ( Do not wait for me in your explosion . I doubt my ability to be up in the morning . ) ) After the bulkhead wall of earth had been blown out , the debris at the north end was partly removed by means of steam dredges . The canal was not of any service during the war , but it has since been enlarged and improved , and has become the ordinary channel for the passage of vessels plying on the James River . GRANT RECEIVES UNASKED ADVICE . GENERAL GRANT had become very tired of discussing methods of warfare which were like some of the problems described in algebra as **more curious than useful , ) ) and he was not sufficiently interested in the canal to be present at the explosion which was expected to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , besides men of real inventive genius , were sending extraordinary plans and suggestions for capturing Richmond . A proposition from an engineer was received one day , accompanied by elaborate drawings and calculations , which had evidently involved intense labor on the part of the author . His plan was to build a masonry wall around Richmond , of an elevation higher than the tallest houses , then to fill the inclosure with water pumped from the James River , and drown out the garrison and people like rats in a cage . The exact number of pumps required and their capacity had been // figured out to a nicety . Another inventive genius , whose mind seemed to run in the direction of the science of chemistry and the practice of sternutation , sent in a chemical formula for making an all-powerful snuff . In his communication he assured the commanding general that after a series of experiments he had made with it on people and animals , he was sure that if shells were filled with it and exploded within the enemy 's lines , the troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would soon become physically exhausted with the effort , and the Union army could walk over at its leisure and pick them up as prisoners without itself losing a man . A certain officer had figured out from statistics that the James River froze over about once in seven years , and that this was the seventh year , and advised that troops be massed in such a position that when the upper part of the James changed from a liquid to a solid , columns could be rushed across it on the ice to a position in rear of the enemy 's lines , and Richmond would be at our mercy . A sorcerer in Rochester sent the geneml word that he had cast his horoscope , and gave him a clear and unclouded insight into his future , and added to its general attractiveness by telling him how gloriously he was going to succeed in taking Richmond . One evening the general referred to these emanations of the prolific brains of our people , and the many novel suggestions made to him , beginning with the famous powder-boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : ( ( This is a very suggestive age . Some people seem to think that an army can be whipped by waiting for rivers to freeze over , exploding powder at a distance , drowning out troops , or setting them to sneezing ; but it will always be found in the end that the only way to whip an army is to go out and fight it. * GRANT RELIEVES BUTLER . ON January 4 General Grant had written to the Secretary of War asking that Butler might be relieved , saying : " I am constrained to request the removal of General Butler from the command of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina . I do this with reluctance , but the good of the service requires it . In my absence General Butler necessarily commands , and there is a lack of confidence felt in his military ability , making him an unsafe commander for a large army . His administration of the affairs of his department is also objectionable . ) ) Learning that the Secretary of War had gone to Savannah to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due time , on January 6 tbe general telegraphed to the President , asking that prompt action be taken in the matter . The order was made on the 7th , and on the morning of the 8th General Grant directed Colonel Babcock and me to go to General Butler 's headquarters , announce the fact to him , and hand him the written order relieving him from command . We arrived there about noon , found the general in his camp , and by his invitation went with him into his tent . He opened the communication , read the order , and was silent for a minute ; then he began to manifest considerable nervousness , and turning to his desk , wrote ( ( Received ) ) on the envelop , dated it 1864 instead of 1865 , and handed it back . It was the custom in the army to return envelop receipts in case of communications delivered by enlisted men , but this was omitted when the instructions were transmitted by staff-officers . He was politely reminded that a written receipt was not necessary . Thereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word or two of apology for offering it , and after a slight pause added : ( ( Please say to General Grant that I will go to his headquarters , and would like to have a personal interview with him . ) ) SHERMAN 'S LOYALTY TO GRANT . GENERAL GRANT was in constant correspondence with Sherman in regard to the movements in the Carolinas . Sherman was to move north , breaking up all lines of communication as he advanced . If Lee should suddenly abandon Richmond and Petersburg , and move with his army to join the Confederate forces in the Carolinas with a view to crushing Sherman , that officer was to whip Lee if he could , and if not to fall back upon the sea-coast . Grant was to hold Lee 's army where it was , if possible , and if not to follow it up with vigor . Sherman 's triumphant march to the sea had gained him many admirers in the North , and it was believed about this time that a bill might be introduced in Congress providing for his promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible to command the armies in case he should be assigned . to such a position . On January 21 he said in a letter to General Grant : " I have been told that Congress meditates a bill to make another lieutenant-general for me . I have written to John Sherman to stop it if it is designed for me . It would be mischievous , for there are enough rascals who // would try to sow differences between us , whereas you and I now are in perfect understanding . I would rather have you in command than anybody else ; for you are fair , honest , and have at heart the same purpose that should animate all . I should emphatically decline any commission calculated to bring us into rivalry . . . . * General Grant replied : ( ( No one would be more pleased at your advancement than I , and if you should be placed in my position and I put subordinate , it would not change our relations in the least . I would make the same exertions to support you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do all in my power to make our cause win. * On January 31 Sherman wrote : " I am fully aware of your friendly feeling toward me , and you may always depend on me as your steadfast supporter . Your wish is law and gospel to me , and such is the feeling that pervades my army . ) ) In all the annals of history no correspondence between men in high station furnishes a nobler example of genuine , disinterested personal friendship and exalted loyalty to a great cause . A ( ( GOOD SHOT . ) ) ADMIRAL PORTER had withdrawn nearly all the naval vessels from the James River in order to increase his fleet for the Fort Fisher expedition . Only three or four light gunboats were left , and one ironclad , the Onondaga , a powerful double-turreted monitor carrying two 15-inch smooth-bores and two 150-pound Parrott rifles . This vessel was commanded by Captain William A. Parker of the navy . Captain Parker would occasionally pay a visit to General Grant at City Point , and he usually brought with him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volubility of his conversation . When the general asked the captain a question , before he could venture a reply his sub would volunteer an answer , and frequently make it the occasion of an elaborate lecture upon the intricate science of marine warfare . The captain could rarely get in a word edgewise . In fact , he seemed to accept the situation , and did not often make the attempt . It might have been said of this young officer what Talleyrand said of a French diplomat : ( ( Clever man , but he has no talent for dialogue . ) ) There had been so much talk about the formidable character of the double-turreted monitors that General Grant decided one morning to go up the James and pay a visit to the Onondaga , and invited me to accompany him . The monitor was lying above the pon toon-bridge in Trent 's Reach . After looking the vessel over , and admiring the perfection of her machinery , the general said to the commander : ( ( Captain , what is the effective range of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards , with their present elevation , * was the reply . The general looked up the river , and added : ( ( There is a battery which is just about that distance from us . Suppose you take a shot at it , and see what you can do . ) ) The gun was promptly brought into position by revolving the turret , accurate aim taken , and the order given to fire . There was a tremendous concussion , followed by a deafening roar as the enormous shell passed through the air ; and then all eyes were strained to see what execution would be done by the shot . The huge mass struck directly within the battery , and exploded . A cloud of smoke arose , earth and splintered logs flew in every direction , and a number of the garrison sprang over the parapet . The general took another puff at the cigar he was smoking , nodded his head , and said , ( ( Good shot ! ) ) The naval officers indulged in broad smiles of triumph , and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things they always did with equal success when they tried hard . NIGHT ATTACK OF THE ENEMY 'S IRONCLADS . ON the night of January 23 a naval officer , at General Grant 's suggestion , was sent up to plant torpedoes at the obstructions which had been placed in the river at Trent 's Reach , as he was apprehensive that our depleted naval force might be attacked by the enemy 's fleet , which was lying in the river near Richmond . The officer made the discovery that the Confederate ironclads were quietly moving down the river . News of their approach was promptly given , and at once telegraphed to headquarters . The enemy 's fleet consisted of six vessels , and by half-past ten o'clock they had passed the upper end of Dutch Gap Canal . The general directed me and another staff-officer to take boats and communicate with all despatch with certain naval vessels , warn them of the character of the anticipated attack , and direct them to move up and make a determined effort to prevent the enemy 's fleet from reaching City Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a little rattled in the hurry of the departure , and started , from force of habit , to put on his spurs . It took me some time to persuade him that these appendages to his heels would not particularly facilitate his movements in // climbing aboard gunboats . A third officer , Lieutenant Dunn , was sent to communicate with a gunboat stationed at some distance from the others . In the meantime orders were given to tow coal-schooners up the river , ready to sink them in the channel if necessary ; and instructions were issued to move all heavy guns within reach down to the river shore , where their fire could command the channel . There was an enormous accumulation of supplies at City Point , and their destruction at this time would have been a serious embarrassment . 1The night was pitch-dark , but our naval vessels were promptly reached by means of steam-tugs ; and their commanders , who displayed that cordial spirit of cooperation always manifested by our sister service , expressed an eagerness to obey General Grant 's orders as implicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these vessels were out of repair and almost unserviceable , but their officers were determined to make the best fight they could . When I returned to headquarters , the general , Mrs. , Grant , and Ingalls were talking the matter over in the front room of the general 's quarters . ( ( Well , now that we ye got all ready for them , ) ) said Ingalls , ( ( why do n't their old gunboats come down ? ) ) 4ngalls , you must have patience , ) ) remarked the general ; ( ( perhaps they do n't know that you re in such a hurry for them , or they would move faster ; you must give them time . ) ) ( ( Well , if they 're going to postpone their movement indefinitely , I 'll go to bed , ) ) continued Ingalls , and started for his quarters . News now came that it was thought the vessels could not pass the obstructions , and would not make the attempt ; and the general and Mrs. Grant retired to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wakened if there should be any change in the situation . 8oon after one o'clock word came that the enemy 's vessels had succeeded at high water in getting through the obstructions . A loud knock was now given upon the door of the general 's sleeping-room . He called out instantly : ( ( Yes . What have you heard ? ) ) The reply was : ( ( The gunboats have passed the obstructions , and are coming down . ) ) In about two minutes the general came hurriedly into the office . He had drawn on his top-boots over his drawers , and put on his uniform frock-coat , the skirt of which reached about to the tops of the boots and made up for the absence of trousers . He lighted a cigar while listening to the reports , and then sat down at his desk and wrote out orders in great haste . The puffs from the cigar were now as rapid as those of the engine of an express-train at full speed . Mrs. Grant soon after came in , and was anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion upon which a woman 's curiosity was entirely justifiable . Dunn had returned with a report about the movement of the gunboat with which he had been sent to communicate , and Ingalls had also rejoined the party . Mrs. Grant , in the midst of the scene , quietly said , *Ulyss , will those gunboats shell the bluff ? ) ) ( ( Well , I think all their time will be occupied in fighting our naval vessels and the batteries ashore , ) ) he replied . ( ( The Onondaga ought to be able to sink them , but I do n't know what they would do if they should get down this far . ) ) Just then news came in that upon the approach of the enemy 's vessels the Onondaga had retired down the river . The captain had lost his head , and under pretense of trying to obtain a more advantageous position , had turned tail with his vessel , and moved down-stream below the pontoonbridge . General Grant 's indignation knew no bounds when he heard of this retreat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the navy , both on the Mississippi River and upon the Atlantic coast . I entertain the highest regard for the intrepidity of the officers of that service , and it is an inexpressible mortification to think that the captain of so formidable an ironclad , and the only one of its kind we have in the river , should fall back at such a critical moment . Why , it was the great chance of his life to distinguish himself . ) ) Additional instructions were at once telegraphed to the shore batteries to act with all possible vigor . Mrs. Grant , who was one of the most composed of those present , now drew her chair a little nearer to the general , and with her mild voice inquired , " Ulyss , what had I better do ? ) ) The general looked at her for a moment , and then replied in a half-serious and half-teasing way , ( ( Well , the fact is , Julia , you ought n't to be here . ) ) Dunn now spoke up and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drive Mrs. Grant back into the country far enough to be out of reach of the shells . ) ) ( ( Oh , their gunboats are not down here yet , ) ) answered the general ; ( ( and they must be stopped at all hazards . ) ) Additional despatches were sent , and a fresh cigar was smoked , the puffs of which showed even an increased rapidity . In about two hours it was reported that only one of the enemy 's boats was below the obstruction , and the rest were above , apparently aground . More guns had by this time been placed in // the shore batteries , and the situation was greatly relieved . Ingalls , whose dry humor always came to his rescue when matters were serious , again assumed an air of disappointment , and said : " I tell you , I m getting out of all patience , and I ye about made up my mind that these boats never intended to come down here anyhow-that they ye just been playing it on us to keep us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters had so quieted down that the general-in-chief and Mrs. Grant retired to finish their interrupted sleep . At daylight the Omondaga moved up within nine hundred yards of the Confederate ironclad Virginia , the flag-ship , and opened fire upon her . Some of the shore guns were also trained upon her , and a general pounding began . She was struck about one hundred and thirty times , our 15-inch shells doing much damage . Another vessel , the Richmond , was struck a number of times , and a third , the Drewry , and a torpedo-launch were destroyed . At flood-tide the enemy succeeded in getting their vessels afloat , and withdrew up the river . That night they came down again , and attacked the Onondaga , but retired after meeting with a disastrous fire from that vessel and our batteries on the river banks . This was the last service performed by the enemy 's fleet in the James River . HOW GRANT BECAME A CONFIRMED SMOKER . THE next morning breakfast in the messroom was a little later than usual , as every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous night . When the chief had lighted his cigar after the morning meal , and taken his place by the camp-fire , a staffofficer said : ( ( General , I never saw cigars consumed quite so rapidly as those you smoked last night when you were writing despatches to head off the ironclads. * He smiled , and remarked : ( ( No ; when I come to think of it , those cigars did n't last very long , did they ? o An allusion was then made to the large number he had smoked the second day of the battle of the Wilderness . In reply to this he said : " I had been a very light smoker previous to the attack on Donelson , and after that battle I acquired a fondness for cigars by reason of a purely accidental circumstance . Admiral Foote , commanding the fleet of gunboats which were coUperating with the army , had been wounded , and at his request I had gone aboard his flag-ship to confer with him . The admiral offered me a cigar , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the road I was met by a staff-officer , who announced that the enemy were making a vigorous attack . I galloped forward at once , and while riding among the troops giving directions for repulsing the assault I carried the cigar in my hand . It had gone out , but it seems that I continued to hold the stump between my fingers throughout the battle . In the accounts published in the papers I was represented as smoking a cigar in the midst of the conflict ; and many persons , thinking , no doubt , that tobacco was my chief solace , sent me boxes of the choicest brands from everywhere in the North . As many as ten thousand were soon received . I gave away all I could get na of , but having such a quantity on hand , I naturally smoked more than I would have done under ordinary circumstances , and I have continued the habit ever since. * GRANT OFFERS HIS PURSE TO HIS ENEMY . GENERAL GRANT never mentioned , however , one incident in connection with the battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was related by his opponent in that battle , General Buckner . In a speech made by that officer at a banquet given in New York on the anniversary of General Grant 's birthday , April 27 , 1889 , he said : " . . . Under these circumstances , sir , I surrendered to General Grant . I had at a previous time befriended him , and it has been justly said that he never forgot an act of kindness . I met him on the boat , and he followed me when I went to my quarters . He left the officers of his own army and followed me , with that modest manner peculiar to himself , into the shadow , and there tendered me his purse . It seems to me , Mr. Chairman , that in the modesty of his nature he was afraid the light would witness that act of generosity , and sought to hide it from the world . We can appreciate that , sir. * GRANT RECEIVES THE ( ( PEACE COMMISSIONERS . ) ) ON the morning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Petersburg front the day before , signed by the Confederates Alexander H. Stephens , J. A. Campbell , and R. M. T. Hunter , asking permission to come through our lines . These gentlemen constituted the celebrated ( ( Peace Commission , ) ) and were on their way to endeavor to have a conference with Mr. Lincoln . The desired permission to enter our lines was granted , and Babcock was sent to meet them and escort them to City Point . Some time after dark the train which brought them arrived , and they came at once to headquarters . General Grant was writing // in his quarters when a knock came upon the door . In obedience to his ( ( Come in ! ) ) the party entered , and were most cordially received , and a very pleasant conversation followed . Stephens was the Vice-President of the Confederacy ; Campbell , a former justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , was Assistant Secretary of War ; and Hunter was president pro tempore of the Confederate Senate . As General Grant had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until further orders , he conducted them in person to the headquarters steamer , the Mary Martin , which was lying at the wharf , made them his guests , ahd had them provided with well-furnished state-rooms and comfortable meals during their stay . They were treated with every possible courtesy ; their movements were not restrained , and they passed part of the time upon the boat , and part of it at headquarters . Stephens was about five feet five inches in height ; his complexion was sallow , and his skin seemed shriveled upon his bones . He possessed intellect enough , however , for the whole cdmmission . Many pleasant conversations occurred with him at headquarters , and an officer once remarked , after the close of an interview : ( ( The Lord seems to have robbed that man 's body of nearly all its flesh and blood to make brains of them . ) ) The commissioners twice endeavored to draw General Grant out as to his ideas touching the proper conditions of the proposed terms of peace ; but as he considered himself purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the commissioners spoke of negotiations between the two governments , while the general was not willing to acknowledge even by an inference any government within our borders except that of the United States , he avoided the subject entirely , except to let it be known by his remarks that he would gladly welcome peace if it could be secured upon proper terms . Mr. Lincoln had directed Mr. Seward , the Secretary of State , on January 31 , to meet the commissioners at Fort Monroe on February 2 . General Grant telegraphed the President that he thought the gentlemen were sincere in their desire to restore peace and union , and that it would have a bad effect if they went back without any expression from one who was in authority , and said he would feel sorry if Mr. Lincoln did not have an interview with them , or with some of them . This changed the President 's mind , and he started at once for Fort Monroe . The commissioners were sent down the James River that afternoon , and were met at Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had a conference lasting several hours aboard the President 's steamer . Mr. Lincoln stated that peace could be secured only by a restoration of the national authority over all the States , a recognition of the position assumed by him as to the abolition of slavery , and an understanding that there should be no cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war and a disbanding of all forces hostile to the government . The commissioners , while they did not declare positively that they would not consent to reunion , avoided giving their assent ; and as they seemed to desire to postpone that important question , and adopt some other course first which might possibly lead in the end to union , but which Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward thought would amount simply to an indefinite postponement , the conference ended without result . After stopping at City Point and having another conversation with General Grant , principally in reference to an exchange of prisoners , the Confederate commissioners were escorted through our lines on their way back to Richmond . I accompanied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with Mr. Stephens . He was evidently greatly disappointed at the failure of the conference , but was prudent enough not to talk much about it . He spoke freely in regard to General Grant , saying : ( ( We all form our preconceived ideas of men of whom we have heard a great deal , and I had certain definite notions as to the appearance and character of General Grant ; but I was never so completely surprised in all my life as when I met him and found him a person so entirely different from my idea of him . His spare figure , simple manners , lack of all ostentation , extreme politeness , and charm of conversation were a revelation to me , for I had pictured him as a man of a directly opposite type of character , and expected to find in him only the bluntness of the soldier . Notwithstanding the fact that he talks so well , it is plain that he has more brains than tongue . ) ) He continued by saying what he said several times in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( ( He is one of the most remarkable men I ever met . He does not seem to be aware of his powers , but in the future he wi1l undoubtedly exert a controlling influence in shaping the destinies of the country . ) ) Mr. Stephens was wrapped from his eyes to his heels in a coarse gray overcoat about three sizes too large for him , with a collar so high that it threatened to lift his hat off // every time he leaned his head back . This coat , together with his complexion , which was as yellow as a ripe ear of corn , gave rise to a characterization of the costume by Mr. Lincoln which was very amusing . The next time he saw General Grant at City Point , after the ( ( Peace Conference , ) ) he said to him , in speaking on the subject , ( ( Did you see Stephens 's greatcoat ? ) ) ( ( Oh , yes , ) ) answered the general . ( ( Well , ) ) continued Mr. Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampton Roads , the cabin began to get pretty warm , and Stephens stood up and pulled off his big coat . He peeled it off just about as you would husk an ear of corn . I could n't help thinking , as I looked first at the coat and then at the man , ( Well , that s the biggest shuck and the littlest nubbin I ever did see. ) ** This story became one of the general 's favorite anecdotes , and he often related it in after years with the greatest zest . GRANT PLANS THE SPRING CAMPAIGNS . GENERAL GRANT was at this time employing all his energies in maturing his plans for a comprehensive campaign on the part of all the armies , with a view to ending the war in the early spring . Sheridan was to move down the valley of Virginia for the purpose of destroying the railroads , the James River Canal , and the factories in that section of country used for the production of munitions of war . Stoneman was to start upon a raid from east Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's communications in that direction . Canby , who was in command at New Orleans , was to advance against Mobile , 1Iontgomery , and Selma . In the movement on Mobile , Canby had at least 45,000 men . Thomas was to send a large body of cavalry under Wilson into Alabama . The movements of our forces in the West were intended not only to destroy communications , but to keep the Confederate troops there from being sent East to operate against Sherman . Sherman was to march to Columbia , South Carolina , thence to Fayetteville , North Carolina , and afterward in the direction of Goldsborough . Schofield was to be transferred from Tennessee to Annapolis , Maryland , and thence by steamer to the Cape Fear River , for the purpose of moving inland from there and joining Sherman in North Carolina . Schofield 's orders were afterward changed , and he rendezvoused at Alexandria , Virginia , instead of Annapolis . The Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James were to watch Lee , and at the proper time strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should suddenly retreat , to pursue him and inflict upon him all damage possible , and to endeavor to head off and prevent any portion of his army from reaching North Carolina as an organized force capable of forming a junction with Johnston and opposing Sherman . Some of these operations were delayed longer than was expected , and a few changes were made in the original plan ; but they were all carried into effect with entire success , and the military ability of the general-in-chief never appeared to better advantage than in directing these masterly movements , which covered a theater of war greater than that of any campaigns in modern history , and which required a grasp and comprehension which have rarely been possessed even by the greatest commanders . He was at this period indefatigable in his labors , and he once wrote in a single day forty-two important despatches with his own hand . In the latter part of January , General Grant went with Schofield down the coast , and remained there a short time to give personal directions on the ground . Sherman entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place on the 18th without waiting to be attacked . When this news was received , Dr. Craven , a medical officer who was in the habit of drawing all his similes from his own profession , commended the movement by saying : ( ( General Sherman applied a remedial agency which is in entire accord with the best medical practice . Charleston was suffering from the disease known as secession , and he got control of it by means of counter-irritation . ) ) Wilmington was captured on the 22d of February . THE PRESIDENT 'S SON JOINS GRANT*S STAFF . AN addition was now made to our staff in the person of Captain Robert T. Lincoln , the President 's eldest son . He had been graduated at Harvard University in 1864 , and had at once urged his father to let him enter the army and go to the front ; but Mr. Lincoln felt that this would only add to his own personal anxieties , and Robert was persuaded to remain at Harvard and take a course of study in the law school . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal representative in the army . He had procured a man to enlist early in the war , whom he always referred to as his ( ( substitute . ) ) This soldier served in the field to the end with a good record , and the President // watched his course with great interest , and took no little pride in him . In the spring of 1865 Robert renewed his request to his father , who mentioned the subject to General Grant . The general said to the President that if he would let Robert join the staff at headquarters , he would be glad to give him a chance to see some active service in the field . The President replied that he would consent to this upon one condition : that his son should serve as a volunteer aide without pay or emoluments ; but Grant dissuaded him from adhering to that determination , saying that it was due to the young man that he should be regularly commissioned , and put on an equal footing with other officers of the same grade . So it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assistant adjutant-general ; and on February 23 he was attached to the staff of the general-in-chief . The new acquisition to the company at headquarters soon became exceedingly popular . He had inherited many of the genial traits of his father , and entered heartily into all the social pastimes at headquarters . He was always ready to perform his share of hard work , and never expected to be treated differently from any other officer on account of his being the son of the Chief Executive of the nation . The experience acquired by him in the field did much to fit him for the position of Secretary of War , which he afterward held . This month had brought me another promotion . I received a commission as brevet colonel of volunteers , dated February 24 , for ( ( faithful and meritorious services . ) ) LEE ASKS A PERSONAL INTERVIEW . ON the evening of March 3 , just as the general was starting to the mess-hut for dinner , a communication was handed to him from General Lee , which had come through our lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a recent meeting under a flag of truce between Ord and Longstreet , from which the impression was derived that General Grant would not refuse to see him if he had authority to act for the purpose of attempting to bring about an adjustment of the present difficulties by means of a military convention , the letter went on to say : ( ( Sincerely desiring to leave nothing untried which may put an end to the calamities of war , I propose to meet you at such convenient time and place as you may designate , with the hope that , upon an interchange of views , it may be found practicable to submit the subjects of controversy between the belligerents to a convention of the kind mentioned . In such event , I am authorized to do whatever the result of the proposed interview may render necessary or advisable . ) ) There came inclosed with this letter another stating that General Lee feared there was some misunderstanding about the exchange of political prisoners , and saying that he hoped that at the interview proposed some satisfactory solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not being vested with any authority whatever to treat for peace , at once telegraphed the contents of the communication to the Secretary of War , and asked for instructions* The despatch was submitted to Mr. Lincoln at the Capitol , where he had gone , according to the usual custom at the closing hours of the session of Congress , in order to act promptly upon bills presented to him . He consulted with the Secretaries of State and War , and then wrote with his own hand a reply , dated midnight , which was signed by Stanton , and forwarded to General Grant . It was received the morning of the 4th , and read as follows : ( ( The President directs me to say to you that he wishes you to have no conference with General Lee , unless it be for the capitulation of General Lee 's army , or on some minor and purely military matter . He instructs me to say that you are not to decide , discuss , or confer upon any political question . Such questions the President holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no military conferences or conventions . Meantime you are to press to the utmost your military advantages . ) ) The general thought that the President was unduly anxious about the manner in which the affair would be treated , and replied at once : . . . I can assure you that no act of the enemy will prevent me from pressing all advantages gained to the utmost of my ability ; neither will I , under any circumstances , exceed my authority or in any way embarrass the government . It was because I had no right to meet General Lee on the subject proposed by him that I referred the matter for instructions . ) ) He then replied to Lee : ( ( In regard to meeting you on the 6th instant , I would state that I have no authority to accede to your proposition for a conference on the subject proposed . Such authority is vested in the President of the United States alone . General Ord could only have meant that I would not refuse an interview on any subject on which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be such as are purely of a military character , and on the subject of exchanges , which has been intrusted to me. ) ) // A VISIONARY PEACE PROGRAM . IT was learned afterward that an interesting but rather fanciful program had been laid out by the enemy as a means to be used in restoring peace , and that this contemplated interview between Grant and Lee was to be the opening feature . Jefferson Davis had lost the confidence of his people to such an extent as a director of military movements that Lee had been made generalissimo , and given almost dictatorial powers as to war measures . As the civilians had failed to bring about peace , it was resolved to put Lee forward in an effort to secure it upon some terms which the South could accept without too gr*eat a sacrifice of its dignity , by means of negotiations , which were to begin by a personal interview with General Grant . One proposition discussed was that after the meeting of Grant and Lee , at which peace should be urged upon terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , by the National government , it should be arranged to have Mrs. Longstreet , who had been an old friend of Mrs. Grant , visit her at City Point , and after that to try and induce Mrs. Grant to visit Richmond . It was taken for granted that the natural chivalry of the soldiers would assure such cordial and enthusiastic greetings to these ladies that it would arouse a general sentiment of good will , which would everywhere lead to demonstrations in favor of peace between the two sections of the country . General Longstreet says that the project went so far that Mrs. Longstreet , who was at Lynchburg , was telegraphed to come on to Richmond . The plan outlined in this order of procedure was so visionary that it seems strange that it could ever have been seriously discussed by any one ; but it must be remembered that the condition of the Confederacy was then desperate , and that drowning men catch at straws . HiGH PRICES IN RICHMOND . IT was seen that Grant , by his operations , was rapidly forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South had been put into the ranks , the communications were broken , the supplies were irregular , Confederate money was at a fabulous discount , and hope had given place to despair . The next evening one of our scouts returned from a trip to Richmond , and was brought to headquarters in order that the general-in-chief might question him in person . The man said : VOL . LIV. - 75 . ( ( The depreciation in the purchasing power of ( graybacks , ) as we call the rebel treasury notes , is so rapid that every time I go into the enemy 's lines I have to increase my supply of them . On my last trip I had to stuff my clothes full of their currency to keep myself going for even a couple of days . A barrel of flour in Richmond now costs over a thousand dollars , and a suit of clothes about twelve hundred . A dollar in gold is equal in value to a hundred dollars in graybacks . Then so much counterfeit Confederate money has been shoved in through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to make any difference between good and bad money . A fellow that had come in from the western part of the State told me a pretty tough yarn about matters out there . He said : ( Everything that has a picture on it goes for money . If you stop at a hotel , and the bill of fare happens to have an engraving of the house printed at the top , you can just tear off the picture and payforyourdinnerwith it . ) ) GRANT RECEIVES A MEDAL FROM CONGRESS . ON th' 10th of March the Hon. Elihu B.Washburne , who had paid one or two visits before to headquarters , arrived at City Point , and brought with him the medal which had been struck , in accordance with an act of Congress , in recognition of General Grant 's services , and which Mr. Washburne had been commissioned to present . A dozen prominent ladies and gentlemen from Washington came at the same time . On the afternoon of the next day General Grant went with them to the lines of the Army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the troops . That evening some simple arrangements were made for the presentation of the medal , which took place at 8 P. M. in the main cabin of the steamer which had brought the visitors , and which was lying at the City Point wharf . General Meade suggested that he and the corps commanders would like to witness the ceremony , and in response to an invitation they came to City Point for the purpose , accompanied by a large number of their staff-officers . Mr. Washburne arose at the appointed hour , and after delivering an exceedingly graceful speech eulogistic of the illustrious services for which Congress had awarded this testimonial of the nation 's gratitude and appreciation , he took the medal from the handsome morocco case in which it was inclosed , and handed it to the general-in-chief . The general , who had remained standing during the presentation // speech , with his right hand clasping the lapel of his coat , received the medal , and expressed his appreciation of the gift in a few well-chosen words , but uttered with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voice , that they were scarcely audible . A military band was in attendance , and at the suggestion of Mrs. Grant a dance was now improvised . The officers soon selected their partners from among the ladies present , and the evening 's entertainment was continued to a late hour . The general was urged to indulge in a waltz , but from this he begged off . However , he finally agreed to compromise the matter by dancing a square dance . He went through the cotillion , not as gracefully as some of the beaux among the younger officers present , but did his part exceedingly well , barring the impossibility of his being able to keep exact time with the music . He did not consider dancing his forte , and in after life seldom indulged in that form of amusement , unless upon some occasion when he attended a ball given in his honor . In such case he felt that he had to take part in the opening dance to . avoid appearing impolite or unappreciative . SHAVING UNDER DIFFICULTIES . MR . WASHBURNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day was Sunday . The congressman was the first one up , and when he went to shave he found there was no looking-glass in his quarters ; *o he stepped across to the general 's office in his shirt-sleeves , and finding a glass there , proceeded to lather his face and prepare for the delicate operation of removing his beard . Just as he had taken hold of his nose with his left thumb and forefinger , which he had converted into a sort of clothes-pin for the occasion , and had scraped a wide swath down his right cheek with the razor , the front door of the hut was suddenly burst open , and a young woman rushed in , fell on her knees at his feet , and cried : ( ( Save him ! oh , save him ! He s my husband . ) ) The distinguished member of Congress was so startled by the sudden apparition that it was with difficulty that he avoided disfiguring his face with a large gash . He turned to the intruder , and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get up , get up ! I do n't understand you. * ( ( Oh , general , for G6d 's sake , do save my husband ! ) ) continued the woman . ( ( Why , my good woman , I m not General Grant , ) ) the congressman insisted . ( ( Yes , you are ; they told me this was your room . Oh , save him , general ; they re to shoot him this very day for deser tion if you do n't stop them . ) ) Mr. Washburne now began to take in the situation , and led the woman to a seat , and tried to comfort her , while she began to tell how her young husband had been led , through his fondness for her , to desert in order to go home and see her , and how he had been captured and court-martialed , and was to be executed that day , and how she had heard of it only in time to reach headquarters that morning to plead for his life . By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping-apartment an excited conversation in the front room , dressed hurriedly , and stepped upon the scene in time to hear the burden of the woman 's story . The spectacle presented partook decidedly of the serio-comic . The dignified member of Congress was standing in his shirt-sleeves in front of the pleading woman , his face covered with lather , except the swath which had been made down his right cheek ; the razor was uplifted in his hand , and the tears were starting out of his eyes as his sympathies began to be worked upon . The woman was screaming and gesticulating frantically , and was almost hysterical with grief . I appeared at the front door about the same time that the general entered from the rear , and it was hard to tell whether one ought to laugh or cry at the sight presented . The general now took a hand in the matter , convinced the woman that he was the commanding general , assured her that he would take steps at once to have her husband reprieved and pardoned , and sent her away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nick of time . He cracked many a joke with Mr. Washburne afterward about the figure he cut on the morning of the occurrence . ARRIVAL OF SHERIDAN 'S SCOUTS . SHERIDAN had started out from Winchester on the 27th of February with nearly 10,000 cavalry . On March 5 news was received that he had struck Early 's forces between Staunton and Charlottesville , and crushed his entire command , compelling Early and other officers to take refuge in houses and in the woods . For some time thereafter only contradictory reports were heard from Sheridan , through the Richmond papers which came into our hands ; and as he was in the heart of the enemy 's country , and direct communication was cut off , it was difficult to ascertain the facts . General Grant felt no apprehension as to the result of Sheridan 's movements , but was anxious to get definite reports . On Sunday evening , March 12 , the members of // the mess sat down to dinner about dark . Mrs. Grant and Mrs. Rawlins , who was also visiting headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meal the conversation turned upon Sheridan , and all present expressed the hope that we might soon hear something from him in regard to the progress of his movements . Just then a colored waiter stepped rapidly into the mess-room , and said to the general : ( ( Thah s a man outside dat say he want to see you right away , and he do n't pear to want to see nobody else . ) ) ( ( What kind of looking man is he ? ) ) asked the general . ( ( Why , ) ) said the servant , ( ( he 5 de mos ' dreffle-lookin ' bein ' I ebber laid eyes on ; he pears to me like he was a ' outcast . ) ) With the general 's consent , I left the table and went to see who the person was . I found a man outside who was about to sink to the ground from exhaustion , and who had scarcely strength enough to reply to my questions . He had on a pair of soldier 's trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sizes too large ; he was without a hat , and his appearance was grotesque in the extreme . With*him was another man in about the same condition . After giving them some whisky they gathered strength enough to state that they were scouts sent by Sheridan from Columbia on the James River , had passed through the enemy 's lines , bringing with them a long and important despatch from their commander , had ridden hard for two days , and had had a particularly rough experience in getting through to our lines . Their names were J. A. Campbell and A. H. Rowand , Jr . As Campbell had the despatch in his possession , I told him to step into , the mess-room with me , and hand it to the general in person , so as to comply literally with his instructions , knowing the general 's anxiety to have the news at once . The message was written on tissue-paper and inclosed in a ball of tin-foil , which the scout had carried in his mouth . The general glanced over it , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It consisted of about three pages , and gave a vivid account of Sheridan 's successful march , and the irreparable damage he had inflicted upon the enemy 's communications , saying that he had captured twenty-eight pieces of artillery , destroyed many mills and factories , the James River Canal for a distance of fifteen miles , and the bridges on the Rivanna River , and stating that he was going to destroy the canal still further the next day , and then move on the Central and the Fredericksburg railroads , tear them up , and afterward march to White House , where he would like to have forage and rations sent him ; and notifying the general that his purpose , unless otherwise ordered , was then to join the Army of the Potomac . The general proceeded to interrogate Campbell , but the ladies , who had now become intensely interested in the scout , also began to ply him with questions , which were directed at him so thick and fast that he soon found himself in the situation of the outstretched human figure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zodiac . The general soon rose from his seat , and said good-naturedly : ( ( Well , I will never get the information I want from this scout as long as you ladies have him under crossexamination , and I think I had better take him over to my quarters , and see if I can not have him to myself for a little while . ) ) By this time the dinner-party was pretty well broken up , and by direction of the general several members of the staff accompanied him and the scouts to the general 's quarters . It was learned from them that Sheridan , deeming it very important to get a despatch through to headquarters , selected two parties , consisting each of two scouts . To each party was given a copy of the despatch , and each was left to select its own route . Campbell and Rowand started on horseback from Columbia on the evening of the 10th , following the roads on the north side of Richmond . They were twice overhauled by parties of the enemy , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in Confederate uniforms and skilled in the Southern dialect , they escaped without detection . When they approached the Chickahominy they were met by two men and a boy , with whom they fell into conversation , and were told by them that they had better not cross the river , as there were Yankee troops on the other side . Before the scouts were out of earshot they heard one of the men say to the other , " I believe those fellows are d*-d Yankees , ) ) and soon they found that the alarm had been given , and the Confederate cavalry were pursuing them . They rode forward to the Chickabominy as rapidly as they could proceed in the jaded condition of their horses , and when they reached the stream they took off everything except their undershirts , tied their clothes on the pommels of their saddles , and swam their horses across the river . Campbell had taken the roll of tin-foil which contained the despatch from the lining of his boot , and put it in his mouth . On the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a row of piles . // As the horses could not struggle out , the men abandoned them , and got into a canoe which providentially happened to be floating past , and by this means got ashore . The Confederates by this time had opened fire on them from the opposite bank . The scouts made their way on foot for eleven miles , in their almost naked condition , to Harrison 's Landing on the James River , where they met a detachment of our troops . The soldiers supplied them with trousers and blouses such as they could spare , and took them by boat to City Point . They had ridden 145 miles without sleep and with but little food . The second pair of scouts sent by Sheridan made their way by canal and on foot to the south of Richmond . After six unsuccessful attempts to get across the lines , one of them reached headquarters several days later . The scouts were given a meal of the best food of which the headquarters mess could boast , and put into a comfortable hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost sleep . The next day General Grant made all preparation for sending supplies and troops to meet Sheridan at White House . The general complimented the scouts warmly upon their success , directed that they be supplied with two good horses and an outfit of clothing , and sent them around to White House on a steamer to await Sheridan there ; but on their arrival they could not restrain their spirit of adventure , and rode out through the enemy 's country in the direction of the South Anna River until they met their commander . Campbell was only nineteen years of age . Sheridan always addressed him as ( ( Boy , ) ) and the history of his many hairbreadth escapes that year would fill a volume . Campbell has always remained a scout and is still in the employ of the government in that capacity at Fort Custer ; Rowand is now a prominent lawyer in Pittsburg , Pa . This day ( March 13 ) possesses a peculiar personal interest for me , for the reason that it is the date borne by two brevet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the regular army-for ( ( gallant and meritorious services in the field during the rebellion. * GRANT DRAWS THE NET TIGHTER AROUND THE ENEMY . SHERIDAN reached White House on March 19 , after having made a campaign seldom equaled in activity , through a difficult country and during incessant rains . He had whipped the enemy at all points , captured 17 pieces of artil lery and 1600 prisoners , and destroyed 56 canal-locks , 5 aqueducts , 23 railroad bridges , 40 canal and road bridges , together with 40 miles of railroad , numerous warehouses and factories , and vast quantities of military supplies . On March 20 Stoneman advanced toward east Tennessee , and on the same day Canby moved his forces against Mobile . Sherman had whipped all the troops opposed to him in his march through the Carolinas , and destroyed communications in all directions . He and Schofield met with their armies at Goldsborough , North Carolina , on the 23d of March , and about all the points on the Atlantic coast were now in our possession . When Sheridan started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Military Division . The various armies were all working successfully with a common purpose in view , and under one watchful , guiding mind the web was being woven closer and closer about the Confederate capital , and the cause of secession was every day drawing nearer to its doom . General Grant 's only anxiety now was to prevent the escape of the enemy from Richmond before he could be struck a crushing blow . No campaign in force could be made at this time by moving around to the west of Lee 's army and heading it off in that direction , for the reason that the rainy season still continued , and rendered the roads difficult for infantry and impassable for wagons and artillery , and because Sheridan 's cavalry had not yet joined our army in front of Petersburg . Every possible precaution was taken meanwhile to prevent Lee from on the picket-line , and all the troops were equipped and supplied , ready to make a forced march at a moment 's notice in case Lee should be found moving . It was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 to join the Army of the Potomac , and on the 24th orders were issued for a general movement of the armies operating against Petersburg and Richmond , to begin on the night of the 28th , for the purpose of marching around Lee 's right , breaking up his last remaining railroads , the Danville and the South Side , and giving , if possible , the final blow to the Confederacy . MR . LINCOLN 'S LAST VISIT TO GRANT . ON March 20 General Grant had telegraphed the President : ( ( Can you not visit City Point // for a day or two ? I would like very much to see you , and I think the rest would do you good . ) ) This invitation was promptly accepted , and on the 24th word came that he was on his way up the James aboard the River Queen . About nine o'clock that evening the steamer approached the wharf , and General Grant , with those of us who were with him at the moment , including Robert Lincoln , went down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest son , ( ( Tad , ) ) and several ladies who had come from Washington with the Presidential party . The meeting was very cordial . It lasted but a short time , however , as Mr. Lincoln and his family were evidently fatigued by the trip , and it was thought that they might want to retire at an early hour . His steamer was escorted by a naval vessel named the Bat , commanded by Captain John S. Barnes , an accomplished officer of the navy . GRANT 'S FORESIGHT . GRANT , with his usual foresight , had predicted that bee would make a determined assault at some point on our lines in an endeavor to throw our troops into confusion , and then make his escape before our men could recover from their consternation and be prepared to follow him closely . As early as February 22 the general-in-chief sent a very characteristic despatch to Parke , who was temporarily in command of the Army of the Potomac during Meade 's absence : ( ( As there is a possibility of an attack from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break your center , extra vigilance should be kept up both by the pickets and the troops on the line . Let commanders understand that no time is to be lost awaiting orders , if an attack is made , in bringing all their resources to the point of danger . With proper alacrity in this respect , I would have no objection to seeing the enemy get through . ) ) On the evening of the 24th of March , General Meade came to headquarters to meet Mrs. Meade , who had arrived by steamer at City Point , and General Grant suggested to him that he had better remain over till the next day , which he did . General Ord also stayed at headquarters that night . ATTACK ON FORT STEDMAN . ABOUT six o'clock the next morning , March 25 , the camp was awakened and was soon all astir by reason of a message from the Petersburg front saying that the enemy had broken through our lines near Fort Stedman and was making a heavy attack . Soon after it was found that the telegraph line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come most of the distance by couriers , there was increased anxiety as to the movement . General Grant saw at once that his prediction of a month before had been fulfilled , but believed that the cautions given would be observed , so that he did not experience much apprehension . We had wakened him the moment the announcement came by rapping upon the door of the room occupied by him and Mrs. Grant ; and in reply to his questions the despatch was read loud enough for him to hear it without opening the door . He dressed at once , and as this was a process which never occupied many minutes , he was soon out in front of his quarters , where he was met by Meade and others . Meade was greatly nettled by the fact that he was absent from his command at such a time , and was pacing up and down with great strides , and dictating orders to his chief-of-staff , General Webb , who was with him , in tones which showed very forcibly the intensity of his feelings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river , soon heard of the attack , and he was kept informed of the events which were taking place by his son Robert , who carried the news to him . General Grant , with his usual aggressiveness , telegraphed to the Army of the James : ( ( This may be a signal for leaving . Be ready to take advantage of it. * It was nearly two hours before any very definite information could be obtained , but the news began to be favorable , and by half-past eight o'clock it was learned that our whole line had been recaptured , many prisoners taken , and that everything was again quiet . Mr. Lincoln now sent a telegram to the Secretary of War , winding up with the words : ( ( Robert just now tells me there was a little rumpus up the line this morning , ending about where it began . ) ) Generals Meade and Ord returned as soon as they could to their respective commands , and took vigorous measures against the enemy . It seems that the Richmond authorities had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenable , and that their army must retreat as soon as possible . A successful attack on our right , it was hoped , would throw our troops into confusion , and while we were maturing plans for the recapture of the lost portion of our lines , and drawing in troops from our left for this purpose , Lee would find an opportunity to make a forced march with his army toward the Carolinas. // This attack was one of the most dramatic events of the siege of Petersburg . It was commanded by General J. B. Gordon . There had been placed at his disposal for the purpose about one half of Lee 's entire army . For some time men had been leaving the ranks of the enemy and making their way to us through the lines at night . The arms which they brought in were purchased from them at a fair price , and everything possible was done to encourage these desertions . The attacking party , knowing of this practice , took advantage of it , and succeeded in having his skirmishers gain an entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly make prisoners of our pickets . Just before dawn our trench guards were overpowered , our main line was broken between two of our batteries , and Fort Stedman , after a brief but gallant resistance , was captured , and its guns turned against our own troops . Several more batteries to the right and left were soon taken , and as friends could not be distinguished from foes , owing to the darkness , it was for a time difficult for our troops to use artillery . Further assaults , however , were handsomely repulsed ; as soon as there was sufficient light a heavy artillery fire was concentrated on the enemy , and at a quarter to eight o'clock Hartranft advanced against Fort Stedman , and recaptured it with comparatively small loss . The movement was well planned , and carried out with skill and boldness , but it proved a signal failure . It was a desperate military gamble , with very few chances of winning . It was a curious coincidence that on the same day that Lee was preparing for his assault on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of the Union armies against the enemy 's right . THE PRESIDENT TELLS SOME ANECDOTES . GENERAL GRANT proposed to the President that forenoon that he should accompany him on a trip to the Petersburg front . The invitation was promptly accepted , and several hours were spent in visiting the troops , who cheered the President enthusiastically . He was greatly interested in looking at the prisoners who had been captured that morning ; and while at Meade 's headquarters , about two o'clock , sent a despatch to Stanton , saying : " . . . I have nothing to add to what General Meade reports , except that I have seen the prisoners myself , and they look like there might be the number he states-16OO. * The President carried a map with him , which he took out of his pocket and examined sev eral times . He had the exact location of the troops marked on it , and he exhibited a singularly accurate knowledge of the various positions . Upon the return to headquarters at City Point , he sat for a while by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head during certain shiftings of the wind , and he brushed it away from time to time by waving his right hand in front of his face , he entertained the general-in-chief and several members of the staff by talking in a most interesting manner about public affairs , and illustrating the subjects mentioned with his incomparable anecdotes . At first his manner was grave and his language much more serious than usual . He spoke of the appalling difficulties encountered by the administration , the losses in the field , the perplexing financial problems , and the foreign complications ; but said they had all been overcome by the unswerving patriotism of the people , the devotion of the loyal North , and the superb fighting qualities of the troops . After a while he spoke in a more cheerful vein , and said : ( ( England will live to regret her inimical attitude toward us . After the collapse of the rebellion John Bull will find that he has injured himself much more seriously than us . His action reminds me of a barber in Sangamon County in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger came along and said he must be shaved ; that he had a four days ' beard on his face , and was going to take a girl to a ball , and that beard must come off . Well , the barber got up reluctantly and dressed , and seated the man in a chair with a back so low that every time he bore down on him he came near dislocating his victim 's neck . He began by lathering his face , including his nose , eyes , and ears , stropped his razor on his boot , and then made a drive at the man 's countenance as if he had practised mowing in a stubble-field . He cut a bold swath across the right cheek , carrying away the beard , a pimple , and two warts . The man in the chair ventured to remark : ( You appear to make everything level as you go . ) ( Yes , ) said the barber ; ( and if this handle do n't break , I guess I 11 get away with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so hollow that the barber could n't get down into the valleys with the razor , and the ingenious idea occurred to him to stick his finger in the man 's mouth and press out the cheeks . Finally he cut clear through the cheek and into his own finger . He pulled the finger out of the man 's mouth , snapped the blood off it , glared at him , and cried : ( There , you lantern-jawed // cuss , you ye made me cut my finger ! ) And so England will discover that she has got the South into a pretty bad scrape by trying to administer to her , and in the end she will find that she has only cut her own finger . ) ) After the laugh which followed this story had exhausted itself , General Grant asked : ( ( Mr. President , did you at any time doubt the final success of the cause ? ) ) ( ( Never for a moment , ) ) was the prompt and emphatic reply , as Mr. Lincoln leaned forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his right hand . ( ( Mr. Seward , when he visited me last summer , gave a very interesting account of the complications and embarrassments arising from the Mason and Slidell affair , when those commissioners were captured on board the English vessel Tremt , * remarked General Grant . ( ( Yes , ) ) said the President ; ( ( Seward studied up all the works ever written on international law , and came to cabinet meetings loaded to the muzzle with the subject . We gave due consideration to the case , but at that critical period of the war it was soon decided to deliver up the prisoners : It was a pretty bitter pill to swallow , but I contented myself with believing that England 's triumph in the matter would be short-lived , and that after ending our war successfully we would be so powerful that we could call her to account for all the embarrassments she had inflicted upon us . I felt a good deal like the sick man in Illinois who was told he probably had n't many days longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any enemies he might have . He said the man he hated worst of all was a fellow named Brown , in the next village , and he guessed he had better begin on him . So Brown was sent for , and when he came the sick man began to say , in a voice as meek as Moses 's , that he wanted to die at peace with all his fellow-creatures , and he hoped he and Brown could now shake hands and bury all their enmity . The scene was becoming altogether too pathetic for Brown , who had to get out his handkerchief and wipe the gathering tears from his eyes . It was n't long before he melted , and gave his hand to his neighbor , and they had a regular love-feast of forgiveness . After a parting that would have softened the heart of a grindstone , Brown had about reached the room door when the sick man rose up on his elbow and called out to him : ( But see here , Brown ; if I should happen to get well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought that if this nation should happen to get well we might want that old grudge against England to stand. * It was a singular sequel to this conversation that the officer to whom he was then speaking became Mr. Lincoln 's successor in the Presidential chair , and carried out this determination by securing a settlement of the account known in history as the " Alabama claims , ) ) and the payment from England of fifteen and a half millions of dollars as compensation for damages inflicted upon our commerce . The President now went aboard his boat to spend the night . The next morning he wandered into the tent of the headquarters telegraph-operator , where several of us were sitting . He pulled out of his pocket a telegram which he had received from the Secretary of War , and his face assumed a broad smile as he said : ( ( Well , the serious Stanton is actually becoming facetious . Just listen to what he says in his despatch : ( Your telegram and Parke 's report of the scrimmage this morning are received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he could not hold the fence . We have nothing new here . Now you are away , everything is quiet and the tormentors vanished . I hope you will remember General Harrison ' s advise to his men at Tippecanoe , that they can **see as well a little farther off. *n MR . LINCOLN 'S KINDNESS TO ANIMALS . THREE tiny kittens were crawling about the tent at the time . The mother had died , and the little wanderers were expressing their grief by mewing piteously . Mr. Lincoln picked them up , took them on his lap , stroked their soft fur , and murmured : ( ( Poor little creatures , do n't cry ; you 11 be taken good care of , ) ) and turning to Bowers , said : ( ( Colonel , I hope you will see that these poor little motherless waifs are given plenty of milk and treated kindly . ) ) Bowers replied : *I will see , Mr. President , that they are taken in charge by the cook of our mess , and are well cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln was found fondling these kittens . He would wipe their eyes tenderly with his handkerchief , stroke their smooth coats , and listen to them purring their gratitude to him . It was a curious sight at an army headquarters , upon the eve of a great military crisis in the nation 's history , to see the hand which had affixed the signature to the Emancipation Proclamation , and had signed the commissions of all the heroic men who served the cause of the Union , from the general-in-chief to the lowest lieutenant , tenderly caressing three stray kittens . It well illustrated the kindness of the man 's disposition , // and showed the childlike simplicity which tion , and immediately*old it to Rawlins , who was mingled with the grandeur of his nature . was as much delighted as Sheridan himself . SHERIDAN 'S FINAL ORDERS . GENERAL GRANT had sent word to Sheridan , whose troops were now crossing the James , to come in person to headquarters , and early on the morning of March 26 he arrived . Rawlins and several other officers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon seeing Sheridan , who had been separated from us for so long a time , we hurried forward to greet him . Rawlins , in his enthusiasm , seized both of Sheridan 's hands in his own , wrung them vigorously , and then went to patting him on the back . Sheridan returned all the greetings warmly , and Rawlins now informed him that General Grant had made up his mind to send the cavalry through to join Sherman , destroying all communications as they went . Sheridan looked greatly annoyed at this information , and Rawlins agreed with him that such a move ought not to be made . Sheridan was told that the general-in-Ghief was awaiting him in his quarters , and went in and had a long talk . The general showed him the written instructions which he had prepared , and to which Rawlins had just referred . They directed him to proceed with his cavalry around Lee 's right , and then to move independently under other instructions . Sheridan felt convinced , from what was said verbally , that he was expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the staff now entered the room , and found Sheridan arguing against the policy of such a move . When he rose up to go , the general followed him out and had a few words of private conversation . We learned afterward that he told Sheridan that the part of the instructions to which he objected was merely a blind ; that he intended to end the contest at once where we were , and that Sheridan was to operate against Lee 's right , and be in at the death . He said : ( ( In case the operations of the cavalry should not be an entire success , the people would take it for granted that a definite movement which they had been expecting had been a complete failure , and they would be greatly discouraged . So I wanted the impression to prevail that a different movement had been contemplated . I really have no intention of sending you to Sherman . ) ) This was the general 's little secret , which he had kept from all of the staff , and revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sheridan was made happy by this conversa LINCOLN REVIEWS THE ARMY OF THE JAMES . IT was decided that upon this day Mr. Lincoln would review a portion of the Army of the James on the north side of the James River , and Sheridan was invited to join the party from headquarters who were to accompany the President . The boat started from City Point at eleven o'clock . At breakfast General Grant said to me : " I shall accompany the President , who is to ride ( Cincinnati , ) as he seems to have taken a fancy to him . I wish you would take Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Grant to the reviewingground in our headquarters ambulance . ) ) I expressed my pleasure at being selected for so pleasant a mission , and arranged to have the ambulance and two good horses put aboard the headquarters boat , which was to carry the party up the river . Captain Barnes , who commanded the vessel which had escorted the President 's steamer , was to be one of the party , and I loaned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accorded with some reluctance to naval officers when they came ashore ; for these men of the ocean at times tried to board the animal on the starboard side , and often rolled in the saddle as if there was a heavy sea on ; and if the horse , in his anxiety to rid himself of a sea-monster , tried to scrape his rider off by rubbing against a tree , the officer attributed the unseaman-like conduct of the animal entirely to the fact that his steering-gear had become unshipped . A naval hero not long before had borrowed a horse ashore , and attempted to make his seat firmer on deck by grappling the animal 's beam-ends with his spurs , which caused the horse to run a little too free before the wind ; and when the officer could not succeed in making him shorten sail by hauling in on the reins , he took out his jack-knife and dug it in the animal 's flanks , swearing that if he could not bring the craft to in any other way he would scuttle it . Navy officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , for fear they would knock holes in the bottom when jumping in , break the oars in catching crabs , and stave in the bows through an excess of modesty which manifested itself in a reluctance to give the command , ( ( Way enough ! ) ) in time when approaching a wharf . The President was in a more gloomy mood than usual on the trip up the James . He spoke with much seriousness about the sit- // 0 0 z z 0 z 0 z H 0 H -H H *I2 0 z w 0 H H H 0 z H H H H H H H H H 0 H H 0 z // uation , and did not attempt to tell a single anecdote . As the boat passed the point where Sheridan 's cavalry was crossing the river on the pontoon-bridge , he manifested considerable interest in watching the troopers , and addressed a . number of questions to their commander . When the boat reached the landing on the north side of the river , I helped the two distinguished ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and started for the reviewing-ground , about two miles distant . The horsemen got the start of us and made good time ; but as the road was swampy , and part of it corduroyed with the trunks of small trees , without much reference to their relative size or regularity of position , the ambulance could make but slow progress . Some additional springs had been put under it , and cross-seats arranged so as to make it ride more easily than the ordinary army-ambulance ; but the improved springs only served to toss the occupants higher in the air when the wheels struck a particularly aggravating obstacle . Mrs. Lincoln , find jng we were losing time , and fearing we would miss part of the review , expressed a wish to move faster , and I reluctantly gave the order to the driver . We were still on a corduroyed portion of the road , and when the horses trotted the mud flew in all directions , and a sudden jolt lifted the party clear off the seats , jammed the ladies ' hats against the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Lincoln now insisted on getting out and walking ; but as the mud was nearly hub-deep , Mrs. Grant and I persuaded her that we had better stick to the wagon as our only ark of refuge . Finally we reached our destination , but it was some minutes after the review had begun . Mrs. Ord , and the wives of several of the officers who had come up from Fort Monroe for the purpose , appeared on horseback as a mounted escort to Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Grant . This added a special charm to the scene , and the review passed off with peculiar brilliancy . Mrs. Grant enjoyed the day with great zest , but Mrs. Lincoln had suffered so much from the fatigue and annoyances of her overland trip that she was not in a mood to derive much pleasure from the occasion . I made up my mind that ambulances , viewed as vehicles for driving distinguished ladies to military reviews , were not a stupendous success , and that thereafter they had better be confined to their legitimate uses of transporting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat , the President seemed to recover his spirits . Perhaps the manifestation of strength on the part of the splendid Army of the James which he had witnessed at the review had served to cheer him up . He told one excellent story on the way back . In speaking of a prominent general , and the failure of the numerous attempts on the President 's part to make the officer 's services useful to the country , and the necessity finally of relieving him from all command , he said : " I was not more successful than the blacksmith in our town , in my boyhood days , when he tried to put to a useful purpose a big piece of wrought-iron that was in the shop . He heated it , put it on the anvil , and said : ( I m going to make a sledge-hammer out of you . ) After a while he stopped hammering it , looked at it , and remarked : ( Guess I ye drawed you out a little too fine for a sledgehammer ; reckon I d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the fire , blew the bellows , got up a good heat , then began shaping the iron again on the anvil . Pretty soon he stopped , sized it up with his eye , and said : ( Guess I ye drawed you out too thin for a clevis ; suppose I better make a clevis-bolt of you . ) He put it in the fire , bore down still harder on the bellows , drew out the iron , and went to work at it once more on the anvil . In a few minutes he stopped , took a look , and exclaimed : ( Well , now I ye got you down a leetle too thin even to make a clevis-bolt out of you . ) Then he rammed it in the fire again , threw his whole weight on the bellows , got up a white heat on the iron , jerked it out , carried it in the tongs to the water-barrel , held it over the barrel , and cried : ( I ye tried to make a sledge-hammer of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , and failed ; I ye tried to make a clevis-bolt of you , and failed ; now , darn you , I 'm going to make a fizzle of you ; and with that he soused it in the water and let it fizz . ) ) It was nearly dark when the party re turned to City Point . After dinner the band was brought down to the steamboat , and a dance was improvised . Several ladies were aboard , and they and the officers danced till midnight . Neither the President nor General Grant joined , even in a square dance , but sat in the after part of the boat conversing . Sheridan stayed overnight at headquarters , and started early in the morning for the cavalry headquarters on the Petersburg front .
