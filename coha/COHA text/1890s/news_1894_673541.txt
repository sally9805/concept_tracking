txt There are some significant features in the Treasury statements issued yesterday . The gold reserve was $202,008 above the limit of $100,000,000 , and some $920,000 of Treasury gold will be shipped to-day to Europe , thus encroaching on that reserve for the first time since the proceeds of the 5 per cent . loan were received . During the month of April , the net debt  --  that is , the debt less cash in the Treasury  --  increased nearly $7,000,000 , ( $6,950,599.25 , ) leaving a net cash balance of $25,097,785.93 . This is sufficient for all practical purposes , on one condition , that the Tariff bill be passed , the customs revenue be renewed , and business allowed to revive . Whatever may be . the prominence and activity of some of the old district leaders in the new Republican County Committee , it is pretty evident that it can not be ? brought into any sort of subserviency to Thomas C. Platt . Considerable pains were taken to make that plain at the meeting of Monday night , and this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk of the Republican voters of the city , and make the socalled " Milholland movement " more than ever ridiculous . If Platt has any notion of getting the Milholland organization " recognized as regular " by the State Convention he will probably be disappointed , Tor that would be too absurd for any body of sane men , even under the direction of Platt . The Mulholland faction is very likely to become in city affairs an ally of Tammany Hall , and the Committee of Thirty organization would gain strength and support by adopting the principle that In municipal matters party considerations should be ignored or completely subordinated to the cause of honesty , efficiency , and non-partisanship in the management of public interests . Mr. Teller is responsible for the statement that when the Democrats in the Senate adjust their differences there will be nothing left for the Republicans to do but to debate the propositions in a dignified way , and then permit the Tariff bill to come to a vote . It should need no spirit from the vasty Rockies to convince the Democrats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but have known it for a long time . What they do not seem to know is that their party . s being discredited and disintegrated throughout the country . They may discover that when it is too late .
