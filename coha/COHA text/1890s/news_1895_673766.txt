txt Dr. Parkhurst has written a book . All the copy is in the hands of the printers , and unless some unforeseen hitch occurs it win be published in a few weeks . Arrangements have been made for a large circulation in this country and abroad . Within three years Dr. Parkhurst has come into possession of an international reputation as a reformer . His name is known almost the world over among people who have a very indistinct idea of the exact nature of the work he has been doing and of the channels through which the municipal corruption that he was among the first to expose have been made the basis of a reform movement that swept the Tammany organization out of power . Dr. Parkhurst thinks , and his publishers think , also , that the book will have a large sale and prove exceedingly profitable for everybody concerned . There is no disguising the fact that in the general round-up Dr. Parkhurst has come out at the short end of the horn . From the start his ultimate aim has been the overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city as it exists to-day  --  men , methods , and everything . He wanted a clean sweep , and he confidently expected that the Lexow committee was going to bring It about . He does not conceal the information that he is disappointed . The politicians have stolen his thunder and left him out in the cold . Dr. Parkhurst knows , as well as everybody else in the inner circle of the recent police investigation , that Senator Lexow and the majority of his associates utterly disapprove of the radical suggestion to throw the entire police force overboard and put the department in charge of some military man unacquainted with police work in this town , and with nothing in view except the establishment of some system of military discipline . As was explained in The New-York Times a few days ago , Senator Lexow and his associates on the committee are opposed to anything of the kind . It is as certain as anything can be within the limits of political prediction that Senator Lexow will recommend the continuance of a non-partisan police board , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supt. Byrnes will be left in absolute control of the reorganized department , with ample power to carry out his ideas uninfluenced and not intimidated by , Tammany politicians as buffers against the punishment of people , who will not comply with the law . His resignation sent to Mayor Strong will probably never reach the Police Commissioners , so Dr. Parkhurst 's friends believe . The report of the Lexow committee will not be very voluminous . It is , if reliable reports are to be credited , substantially ready for the ' Senate . One of the men who has been largely instrumental in drawing it up is ex-Judge Sutherland of Rochester , who came down here at the outset es the real counsel of the committee . He was lost sight of , temporarily , in the meteoric revelations of Mr. Goff as prompted by the Society for the Prevention of Crime , but he is in at the death . With all this in view , Dr. Parkhurst has decided to print his own account of the reform movement in this city . He will begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , describe with the most minute detail his wordy conflict with Superintendent Byrnes , give the history of his lobby work in Albany which led to the . appointment of the Lexow committee , and inculcate his impressions of the effect that the revelations made before that committee had on the overthrow of the Tammany throng . It is not the purpose of the book to go very far beyond the elections of last November , except to record Dr. Parkhurst 's conviction that the people came out at that time for real reform , and that they will be satisfied with nothing elseDr . Parkhurst said yesterday to a reporter for The New-York Times : " If there is any attempt on the part of this reform Legislature to evade real issues which the people of New-York voted upon at the last election , I believe that the voice of the reform element is still strong enough to be heard all the way up the North River . " Thomas C. Platt returned to town yesterday and gave out his usual gist of glittering generalities to the reporters . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Police ' Department or the probable suggestions that the Senate committee would make concerning it . To judge from Mr. Platt 's conversation , he was not giving the matter much consideration . On the other hand , to judge from his actions , it was uppermost in his thoughts . When he had finished his business down town , he went to the Fifth Avenue Hotel and had a long conversation with Police Commissioners Murray and Kerwin . " What do you think , " Mr. Platt was asked , " about the suggestion mde by Charles Stewart Smith that a commission of five be empowered to condense and codify the police regulations of this city and devise a plan for the radical reorgara : ization of the Department ? " Mr. Platt replied that the suggestion was interesting to him , but that he really did not care to discuss it . If , such -a commission was appointed , whom would you suggest as suitable men ? " Mr. Platt once more declined to commit himself . He should dislike very much , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee had the subject well in hand , and it would be just as well to wait and see what was suggested by it . That was all that could be obtained from Mr , Platt on the subject . But he devoted a good deal of time to its consideration during the day . One of his visitors to whom he mentioned the matter said that it might be considered an assured thing that Mr. Platt would use all his influence for the continuance of a non-partisan Police Board ; and that he would oppose any attempt to.reorganize the . department with Superintendent Byrnes out of it . In fact , it was generally admitted yesterday by men in a position.to know anything at all about the matter , that the new police bill will provide for a. bi-partisan corn-* mission , and that the single Commissioner idea will be thrown to the winds . If . this scheme is carried . out , and Superintendent Byrnes is , . retalned in control , it will leave I him in substantially the same position that he was when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater opportunities to carry out the reforms expected of him , but that is all . Dr. Parkhurst was a very busy man yesterday . People from all over town , who somehow gained an impression that he was being crowded to the wall in the new police deal , called at his house , in Thirty-fifth Street . to have a talk with him . The preacher-politician did not seem to be at all discouraged . " We are not after temporary measures , " he said , " We have been defeated before , as , for instance , in our failure to convict Devery . But that helped us , and we shall survive this last check . It is the politicians and the interested few who will try with their small contracts to misuse the recent election and undo what disinterested men hoped to accomplish . There has been an advance , I am sure . I know very many men who stand for the long struggle that is to go on forever against fraud and corruption . We hope to make as tangible , ever existent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that which helps on evil is . To insist on the rights of the men who are minding their own business and have nothing to deal with the politicians for , I do , nevertheless , think there should be a mass meeting . Such a demonstration might freshen in the minds of the legislators their awakening recognition of the real source of their recent success and present power . " Dr. Parkhurst was emphatic in his declaration that the people demanded an immediate and complete reform in the Police Department . He would not discuss personalities . Superintendent Byrnes was simply the head of a police system which was incorrigibly bad . " There are , " he said , " only two methods of reorganization . One is to deal with each inculpated member of the present force by a process of prosecution  --  a weeding-out process , submitting each suspected member of the force to a process of investigation which would probably reach its completion somewhere near the beginning of the twenty-first century . We have no time for any such nonsense . " The other method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. most drastic nature . The thing to do is to include in fhe bill of police reorganization a clause to the effect that on or before a certain ate  --  say July 1  --  the term of service of the existing force shall expire , that a commission  --  say of five men  --  should be designated by the Mayor to reconstruct the force , whose term of service should commence on the even date with that of the expiration of the present force . " " Whom would you suggest as members of that commission ? " " I have no suggestions to make . I suggest the method . It devolves upon others to suggest the men . " Dr. Parkhurst explained that it was not at all his idea to sweep every policeman now employed off the force , but he did think that the reform should be so radical that every member of the existing force above the rank of Sergeant should be ineligible , and that in reappointing every man below the rank of Sergeant every man should be judged solely on his credentials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into details about his old-time suggestion of a military police . It was necessary , he said , to- lift the department clear of ward politics , and this seemed to him to be the most effective method of doing so . Nor would he express an opinion on the proper punishment to give police officers whose corruption was exposed before the Lexow committee . Comment was useless , he said , upon the testimony of such a man as Williams . It remained for the District Attorney to deal with that . The treatment of such persons as individuals , the doctor said , did not concern him cr the society of which he was President . His fight was against the rottenness of the entire system . The only way , in his . opinion ; to remove the rottenness was to turn out the men who had admitted that they were subject to corrupt influences . " To whom do you refer ? " " Oh ! well , " said Dr. Parkhurst , as his wife came , for the third time , to call him away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrnes 's testimony of the men who made his fortune for him . " MR . PLATT HAS MANY CALLERS . He Confers with the New Commissioner of Public Works . Thomas C. Platt was almost overrun with Republican politicians in ' his rooms in the Fifth Avenue Hotel last night . By far his most important political caller , in view of the day 's events in Albany , was Mayor George W. Aldridge of Rochester . Mr. Aldridge was nominated by Gov . Morton and confirmed by the Senate as State Superintendent of Public Works in the afternoon . Before 9 o'clock last night he was snugly closeted with Mr. Platt . His arrival just at this time was a source of great interest to the politicians and of course , it was declared that Mr. Aldridge had just come down to this city on a visit . He expressed himself as very much pleased with his appointment . The place of State Superintendent of Public Works is rich with patronage . Mr. Aldridge was with Mr. Platt for more than an hour . Edward Lauterbach , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Committee , also called on Mr. Platt , but whether on the question of the Chairmanship or on other matters of business or politics is not known . Fred S. Gibbs came in about 10 o'clock with Assemblyman Nixon of Chautauqua , Arthur C. Wade , and Thomas Hamilton . Mr. Gibbs , who , with Hamilton Fish , Jr. , was read out of the party by Platt 's orders a few years ago , sent up his card , and in a few minutes he and the men who were with him were called up to Mr. Platt 's room . It may be that Mr. Platt wanted Mr. Gibbs 's advice on the question , of committee Chairmanship . Mr. Platt , earlier in the evening , said to a reporter who asked him what truth there was in a published story that he would oppose the passage of a Power of Removal bill , said : " That 's all rot . Pure nonsense ! I have already expressed my views on the Power of Removal bill . " ' Mr. Platt also denied that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which he was reported to have said that Dr. Parkhurst was suffering from " a swelled head . " " 1 gave out no interview of any kind at Wilkesbarre , and what was published was a garbled report of a Private conversation , " said Mr. Platt . Asked as to what he thought of the election of Hamilton Fish , Jr. , as Speaker , Mr. Platt calmly remarked : " I took no part in the fight in any way , and I supopse that what is must be right . " . " Are . you going to make a New Year 's call on Mayor Strong ? , " No , " said Mr. Platt . " I saw the Mayor not . long ago : where is no reason why I should see him again . If he wants me he will send for me , I suppose . I am an easy boss to get along with , if I am a boss . I do not say that . : any . man must go , or that ' any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Happy , New Year . to ' everybody , "
