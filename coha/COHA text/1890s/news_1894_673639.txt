txt The Treasury statement of the money received for customs at this port is completed to Aug. 20 . For the ten days preceding that date , with receipts of $4,652 , - 982 , the proportion of gold was only eighttenths of 1 per cent. , or 80 cents on every $100 . Silver certificates were 57.5 per cent . and Treasury notes 21.7 per cent. , forming together 79.2 per cent. , or practically four-fifths of . the total receipts . This is not so unfavorable a showing as in the early part of July , and it is likely to be improved when the receipts under the new law begin to come in . These will be watched with interest , since the condition of the gold reserve distinctly depends upon their course . The opinion of the Attorney General of this State that the revised Constitution , or any constitutional amendments framed by the convention , need not be submitted to a popular vote at the election of this year seems to be based upon the theory that the convention itself has an authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no room for doubt as to the meaning and intent of the act of the Legislature which provided for the holding of the convention It declares explicitly that " the said amendments , or revised Constitution , shall be submitted by the convention to the people for their adoption or rejection at the general election in November , 1894 , " and that the laws regulating general elections shall apply so far as they are applicable and " not inconsistent with the terms of this act . " The provision that the payment of a per diem to the delegates shall cease after Sept. 15 , 1894 , shows the intention to have the work of the convention completed in ample time for consideration before the election of this year . The act further provides that the Constitution , " as adopted , revised , or amended , " should take effect on Dec. 31 , 1894 , " unless the said convention shall prescribe some other time , " but it leaves no discretion as to the time of having the vote taken- It Would be better policy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby meet the public expectation . The thoughtful and weighty address of judge Thomas M. Cooley , read before the American Bar Association yesterday at Its annual meeting at Saratoga , is worthy of the most sober consideration . It dealt mainly not with technical matters of interest to lawyers alone , but with questions of the observance of law which concern all citizens . In speaking of the Coxes movements , lynchings , and labor disturbances of the past year he laid stress , very properly , not so much upon the spirit of lawlessness exhibited by the offenders as upon the lack of that patriotic and aggressive spirit of respect for law and public authority which should discountenance such ? proceedings and make them rare and of short duration . The apathetic toleration of lawlessness was a more disquieting symptom than the disorders themselves . Judge Cooley 's reference to Gov . Altgeld 's protest against the President 's action in enforcing the laws of the United States and vindicating the authority of the Federal Government is the more scathing for its calm and conclusive statement of the utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " even plausible . " This address of the venerable authority on constitutional law should be widely circulated and read . A very practical indication of what the enlarged commerce under a reformed tariff will do for this city is the completion of the plans of the wool trade for a large building in which there will be a Wool Exchange , a Wool Bank , a ' Wool Club , and a Wool Warehouse . This provision for the extended interests of the trade was undertaken immediately on the election of Mr. Cleveland , on the indubitably correct inference that free wool would follow . The operation of these combined enterprises must be to tend to make New-York a centre of the wool trade of the world , and thus to bring to our manufacturers that choice of material , both as to quality and price , which is of the very essence of successful production . And the advantage thus secured must in the nature of things be shared by the consumer .
