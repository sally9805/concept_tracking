txt Now that the Carlisle Currency bill has been reported , it is not at all certain that it will pass the House . If the Committee on Rules could be assured that the bill would go through without delay or serious opposition , that committee probably would report an order of business limiting debate on the bill , so that it could be sent to the Senate before the holiday recess . But a hasty canvass of the House , made by members who must share the responsibility for reporting an order of business , leads to the conclusion that there are difficulties to be encountered . There has been little doubt , from the moment that the currency reform was suggested , that it would be impossible to secure a report on any bill that might be framed in the committee . The reason for this belief is found in the great diversity of opinion of the members . It would be easier to secure a bill from the Republican members than from the Democrats , but Mr. Walker knows that the Republicans would not unite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested the plan of the Controller of the Currency . Mr. Walker may have had an idea that the Democrats would report his bill , but that belief was attributable entirely to overconfidence on Mr. Walker 's part , and to some extent to forgetfulness of the fact that Mr. Warner and Mr. Hall , both men of ideas , and likewise Mr. Springer , who has a fruitful mind , entertain the impression that they are quite as capable as Mr. Walker of suggesting practicable plans of currency reform . Leading Democrats of the House are inclined to believe that the Carlisle plan and bill will be resisted by an almost solid Republican vote . They are also fearful that the disregard of the advice of visiting bankers , as to amendments to the bill , will be resented by adverse votes from Eastern members on the Democratic side . There is also a large Democratic vote in the House against the State bank proposition . On the other hand , there are some Democrats , notably Mr. Catchings of Mississippi , who would be glad to see a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State bank issues . These members are aware , however , that if there shall be made an attempt to enlarge the powers of State banks without ' Government supervision , which is regarded as undesirable by almost everybody at this time , every friend of the national banking system in the House would be arranged against the bill . An attempt to impose restrictions upon the State banks more severe than those made for national banks , would . it is certain , deprive the bill or the vote of every ' SLnithern member who will support the bill - as- it stands for the encouragement it gives to a removal of State bank issues . There are murmurs from the Senate , too , of opposition to the Carlisle bill . They have reached the House , and their tenor has been to depress the hopes of those leaders who have been confident that the Administration would be able to pull the Carlisle bill through . The advocates of free-silver coinage in the Senate will encourage the plan that is suggested of offering a bill that is a compound of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver . This may be largely a silver " bluff , " but it supports the position of some of the Democrats who have given their friends in the House to understand that the Carlisle bill will not easily pass the Senate . The Administration will be stronger , relatively , in the House on this measure than it will be in the Senate . But the men who have been regarded as the firm friends of the Administration in the House admit to-day that it is by no means certain that the Carlisle bill can get through the House as it stands . They do not feel competent to recommend the amendments that would make it acceptable , and as long as the Republicans are determined to support none of the Democratic plans , and with division of the Democrats almost inevitable , the difficulty of passing any bill is admitted to be great . The Committee on Rules is aware of the situation . That is the chief reason for the delay of the committee in reporting a rule under which to endeavor to push the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
