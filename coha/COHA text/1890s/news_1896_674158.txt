txt Lc-aisle:lion Shaped in the interest of the State Machine  --  The " Boss 's " Plans . May Miscarry After the St. Louis Convention  --  The Gov .. governor Not So Subservient as the Legislators -- A Serious Situation Facing the Republican . Dictator . ALBANY , May ** C. Platt 's Morton Presidential-candidacy farce is as dead as the recent session of Mr. Platt 's Legislature . The Tioga boss - nay not admit it before the expiration of the thirty days ' period in which Gov . Morton will have an opportunity to act upon some of the bills in which Mr. Platt 's son 's law firm is interested , but the news from Illinois this morning has been ample to satisfy everybody else upon that point . Gov . Morton may be pleased to.take the soft seat which is awarded to favorite sons , but unless he has a whole hive full of bees in his hat he will probably see the existing condition of affairs as clearly as any ordinary observer . A bit of inside political history is well worth recording at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton did not consent to enter his name in the list of Presidential aspirants until he had been besought , begged , and implored to do so by T. C. Platt 's machine . The little yarn about Platt never having tried to influence the Governor in this matter , which has been given out so freely by Mr. Platt 's friends , is ridiculous . The official announcement that Gov , Morton was a candidate for the nomination at St. Louis came with the new year within a. few hours of the beginning of the Iegislative session . Mr. Platt knew long before then that he had absolute control over the Legislative branch of the Government . To carry out his schemes of legislation completely he . wanted a club over the Governor 's head He also had control of the machinery which would nominate seventy-two delegates to the St. Louis Convention . Besides that , he was on trading terms with Quay . Clarkson , and other bosses , who then thought they could manipulate delegations in various parts of the country . Under these conditions it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buzz in his hat unless he was disposed to keep on good terms with Mr. Platt , and that was just what . Mr. Platt was after . Mr. Platt was accused early in the game of a lack of sincerity in his support of Gov . Morton . He was charged with having brought Mr. Morton into the field simply to furnish  --  a rallying point for the New York delegates , and many skillful politicians who watched the course of events and who knew Mr. Platt . maintained that when the time came Mr. Platt would " clump " Mr. Morton like a load of sand , and put the delegates to St Louis where they could act to the best advantage for Plan . It appears to a good many politicians now that this was only a part of the game ; that Mr. Platt was more interested id the Morton boom because of its effect on Morton than from any advantage he might get by holding the delegates in a solid bunch . Mr. Platt doubtless has been pleased to some extent with the way his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace-loving man at all times , has dealt gently with some of Mr. Platt 's choicest measures . At times open threats have been made against the Governor that refusal to obey machine orders would cost him delegates at St. Louis . One such occasion was when the Albany Police bill , which the Governor signed today , was before him for the first time . That bill was drawn in the idterest of the Albany section of the Platt machine , and was designed specifically to make William Barnes , Jr. , Mr. Platt 's lieutenant in this county , the dictator of Republican machine Politics hereabouts . The Governor objected to some of the bill 's provisions , and was preparing to vc.:to it . Mr. Barnes openly made the threat that a veto would cost at least two votes in St. Louis , and would make trouble generally for the Governor . The latter made a show of withstanding these threats , and insisted that the bill be withdrawn for amendment . A compromise was agreed upon , whereby the bill was withdrawn , amended in some unimportant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill , it became a law , and Mr. Platt and Mr. Barnes have about what they wanted . The disgraceful part of this whole attempt of Mr. Platt to control a Governor as well as a Legislature is that an effort was made to work one end of the Morton boom for business purposes , Platt allowing his son 's law firm , Tracy , Boardman &; Platt , to use it as a means to influence the Governor 's action on bills in which , in behalf of various corporations , this firm was interested . Representatives of this firm have been constantly invading the Executive Chamber , favoring or opposing bills before the Governor in which corporations which were its clients were interested . It ought to be said to the Governor 's credit that the fact that the " organiza tion " favored or opposed a given measure has not been as potent in the Governor 's chamber as it has in the legislative hall . It is doubtful , in view of the news from Illinois , that the club can be used effectively in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty days . It is already rumored that the delegates to St. Louis who are controlled by Platt are mighty anxious to know whither Platt is leading them . " What , " some of them are asking , " can Platt do with nominated ? What sort of a position will we be in when we get to St. Louis ? " It is probable that the news from Illinois has hurt Platt more than it has any other anti-qzmcq#Kinley boss . He is likely not only to have trouble in delivering his delegates at St. Louis , but he is more than likely to find himself in great political distress when he shall attempt to name the Republican candidate for Governor this Fall , Such anti-Platt sentiment as there is In the State , so far as it has come to any head In the contest for National delegates , is for . If it shall turn out at St. Louis that has the nomination to a certainty , the New-York delegates , according to present indications , will be in the position of joining in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on the band wagon and remaining with Plat , . outside the breastworks.
