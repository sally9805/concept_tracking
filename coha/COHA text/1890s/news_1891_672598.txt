txt Democratic Senators here have been more or less interested in the gossip relative to Gov . Hill 's intention to hold the office of Governor after March 4 , when his term as United States Senator begins . If the Governor will take the ' trouble to inquire what his future colleagues think about it , he will find that they have no doubt of his right to remain Governor of New-York until the and of his term if he chooses to do so , and that they expect him to resign that office on or before Wednesday or next week . If he decides to retain the Governorship after the first Monday hi December , however , or after the beginning of the next session of Congress , should the President call a session before December , he must not expect to act as Senator . The prohibition regarding the holding of two offices , by the same person , at the same time , 15 held to apply to two State or two Federal offices . Almost one hundred years ago the Senate , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of Senator of the United States was not a Federal but a State office . This deMelon was made in the ease of William Blount , the first Senator elected from Tennessee . He was impeached by the Honseof Representatives for certain acts committed previous to becoming a Senator , while acting as a Government officer , in dealing with the Indians in Tennessee and Georgia . His counsel contended that he could not be Impeached as a Senator , be cause a Senator was not a Federal officer , and the Senate sustained the plea . Gov . Hill 's right to continue in the office of Governor after March 4 is conceded by Senators on the ground that , while his Senatorial term begins on that day , he will not actually be a Senator until he has taken the oath of office required by the Constitution . His salary as Senator will begin next week , and , beginning in April , a check for the amount due will be mailed to the Governor on the third of each month . So far as pay is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he can perform no act as a Senator until he bas been sworn into office . There have been some differences of opiidou among tienators as to how and when the oath of office of a Senator might be taken . That question beeame one of great importanoe a few years ago , when Messrs . Miller and Lapham came to Washington to take the places vacated by Messrs . Conkling and Platt as Senators from New-York . With these two places vacant the Democrats were in the majority and could organize the Senate . With the two New-York men seated the Republicans would have control . Mr. Arthur had become President and the Senate was without a President pro tem , while the Secretary of the Senate had died . The Republicans desired to put Mr. Anthony in the chair and have the oath administered to Messrs . Miller and Lapham . The Democrats insisted that , in the absence of a Vice President , President pro tern. , and Secretary , the Senate must be called to order by the Chief Clerk , who must preside until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not administer the oath to Senators-elect . As the result of caucus action by both parties , it was finally agreed that the Democrats should select one of their number to preside until a President pro tern . was elected , and Mr. Harris of Tennessee took the chair at the beginning of the session , and , " in the absence of objection , " presided until David Davis was chosen as President pro tem . Mr. Harris and others held that the oath or office of a Senator could be administered only by one of two persons  --  the Vice President of the United States and the President pro tem. of the Senate  --  and the New-York Senators were not sworn in until the presiding officer tied been elected . It is now a formal rule of the Senate that the oath of officio must bo taken and subscribed in open Senate , and under the precedents it can be administered only by the Vice President , or President pro tern. , while actually presiding over an open session of the Senate . Gov . Hill therefore can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regular session in December , or in an extraordinary session called by President Harrison before that time . And as he is not a Senator until he has been sworn into office , he can continue to be Governor until he chooses to take the oath or until his term expires . Gov . Hill must decide for himself how long he will remain in the chair as Governor , and whether or not he will accept two salaries , one from the State and one from the Nation , after March 4 . It is assumed by Senators here that he will leave his present office when his Senatorial term begins , because it appears to them that it is the only way for the Governor to avoid a great deal of adverse criticism and a good many unpleasant comments , and because it is the course that would naturally suggest itself to any gentleman with ordinary notions of propriety . They recognize that it is no business of theirs , but concerns Mr. Hill alone . The Senate knows Gov . Hill only as a citizen or New-York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His pay will be sent him regularly , and , when he presents himself at a regular sitting of the Senate after March 4 , the oath will be administered to him by the regular presiding officer , and he will become a Senator in fact , and then , 11 not before , he will cease to . be Governor .
