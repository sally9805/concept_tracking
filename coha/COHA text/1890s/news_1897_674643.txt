txt Capt . William 0 . Perry and a crew of five men were rescued to-day from the dismasted schooner Henry May of Portland , Me. , bound from Newport News to Portland with piling . The May ran into the storm on Friday , but swept along until Saturday at 10 o'clock , when she was found to be making water , and despite the greatest efforts of her men at the pumps became water-logged . She finally went over on her beam , owing to the shifting of her cargo . Her masts were cut away and she righted , but began to drift . The vessel was nearly awash , and the men were forced to take to the rigging . The schooner was first seen from the shore Saturday , and the Ocean City lifesaving crew made an attempt to reach her . The lifeboat was launched , and almost immediately a huge wave broke over her and flung her angrily back upon the sands . Again and again was the attempt made , only to meet with the same rebuff . Eventually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescuers were despairingly compelled to abandon it . The schooner continued to drift slowly down the coast , her anchor chains dragging and wave after wave breaking over her . Her anchors finally held when she was off Ocean City this morning , and her men were seen clinging to the rigging . The sea had calmed somewhat , and the life-saving crew decided that it would be possible to reach the unfortunate craft . They put off in their lifeboat , and , though they encountered great difficulties , managed to accomplish the rescue . The men were almost dead when the hail of the lifesavers was heard . Several of them had to be lifted into the boat . The rescue of the crew was witnessed by a great crowd on the beach . There was a burst of cheers when the life-saving boat reached the shore , and when the sailors who had faced death for twenty-four hours were brought to land , there was more cheering . The life-savers received a grand welcome . Men grasped them by the hand , and women hugged them and praised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
