txt FANCY a painter unable to make pictures except when some one says to him : Paint now , paint this or that , and paint it thus and so ; or a poet or musician forced to wait for similar behests , and getting them , very often , in the shape of uncongenial themes and narrow limitations . Imagine this and you will realize the architect 's actual position , and the contrast between his life and that of other artists . Of course , the difference is neither accidental nor designed , but inevitable . It is the natural result of the fact that architecture is not an art pure and simple . It has a practical side . Its products are not mere objects of beauty . They are useful objects made beautiful , and they can not be spun out of the artist 's brain , but must cost a great deal of money . When useful , costly things which take up a great deal of space are in question , demand must precede supply . The poet or the painter caters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public 's express wishes . These facts mean two things . They mean that the arch.itect must be something more than an artist , and that the client has a part to play which is only less important-which from one point of view is even more important-than the architect 's own . As neither perfectly fulfils his duty in America to-day , it may be worth while to define in brief what that duty is . Let us begin with the client . I. The client-whether a unit or that multiple of units called a committee-should remember that architecture is not practical only , but that its aesthetic side is as inevitable and important as its utilitarian , should realize that he who meddles with artistic things owes a duty to others as well as to himself , and know that this is especially the case when the result is to stand conspicuously // before the public eye . It is false to say that there are structures which need not be " architectural " at all ; that men may build at times , yet put all thoughts of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of architecture or a bad one . If it plainly shows that its builders did not even try to make it good , it is only the more inexcusably bad . We are not naive savages . We know that if a man is hungry for food or for beauty our obligation is the same , and we must give him the best that opportunity allows . When we insist that our neighbors shall daily look upon barrenness or deformity , when we fill what before was placid , empty space with crying shapes of ugliness , we are bad citizens , brutal neighbors . Some one has said that to build a hideous house is to indulge in the worst form of selfishness , and I am not sure that he exaggerated much . Thus the client , whatever he means to build , should look about him for an architect , in the . sense of a man who values at its highest the artistic side of every problem , great or small , elaborate or simple , and has thoroughly prepared himself to treat it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for an " unimportant** as well as for an " important " building . Indeed , these words should nof be used as they commonly are ; for architectural things are most important in their aggregate , and in making up this aggregate it is the smaller units which play the larger part . If every twenty-five-foot house in New York could be made truly excellent , inside and out , would we not gladly give in exchange our few large and sumptuous buildings ? The second commandment is that when we set an artist to work we should let him work as freely as possible . " Undoubtedly , " you may say ; " but who is to decide just what is meant by these words ? " In a letter I received not long ago from an American architect I find the following answer ; it may sound startling , but , believe me , none could be more true and wise : " The public must first learn to trust us as it does lawyers or doctors , before architecture can develop into a great art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests in building into the hands of trustees who are architects , can the latter do their best work . Any examples otherwise produced are accidental and not healthful developments . " That is to say , the architect 's client should reason with himself somewhat in this fashion : Here is a problem to be solved which is very difficult , as demanding both a practical and an artistic solu // tion . Here is a man whose profession it is to deal with such problems . The respect I feel for professional skill in other directions , artistic or practical , as the case may be , I should now feel with double strength . Of course , I must tell him exactly what I want , as I must describe my state of body to my doctor or my business tangle to my man-of-law . But , this done , I should feel sure that he will know best how my wants can be supplied . Of course , he is working for me , but so is my doctor , so is my lawyer . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theirs ; it is not a sign of folly , a confession of disgraceful ignorance , to defer to professional skill when they are concerned : the folly would be , and the ignorance and disgrace , did I try to doctor myself or to plead my own cause , or , after engaging some one more competent to do it for me , did I dictate to him , cavil at him , and hamper his hand at every turn . And by just so much as art is more subtile and , so to say , more professional than anything else , by just so much ought I to be most modest , most scrupulous , most trusting , when her ministrants are at work for me . But this , American Public , is exactly what'you do not say to yourself , except of very recent years , and in the very rarest instances . You do not see that it is just as foolish to refuse professional help in building as in law or medicine , and a great deal more selfish ; nor , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help him with half enough docility and trust . You must have your own say about his work , and your own share of credit if it succeeds . Truly , you own the result . But it belongs also to the artist and to the world at large , and their interests are quite as important as your own . The architect , it can not be said too often , works only when you give him the chance , and only as you permit . Just now our art is in a transition stage . This is a crucial time , when every effort is of such importance that you would be glad to escape from all responsibility , eager to shift it all upon the architect , if you were only a little less ignorant with regard to the depth of your own ig*orance . What you ought to know is that in any profession , and especially in so complicated a one as this , the weakest professional is likely to do better than the cleverest amateur . Whatever you want , then , go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a mason , or your own still more profound incompetence . Tell him all your practical , material desires , and insist that // they shall be respected . That is to say , if you are quite sure what they are , and quite certain that it is possible to respect them . This is by no means always the case . To be unsettled , vague , self contradictory , unpractical , impossible , is one of your most common faults , and one for the inevitable results of which you are only too apt to blame your architect . Scttle your practical desires and state them clearly ; and , if you will , pour out your vague aesthetic wishes ; try to explain those crude artistic preferences , those misty , formless visions which you are pleased to call " my own ideas . " But then go home , and leave him who is a trained artist , an experienced planner and constructor , to work out your problem in his own way . If what you get is exactly what you want , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit where credit is due . And if what you get is not quite all you want , or exactly what you think it ought to be , why , be thankful still ; for the chances are ( nay , the certainty is ) that , had you interfered , the result would have been more unsatisfactory still . This , then , American Public , is , as I conceive it , your duty in matters architectural . Or-for I must now confess that I have been playing the part of special pleader-this would be your duty , everywhere and always , and without possibility of doubt , if the architectural profession also recognized its duty clearly and was unanimously bent on its fulfilment . II . In turning now to you , The Profession , can it be said that you have no shortcomings ? Are there not many things in your attitude towards your client and towards your art which must be reformed , if you , if he , and if that ai't are to profit and to prosper as they should ? Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it trusts the legal or the medical profession . Bat are you sure that you deserve to be trusted to quite the same extent ? We are pretty certain that any lawyer or physician " in good standing " will do his very best for us . He may be stupid , but he is not likely to be uneducated , careless , or unfaithful . Theory would teach us to have the same confidence in you ; but does experience prove that we always can ? When we ask you and pay you to do a certain definite thing , can we feel confident that you will know how best to do it , and will do it as exactly as you can ? that you will not slight it in favor of more interesting // work , and will not can selessly alter it into something more like your own idea of what we ought to want ? Can we feel confident that , if the task is small and cheap , you will approach it as carefully as though it were large and costly , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will scrupulously respect the limitation , and scrupulously give us the most and the best you can within it ? Many men in other professions sin by making things cost more in the end than they said they would in the beginning ; but do they sin as frequently , frankly , and light-heartedly , or with as many specious maxims in excuse , as you ? Do not say that the conditions differ . Of course they do , and of course in your case they are singularly complex and difficult . But your responsibility is increased , not lessened , by the fact . If it is peculiarly hard for you to make your clients understand the difference between a desirable or necessary increase in cost and an increase which comes merely from wilfulness , carelessness , selfish ambition , or stupidity on your part , then it is peculiarly iieedful that you should never be careless or selfish or more stupid than poor mortality is sometimes allowed to be . If it is essential that your client should have more confidence in you than in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientious . You should work unusually hard to inspire that trust which to you , and to the general progress of your art , is so absolutely indispensable . And this I do not think that , as a profession viewed in the mass , you yet have done . I know that as a whole-as an Architectural Profession really worthy of the name , as something different from a mere body of building creatures-you are very young in America . Every one who cares for our art must recognize this fact , must see in your youth lusty strength , right ambition , and healthful promise ; must have followed your progress thus far with admiration , and must believe in your future . If you could hear all that is said about you by serious and critical observers , I am afraid you would grow conceited . You are by no means conceited now . Indeed , you hardly realize as yet what surprisingly good work you have done as compared , not with your fathers only , but with your rivals over sea . Yet with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I think such observers see that you have faults , and that they are faults of character rather than of artistic endowment . Now , faults of character do not greatly matter with // artists who paint or carve or even write , but with you they matter in the most vital way . An architect can not shut himself up in his closet . He must come in contact with the public both as artist and as man ; the public must trust him , while it need only weigh the poet and the painter after the act ; and their product it may take or leave , while it is obliged to keep whatever you bestow . Therefore it is that , as men and artists , you must set yourselves a lofty standard . You must respect yourselves , respect each other , respect your client , and respect your art ( each for its own sake and always all together ) , if you have any hope that the public will do the same . Let me hasten to say that there are some among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who come pretty near to being models of all an architect should be . That is ,  --  for I want to explain myself quite clearly ,  --  they have prepared themselves in a thorough , all-round way to deserve the professional title ; they think in the first place of their art and what it demands of them , in the second place of their client and his inalienable rights , and only in the third place of themselves ; and in thinking of themselves it is still for art they care more than for pecuniary profit . To do all this means much labor and constant self - abuegation . But they know that they are artists , and if they did not mean to do it all , ought they to pretend to the artist 's name or standing or reward ? Does this look like a fancy picture in your eyes , American Public ? It is a faithful portrait , drawn from more than one original . As a picture of the whole profession it would , indeed , be flattered ; yet it ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , until some distinct approach is made to the qualities it exhibits , the profession as a whole will never win the position it should , the public as a whole will never take the attitude it ought , and our art as a whole will never have the best chance of development . I may quote again , as a summing-up , from the letter already cited . It was written hastily for private reading , not as a formal confession of faith , but is , therefore , all the more significant . " I have never spoken to you on the subject of the responsibility of my profession in this new country , where we have to create its status , but I feel its importance most keenly . The public must first learn to trust us as it does doctors or lawyers , before architecture can develop into a great art .... Therefore , every architect , no matter what his genius , who shows any lack of conscience or devotion to the responsibility his client has laid upon him , does more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his creation can counterbalance .... Tam proud of the men // in my office . Thus far they have been but average fellows , but all seem quickly to feel the responsibility and dignity of their profession , and learn to accept the self-restraint and sacrifice it entails ... , Of myself I may say that I have never yet had a chance to do anything great , but I have been patiently fitting myself for that opportunity ( should it ever come ) by trying my best and uttermost on everything , no matter how unimportant it may be ; and I do not really think that anything has ever passed through the hands of our firm that greater care could at the time have improved . " Is not this , in truth , the heart of the matter-loyal trust on the client 's part , loyal service on the architect 's ? When we say that the architect should think first of his art , do we not mean that he should prove that some kind of art may result from the faithful solution of the given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a kind easier of production , by wilfully altering the problem ? If he reveres his art , and wishes to make the public revere it , he should never doubt of its capacity . And if he is sure that in the given problem his capacity can not keep touch with the capacity of art , then , as an artist , he has no right to meddle with it-whatever he might decide to do as a mere money-making man . III- Which , now , will be more in fault , public or profession , if there does not soon grow up that happy accord upon which the future of our art depends ? If loyal trust is not the rule , and does not always meet with loyal service , where chiefly rests the responsibility of developing a better state of things ? Chiefly , I think , upon the public ; and for several reasons . In the first place , it is the public which in each given case must take the initiative . The architect can not choose his client ; the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault if today he does not choose a good one . Then , in the second place , the profession , with all its faults , has certainly gone further than the public on the road to ideal excellence . The great advance it has made in recent years towards loyal service-which means , be it remembered , both competent and conscientious service-has been due to its own right instincts . The public has never asked that its architects should fit themselvei* better for their work than they did in former years ; nor when they have thus fitted themselves is it properly conscious of the fact or properly grateful for it . Do we clearly see the kind and degree of difference which marks off our good buildings from our bad ones ? IDo we so in* // telligently , so persistently , encourage trained ability that untrained incompetence need feel greatly discouraged ? Nor are we more careful to foster professional honor and frankness than to foster true art . That system of competitions which has been supposed the best aid to art and the best protection for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unpaid competitions are an abomination . It is folly , and something worse , to ask the members of a respectable profession to show us their ideas for nothing , and to expect to get their best ideas or the ideas of the best among them . Limited , paid com* petitions , where certain chosen artists are asked to submit schemes for comparison , and are promised a fair reward for their trouble , should stand on a different footing . But they are often managed with so total a lack of respect on the client 's part , not only for art , but for mere labor , and so total a disregard for the precepts of business good-faith and common honesty , that they , too , have become a by-word and reproach . I can not dwell upon this thorny subject here ; those who care to pursue it may take a tile of the American Archileci and Building News and look up the references under the index heading " Competition . " Let me only beg of my reader that , whether he be architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unpaid competition ; that , if as a client he shares in the management of a paid one , he will keep the Eighth and Ninth Commandments-will mean what he says and say what he means and stand honestly by his meanings and sayings , and will not try to get something for nothing , or more than he asked for the price he agreed to pay ; and that , if as an architect he takes part in such an enterprise , he will try not to break the Tenth Commandment in deed , or word , or thought . But a competition is a make-shift thing at best . In the majority of cases an architect should be chosen in the same way as any other professional adviser . It is easy to discover his standing among members of his own profession , easy to estimate his past results , and easy to draw conclusions from the effect he produces upon you as a man . Or , if all this is not always easy , it is not as hard or as risky as to judge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . Of course , it is more difficult to make sure in advance of conscientiousness than of capacity . But , as a general rule ( which is not , perhaps , without exceptions ) , capacity implies at least artistic conscien // tiousness , for it means thorough preparatory training ; and such training means right ambitions , since no strong external pressure has enforced it . The subject of architectural drawings is too important to be passed over with a word . Much of our trouble in the past has come because the public does not understand that it takes an architect 's eye , or , at least , an experienced eye , to read an architectural drawing rightly . At its best it is a conventionalized thing ; at its worst it is about as mendacious a thing as one could find . The effects a novice admires most on paper are often the very ones he will not notice or will not admire in the building . The points which on paper seem least important are often those which will tell most strongly in brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective can not easily be understood ; and a plan , a section , an elevation , are not pictures at all , but signs and symbols , which the novice often misconceives most entirely just when he thinks he has unravelled every knot . It should be a maxim , therefore , that never in competitions of any kind should judgment be pronounced without the taking of expert testimony . The interests of the client and those of the architect both demand that some competent artist , not himself concerned in the matter , should be asked  --  and paid  --  to explain the submitted designs . Even apart from competitions , the public 's conduct is not what it should be to encourage loyal service . Often enough in all his dealings the client shows a disregard for truth , honesty , and busiuess methods which he would find very shocking were the architect the sinner and he the sufferer . * And when the work is complete , he constantly takes credit for good ideas which do not belong to him , blames his architect for defects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all , cries out against an excess in cost that has been necessitated by changes from the original scheme which he himself has suggested . Finally , our building customs are not yet arranged on a genuine business basis , and this is chiefly the fault of the public . With the best will in the world , a client rarely knows what he has * See , again , the files of the American Architect and BuildinG News , and especially the issues for January 16 and February 6 , 1886 , where there is an instructive account of a case of Architect vs. client . it was pleaded in a New York court , the damages asked were heavy , the defendants were the building committee of a prominent club , and the verdict was given for the plaintiff . // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . a right to expect from his architect in the way of executive service , and almost always expects too much . " Superintendence " is a bone of contention between them , and will so remain until the public realizes all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and science , and is willing to pay a fairer price than at present for its proper execution . * In short , the American architect has less reason to trust the American public implicitly than the public has to put confidence in him . Therefore upon the client even more than upon the architect  --  and yet upon him , too , in no inconsiderable measurelies at this moment the responsibility of improving our condition in matters architectural . If we are to have that reciprocal loyalty in trust and service from which alone can grow a healthy , prolific , and truly national art , the public must learn to bear itself as intelligently and honorably as the profession does to-day , and thus encourage the profession to still greater conscientiousness.
