txt Not since the Congress met has the prospect for the unconditional repeal of the silver-purchasing clause of the Sherman act been better than it has looked to-day . Hour by hour the conviction is becoming stronger among members of both houses that the repeal must come , and even men who have been counted upon as strong free coinage men , quite free from the influence , however , of the silver producers , are yielding their natural preferences and the determination with which they came here , to the universal demand that the efficacy of the repeal to restore confidence to business circles shall be tried . The fight is not over , but the cause of sound money is prospering . There has been no doubt at any time that the House would pass the Wilson bill . The canvass of the House shows that there will be a large majority for it , and the supporters of the bill are greater in number than they were when the measure was introduced . The House teat will be on Monday , Aug. 28 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voting will begin on the substitute and on the various amendments offered for a change of ratio . There is no disposition manifested by the silver man to delay after the voting point has been reached . They will not resort to filibustering , but will rest entirely upon the inclination of the House to indicate what is to be the form of the law to be passed . Three days it is estimated , will be all that will be required to get through with the voting . It may be over in less time . Then , with the bill sent to the Senate . the House will rest , so that the country may devote itself to studying , without any sort of diversion by the House , the progress of relief legislation in the Senate . There will be no other business transacted . As the House can not adjourn for more than three days without the concurrence of the Senate , it will adjourn for three-day periods , and the Representatives can , if they like , go over to the Senate and hear their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been applied to Democrate of the Senate for lack of interest and activity in helping out the Administration , and some of it has been made unadvisedly . From sources that are trustworthy it is learned that the Administration does not consider itself " betrayed . " nor has it placed reliance upon Senators who have abandoned the Administration cause and threatened the purposes of the Administration iu Congress . There has been much work to be done ; it had to be conducted with skill and care , and it has been prosecuted with so much of both that success has been won where there was reason to look for failure . A Senator who has been somewhat in doubt about the outcome said this afternoon that he was now confident that the repeal bill would be brought to a vote . without unnecessary delay , and that the bill would pass in about the shape in which it will come from the House . Of course this is disputed by the silver State Senators , the Republicans who ha% a insisted that they will keep the Congress here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who declare that they will find speakers to discuss silver eternally , to keep oft ' the vote . But that may prove to be an empty menace . Possibly the silver Senators intend to try it , but , if there is a majority for repeal . the majority may rind a way to get to a vote . At all events , they will try . When the time comes to lock with three or four or six unconditional free-coinage men it may be that the small fraction of the members will find it impossible to obstruct the passage of the bill advocated by the majority and insisted upon by the country . Mr. Bryan 's brilliant speech of yesterday is praised to-day for its interest and as an oratorical effort , but some of those who enjoyed the pleasure of listening to it as it flowed from the lips of the gifted orator are to-day reading it in the Record to criticise it for its sophistries . Some of those who cried " Vote ! " when he closed , and who thought that the last thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be instructed , and when they vote it will be to overlook all the special pleading for the double standard . There will be some striking speeches on the other side during the week . Dr. William Everett will speak on the question in a day or two , and then will come W. C. P. Breckenridge , Mr. Cochran , Mr. Fellows , and others , who will keop alive the interest on the silver question which Bryan has undoubtedly stimulated . Canvasses of the Senate just now are not to be relied upon . There are , of course , members of that body whose attitude is so well known that it is possible to put them down as for repeal , or for free coinage , or for a new ratio if they can have free coinage on terms of compromise . But beyond that , it may be shown when the vote comes to be taken that there are men now supposed to be against unconditional repeal who will think better of that question and conclude that at this time affirmative legislation for silver is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperative . Some of the Senators who have declined to tell how they will vote , and who are resending the daily inquiries of uninformed men , are just as likely to be found with the supporters of repeal as they are with the free-coinage men . They are not impervious to public opinion , and they know that a wrong vote may involve the party in ruin that will reduce them to the rank of ordinary mortals , and they like ' the taste of power too well to throw it recklessly away .
