LEGISLATIVE SHORTCOMINGS . THE Congress of the United States and six state legislatures meet every year ; the sessions of thirty-nine legislatures are biennial . The meeting of any of these bodies is awaited by many sensible and intelligent citizens with uneasiness and even with alarm , and final adjournment is generally welcomed as a relief from serious anxiety . That our legislatures , state and national , do their work unsatisfactorily no one thinks of disputing . The conservative capitalist and the socialist may not agree in the details of their criticism , but they are quite at one in the severity of their censure . Newspapers and magazines are filled with vigorous denunciation of Senators and Representatives , and voters are rather vaguely exhorted to improve matters by a wiser choice of legislators . Even if the universal dissatisfaction be somewhat excessive , it has a substantial basis . Our legislative shortcomings are worthy of serious study , and yet , notwithstanding all the severe criticism spoken and written , unimpassioned and precise study of these shortcomings is rare . The critics seldom have any experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often forget that they are open to criticism . I hope I shall not be thought presumptuous if I give , for what it is worth , the result of two years ' experience in the Massachusetts House of Representatives . Compared with others , this legislative body holds a position at least respectable , but the complaints made of it are the same in kind , though in degree they may not be so severe , as those relating to the legislatures of other States . Local conditions and traditions doubtless have their effect in making one legislature differ somewhat from another , but throughout the North , and to a less extent even in the South , the problems and difficulties of legislation are much the same . If the average man be asked why a session of the legislature is dreaded by many intelligent persons , he will answer that the quality of the individual legislators is poor , and that few of them are men of good standing in their several communities . This statement he will hold to be obviously true beyond the possibility of doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , machine politicians of small capacity and doubtful honesty , actuated mainly by party spirit and personal ambition , - men who are but little trusted by their neighbors in the other affairs of life . To prove positively the unsoundness of this common opinion is impossible , of course , for respectability , reputation , and good standing in the community are largely matters of opinion . I can only say that I believe the members of the Massachusetts House , as individuals apart from their office , to be much better men than their critics suppose . A House of two hundred and forty members must always contain some men who are not honest , reputable , or intelligent ; but the better the members are known as individuals , the more plainly does it appear that the great majority of them are altogether respectable and well intentioned , and that many of them are men who in their several communities are actually chosen , and chosen naturally and properly , to fill important positions of private and corporate trust . Considering human nature , it is rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is made by the country districts , where the population is stable , and where the average income is so small that the legislative salary makes a desirable addition to it . In the cities , and especially in the larger cities , men of the widest and most successful experience in business seldom find time for legislative 366 // service ; but even in cities the Representatives are usually men of some acquaintance with affairs , whose principal desire , when elected , is to do that which is right and for the public interest . These statements may be strenuously controverted , but I can say that experience has converted me from the opposite belief . Again , these Representatives are not often guided by party spirit . Undoubtedly party spirit exists , and it affects , sometimes legitimately , sometimes quite improperly , the course of legislation ; its effect on legislation in Massachusetts , however , is comparatively small . In only thirteen roll-calls out of one hundred and four taken in 1895 , and in only seven out of forty-nine taken in 1896 , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases they were not drawn with absolute strictness . If most of the Representatives , as individuals , are men of good character , of experience in business , intelligent , well intentioned , and not unduly partisan , it may be asked in what good quality they are lacking , and why their meeting is an occasion of common apprehension . Though they are generally most respectable individuals , they are almost wholly without special fitness for the work of legislation . Iii the average legislature there can be found hardly a man who has ever given such consideration to the study of any legislative question that lie has become expert in its treatment . The legislature is composed almost or quite altogether of men without serious legislative experience . As soon as a rural legislative district is established in Massachusetts by the decennial apportionment , its Representative convention assigns to the towns composing it , sometimes six or eight in number , the years in which each town is permitted to select the Representative . Locality alone is considered . When the turn of a town arrives , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor , by the voters of the other towns . The retiring membcr may be clearly the most competent man in the whole district : his superior qualifications are not even mentioned , and his experience , painfully acquired during four or five months , is unhesitatingly thrown away . If his town is somewliat larger or if his constituency is urban , a second term will probably be assigned to him almost as of right , but two terms are supposed to satisfy the political appetite of any reasonable man . For one change in representation caused by change in the politics of a constituencyor by disapproval of a Representative 's course , there are five changes caused by the principle of rotation in office without other reason whatsoever . If the rolls of the House in 1889 and 1896 be compared , an illustration taken quite at random , but four names will be found common to both , and of these four members two did not serve in any intermediate legislature ; no one of the four served continuously . A few constituencies disregard this two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature , but the habit of change is so deeply ingrained that even the clearest demonstration of its injury is quite unavailing . Public office is still regarded as a personal distinction rather than as a means of public service . In this respect there has lately been in Massachusetts a very slight improvement . Nearly all our state Senators have served a year or two in the House before entering the Senate , and the experience thus acquired , as well as the smallness of the Senate , makes it a much more businesslike body than the House , and one which wastes much less time . In some other States the want of legislative experience is even greater than here ; in some the rei*lection of Representatives may be a little more usual . This constant change makes impossible a legislative career such as may be followed in most European legislatures , and in a less degree even in the Congress of the United States . The requlrements of training and experience would seem to be as imperative for useful legislation as // for the successful practice of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned , legislation is shaped by men without any special equipment worth mentioning . Rotation in office makes a legislative expert almost an impossibility . As no lawyer or physician would ever submit to a professional education if he were allowed to practice his profession but for a year or two in the course of his life , so no man will undertake serious legislative study if his knowledge , the result of his faithful and long-continued hjbor , can be made profitable but for a few months . Even if a man were found , ready to give years of study for so scanty a return of usefulness , he would be denied the opportunity of sufficient legislative practice , without which his study would probably be misleading . Try to imagine for a moment the effect upon the community of compelling all physicians , merchants , and manufacturers to retire from business after an experience of only a year or two . When the Massachusetts House meets , composed , as I have said , of men who fairly represent the intelligence and business capacity of the communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative education and experience , it has no defined legislative programme , partisan or otherwise . The individual member generally has two objects in view . The first object is to secure the passage , or more rarely the defeat , of some legislative measure of only local importance , - a measure in which his constituents or friends may be deeply concerned , though it is of very slight importance to the commonwealth at large . Occasionally , but not often , this measure is an iniquitous job . Usually the member has no pecuniary interest in it , and often it is little more than a matter of legislative routine . Even when it is unwise , it is frequently nothing worse than a piece of foolish legislative fussiness ; or perhaps it was devised to meet some local demand , and Legislative Shortcomings . is objectionable only because of the bad precedent it establishes ; such , for example , as acts to enable a particular town to subsidize a steamboat or a variety show for the convenience or amusement of its summer visitors . Statutes like these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole population of the towns in question . If the member 's pet measure is not a local matter , but an act of general importance , he runs the risk of being deemed a crank . If he should strenuously seek the passage of several measures , really important , he would be thought wholly devoid of common sense , and his influence would soon disappear . Such a man is sometimes found in the House , but his fellow members agree in thinking that his rarity is a blessing . As will be explained presently , they know that important legislation has no chance of passage , and they grudge the time given to its consideration . The second object which the average member of the legislature proposes to himself is a fair and impartial vote upon the measures submitted to him , in which he has no particular interest and concerning which he has no peculiar knowledge ; in this category he would modestly put at least nineteen measures out of twenty that come before the House . He wishes first to pass his own pet measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fellow members , after giving them an impartial hearing . Now , a member of the House who does not aspire to be a leader knows that so long as he does not err exceptionally and grievously concerning the great mass of legislation submitted to him , his record will be judged mainly by his success in passing the one or more bills in which his constituents or friends are especially interested . To succeed here will redound greatly to his credit ; to vote wrong occasionally upon measures of general interest will impair that credit but slightly , - at any rate , if the vote is quietly and unobtrusively given . // His reputation must be merely local , and local reputation , in most cases , is determined by the member 's attitude toward local measures . Hence his sense of responsibility is much stronger regarding some local measure which is unimportant to the general public than it is concerning measures which are generally important . This may be illustrated by a story from experience . A rural district returned to a certain legislature a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - a man who would naturally be trusted in the ordinary affairs of his neighborhood . The only thing his constituents cared for was a local bill in which he had no direct pecuniary interest . In order to secure votes for his pet bill , he was willing to trade his own vote on almost any other measure , important or unimportant , that came before the legislature , and consequently he was a bad legislator . The badness of his record , however , was caused , not by his bad character as an individual , but by his regard for the wishes of his constituents . Had he refused to trade his vote , his constituents , without regard to party or condition , would probably have deemed him faithless to his principal duty ; had he succeeded in passing his bill , they would cheerfully have pardoned , if indeed they had noticed , his aberrations concerning every measure of real importance which came before the legislature . This is an extreme case , but in a somewhat milder form trading is common and almost universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct pecuniary corruption . The temptation to trade is much more insidious than the temptation to take a bribe . The line between bribery and pecuniary honesty is pretty clearly defined , - no man can well be bribed without knowing it ; but the line between legitimate compromise and pernicious log-rolling can not be drawn with any sharpness . Moreover , bribery is condemned by the common judgment of every one ; trading is not . In spite of frequent trading and occasional venality , however , the average member of the House does try to pass fairly upon most questions submitted to him ; but his attitude , both in committee and in the House , is distinctly that of a juryman . He does not try to carry out any programme drawn up by the party leaders or determined by his own individual opinions , he does not seek to initiate serious legislation ; he sits to hear the petitioners that come before him , to effect a compromise , if possible , in matters of dispute , and in the last resort to decide the case on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the average member of the House , but even of those who may fairly be taken as its leaders . Even a leader , but slightly aided by party discipline , having no recognized position like that of a cabinet minister , and exposed to the jealousy of his fellow members , which is heedless and irritating , though it is seldom malicious , soon comes to consider that his chief duty is to stop legislation which is positively bad rather than to secure that which is positively good . If a proposed measure be unopposed , it is passed , of course , without serious difficulty . The bill is prepared outside the legislature , presented to it , and referred to the appropriate committee . TIme petitioners make out a strong case , and succeed in giving the committee an inkling of what they desire . There are no remonstrants , the committee 's report is favorable , and , as there is no opposition whatever , it is accepted by the House . A controversial measure has quite another fate . The system of land transfer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Australian or Torrens system was suggested as an advantageous substitute . Obviously the matter was too difficult for the unaided intelligence of the legislature , and so it was referred to a commission . The commission presented two reports , differVOL . LXXIX. - NO. 473. 24 // ingconsiderably in detail , but both recoinmending a change in the existing system . These reports were duly referred to the Committee on the Judiciary , which is composed of lawyers , and is more nearly a body of experts than any other committee of the legislature . Most of its members were ready for a change in the law , but all thought the changes proposed by the commission too sweeping . Time was needed to draft a new bill , and time was the one thing wanting . A hundred and twenty matters , or thereabouts , had been referred to the committee , on almost all of which a public hearing must be given . Some of these were matters of mere routine , such as the ratification of acts of justices of the peace and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others were measures which had been rejected over and over again by preceding legislatures , and had not the slightest chance of passage . Others were frivolous . In all cases , however , the petitioners had the right to a hearing , - a right as sacred as that of a suitor to a hearing before a court of law , - and a hundred and twenty public hearings take time . Hoping for a little leisure , the overworked committee postponed the consideration of land transfer until careless justices and stupid town officers had been furnished with the desired legislation . Reports on all matters referred to the committee had then become due under the rules of the House , and , confessing its impotence , the committee had to recommend the reference of the proposed changes to the next legislature . In that next legislature the subject came up again , and for the same reason met the same fate . Thus an important measure was refused serious consideration , not because the House was hostile , not because its members were venal partisans , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representative with leisure for serious study . Sometinies , of course , an important measure does pass . The Bay State Gas Company desired a charter to sell gas throughout the commonwealth unhampered by municipal boundaries ; if allowed to do this , it promised to give consumers cheap gas . The measure , though in form a private bill , was probably more important to the general public than any other measure brought before the legislature of 1896 . The petitioners , like the plaintiff in a suit at law , asked for more than they hoped to obtain . Their proposed bill was referred to the appropriate committee . Before the committee appeared several able gentlemen , leaders of the two great political parties , retained at a great price to argue on behalf of the petitioners , in the hope that the political standing of the advocates would add weight to their arguments . It must not be supposed that these gentlemen were expected to corrupt members of the legislature , - nothing of the kind ; bribery , if practiced at all , was practiced by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be doubted if good legislation is helped by the paid employment in behalf of a given measure not only of learning and forensic ability , but also of the influence naturally carried by a great name . After the petitioners ' case was in , the established gas companies , as remonstrants , took their turn , being also represented by distinguished politicians . The committee was perplexed . All admitted that the petitioners asked too much ; nearly all were for giving them something by way of compromise , in the honest desire of securing to the community the benefits of cheap gas . No member of the committee had any particular knowledge of the subject , and an unprejudiced expert is nearly as unobtainable by a legislature as by a jury . Had the Gas Commission , for example , in the excited condition of public feeling , given an opinion for or against the bill , its influence would have been seriously impaired for years . Sorely perplexed , // the committee reported to the House a bill so much less generous than the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it doubtless seemed moderate . In fact , it gave many extraordinary privileges . The same spirit of compromise existed in the legislature . The petitioners had purchased the support of many newspapers throughout the State , and thus had impressed the members with the unportance and desirability of cheap gas . The committee 's bill was conceded to be too liberal , and its provisions were much modified by amendments . Thus a third edition of the bill was prepared , a curious piece of haphazard patchwork , the result of the well-meant efforts of a dozen or twenty different men , working without any reference to one another , in great haste and without any particular knowledge of the matter in hand . This third edition passed the legislature by a large majority , though probably no one , with the possible exception of the petitioners ' attorneys , knew precisely what its provisions meant . It was vetoed by the governor , who , in his message , explained at considerable length his reasons for thinking that the bill granted too much . The veto was sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious parliamentary device which it is needless to explain , had provided themselves with another bill in reserve , and this they put into a shape to satisfy the governor 's objections . The bill so amended is now the law . Thus there were four editions of the bill , each of which differed greatly from all the others , the last three being the results of three successful compromises hastily and clumsily prepared by hardworked men , well intentioned , but without any special training or knowledge . The community was disturbed by extravagant stories of bribery and corruption used to secure the passage of the measure even in its last form , and in the newspapers and on the streets there was talk of the degradation of the legislature and of the bad character of its individual members . It might be too much to assert that in no case was brib*ry resorLed to in order to secure the passage of this bill , but the stories of corruption were at any rate grossly overdrawn , and the bill was supported chiefly by men who desired to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right when they patched up a compromise , which they did not quite understand , between the extreme demands of the petitioners and the selfish opposition of the existing gas companies . It has been said that exaggerated stories of bribery are often believed by the public , and , it must be added , by not a few Representatives themselves . One cause of the belief is this : It is admitted to be wrong to pay a member for his vote , but it is not admitted to be wrong to pay his friend , patron , or employer for getting his vote . Men are hired whose influence , personal , political , or social , is supposed to control certain members of the House . In some cases , doubtless , these men act as go-betweens , and pay directly for the votes which they procure ; but much more frequently the vote is procured by persuasion , coaxing , an appeal to friendship , or a threat of unpleasant consequences . The Representative is often free from any taint of dishonesty , and may not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cajole him . If the agent succeeds , it is believed by the public that bribery has been committed ; if he fails to secure the vote he is supposed to control , he not uncommonly excuses his want of success to his employer by asserting , quite untruly , that the Representative has been bribed by the other side . The gas bill was probably the most important act passed by the Massachusetts legislature in the session of 1896 . Had it been the most important measure of a session of the British Parliament , its course would have been very different . First it would have been studied in detail by experts in the employ of the government . These experts , being prac // tically anonymous , and not open to personal attack or to cross - examination , would have given an opinion both intelligent and impartial ; under their advice , a consistent scheme would have been framed and put into a carefully drafted bill , to pass which , after it had been further discussed and perfected in cabinet meeting , the whole power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have involved the immediate overthrow of the existing administration , and any amendment permitted would first have been carefully scrutinized by the government and its experts . Party feeling , which influences the House of Commons much more than the Massachusetts House of Representatives , undoubtedly increases the sense of responsibility , and , in consequence , the chance of passing carefully prepared and consistent measures of considerable legislative ilnportance . Another serious shortcoming of the legislature deserves notice . It is charged that some members levy blackmail upon corporations by threatening to introduce measures injurious to the corporations in question ; as , for example , bills to reduce railroad fares , to enlarge the liability of employers for the injuries of their workmen , to enable municipalities to undertake certain kinds of work now done by private corporations , and so forth . We need not consider whether the measures thus proposed are good or bad ; if they are good , it is most objectionable to withdraw them upon payment of money , or to threaten their introduction if this payment is not forthcoming . That blackmail is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the legislature can doubt , but the inference often drawn - that a large number of the members are corrupt or ill disposed - I believe to be without foundation . The fault is in the system rather than in the men . Let us suppose that the threat has been made , and that the required payment has been refused , either on moral or on economical grounds . The bill is introduced , apparently , to meet a public demand . This may easily be simulated , or it may really exist , even though the measure proposed be unwise or unfair , inasmuch as the public is not always altogether well informed and reasonable . The bill , when introduced , is referred , under the rules , to a committee , and it lies in the committee 's docket for a month or six weeks , a constant if not a very serious menace . The day for the public hearing arrives . If the introducer of the measure is tired of the game , he can withdraw at the last moment without cost or inconvenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hiring cowsel and summoning witnesses , - an expense not infrequently greater than the blackmail originally demanded . If the blackmailer decides to go on , he can generally find persons , not always dishonest , to appear in support of his bill . Some hours of the committee 's time are spent in the hearing or hearings . If the public demand is real , though unreasonable , one or more weak but well - intentioned members of the committee may sometimes be persuaded to sign a minority report in favor of the bill , and occasionally the introducer has a personal friend on the committee who is willing to humor him ; but the committee 's report is almost invariably against the blackmailing scheme , and that report is usually unanimous . The blackmailer 's game is not yet up . The question before the House is the acceptance of the adverse report of the committee . The blackmailer asks for delay ; he offers a compromise measure , or he appeals to the House as a whole and to its members individually to reject the committee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if they please , they may vote it down afterwards . The good nature of the House seems at times its most dangerous vice , particularly in the early part of the // session , when time is abundant . The blackmailer is an unknown man , often plausible , appealing to an inexperienced stranger . He tells the new member that he will amend the bill to meet all objections , and he threatens vengeance upon the new member 's pet measure if the latter does not vote with him this once . It has been explained already that this pet measure is often the one desire of the new member 's constituents . His sense of responsibility for it is great ; his sense of responsibility regarding the blackmailer 's bill is slight , there is no party discipline to steady him , and lie votes with the blackmailer just once , intending to vote against him on the next stage of the same bill . The blackmailing measure is thus substituted for the adverse report of the committee ; the corporation becomes frightened , and either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat a bill which would have died of itself at the next stage . Thus the corporation finds the expense of defeating a bill once introduced to be greater than that of buying its introducer in the first place ; its officers grow cynical , think most Representatives corrupt , and at the next session may seek to bribe instead of waiting to be blackmailed . The blackmailer has the best chance of success if he introduces a bill which can be supported by honest and serious arguments . In this case , he may gain the votes of men not only well meaning , but intelligent . Occasionally , there can be little doubt , the best members of the House are led to vote against a bill which ought to pass , because they believe it was introduced to get money out of a rich corporation . The case of blackmail shows the legislature at its worst , yet the cause of the evil is neither the dishonesty nor even the extreme stupidity of the average member . Until the committee reports , the blackmailer needs no help beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a rule which appears founded in justice , though in practice it is the cause of much delay and of no little harm . Even during the action of the House , the blackmailer 's strength comes from the good nature of his colleagues , from their want of discipline , and from their inexperience , rather than from their low character as citizens or as individual members of the community . If it be said that the origin of the whole trouble is the presence in the House of even a few dishonest members , it must be answered that no considerable legislative body which ever existed in the world has long been without some members open to bribery . Certain recent trials have shown that more than one member of the House of Commons , if he did not take money for his votes as a member of the House , was restrained from doing so by want of opportunity rather than by lack of inclination . Again , it may be asked if the blackmailer is not soon found out , and if he does not thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost always found out by the end of the session , but if he has the good fortune to be reelected to the next legislature , he finds a hundred and twenty new members who have never heard of him in the course of their lives . It has already been pointed out that our legislative system makes it very difficult to pass any considerable measure of controversial legislation . Important matters , like the regulation of the hours of labor , are never treated in the legislature as settled , even for a period of years . The existing law is always a temporary compromise , hastily patched up in the legislature , - a short step , to be followed as soon as possible by another . So much is this the case that no sensible man expects to accomplish serious controversial legislation except by piecemeal . This condition of affairs has two evils it keeps the community in constant unrest ; and , as each fragment of legislation takes nearly as much time as // should the passage of a comprehensive measure , sessions are lengthened to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , nearly everybody believes that the system of taxation in Massachusetts is antiquated and inefficient , and needs a complete remodeling ; some men think that sufficient provision should be made for enforcing the existing laws , while others believe these laws to be so barbarous that they should be done away with at once ; yet a quarter of a century 's constant agitation , which has in the aggregate taken up months and perhaps years of legislative time , has resulted only in the passage of two or three bits of piecemeal legislation , which , whether wise or foolish , have at any rate made the existing law more complicated and contradictory than before . There is very little hope that any comprehensive system can be established except by a long process of attrition , which must consume an incalculable amount of legislative time . What has been said goes to show that the shortcomings of the House are caused not so much by the poor quality of its members as individual men , as by their inexperience , their weak sense of responsibility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rotation in office is the chief cause of their inexperience . The cause of their want of responsibility is to be found largely in the principles of our Constitutions , State and Federal , which so divide power among the executive , legislative , and judicial departments of the government that no one department is altogether responsible for any considerable part of its own acts . In these circumstances , it is clear that , even if the average quality of our legislators shall be improved , no great improvement in legislation can be expected so long as our system remains unchanged ; and hence it follows that moral exhortation to choose better Representatives is not likely to do much good . To effect a remedy , we must change principles rather than men . The principle of rotation in office is not an essential part of the American system of government , and can be abandoned without constitutional or legislative change if the voters of any constituency desire . Until it is abandoned as a principle , legislative improvement seems to me out of the question . The theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , is the theory that in the conduct of public affairs experience is valueless . Doubtless there is something to be said for rotation , or it would never have been practiced . Other things being equal , a community may be benefited by giving to a considerable number of its citizens some knowledge of its affairs ; but when the knowledge thus given is never utilized , and when none but prentice hands are allowed to frame our laws , rotation is reduced to an absurdity . It is at once irritating , pathetic , and ridiculous to see a constituency composed of six or eight small rural communities discard the services of a Representative who has just begun to be useful , because the rule of rotation requires that no community in the district shall have a Representative two years in succession . It is obvious that men should be chosen for public office , not because they are rich or poor , not because they live in one place or in another , not because they deserve distinction , not because they are respectable or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public better than any one else . Even if this were the received theory of our government , we might still be far removed from a satisfactory practice , . but the American people have not yet learned wisdom even in theory . The limitation of legislative authority , unlike the principle of rotation in office , is the very foundation of the government of the United States . To guard individuals against the tyranny of the majority , the Federal Constitution , followed by // the Constitutions of most of the States , puts it out of the power of any majority , short of practical unanimity , to abridge certain rights of the citizen . Legislatively speaking , the Parliament of Great Britain is omnipotent , and therefore it has a strong sense of responsibility . The ministry of the day , practically a committee of the House of Commons , has , so long as it enjoys the confidence of that House , all the power of the executive . Legislatively speaking , the Congress of the United States and the legislatures of the several States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore their sense of responsibility is comparatively slight . They have no executive authority . For centuries the political development of Great Britain has tended to the concentration of power and responsibility in the House of Commons and in the ministry which is its committee . The development of the United States , in the century or more of its existence , has tended to protect the rights of individuals ; that is to say , to prevent the concentration of power in any man or body of men . As the power of our legislatures is limited , so is their responsibility . Viewing them merely as effective machines for passing laws , we can not expect that Congress or a state legislature will ever equal the House of Commons ; and even the House of Commons seems to be losing something of its efficiency . This is not to say that the English Constitution is preferable to our own . I believe that ours , protecting individual rights as it does , is the safer and better of the two , but a weakened sense of responsibility is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , however , we recognize clearly the nature and the causes of our legislative shortcomings , we shall have taken the first step to lessen them . Experience in our legislators we can secure if we will , and this will accomplish something . At the beginning of the session a legislature is now much like a crowd , quiet and well disposed , but unorganized and undisciplined ; the members sometimes too distrustful of one another , sometimes too confiding . A minority , even a small minority , of men familiar not only with parliamentary rules , but with the course of legislation , will give to this body from the beginning an organization and a cohesion which it now lacks . If sixty members have already come to know one another 's strength and weakness by the experience of several years , the remaining one hundred and eighty become more easily acquainted , and the plausible rogue , in the legislature and out of it , will not so readily deceive the new-coiner , and get from him pledges which afterwards he may bitterly regret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now wasted in every session by the discussion of measures which have no chance of passage . If it were understood that an important measure once passed or rejected was safe from attack or from premature resurrection for five years at least , the saving of time would be enormous . This conservatism would not delay wise reforms , but rather hasten them ; for , as has been shown , they are now defeated by the pressure of routine . One piece of useful general legislation discussed , put into proper shape , and passed within a year is more valuable than ten plans for legislation discussed and either rejected or botched within the same time . If a few men , not necessarily very brilliant , but sensible citizens with some leisure , men not unlike many members of our recent legislatures , can be induced to make legislative service their career or a part of their career , the prospect of serious and consistent legislation will be greatly improved . These men can then make practical legislation a study , and their value to the commonwealth will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a matter which can not even be understood without legislative experience , would also accomplish something . Gen // eral laws might be framed , if we had experienced legislators to frame them , which should avoid the necessity of many of our special acts , and thus save time for real legislation . The statutes might be made more comprehensive and put into more systematic form . The drafting of bills , at present so awkward and defective , generally the work of a man otherwise overtaxed , who has had no training in legislative or even in literary expression , should be entrusted to a highly paid permanent expert with a sufficient force of competent clerks . Ten thousand dollars a year spent in salaries would probably save five times the amount , now spent in litigation . In this matter the Massachusetts House of Representatives has made a beginning which it is to be hoped will have satisfactory development . Again , the law which requires a Representative to reside in the district which he represents has lost whatever reason it may have had in former times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a unit in most matters politic , sent up one of its citizens to the General Court has passed by forever . Nearly all representative districts are without other political unity , and even this unity is broken up by the decennial apportionment . Each district is either a congeries of small towns , or a fragment of a city , or sometimes such a fragment tacked to one or more towns for the sake of partisan advantage . If the voters of these constituencies deliberately prefer to be represented by some one who does not live among them , there is no reason why they should not have their way , and their local jealousy can be trusted to get its proper influence without being strengthened by positive law . If a seat in the legislature should be looked on as a sort of reward of merit , an honorary distinction conferred upon an individual or upon a community , the democratic spirit may require that the coveted decorations shall be distributed proportionally among the different parts of the State ; but if the legislature exists solely for useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can legislate most usefully , and nature does not always distribute useful legislators in exact proportion to the population . In any event , local jealousy will generally triumph over superior fitness . It may be mentioned in passing that nearly every country in Europe permits its constituencies to choose their representatives freely , and this freedom of choice has never been a cause of complaint . The existing rule bears with particular hardship upon political leaders , for they often reside in districts which differ from them in politics . Thus the Constitution not infrequently forces a political party to choose as its legislative leader an inferior man . The responsibility of political parties may be increased We usually speak of party spirit as if it were altogether undesirable , but party responsibility is a thing to be desired , and this can not be had without reasonable party spirit and sufficient party discipline . At present , party spirit , in the Massachusetts legislature at least , is feeble and intermittent , and party discipline is almost wanting . The legislation of each session should have some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame itself , and it can not be framed by common consent , for nearly all serious legislation is inevitably the object of opposition . If there is to be any programme at all , it must be made by the political majority . Not all the legislation proposed would be political ; much , perhaps most of it , would be quite unconnected with the issues of national politics . The English ministry is held responsible for the passage not only of partisan measures , but of non-partisan measures needed by the country . Responsibility , similar in kind though less in degree , should be undertaken by the prevailing political party of any State . Finally , our people must be taught // that legislation is a business . In the modern world , all business is specialized , and performed by those who have demonstrated their fitness . We do not go for medical advice to a farmer , however successful or upright ; we do not hire a cotton manufacturer to draw our wills for us , though his name be a proverb of honest dealing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the counsels of our lawyer , though he be a Marshall and a Story rolled into one . Moralists and reformers continually exhort their fellow citizens to elect good men to office . A good general character , certainly , is desirable and even necessary to a useful legislator , but general goodness without some special fitness is a poor equipment for legislative service . Political ideals necessarily transcend actual political results . It is important , therefore , that the most intelligent and public-spirited men in the community , the political idealists , should insist that fitness , which must include respectability , rather than respectability alone , is the true test of a public servant , and that a public servant of approved fitness , in the legislature as well as in the civil service , is not to be displaced lightly or unadvisedly . If he has ceased to represent the opinions of his constituents from the standpoint of partisan politics or otherwise , let him go , but do not let him go because " he has had it long enough . " If these sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will gradually affect our actual conditions . The object of this article , however , is not chiefly to suggest remedies for existing shortcomings , but to point out those shortcomings and their causes . An understanding of their effects must precede their cure .
