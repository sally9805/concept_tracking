By 0 . B. Super . lOW to treat the original American has been a problem to the American who is such only by immigration ever since the first settlement of the country by Europeans . As the wave of settlement rolled farther and farther westward from the seaboard , the red man either fled before it or stubbornly resisted its advance until it caught and overwhelmed him . The present condition of the Indian in the far West does not greatly differ from that of his forefathers two hundred and fifty years ago ; but the fault lies with the white man rather than with the Indian . True , ever since the time of John Eliot , attempts have been made to improve his condition ; but these have been spasmodic and individual , while the general policy has been to leave him as much as possible to his own devices and to treat him as a being having no rights that white men are bound to respect . Since the time of William Penn , at least , our dealings with the Indians have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dishonesty as individuals . Our policy has alternated between pauperizing and extermination . The Indians have been encouraged in idleness by being freely supplied with food , clothing and money at the public expense ; and when they have protested against encroachments on their domain , or against being ordered about from pillar to post , men , women and children have been ruthlessly slaughtered . Helen Hunt Jackson 's eloquent " Century of Dishonor " is an arraignment which , severe as it is , is an inadequate presentation of the case . The present reservation plan was inaugurated by President Jefferson , whose idea was to transfer all the Indians beyond the Mississippi River . He issued instructions to those controlling *24 Indian affairs to put them there and let the great river be the dividing line between them and the whites , at the same time authorizing the employment of negotiation , persuasion or force in order to secure removal . Washington 's plan , on the contrary , was one of association and civilization . He believed that commerce freely entered into between the white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter ; but at no period of our history has Washington 's plan been honestly tried . The policy of our government has always been removal , segregation , degradation , destruction . The establishment of the Indian Industrial School at Carlisle marks an epoch in the history of our treatment of the red man . To Captain R. H. Pratt , the superintendent of this school , is due the credit of conceiving and , so far as possible , of carrying out the idea that " the most effectual way of getting civilization into the Indian is to get the Indian into civilization . " He believes that the same system which converts the dregs of European civilization into respectable , self-supporting American citizens Will , if applied to the aborigines , produce the same results . He sees no reason why Indians should not be allowed an equal chance , at least , with the foreigners who annually flock to our shores by the hundred thousand . Richard Henry Pratt was born in Allegany County , New York . When he was quite young his parents removed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered by the village school . At the breaking out of the Civil War he was among the first to answer the call for troops , enlisting in April , i86i . He served during the entire war , taking an active part in all the engagements of the Army of the Cumberland from Shiloh to Nashville , and was mustered out in May , 1865 , as captain // in the Eleventh Indiana Cavalry . In 1867 he accepted a commission in the Tenth United States Cavalry , and until 1875 was stationed on the frontier in Texas and the Indian Territory . During the Indian war of 1874-75 he had charge of hundreds of Indian prisoners at Fort Sill . Seventy-four of the worst of these were selected and sent in care of Captain Pratt to the Spanish fort at St. Augustine , Florida . It may be said , too , that although these men were regarded as incorrigibles , and although Captain Pratt was their jailer and took them to Florida in chains , by his humane and reasonable treatment of them he won their affection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . Some of them have children in the Carlisle school , where they permitted them to come because they knew that Captain Pratt would have charge of them . When he visits the Indian Territory they greet him with demonstrations of affection quite unlike the traditional stolidity of the red man , effectually refuting the charge that the Indian is by nature ungrateful and vindictive . The Carlisle school had its origin in convictions that grew out of Captain Pratt 's service against the Indians . He belonged to a regiment in which all the privates and non-commissioned officers were colored men . He found many of the men most capable . Williams , who subsequently wrote the history of the negro in America , and who occupied the post of Minister to Hayti , was a sergeant in one of the companies . Indian scouts often formed part of his command , and in various ways the black and the red man were brought into contact in such a way as to lead Captain Pratt to compare the two races . His conclusion was that if the negro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization than the Indian now does , could in two hundred and fifty years be educated up to such a point as to make us consider him our political equal , the red man might be equally transformed . It is at least not fair to denounce the Indian as an incorrigihle savage until he has had the same privilege of associating with white men which the negro enjoys . If millions of black savages can become so transformed and assimilated as to become good citizens , and if annually hundreds of thousands of emigrants from all lands can become Americanized and assimilated through association , then we should at least try the same method with the Indian . When Captain Pratt was directed to conluct the Indian prisoners of war to Florida and to remain thefe in charge of them , he tried to put his theory into practice . In accordance with conclusions previously arrived at , that the Indians had a right to all the education they were capable of acquiring , he established schools among them , and by letting them go out as laborers , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into contact with civilized life . These Indians remained in Florida three years , during which time wonderful CAPTAIN R. H. PRATT . // changes were wrought in them . They even begged to have their wives and children sent to them and to be allowed to remain in the East . But those in charge of the agencies were unwilling that any should escape from their supervision , and not only refused to allow their women and children to come east , but even demanded that the released prisoners should be returned to their former degrading environment , although many of them had expressed a desire to be freed from its thraldom . Those in charge of the agencies , as well as those living near them , are accustomed to look upon the Indian merely as a convenient channel for conveying the public money into their own pockets , knowing well that whatever sum the government sends to these unsophisticated people will soon find its way into the hands of their white neighbors . In the spring of 1878 , when the prisoners were released , twenty-two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East in order to go to school . During their stay in Florida they had excited the sympathy and interest of various benevolent persons , who offered to provide the means of securing for them the education which they so ardently desired . Accordingly seventeen of them were placed in the school at Hampton , which up to that time had been devoted exclusively to the education of the colored race , four near Utica , New York , and one at Tarrytown , New York . Thus was begun the eastward movement of the young Indians . The great work which the Hampton School has done in the cause of Indian education owes its beginning to Captain Pratt . In the fall of 1878 Captain Pratt was sent to Dakota to collect students for the Hampton School , and he brought fortynine from the various agencies . He was then detailed to stay at the school until the pupils were " accustomed to their new mode of life and interested in educational pursuits . " After remaining at Hampton three months , he reported to the Secretary of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might now be returned to his regiment . Both the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Interior , however , desired him to continue in the work of Indian education ; and in 1879 , at their suggestion , a special clause was inserted in the Army . Appropriation bill , authorizing the detail of an officer of the army , not above the rank of captain , for special duty with reference to Indian education . Captain Pratt was willing to devote himself to this work ; but his experience at Hampton had convinced him that it was not advisable to entangle the fate of the young Indian seeking an education with that of the negro . Their conditions and wants were not at all similar . The negroes , numbering eight millions , already spoke English , while most of the two THE SCHOOL GROUNDS FROM THE NORTH . // hundred and fifty thousand Indians did not . The former had always lived among the whites and were familiar with their modes of life , while the latter could best learn the same things at first hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unentangled with the negro , would more easily become absorbed in the body politic . In addition to this , there exists almost everywhere a certain race prejudice against the negro , from which the Indian suffers scarcely at all , and the alliance of the two problems could only result in begetting a like prejudice against the Indian and so become a clog to his progress . These considerations led Captain Pratt to propose the establishment of an industrial school especially for Indians , and suggested the old barracks at Carlisle as being a suitable place for such a school . Situated in the midst of an industrious and intelligent community , they would afford an excellent opportunity for trying what he believed to be the only true method of educating the Indian . The suggestion was made to the authorities at Washington , and a bill was promptly introduced in Congress and favorably received by both houses ; but it was so far back on the calendar that it was not reached during the session of 1878-79 , and did not in fact become a law until July 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favorable attitude of Congress led the Secretary of War to submit the project to General Sherman , commander of the army , and to General Hancock , commander of the Department of the Atlantic , in which the Carlisle barracks are situated . They both approved ; and September 6 , 1879 , an order was issued turning over the barracks to the Department of the Interior for an Indian industria school , pending the action of Congress on the bill . These Carlisle barracks have an interesting history aside from their connection with Indian education . In 1755 , about the time that settlers in any considerable numbers began to come into this region , the Penns gave the site of the barracks to the " Province of Pennsylvania , " free of rent . This donation was continued until i8oi , when the place was purchased by the United States government . Prior to the Revolution almost the only building on the grounds was a block house , designed to serve as a protection against the Indians who , during the French and Indian War several times invaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baing remote from the scene of active operations , were used by the colonial government as a recruiting station and a place for the detention of prisoners of war . Thus , in the autumn of 1775 , portions of two British regiments captured by General Montgomery at St. Johns , Canada , were first sent to Lancaster , and in the spring of 1776 a portion of them were removed to Carlisle . Among the latter were Lieutenants Andre and Despard . Despard , who was an Irishman , A GROUP OF INDIANS ON ARRIVAL . // afterward became a colonel in the British service , and served under Nelson . He seems to have carried back with him from America some democratic ideas , and he was executed for treason in 1803 . The unfortunate Andre was long remembered in Carlisle , and his trysting places with a certain " Annie " are still known to tradition . He is said to have " passed his days in reading , with his feet resting on the wainscot of the window , and his dogs lying by his side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged , and Andre left Carlisle for New York November 28 . The Hessians captured by Washington at Trenton December 25 , 1776 , were also sent to Carhsle . They were compelled to make themselves useful by erecting substantial buildings , one of which is still used as a guardhouse . The little cemetery where those were buried who died during their cap tivity is still preserved intact . A kindly feeling was entertained toward these Hessians by the citizens , and they were regarded as victims of the avarice and selfishness of their rulers . After the war many returned and settled in the vicinity of Carlisle , and some of their descendants are still to be found in the county . In 1836 some of the old buildings were torn down and rebuilt , and new ones added , which remained until the night of July r , 1863 , when the town was occupied by Confederate troops under General Fitzhugh Lee , and the barracks , being government property , were burned by his orders . But little other damage was done here , for the booming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south , notified General Lee that his services were needed elsewhere , and he hastily withdrew his forces . The barracks were rebuilt in r86*-66 , and occupied as a school for cavalry and a depot for United States stores until 1872 , when the depot was transferred to St. Louis . The place remained unoccupied until 1879 , when the Indian school was established . In September of that year Captain Pratt was ordered to proceed to I ) akota and the Indian Territory , to procure pupils for the school . By the end of October one hundred and thirty-six had been collected . Hampton gave up eleven of the former Florida prisoners , and on November i the school opened with one hundred and forty-seven pupils . Since that time over two thousand five hundred different pupils , representing more than fifty tribes , have attended the school for periods varying from a few months to ten years , the largest number being about eight hundred , and the present number seven hundred and fifty . The aim of the school has always . been to make of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE GIRL5 ' QUARTERS . // In order to accomplish this , the pupils are , first of all , taught to speak English , and then are given a primary education , in connection with a knowledge of some common and practical industry , so that each pupil may be furnished with some means of self-support among civilized people . To this end regular shops and two farms have been provided , where the principal mechanical arts , such as printing , blacksmithing , shoemaking , harness-making , tailoring , wagonmaking , carpentering , painting and tinning are taught , and the boys also acquire a practical knowledge of farming and the care of stock . Not a few of these pupils have found employment and located in civilized communities . The girls are taught cooking , sewing , laundry and housework . After some preliminary training in the school , eight young women entered regular training-schools for nurses in Philadelphia or elsewhere . Six of these have completed the prescribed course , and are now doing the same work as white nurses , and receiving the same wages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the young men have gone out from the school to occupy responsible posts , especially in the West and at or in the vicinity of the agencies . One who learned blacksmithing at the school is now employed by the Atlan. tic and Pacific Railroad Company at a salary of $90 a month . Pupils from the Carlisle school have always been in demand in the Indian school service . A school recently established has among its employees five former Carlisle students . ASSEMBLY HALL . Half a day 's work and half a day 's study for each pupil daily has been the rule of the school from the beginning . All the schools and shops are organized with two sets of pupils alternating each half day . The key-note of the system is self-help , and its object is to make the pupils self-reliant and independent . With all this , moral training is never lost sight of . There is a religious service every Sunday in the school chapel , usually conducted by a clergyman from the town . A large number of the pupils are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are regular attendants on their services . There is a special service at the school for such as do not attend the town churches ; and in many other ways moral and religious influences are brought to bear on the pupils . There are four circles of King 's Daughters among the girls , and an efficient Young Men 's Christian Association among the boys . These are incorporated into the state and national organizations , and send delegates to all their conventions . Moral teaching is made a part of the social life , and enters into all the activities of the school . Neither is the social side of culture neglected . As a DR . CARLOS MONTEZUMA. // matter of course , an Indian school is vastly different from most others , because there is so much to be taught with regard to manners and conduct which with others comes naturally in the course of family life . One point receiving special attention is that of the proper association of the sexes . This is secured by sociables held once a month , when the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two hours are spent in conversation , games , or in any proper agreeable way . The students also have annual banquets , inviting the guests and showing great interest and ingenuity in providing for their entertainment . The several circles of the King 's Daughters have their annual fair for the sale of articles manufactured and contributed for such benevolent objects as they may undertake . There are also four literary societies in the school , conducted entirely by the pupils . Here original essays are read and live questions debated , and the patience and diligence manifested in preparing for these exercises are worthy of the highest commendation . There is a circulating library in the school , and seventy-five or eighty books are taken out every week . In addition to this the school has its reading-rooms , one for the large boys , one for the small boys , and one for the girls . All these various agencies are effective as spurs to individual effort , and they make the routine of the school and the shop more endurable by breaking its monotony . Nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in teaching white children ; and their testimony is , that these " children of nature " do about as well on the average as the children who are the " heirs of all the ages " of culture and civilization . Allowance , of course , must be made for the fact that some of these pupils at the start knew absolutely no English ; and since this is the only language permitted in the school , some time is necessarily spent in getting the young Indians up to the point where other children usually begin . This feature of the school is disappearing , since the number of Indian children who know no English is becoming smaller each year ; but it is possible to see classes of new-comers struggling with the elements of the language and painfully trying to put together in sentences the words whose meaning they are beginning vaguely to comprehend . Some of these early attempts at English composition furnish entertaining reading . A characteristic feature of the school is the printing-office , which has always been regarded as one of the most valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , the pupils publish two papers , The Red Ala ri , an eight-page quarto , with a monthly circulation of about two thousand copies , and The Indian He/f/er , a small four-page weekly , with a circulation of over ten thousand copies . They also do a large amount of job printing for the school , which would cost hundreds of dollars if done outside . In no department of the school is mental growth more apparent than here . It is interesting to THE ART ROOM . // watch the development of thought and ideas as the pupils gradually enter into the spirit of the work . Here especially they learn that quickness is necessary to success , and take pride in gaining speed and accuracy in their work . Although some of the pupils may not become practical printers , the mental growth here acquired will prove useful to them in any occupation to which they may afterward devote themselves . The school department proper consists of twelve school-rooms , with nine grades . There are also two rooms known as the Normal Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades . These are taught in turn by a number of pupil teachers , under the supervision of an experienced teacher . Here they not only get practice in teaching , but also receive special instruction in methods . The graduation limit for the school is fixed at the end of the grammarschool grade , because this point may be easily reached by the average pupil at the end of two terms of five years each . In making comparison between what is done here and in the ordinary public school in this length of time , it is necessary to bear in mind that these Indian children spend only half of their time in the school - room the other half being devoted to manual training , so that most of the graduates have not only acquired a fair English education , but have also gained sufficient skill in some handicraft to enable them to earn a living by it . The distinctive feature of the school , however , is what is known as the " outing system . " This means the placing of the pupils of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may not only earn money for themselves , but also learn practically those lessons of civilized life which can only be taught theoretically and imperfectly at the school . By this means , also , a considerable number may enjoy the privilege of attending public schools , and thus associate intimately with white children , which , as a matter of course , they can not do at the school . During the first vacation ( r 88o ) , places were thus found for six girls and eighteen boys ; and this number has steadily increased , until last year it reached two hundred and forty-five girls and three hundred and seventy-six boys , while applications were received for six hundred and ninety-two boys and five hundred and ninety-oue girls , showing that the demand was largely in excess of the supply , and incidentally , also , the eminently satisfactory character of the work done by these pupils . At the close of the vacation , if satisfactory conditions exist , students are encouraged to remain out through the winter and attend public schools . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil , when not attending school , receives pay , IN THE PRESS-ROOM. according to the nature of the work done , Indians always receiving the same wages which white laborers are accustomed to receive in the same locality . Their aggregate earnings during a single year have amounted to $20,109 , oC vihich the boys earned nearly $15,000 . Their actual savings were over $8,400 . Since the // establishment of the school the pupils have thus earned over $r5o , ooO . Economy is encouraged , and in order to promote it , as well as to instruct the pupils in business methods , a savings bank system is carried on . The pupils deposit their earnings and receive interest for them . At present the amount on deposit is about *i5 , ooo . Each depositor has a bank book , and is taught how to keep his account . Once a month those who have money in the bank are given an opportunity to purchase such articles as they may think necessary or advisable . These purchases are made under the supervision of the officers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each pupil is furnished with an application blank , on which he states how much money is wanted and for what purpose , as well as the amount to his credit in the bank , which he finds by balancing his account book . If the statement is found correct and the application is approved , the pupil takes the money and makes the purchase , and the articles purchased are submitted to the proper officers for inspection . It is worthy of note that those tribes which are usually regarded as the least civilized , such as the Apaches , have contributed their full quota to this army of workers . The original American , according to popular estimation , is not a model of industry , and in his native condition he is perhaps neither better nor worse in this respect than any other savage . Doubtless the average " brave " on the western plains will lie in the sun and compel his squaw to do all the work . But he only acts thus because he has never been taught any better . The Carlisle school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARLISLE . // prove that when he has been shown " a more excellent way " he is not slow to adopt it . That these pupils give satisfaction as workers is further shown by the fact that of those annually sent out from the school not more thar four in a hundred are returned as unsatisfactory , although any one who hires a pupil from the school does it with the distinct understanding that the pupil shall be at once returned if either party to the contract has any cause for dissatisfaction . Again , pupils are sent only on their own request , with a full knowledge of the purposes , hardships and benefits involved ; and almost universally those who have been out in this manner one year desire to go out again the next year and so every year during their stay at the school . An important feature of the contract is that the pupil shall share the home life of the family in all its manifold relations . Thanks to this outing system and the facilities which the Carlisle school possesses for applying it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one in twenty of those who have been here three years or more is unable to succeed in civilized pursuits among civilized people . By this system they learn to compete with the white man on his own ground ; and were it not for the tremendous pressure exerted to draw them back to the reservations , many more would remain in the East and take their places in civilized communities than do so now . One cause of the opposition to their living among the whites has already been stated as being the self-interest of those living on or near the reservations . Another cause is a religious one . The doctrine that THREE YEARS LATER . // " ignorance is the mother of devotion " still has its advocates , at least among missionaries to the Indians , who well appreciate the fact that if these sheep are once permitted to get out of the fold it may not be so easy to get them back into it again . In spite of all opposition , however , the system as originated and developed by Captain Pratt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of December , 1894 , the Secretary of the Interior approved a circular to agents and superintendents of Indian schools calling their attention to the " benefits accruing to the Indians of both sexes by placing them at service , although it may be only for a few months , in families of farmers , the girls and women sharing in all the domestic duties of the family life , cooking , sewing , dairying , etc. , and the boys and men in farming , gardening , the care of stock , etc . While thus employed , they acquire the English language and become self-reliant , and through the wages which they receive learn the value of money and its proper use . . . The day is not far distant when government support must he withdrawn from the Indians now receiving aid , and like their white brethren they will have to depend upon their own exertions for a living . It is therefore increasingly important that they should be learning how to support themselves by intelligent labor in civilized ways . . . . If practicable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend public schools during the winter months . " These agents and superintendents are further directed to use all possible means for carrying out these suggestions . It is a matter of experience , however , that the system does not work well in schools that are not far removed from the homes of the Indians . The restraints of civilized life are , at first , likely to press somewhat heavily upon them , and some seek to escape from them where they have a convenient opportunity for so doing . If the Indian question had been thus intelligently dealt with during the last hundred years , we should now need a Commissioner of Indian Affairs just as little as we need one of Irish Affairs or Italian or Polish Affairs . The Indian capacity for culture can not he better illustrated than by the history of Dr. Carlos Montezuma , the resident physician at the Carlisle school . He is a full-blooded Apache Indian , about twenty-nine years of age . When he was five years old he was carried off as a captive by a neighboring tribe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling artist named Gentile , who happened to be passing through that region , accidentally heard the boy 's story , and purchased him from his captor for $30 . Gentile took the boy to Chicago and sent him to school . He worked his way up step by step , paying his way by hard work , and at the age of twenty-three years was graduated honorably from the Chicago Medical College . Since that time he has held various positions in connection with Indian school and agency service , and IN THE BLAcKsMITH 's sHOP . // has always performed his duties in an eminently satisfactory manner . He has written valuable articles on the Indian question , and expresses the opinion that his case is exceptional only in so far as he received exceptional treatment . During the whole period of its existence the Carlisle school has served as the " Department of Publicity " in Indian school work . It has done this by its admirable location , by its superior advantages , by its publications , and by the public presentation of its students in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York in 1887 and at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1892 and 1893 , as well as on many less conspicuous occasions , thus enlightening the people at large on the general question of the merits and results of Indian education . In fact , the authorities of this school have always invited the closest scrutiny into its methods and results , knowing that the opposition to it could only result from ignorance and prejudice . It has also fallen mainly to the school to represent the Indian Bureau at the various international exhibitions which have been held since its beginning , in New Orleans , Paris , Madrid and Chicago , with the result of a great interest in the cause . At New Orleans the school was awarded a diploma for the excellence of its exhibit , a medal and diploma at Paris , and a medal and diploma at Madrid , while at Chicago the following award was made - INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL , CARLISLE , PA . AWARD . Excellence of methods , objects and results , as a part of the best plan for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual training of the Indian to take his place as a member of civilized society ; seen , first , in his separation from savage surroundings ; second , in wise and wellfitted plans and methods of theoretical and prac tical training of boys and girls in the several years of school life , during which they learn conditions of caring for health and are prepared for active affairs in common studies such as reading , writing , drawing , arithmetic , composition , geography , music , book-keeping and morals ; and in industries for girls , such as household economy , needlework , cutting of garments and cooking ; and for boys , farming , carpentering , blacksmithing , harness and wagon making , the making of tinware and shoes and printing ; third , as seen in the outing system , by which the pupils are placed in good families , where both boys and girls for a year or more become familiar , by observation and practice , with all the customs and amenities of American home life , fixing what they have been learning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the results attained , and ( a ) in the outing system for 1892 , which resulted in the earning by four hundred and four boys of $i6 ,  - -  698.83 , and by two hundred and ninety-eight girls of $5,170.15 , or a total of $21,868.98 , all of which was placed to their individual credit , and ( b ) in the useful and worthy lives of the great majority of all who have returned to their Indian homes . The exhibit at Chicago , compared with the first exhibit of Indian education and industry made at Philadelphia in I876 , fairly set forth the progress and abilities of the race as students in literary and industrial matters , and may be properly said to prove that , if the Indian is a savage , he is not so by choice or through lack of capacity , but because of his lack of education and because , so far from endeavoring to free him from his savage environment , we have rather tried to keep him in his toils . The exhibit in the Liberal Arts Department was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the officials of many foreign countries , as well as prominent workers in the home and foreign mission fields . Another feature of the school 's connection with the Chicago Fair was the visit made in October of more than four hundred and fifty pupils , going in a special train of ten coaches , leaving Carlisle at midnight October i and returning at midnight October 7 , after a most instructive stay of more than four days in Chicago . During this time the services of the band , a concert in Festival Hall hy the hand and choir , and a daily parade and drill of one hour by the school cadets , were accepted by the management in lieu of entrance feec for the whole number , and incidentally gave the Indian school work , and especially the Carlisle school , great publicity . The expenses of the trip , amounting to nearly $7 , ooo , were paid by the students themselves from the earnings of their summer outings . Not the least remarkable thing about these Indians is the talent they display for music when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of the pupils , mostly girls , show fair ability as pianists ; and there is a choral society in the school having about forty members , which renders correctly and effectively the works of the best composers . The most noteworthy illustration of this talent , however , is the band , consisting of about thirty members , led by an Indian , Dennison Wheelock , * educated in the school , who not only plays the cornet with rare skill , but also composes and arranges music for the band . This band has given concerts in most of the large eastern cities , and its performances have always attracted attention , not only on account of the unique character of the performers , but also on account of intrinsic excellence . No feature of the Columbian parade in New York attracted more attention than this Indian school hand . Frederick Douglass , after once hearing the band , said : " It is impossible to relegate to permanent barbarism a people endowed with the musical abilities shown by these young Indians . " As the opinion seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man 's education rather than a knowledge of foot-ball and b. se-bail , it is not out of place to say that even in this department of the arts and sciences the young Indians hold their own . During the past season the teams from the InTHE BAND-MASTER . THE SCHOOL BAND . // INDIAN EDUCATION AT CARLISLE* dian school met those of various colleges and athletic clebs , and always did themselves credit . Doubtless the average collegian would say that any Indian who can play foot-ball well can also learn enough Latin , Greek and mathematics to entitle him to the degree of Bachelor of Arts . Marvellous changes have taken place in the condition of many of the western Indians since the Carlisle school was established . In i88i there was not one member of the Pueblo tribe who could read or write in any language . Now hundreds of them read and write English , and letters are received from them at the school daily . This improved condition of things is due almost entirely to the pioneering of the Carlisle school , among whose pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some years numbering nearly one hundred and fifty children . Fifteen years ago there was great opposition , chiefly ecclesiastical , to TIlE FOOT-BALL TEAM . educating these Indians ; but the pressure has been so great that even the opponents have been obliged to fall in with the general sentiment on the subject or lose their influence . At that time , also , the practice of instructing the Indian in his own language was largely adhered to and when the government demanded that only English should be taught in its schools vehement ecclesiastical protests were made ; but here also the opposition has been compelled to yield , and the next generation will probably witness the extinction of the Indian dialects in the United States . With regard to what becomes of the ' graduates of the school , the superintendent is always willing to give full information . A complete record of them is kept ; and it may be said that only one of them has turned TILE cUORAL sOCIETy . // *out badly . Those who pretend to legislate on the Indian question could study this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a newspaper , holding up to public execration some " Carlisle graduate " on account of his crimes and misdoings , and these stories have even been repeated for partisan purposes in the halls of Congress ; but they have in every case been manufactured out of whole cloth . Congressman Smith of Arizona has given utterance to the remarkable statement : " There is as much hope of educating the Apache as there is of educating the rattlesnake on which he feeds . " No better answer can be given to such a statement than the record of a full-blooded Ap3che , Dr. Montezuma , the resident physician of Carlisle , to whom reference has already been made . It would be impossible to show that any of the graduates , and even any of those who have been at the school half the time required for graduation , are living in crime or hopeless degradation . In a recent speech Captain Pratt said : " We should in the first place realize that the Indian is a man , created as we are , and that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I look at the Indians I see that they stand erect . When I talk with them they reason . They have the same body that I have . As I deal with them I realize that the only difference between us is a difference in opportunities . If young Indians can be placed where they will have opportunities and somebody to instruct them , they can make lace , or they can do anything else , and all this continual holding them back and letting them wait , as though they were cripples and incapable of development , is nonsense . If there is not morality it can be cultivated . If there are not skill and industry they can be acquired . There is no end to the possibilities . My boys have gone into the foot-ball craze lately and have even been so ambitious as to make arrangements to play with several prominent college teams , and I am sure they will give these teams hard contests . It does not make any difference what the line of effort is , whether it is holding the plough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing football , - whatever is to be done can be done and ought to be done now , and there should be no closed doors . " My way of getting the Indians to work would be simply to follow the same methods we do with all others and give them work where the work is ; not try TOM TORLINO , NAVAJO . AT THE TiME HE ENTERED THE SCHOOL . THREE YEARS LATER . // further to keep them together and continue thinking we are somehow going to accomplish great things by continuing the tribes . The system is not American . I do not believe it is Christian . I do not believe the Lord ever intended it that way . Let us get them into our industries . If I can take children from any tribe - and if there are any Indians in this country that I have not tried I will take hold of them and send them in considerable numbers into our communities and they by good conduct and industry win a welcome , people want them and the Indians learn to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why can not it be done for all ? We are dealing with two hundred and fifty thousand people , that is all . It is this hesitancy , this hanging back from doing the right and proper thing , that is in the way . We can put our Indians into all the lines of our life if we ourselves only conclude to do that . " " Indian education , " says Captain Pratt in his last report , " has had its experimental and formative stages . It is now universally admitted that the Indian can be and should be educated , and that the government should do the work . There is , therefore , in the future the somewhat monotonous but necessary work of keeping on - keeping at it - until the work is done and until the need for schools exclusively Indian shall have passed away and the Indian through his intelligence and industry becomes a full and independent citizen to whom all the schools and occupations of the country are open and become available . In working to this end , Carlisle loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her care the idea that the future is one nation , one people , one language , one way to comfortable living , open alike to the Indians and the white race , embodied in the ancient decree , In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread .
