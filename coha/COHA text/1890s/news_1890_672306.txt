txt A decision was rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States yesterday in a case that ought to make the tariff tinkers of the country blush , if their hardened cheeks have not become incapable of that demonstration of emotion . It is what is known as the " Ribbon case , " or the " Edelhoff case , " and arose under the Tariff act of 1883 . That statute provides that " trimmings for hats , bonnets , and hoods " shall be subject to an import duty of 20 per cent. , but it was decided by the Treasury Department , we believe in 1884 , that certain goods , declared by the importer to be intended for the uses above described , and composed of silk and cotton , were subject to a duty of 50 per cent , as goods of which silk was the component of chief value . This decision was appealed from in the manner provided by law , and carried to the courts , and in a trial before Judge CoxE in Circuit , in the Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Government then carried the case to the Supreme Court , and now , nearly four years after the first judgment was rendered , the final decision is reached and the former confirmed . The Supreme Court finds that the claim of the importer as , to the duties to which his goods were properly subject is correct , and that that duty should be 20 per cent. , and not 50 per cent . Under this decision it is estimated that the Treasury will be required to repay from $5,000,000 to $6,000,000 money illegally and wrongfully collected from the importers . There are several things perfectly plain in this case . One , and the most obvious , is that if the duty in this case bad been levied by Congress for the only purpose for which Congress has really any right to lay a tax , namely , to provide revenue for the necessities of the Government , no question would have arisen as to the rate which would have been uniform , clear , simple , and moderate . It was only when Congress undertook to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to check or prevent their competition with those of their fellow-citizens who were engaged in making like goods that the language of the law became vague and untrustworthy , and there was occasion for doubt as to its real meaning . This difficulty was aggravated by the absurd and oppressive rule that in all cases of doubt the highest rate of duty shall be exacted . thus throwing on the weaker party the onus of all proceedings to correct an injustice or even a , deliberate act of extortion . To this source of wrong is added another ; the rule that while the Treasury Department may reverse the decision'of a preceding Secretary in order to exact higher duties , it can not do so iu order to fix lower ones- . A more ingenious and cruel machinery for perpetrating injustice to the verge of fraud was never devised . Another thing that is plain in. this case is that under these malevolent conditions there is always a large class of business men -- namely the protected manufacturers -- who have a strong , direct , pecuniary interest in securing the greatest possible amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff laws and of arbitrary uncertainty in their interpretation . They always get the benefit of the doubt . and they do not fail to employ every means , often bad rather than good , to introduce doubt . Nothing more michievous or more iniquitous than this is known to modern legislation . Still another feature of the case is the obvious contradiction of thelaw with any rational principle of protection . It was the plain intention of Congress in the act of 1883 to encourage a certain branch of American manufactures , to wit , the making of hats , bonnets , and hoods by putting a moderate duty on the . materials used in such manufacture , viz .. on " trimmings . " But all that was necessary to defeat this intention of Congress'for six long yearswas to secure a decision of the Treasury authorties ? not a judicial decision at all , but perfectly irresponsible action by administrative officials who could never be held to account for error or intentional wrong ? that these goods came under another clause of the complicated tariff law , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the one Congress had levied . This was done , and the $6,000,000 wrongfully extorted from men engaged in domestic industry is only a small part of the damage inflicted by this wicked pretense of protection . For every business man knows that , in the first place , the injury caused by increasing the cost of goods is in nowise compensated by the subsequent repayment of the amount of the original increase , and in the next place , for six years , in this ease , a legitimate business has been subjected to ' arbitrary change of conditions and to needless uncertainty and risk . And even now , when $6,000,000 will have to be taken out of the Treasury , it will in great part never reach those who have really suffered by its wrongful exaction . It will go largely if not wholly into the pockets of importers who have long ago reimbursed themselves by adding to the prices of their goods . To these men it will be a large net gain , but their customers , who are really injured , will get nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely in this matter . It is the system that is bad , and this is only one of thousands of instances in which it works mischief .
