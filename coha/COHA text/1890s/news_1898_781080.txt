txt Senor Garnica of the Spanish Commission , ' questioned to-day concerning the treaty of peace , said : " The exact number of articles is still undetermined . It depends upon how Secretaries Ojeda. and Moore divide the treaty . It may be that there will be twelve or twenty articles . The Americans are to pay the indemnity within three months of the ratification . We shall appoint Consuls in Cuba , Puerto Rico , and the Philippine Islands without delay . The Cuban Consul will be accredited to the powers that be . " Asked why the Spaniards refused to grant the United States a coaling station in the Caroline Islands , Seiler Garnica said : " The Americans could hardly expect that we should agree to discuss matters outside of the protocol , after the lessons we have had from them on this point . When we wished to discuss the Cuban debt they absolutely refused to consider it , and then they ask us for whatever they want . Quelle toupet ! ( " What cheek ! " ) Yet the Cuban debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Spaniards ' final protest on the subject of the Maine , Senor Garnica. remarked : " That protest now becomes history , as it is embodied in the protocol . We do not wish to remain under an imputation which would perpetuate animosity and hatred against us and which would be a source of constant irritation in Spain . It is neither loyal nor just that this thing should hang over the reputation of Spain . We can not submit to it . It must be cleared up , . n justice to ourselves . There are many other causes to bring hatred between the two nations without the addition of such a one as this . " As to the future relations of the two countries , that is one of the things history alone can determine . Many nations which have been deadly enemies are speedily reconciled . " Senor Garnica was then questioned as to the future of the Philippine Islands , and he said : " The United States has inaugurated a policy which will bring it much trouble and many responsibilities . The Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undertake . Your democratic system must inaugurate an imperialistic and bureaucratic system and you must increase your army and navy , with the result that there will be constant friction between yourselves and the European powers .
