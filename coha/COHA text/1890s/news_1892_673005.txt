txt The managers of the World 's Columbian Exposition at Chicago have little cause to feel grateful . to Congress for the meagre aid which it has granted them as a means of getting out of a vexatious dead-look in order that it might reach a speedy adjournment While the financial aid so grudgingly bestowed presents little to be thankful for , there is cause for resentment in the restrictions put upon the management as a condition of getting even this scanty and ungracious allowance . It is a question whether the managers can better afford to accept the financial aid with the restriction or refuse it and leave themselves at liberty to follow their own judgment in regard to having the fair open on Sunday . File bill as finally passed contributes 142,500,000 in souvenir half dollars to the general expenses of preparing for the exposition and provides at a cost of $103,000 for 50,000 bronze medals and 50,000 vellum diplomas to be awarded to exhibitors . The $2,500,000 is to be paid . out on vouchers after satisfactory evidence that t10,000,000 otherwise raised has been collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further sums necessary to complete the work " has been or will be provided by said World 's Columbian Exposition . " The appropriations in the bill are made " upon condition that the said exposition shall not be opened to the public on the first day of the week , commonly called Sunday , " and . if the appropriation is accepted by the World 's Columbian Exposition , which is an Illinois corporation , the World 's Columbian Commission , which is a body created by Congress , is directed to make such rules as shall require the closing of the exposition on Sunday . As the matter stands , the Sunday-closing requirement appears as virtually a bold attempt to exercise the authority of the National Government to forbid the opening of the fair by a State corporation on the first day of the week , on which the receipts would probably exceed those of any other two days , and come largely from those who would otherwise contribute nothing . The managers can get rid of the restriction by refusing to accept the funds , and it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means certain that the Sundayclosing restriction could be enforced by the Government . ' Suppose the $2,500,000 is taken and . expended upon the buildings and other preparations for the fair , and that the Government goes on and completes its exhibit and provides for the award of prizes , medals , &c.,; and . then when the time comes for opening the gates the commission should decide that they might be kept open seven days in the week . What could be done about it ? Could the Government recover its money , or by any process of law compel the shutting up of the fair grounds ? But there is evidently a purpose harbored by some of those concerned in the World 's Fair management of appearing before Congress again next December to ask for several million dollars more and the removal of the Sunday-closing condition , thinking that after the Presidential election is over more heed will be paid to their prayers . To say nothing of the guarantee required on the disbursement of the funds already allowed , it would not be wise to calculate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening the fair will come next May , and everything should be ready . The session of Congress wilt be a short and crowded one , and it is very doubtful if a new demand for help for the World 's Fair at that late day would be received with favor . If it is depended upon it may lead . to ruinous delays and final disappointment . The managers have done well in raising $10,000,000 through the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois by private subscription , but the amount might be doubled , if necessary , by a new display of patriotism and local pride and pluck and by the right kind of appeal to the country at large . It would be unwise to count upon any further help from the Government , but it may be hoped that the burdensome condition under which this little has been granted may be removed next Winter . There is now but one thing for the World 's Fair peeple to do . They have been credited with excellent work so far , and we have been given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a vast deal to do yet , and the work of installation will be so enormous that the buildings and spaces should be made ready just as soon as possible . While the $2,500,000 of Government money is being utilized to the best possible advantage , there should be vigorous efforts made to raise the needed balance of funds as speedily as the thing can be done . There should be a new concentration of energy and of " push , " lest Chicago find itself overwhelmed next May'svith an unmanageable chaos , where there should be completeness and order to greet the first expectant visitor .
