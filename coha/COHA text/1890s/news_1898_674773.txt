txt The embargo upon the exportation of coal without the permission of the Government is a most necessary act of war . The Spanish ships on this side of the water have hitherto been largely furnished from our mines . If the embargo is enforced , it seems that the war must be fought out , upon the part of Spain , upon such coal as she has already collected upon this side of the water , or rather upon such part of it as she can make available . The coal at Havana is not part of her " visible supply . " She can not get at it without breaking our blockade , and she can not do that without defeating the blockading squadron . The supply at Puerfb Rico is thus far available to her , but it is not to be supposed that it will remain so . In fact , the coal for her naval vessels in service on this side must very soon , if not at once , be brought from Europe . It is not to be supposed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoy , and on the other hand it is evident that her fleet is not sufficient to afford such a detachment as would be required to keep open communication for the colliers . This dilemma is perhaps the most urgent and grievous of the many troubles which confront Spain . It is made more terrible by the announcement of Mr. BALFOUR in the House of Commons yesterday that the precedents would be strictly followed . Such a following would require of Great Britain to refuse to supply the naval vessel of a belligerent with more than enough coal to take her to her nearest home port , and that the same ship shall not be allowed to coal at the same port oftener than once in three months . A nice question might arise in the case of a Spanish ship seeking to coal in the British West Indies , the question whether her nearest " home port " was in Spain or in Cuba . Cuba is still nominally a Spanish possession , and if the nearest home port were construed to mean the nearest Spanish port , this might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would take her from any foreign port in the West Indies to one of these would not suffice to enable her to do much cruising or fighting . The question of coal , as we have already pointed out , is the essential question in relation to Spanish privateering . The nations which have agreed among themselves to abolish privateering are not likely to stultify themselves by allowing the sale of coal to Spanish privateers . The issue of letters of marque to a Spanish merchantman which can get no coal can amount to nothing . We have reason to rejoice , however , both that we ourselves have renounced our right to fit out privateers , and that Spain has refused to renounce that right . The difference between her action and ours inclines all the maritime nations to take sides with us on that point . Moreover , such privateering as Spain may be able to begin can hardly fail to embroil her very soon with the neutral nations whose ships she may make the pretension of seizing for enemy 's goods .
