txt For the first time lira career of much utterance Mr. GEORGE 'S utterances are vague . It is in vain that friend or foe ( if he has any foes ) will search his speech of Tuesday night to find one clear statement of a single specific doctrine , or purpose , or desire . This is very unlike Mr. GEORGE , who has always had , not only the courage of his convictions , but the mental vigor and acuteness to put his convictions clearly and sharply before the public . Now he borrows the phrase which DAVID B. HILL long ago made commonplace : " I. am a Democrat , " and like the retired author of the phrase , refuses to say what kind of Democrat he is . He even goes further and declares that he is neither of the known kinds of Democrat ? " not a Silver Democrat nor a Gold Democrat . " Then he surrounds himself with a cloud of rhetoric as brilliant and impenetrable as the golden cloud of the Homeric Jove , and declares himself " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the great truth is self-evident that all men are created equal . " Probably Mr. GEORGE is oppressed with the knowledge that if he were elected he could do nothing to carry out the doctrines he holds , but which he now withholds from public attention . Nevertheless there are things involved in this election quite independent of those doctrines as to which we should expect Mr. GEORGE to have distinct notions and to be willing to exert some influence . One of them is the right and the need of the people of Greater New York that their affairs should be managed in their own interest solely , and not in the interest of . any party , Democratic , or Republican , or Socialist . By his appeal to Democratic partisan feeling he beclouds this issue . and for that we are sorry . It tends to mislead his followers and it robs his own position of that manly independence which he has heretofore shown .
