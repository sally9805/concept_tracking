txt There can be no dispute that the death of the Czar of Russia at this time is a great loss , not only to Russia , and not only to Europe , but to the whole world . He has wielded the immense power of his hereditary station in the interest of justice and in the interest of peace . The power itself there is reason to believe that he looked upon as a sacred trust , which it would be base in him either to share or to abdicate . Surely there can have been little in a career so beset with political difficulties and with personal dangers as his to make it attractive or enjoyable to a man of little ambition , of simple tastes , and of an affectionate disposition .. It was as a duty , and not as a pleasure , that he discharged the functions of his Czarship and exerted its enormous power . Indeed , the very virtues of the late Czar , and the painful suspense of all Europe whether these virtues will reappear in his successor , emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power should be held by any man . The nation in which one man can hold it can not be allowed to be a civilized nation . The Emperor of Germany possesses far more power than it Is safe for a nation to intrust to any magistrate , hereditary or elective ; and the amount of power left to the Emperor in Germany is a proof that Germany is not so advanced and civilized politically as it is in every other respect . A headstrong , quarrelsome man might do great mischief as Emperor of Germany ; but nothing like the mischief such a man might do as Czar of Russia . Theories of government do not make the difference . The Kaiser can talk as boastfully about divine right as the Czar , on occasion , and in theory , at least in his own theory , he is as autocratic , and the representative institutions of Germany have been conceded by him as a boon , not extorted from him by the people as a right . The main difference between the political conditions of the two countries is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened public , in Germany , and that its opinion is almost as likely to decide public questions as the public opinion of England or France . In either of these countries the monarch might theoretically be a Czar , without making so very much practical difference in the conduct of affairs , unless he were also a maniac . He would still govern according to public opinion . But in Russia . there is no way of finding out what public opinion is . Every free expression of it is carefully and completely suppressed , instead of being anxiously watched and consulted by the Government . And - We suppression of free speech and a free press has had the effect of destroying public opinion itself , or , rather , of not permitting it to be born . The Government is still , as much as in Voltire 's time , a despotism tempered by assassination . All this has made the illness and incapacity of the Czar a fact of more moment in the politics of Europe than a like incapacitation would be of any other man in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor are of European importance , and nothing is publicly known about them . Russia has an " entente " with France simply because th:2 Czar willed it . Wi11 the coming Czar ratify that understanding , or will he break it and unite himself with Germany ? Nobody knows ; nobody has any trustworthy means of guessing what course he will think the interests of Russia  --  that is to say , his personal interests  --  require of him . And yet upon his decision all questions t of European politics will largely depend . ' A change in the policy of Russia has , in times past , affected all the affairs of Europe . Prussia owes her start in life so to speak , to an opportune death in the Russian imperial family . There is , every reason to believe that Frederick , the Great would have been finally crushed by the coalition against him , after his great defense by the Russians at . Kunersdorf , the entry of the victors into Berlin , and the Russian occupation of Pomerania . He was saved only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the accession of his devoted admirer , Peter III . There is nothing to hinder a like change in the policy of Russia now , and ? Europe must await impatiently a disclosure of the views and purposes of the coming Czar .
