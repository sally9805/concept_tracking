Main text Scene : A room in the Summertop Hotel . A chambermaid is discovered putting the last touches to the bed which she has made up in an alcove . A stout gentleman appears at the door and looks in . I THE STOUT GENTLEMAN AND THE CHAMBERMAID The Stout Gentleman : The Stout Gentleman Putting anybody in here to-night , Mary ? I 'm just going to turn in below , and I 've been out with some friends , and I guess I 'm pretty tired . You all know how I am when I 'm sleeping light ; and I 'm going to sleep hard to-night . I 'm afraid I should make it lively for anybody over me . The Chambermaid : The Chambermaid Oh , that 's all right , sor . There ai n't annybody in by the last train but a gentleman and his wife , and the clerk 's put them into No. 10 . I 'm just gettin ' the room ready for a party that 's comin ' to-morrow morning for the day . The Stout Gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I ought to tell you . The Chambermaid : The Chambermaid All right , sor . Slape as harred as ye pl'ase . Ye wo n't harrum annyone here . After a final glance round the room : Do n't you worry , sir . The Stout Gentleman , The Stout Gentleman going out : No . I always leave that to them . Well , good-night , Mary . The Chambermaid : The Chambermaid Good-night , sor . She follows him out . II MR . AND MRS . JULIAN TRENMORE AND THE NIGHT CLERK Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Yes , this will do nicely . I do n't see why you did n't put us here at once . She looks about the room which the night clerk has shown her into , and sinks down upon a sofa with a deep sigh of satisfaction . Mr. Julian Trenmore , her husband , draws a fainter sigh of relief , and puts down on the table in the centre of the room his dress-suit case , and a bundle of shawls and umbrellas ; he finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The night clerk , who has stood near the door , burdened with a valise , two smaller handbags , a variety of wraps , a parasol , and a kodak camera , until Mrs. Trenmore shall have expressed her content with the room , now begins to place these things on the floor , and is about to retreat when her voice arrests him . May I ask why you did n't put us here at once ? The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk Put you here ? Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Yes , put us here ; give us this room in the first place , instead of the room you did give us ? I should really like to know . The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk The other room was only one flight up , and  --  Mrs. Trenmore Mrs. Trenmore with vehemence : Right over the kitchen , where they were washing up the last dishes and singing and talking and clashing the crockery and knives ! And if we kept the windows shut the heat was suffocating , and if we opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warm dishwater . You heard us say that we had come for a quiet night , and a breath of pure air , and that we wanted a cool room away from all the noises  --  Mr. Trenmore , Mr. Trenmore with spirit that does not seem constant in him : You heard me say so when I registered . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore And yet you put us in that wretched place , where we began to swelter and stifle from the first instant , and the clatter gave me a headache that I shall not get over for a week . Mr. Trenmore : Mr. Trenmore You said that No. 10 was the only room you had left . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore And here , only one flight further up , was this delicious place , absolutely empty , and as cool and quiet as the grave ; with windows opening on a garden , and every breath of air thick with the syringas , or honeysuckles , or whatever they are . Now , why did n't you do it in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room by examining it in every part ; she flings back the curtain of an alcove , and discloses a snowy bed . Oh , I could sleep for ages in that bed ! Then she advances suddenly upon the night clerk , who retires before her demand . I should simply like to know why you did n't . Is it the rule of the house to keep people out of a good room if you can possibly find a bad one for them ? Do you take a pleasure in thwarting and harassing people ? When people come and tell you that they are sick with the noise and heat of New York , and that they have run out for a few nights simply to save their lives , and you see them fairly dropping dead before you , do you like to give them a room where a salamander could n't breathe and an adder would be stunned ? Mr. Trenmore : Mr. Trenmore You heard me say so when I registered , and you told me that No. 10 was the only  --  Mrs. Trenmore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to the tone of withering irony : Or do you merely prefer to wait up till the porter and call-boys have gone to bed , and then move the people yourself into something decent , when they have got perfectly desperate , and wo n't stand it any longer ? I should like to know what your motive really is . I should like to know whether you have been following a rule of the house , or whether there is some mystery about it all that you ca n't explain , or whether you simply did not care to tell the truth . And after what you have made us suffer , I think I have a right to know . Mr. Trenmore : Mr. Trenmore Yes ! Why did n't you show us this room at once ? The Night Clerk , The Night Clerk backing into the doorway , and making good his retreat as he speaks : I  --  I  --  forgot this room . III MR . AND MRS . TRENMORE Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore with contemptuous incredulity : Forgot ! Forgot , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot it in the world , and now to have the impudence  --  He was keeping it for somebody whom he could n't impose upon with such a wretched hole as No. 10 ! He saw that he could put off anything upon you ! They always do . You never browbeat them or bully them , and so I always have to submit to any sort of  --  Oh , I wish I was a man , and had to do the registering ! I do n't think  --  Forgot this room ! Call him back , Julian ! I wo n't stand it . I ca n't . If he thinks that I am going to put up with any such paltry subterfuge  --  I 'll call him myself . She plunges towards the electric button in the wall , but before she can get her finger upon it , her husband intercepts her and restrains her in a coaxing embrace . Mr. Trenmore : Mr. Trenmore No , no , my dear ! Let it go till morning and have it out with him then . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house , and we have n't lost so very much time , after all , You did n't let the grass grow under your feet in No. 10 : we 're well out of it , and you 've punished that poor fellow enough . Leave him to his little mystery , or his hotel convention , or his plain lie , for the night , and make him suffer a little more in the morning . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore But he wo n't be on duty in the morning ; we ca n't see him again till to-morrow night , and  --  Mr. Trenmore : Mr. Trenmore Then we 'll wait till to-morrow night , and see him . But remember , now , that we came out for a rest , and not for a fight , though I believe you 'd rather fight than rest any time , you 're such a little bundle of pluck . Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore half persuaded and with a touch of fondness : Oh , if you had more pluck , dearest , I need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , and that makes me furious . Mr. Trenmore : Mr. Trenmore I know it does , and I assure you I appreciate it . But  --  Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore more and more softened : It was for your sake that I wanted to do it . When I thought how worn out with the heat you were , and how you had n't been sleeping for days and weeks almost , and then thought of the cruelty of that wretch in putting us into No. 10 , when all the time he had this beautiful , big , cool , quiet room standing vacant and perfectly idle , I  --  Mr. Trenmore : Mr. Trenmore I understand , and I 'm very grateful , but now I 'm very sleepy , and  --  Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore I 'm not . I never was so wide awake in my life . I could sit up all night , just to enjoy the quietness and sweetness . I do believe it 's rested me more to give that creature a piece of my mind than sleeping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , while he drops into a chair . Oh , this lovely garden ! And this divine silence ! How do you suppose we did n't see the garden from No. 10 ? Or was that wretch keeping it a secret , too , along with this room ? They do n't often have a garden , even in a summer hotel . There was one in that hotel at Plattsburgh , do n't you remember ? But the locomotives at the station under the hill seemed to be scampering up and down the garden paths the whole night . And here it 's so still ! You can almost hear yourself think . Dearest , if you ca n't sleep here , I do n't know where you can sleep . Just come and see this garden , and smell it . She turns her face over her shoulder at him . Mr. Trenmore , Mr. Trenmore yawning : In the morning , my dear . We 'll take the night clerk out among the roses and rub his nose into the pinks till he gives the true reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather go to bed . Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore returning to him : You are sleepy ! That 's because you kept your temper . If you 'd been as mad as I was  --  But I 'm not angry , now , a bit . I 'm simply bewildered . What can the mystery be ? There must be some mystery ! That fellow never forgot this room in the world . There must be something uncanny about it . Do you suppose it 's haunted ? Perhaps somebody 's committed suicide in it ! Do you suppose there 's a back fence that will have cats on it later ? Mr. Trenmore : Mr. Trenmore They 'll have to get up early if they 're going to be much later . He looks at his watch . It 's nearly one o'clock . Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore going to the window and looking out again : I ca n't see any back fence . She leans further over the window sill and peers down . We seem to be in a kind of wing , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , and there 's a room just under us , but the ground floor is an open veranda . I never heard of cats coming on verandas , and I do n't believe that there can be anything to disturb us . It 's as still as still can be , now , anyway . That perfume  --  she inhales it vigorously  --  is from a honeysuckle that perfectly walls in one side of the veranda ; you ought to see it in the moonlight ; it looks as if it had been snowed on , it 's so full of blossoms . While she talks , Mr. Trenmore drowses in his chair , and his head drops on his breast . No , there 's not the least danger of cats ; I 'm satisfied of that . Perhaps cat-birds ; but they do n't caterwaul , do they ? She looks round , and sees her husband asleep . Poor Julian ! I do n't see how he can be sleepy , such a lovely night as this , in this exquisite room , and with this delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my ears . Not a sound , anywhere ! The last train must be in , and the station is a mile from here , anyhow , and every one of those kitchen girls has giggled herself off to bed ; there is n't a cat ; and  --  She starts , and listens ; she puts her head out and then draws it in and listens again . Julian , what 's that ? Trenmore , Trenmore staggering to his feet : What 's what ? He makes some vague passes through the air and tries to rouse himself . Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore listening : That  --  sound . Do n't you hear it ? No , there it 's stopped ! Did you make it ? Trenmore : Trenmore Make what ? Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore The sound . Laughing , Of course you did ! You had just dropped off , and you were sno  --  Hark ! There it is again ! Then it was n't you ! Now it 's stopped again . No , there it goes ! I knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , now . A low hissing noise , coming and going regularly , like the first respirations of a locomotive in starting , makes itself heard . Do n't you hear it ? Trenmore : Trenmore Yes , certainly , I hear it . It 's nothing but the engineer trying the steam in his boilers ; they have to keep the steam going all night , in these hotels . The boilers are in the basement , and it 's coming up outside . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Why , of course ! Well , it does take you to think things out , Julian ! Do you suppose he 'll keep doing it long ? Trenmore : Trenmore I do n't believe so  --  Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore There ! He 's stopped again , already . Now , he 's beginning again . She listens . But he ca n't be going to keep it up long , and we must n't mind it . I 'm sleepy , too , and  --  He seems to be putting on coal , now ! Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken noise is heard , and the hissing ceases . Such queer lumps of sound ! I believe I prefer the hissing . It 's stopped . It 's all over . Now , my dear , it 's high time that  --  Oh , what is he doing ? Trenmore , Trenmore listening : Sawing kindling-wood , I should say . Listening again : That 's it ! But I do n't see why he should be planing it . And the plane seems to catch in knots , and  --  He goes to the window and puts out his head . Everything 's quiet outside . I thought they might be chopping ice under the window . I 've been in hotels where they do it all night ; but  --  Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore tragically : It is n't coming in through the window . It 's coming up through the floor ! Trenmore : Trenmore Through the floor ? Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Yes , do n't you hear it ? Trenmore : Trenmore Oh , that 's merely the register , bringing the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no register . I tell you it 's in the room under this . Do n't you hear it ? Trenmore , Trenmore listening carefully : It does seem to be coming through the floor . Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore sternly : What are they doing ? Trenmore , Trenmore listening and reporting with analytical conscientiousness : Well , they seem to be letting off steam . And  --  putting on coal . And  --  sawing kindling . And  --  planing it . And  --  catching the plane in knots . And  --  chopping ice . And  --  now , they 're emptying out potatoes on the floor . And  --  making hooks and hunks of noise . And  --  choking , and catching their breath , and  --  Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore They 're killing somebody ! I tell you they are ; and we shall both be subpoenaed and cross-examined , and I do n't know what all . Go down and  --  There , it 's stopped again ; it 's all perfectly silent ; they 're every one of them dead ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ! They 're beginning to struggle again . Oh , Julian , if you have any love for me at all , you will go  --  No , I ca n't let you ! They will murder you too . But call  --  call that wretched night clerk , and make him go . I 'll ring  --  She whirls away to press the bell button , but he catches her by the wrist , and pulls her over towards the floor with him where he stoops listening . Trenmore : Trenmore It is n't murder  --  It 's something much worse  --  It 's  --  Do n't you hear ? Listen ! She stoops and listens with him ; then she lifts herself and faces him . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore You do n't mean to tell me that it 's some one  --  snoring ? He nods solemnly . Julian , I ca n't believe it ! That any human being is making those horrible sheets and spurts , and chips , and shavings , and lumps , and hooks , and bounces of noise in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can tell you it 's nothing of the kind . It 's not snoring ; it 's murder ! It 's  --  She listens again , stooping lower with her ear toward the floor , and then facing him with awful calm : I do believe it is  --  what you say . And now , what are you going to do about it ? Trenmore , Trenmore in a ghostly whisper : I do n't see what we can do , exactly . I suppose we shall have to wait till he stops . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore And suppose he does n't stop ? Suppose he never stops ? Trenmore shrugs . Do n't tell me you 're not going to do anything ! That you 're going to submit  --  that you 're going to lie down passively under the worst snoring that there ever was ! Then I 'm not ! We sha n't get a wink of sleep the whole night . It 's an outrage , and I wo n't endure it ! I 'm going to ring for that  --  She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercepts her again ; the noises continue in their complexity . Let me go , Julian ! Now , I understand why he was so loath to give us this room , and I shall let him know what we think of his putting us  --  Trenmore : Trenmore We do n't want to make a scene , my dear . We do n't want to be ridiculous . Let us think whether we ca n't do something ourselves to stop it . They both stand silent and motionless , trying to think ; the noises continue as before . If there was only a register we might call down through it . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore But there is no register . I told you there was no register in the beginning . Indeed , if there was a register , do n't you suppose I would bang on it till he was glad to stop ? Go down and knock on his door ! Trenmore : Trenmore Do you think that would do ? I 'm afraid it might rouse the house . I might go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , and what  --  what  --  Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore impatiently : Well , what ? Trenmore : Trenmore What if it was a lady ? Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Nonsense ! No woman in the world could make such a noise as that . I tell you it 's a man , and you 're perfectly safe . Trenmore , Trenmore dubiously : I do n't know about the safety . If it 's a woman it would be scandalous , and if it 's a man it might be dangerous . He might come to the door to ask what I wanted , and then what could I say ? You ca n't tell a man that he 's been snoring , and you 've waked him . And if it was a woman came to the door  --  I 've heard them on the sleeping-cars sometimes , and if it should happen to be a woman  --  think of the talk ! No , my dear , it wo n't do . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Then we must thump on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know ! That 's rather serious . I rather think we 'll have to have patience . He ca n't keep it up all night ; he must wake himself by and by . Let 's wait a while longer . I do n't believe we 've any right to thump on the floor . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Right or wrong , I 'm going to do it . Has he any right to keep on making noises that raise the roof and shake the whole house , and we not lift a hand against it ? Give me those umbrellas ! She makes a dash for the umbrellas on the table , but he interposes . Trenmore : Trenmore But if it should be a woman  --  Mrs. Trenmore Mrs. Trenmore Oh , I wish it was a woman . Horrid thing ! Will you let me have those umbrellas , Julian , or do you wish me to go home to mamma ? What a shame to treat your own wife so ! You care more for some horrible , vulgar , common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole hotel with her puffing and  --  She slips round behind him , and seizes the umbrellas . There ! Now , I 'll see if I ca n't do something to stop her making a perfect hippopotamus of herself . Trenmore : Trenmore But I do n't say she is a woman , my dear ! Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore No matter . I do n't care whether she 's a woman or a man . If I can only find the place right over his head , I shall thump so that she 'll be glad to  --  She goes about listening at different points in the room , and trying to locate the noises , bending over , and putting her ear to the floor ; he follows her , adapting himself to her movements in vain entreaty of posture and gesture . Trenmore : Trenmore Do n't do it , my dear ; do n't do it ! Consider the uproar it 's going to make ! We shall have people running in from all over the house asking what 's the matter . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . We 're in a public house , and we have no right to make a noise and wake everybody up . They can arrest us , I believe . Do n't , darling ! Do have a little patience . He 'll soon wake , I know he will ! Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore unheeding : The sound seems to be everywhere . Oh , how cruel , Julian , to leave it all to me ! She rises and glares reproachfully at him . Help me to find the place right over the dreadful thing 's head . She ought to be ashamed ! Trenmore : Trenmore But if she 's a man , he 'll make an awful row at being waked . Very likely he 'll come up here and  --  Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Oh , I should just like to have her . She goes about as before , stooping and listening . I believe I 've got the place now . She stoops lower and listens . Yes , this is it . He 's right under it , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thump  --  Trenmore : Trenmore But , consider , my dear ! Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore desperately : I shall not consider . I have a right to save my own life ; and  --  Will you lift the rug , here , Julian , or must I do everything ? Oh , very well then ; I 'll lift it . Trenmore , Trenmore reluctantly lifting the rug : I 'll do it , my dear ; but  --  but  --  thump softly . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Thump softly ! Snore softly ! She raises the umbrella and brings the point down with all her force . There ! I think that she 'll hear that , unless she 's dead , and I know she is n't dead . She batters furiously with the umbrella , which goes to pieces in her hands . Give me another umbrella . Julian . Trenmore : Trenmore But had n't you better wait and see , my dear , if he wo n't  --  Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore snatching the other umbrella from the table , and returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression on her . She beats and thumps on the floor till the second umbrella gives way ; she flings the fragments from her . Oh , if I only had a poker ! She glares around the room . But of course in a summer hotel , like this , there 's no fireplace , and no poker nearer than the kitchen . Why did n't you think to bring your cane ? Trenmore , Trenmore soothingly : It would n't have done any good , my dear . If umbrellas wo n't wake him , canes  --  Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Then give me my parasol ! Trenmore : Trenmore But your parasol could n't bear it a moment ! Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore seizing it : No matter , I ca n't either . There ! She dispatches the parasol with a single blow , flings the fragments from her , and turns to her husband : Bring your dress-suit case ! It 's good and hard , and  --  Trenmore : Trenmore But , my dear ! I do n't want to thump the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Trenmore with frenzy : You want me to do it ? Very well , then , I will . She reaches for the dress-suit case , but he puts it behind him . Trenmore : Trenmore There ! I 'll do it . Where is the place ? You 've ruined the floor ! Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore No matter about the floor . Thump . Trenmore blindly obeys . Now , that is something like thumping . If that wo n't wake her , nothing will . And if you had thought of your dress-suit case in the first place , I need n't have destroyed our two umbrellas and my Paris parasol . But , no ! I have to think of everything . Thump with the corner ! After half a dozen blows with the corner of the case , it springs open , and the dress suit , with a shirt , collars , cuffs , ties , and handkerchiefs flies out over the floor . That comes of your not locking it ! But never mind the things , now . I never wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but you always will , even if you do n't expect to meet a soul you know . Thump ! She sinks panting into a chair . Trenmore , Trenmore erect ing himself and standing with the open empty case in his hand , listening : No . He 's stopped . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Listen ! I do believe we have stopped her . I knew we could do it . Oh , we have ! What a rest ! How deliciously silent ! Oh , Julian , I never can be grateful enough to you . He looks round at his scattered garments . I 'll pick them up for you , as soon as can I get my breath . Trenmore : Trenmore I wish you 'd get my breath , too , while you 're at it . He sinks panting into a chair . And look at my dress-suit case ! He gazes ruefully down at the ruin . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Do n't mind it , dearest . I 'll get you a new one for your birthday . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and I did n't know what I should get you , and now it 's a perfect inspiration . Oh , how quiet it is ! Does n't it seem too good to be true , dearest ? Now , wo n't you always trust my judgment after this , a little ? I know that I 'm impetuous at times , and I do take the whip hand and the bit in my teeth , now and then , but only when it 's absolutely necessary . Better put down the window , dear . We 're both overheated , and we ought to keep out of the draft till we cool off . Oh , what a rest ! I really had begun to despair ; and it has cost us something . Your umbrella is ruined , and so is mine ; and my parasol is a perfect wreck ; and I suppose the floor  --  But if it 's a man we can make him pay for the floor , ca n't we ? Or we can just pull back the rug over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about such things , and I merely suggested it ; I 'm sure I do n't want to do anything wrong about it , if you do n't . Oh , I 'm so happy ! I 'm not the least sleepy any more ; I feel as if I could stay up all night and enjoy the quiet more and more , every minute . Oh , how still it is ! Ca n't you fairly hear the stillness ? Trenmore lifts his head and stands in a listening attitude . What is it ? Trenmore : Trenmore Nothing . I  --  Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore You what ? Trenmore : Trenmore Nothing . But I  --  did n't you  --  hear something ? Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Only the singing of the silence in my ears . Trenmore : Trenmore Yes , it must be that But  --  did n't it begin that way before ? Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore It ? Oh , Julian , you do n't  --  Trenmore : Trenmore No , no ! It 's stopped . It was the si  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepens , and passes into the effect of escaping steam . It becomes like the respiration of a locomotive in starting . It changes into the sound of stoking an engine . It changes again into the sound of sawing wood , of planing knotty lumber , of chopping ice , of pouring out potatoes , and ends in lumps and hooks and bounces of sound . Trenmore turns a ghastly face upon his wife ; she hides her face in her hands and bursts into tears . I suppose he merely turned over and got a new grip . Mrs , Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Oh , dear , oh , dear ! What shall we do now , Julian ? Trenmore : Trenmore Shall I thump again ? Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore It would n't be any use . She 'd just turn over again and get another new grip . Oh , I know it 's a woman , now , and she 's doing it to spite us because we woke her . I shall die ; yes , I shall die ! Oh , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever hear anything like it before ? Now say if you did ? She stretches her hands piteously toward him . Trenmore : Trenmore Never ! not even on a sleeping-car , and I 've listened to a whole car-load of drummers before now . Suddenly : But I 'm not going to stand it ! He dashes his empty dress-suit case wildly to the floor , and jumps up and down on the bare space , while she weeps silently . I 'm getting a little mad myself now . The noises below continue unaffected by his activities , and he flies at the electric bell button . I 'm going to have that scoundrelly clerk up ! I am going to know why he puts two unoffending strangers into the loft of a boiler factory . I am going to make him send the proprietor . I am going to have the police . I am going to rouse the house . I am going to raise the roof . He strides furiously up and down , kicking the broken umbrellas and shirts and collars out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath . Oh , blow away , you old grampus ! Your time is short ! Get in your work ; let off your steam , put on your coal , saw your kindling , plane your boards , chop your ice , pour out your potatoes , make your hooks and hunks ! Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore clasping her hands in admiration : Oh , dearest you are mad , are n't you ? How sweet it is of you ! But Julian , could n't you  --  I know it 's against your principles , and you never have ; but just for my sake  --  swear ? IV THE NIGHT CLERK , MR . AND MRS . TRENMORE The Night Clerk , The Night Clerk tapping on the door jamb , and extending a pitcher through the open doorway : Ice-water ? Trenmore : Trenmore Ice what ? The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk Water . You rang three times . Trenmore : Trenmore Did I ? Then I meant to ring three hundred times . What did you mean by putting us in here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like No. 10 , and I changed you to the only room we had . Ai n't you comfortable ? Trenmore : Trenmore Comf  --  ! Do you hear that ? Do n't pretend you do n't hear it ? I wo n't stand it ! He seizes the clerk by the arm and pulls him over , so as to bring his head close to the floor . Now do you hear it ? The Night Clerk , The Night Clerk rising , as Trenmore releases him : If you say so . Yes , sir , I think I did hear a noise of some kind . Trenmore : Trenmore Oh , you did ! And what do you think it is ? The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk Well , sir , it 's no use trying to disguise it , I suppose . It 's the gentleman in Room 45 , right under you here . That 's the way he always does . Trenmore , Trenmore choking with rage : And you put us in here , over a man that always does like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Room 45 , and wake that man up , and tell him  --  Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore I knew it could n't be a woman . No woman could be so lost to shame . Trenmore , Trenmore harshly : Never mind about that now . To the clerk : You go down  --  The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk Oh , I could n't do that . I would n't have the right to call up any guest that way . Trenmore : Trenmore No right to call up a porpoise  --  The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk No , sir . Not if he was a guest . And especially No. 45 . You see it 's like this . He 's here for the summer , and he told us fair and square , when he came , that he had this  --  habit ; and we arranged to put him off here in the L , with nobody under him , and only this one room over him  --  you must have noticed that we came here through a sort of gallery ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may say  --  Trenmore : Trenmore And you mean to tell me that we 're trespassing on a locomotive , wood-sawing , ice-chopping , potato-pouring stoker like that ? The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk No , sir , not exactly ; we can use this room at our own risk , and we do use it under certain conditions , when there 's no other vacant . You see , there is n't much danger , if we can get a transient in here , and get him asleep before No. 45 comes in . Then the transient sleeps through , and No. 45 does n't disturb him . But sometimes we do get stuck . Now , to-night , for instance : when I put you in here , I supposed 45 was out , and would n't be in for an hour , and that would give you plenty of time to get in ahead of him , but he must have stolen a march on me . I do n't blame you for being mad ; I should be just so myself , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , and I had to take the chances with you . He listens and adds , sociably : He 's in great form , to-night , ai n't he ? Whole band , as you may say . Notice how he gets in that trombone tremolo every now and then ? It 's grand  --  in its way , I mean . The clerk sits down and listens with an air of critical appreciation . Oh , he 's an orchestra , and no mistake ! I never heard any thing like it . Whole Wagner opera , ai n't he ? He appeals for sympathy to Mrs. Trenmore , but failing , addresses himself to Trenmore . Well , sir , you wo n't hardly believe it , but there ai n't anything I like better , when the house is all settled down , than to take my cigar and get into a good easy-chair on the veranda under him , and just listen . No danger of my dropping off to sleep and missing a bell ! No , sir . He looks after that . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . He listens : There 's a kind of a vox humana stop that he gets in , now and then , after he 's been dining pretty well , that beats everything . I wish he would just try it once so you could hear it . He listens : No , that ai n't it ; that 's his olian harp attachment . Some nights I 've heard him do a symphony ; kind of soft and low , to begin with , like the wind in the leaves , and shepherds dancing ; then drums in the distance , and cannon firing ; then the tramp of soldiers , and army wagons creaking and horses neighing ; then musket-firing along the whole line , and peasants running off and women crying . That usually wakes him up , and he turns over for a fresh start . He listens : I do n't know as I ever heard him get in more style than he is doing to-night . Kind of a diapason , ai n't it ? Notice those high notes ? And that bass ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with the boys , somewhere , tonight . What a swing he 's got to him ! Like the wedding march in Lohengrin , ai n't it ? There ! By George , he 's stopped , and I thought he was just coming to that passage in the Intermezzo ; I was keeping it for a kind of surprise for you . He is such an undependable fellow , though . Never twice alike . He 's so quiet you 'd think he was dead now , would n't you ? He listens with a rapt air . Trenmore , Trenmore grimly : Do you suppose he is dead ? That he 's stopped for good ? The Night Clerk , The Night Clerk shaking his head : I would n't like to trust him . He may begin in another minute , or he may take a rest  --  like when the orchestra goes out for beer , you know  --  and you wo n't hear from him for a quarter of an hour , maybe . But he 's uncertain . Trenmore : Trenmore And what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Night Clerk Well , sir , I 'm sorry , but there is n't anything else except No. 10 . I guess that 's all quiet now ; in fact , I know it is ; and I 've had it airing  --  Trenmore : Trenmore Oh , then , you expected we should have to go back , did you ? The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk Not exactly . But I thought , in case anything happened  --  If he gets in his work first , they generally want to move . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Well , it 's a wicked imposition , and I 'm not going to stand it . I 'm going to stay here . Does he never stop for good ? The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk He does sometimes ; or as good as for good . He wakes himself up so that he ca n't sleep , and then he turns out and smokes a cigar , and that gives you a chance to drop off . He may have done it now . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and started in for a smoke , why , you may drop off , you know , and make out a splendid night 's rest yet . Guess you 're so tired he would n't wake you , if you hurried . But , as I say , it 's all a chance . Mrs. Trenmore : Mrs. Trenmore Then we will take the chance , Julian . I am not going to be driven back to that noisy , pantry-smelling  --  Oh , he 's beginning again ! She sinks into her chair with a desolate wail , and hides her face in her hands . The Night Clerk , The Night Clerk sadly , while the noises successively make themselves heard in all their variety : I was afraid of it . You see , if he 's been dining more than usual , he ca n't quite wake himself ; he makes a strike for it , and that gives you the idea that he has done it . But  --  He shakes his head compassionately . I can understand just how the lady feels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore springing to her feet , and confronting him : Then do something ! Julian , go with him , and see if it 's quiet in No. 10 , and see if it 's cool ; and if it is  --  No , do n't take your things ! You can come back for them , if it 's all right , and then I can come . Trenmore and the night clerk fly at her command , and she remains alone amid the sounds from below . At first she is absorbed in the interest of her husband 's quest ; then she becomes aware of the sounds . Oh , yes , keep on , you heartless , shameless thing ! Puff away , you cruel wretch ! I wonder what you look like , anyway ! I should just like to see what sort of fiend in human shape you really are ! Keep on , do ! She stamps on the bare floor above the sleeper 's head , while he steadily works away from locomotive fizzing to wood-sawing , ice-chopping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , with cheeks hanging down , and a red fat neck , and pudgy hands  --  oh , I know what you look like ! And I hate you , hate you , hate you ! If you had a spark of humanity , or the least remorse , or any gallantry at all , you 'd stop . But you just take a pleasure in driving a helpless woman from her room , great oaf ! She begins to gather up the broken umbrellas and to put Trenmore 's things back into his dress-suit case , whimpering : You 've made me break our two silk paragon frame umbrellas , that cost five dollars apiece , and my parasol that I brought from Paris ; but much you care , you big , ugly  --  I do n't know what ! And Julian 's dress-suit case is perfectly ruined , and we shall have to pay for the floor over your head , you hideous monster . Oh , rumble and puff and whistle away ! If you had any self-respect  --  But I do n't care what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and you ca n't spoil my rest any more . I just like to listen to you and despise you ; I take a pleasure in it ; and I hope you 'll go on snorting and wheezing to your heart 's content . It does n't matter to me , now ; I 'm safe . Keep on , and show how gross and vulgar you are ! I just like to laugh at you . Ha , ha , ha ! I only wish you knew I was listening to you . Oh , go on ; go on ! I shall leave you now and wait outside ; you can have the place to yourself . She goes out , and instantly returns . But do n't suppose I 'm going to leave you sweetly sleeping . She takes up the water-pitcher , and smashes it on the floor . There ! I guess that will make you turn over . She goes and returns again , to follow the pitcher with the bowl . And that , too . She goes out , and returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like that , for a change . She drags the washstand from the wall and bumps it up and down . And that , and that , and that ! Oh , it has n't troubled him a bit ! I surely shall go mad , if this keeps on ! Yes  --  Julian , Julian ! Come back and save me ! Where are you , Ju  --  VI TRENMORE , THE NIGHT CLERK , MRS . TRENMORE Trenmore , Trenmo re returning with the night clerk : It 's all right , my dear . No. 10 is as cool as a cucumber and as sweet as a pink . Mrs. Trenmore , Mrs. Trenmore frantically : Oh , I do n't care what it is ! If they were washing all the dishes in the world under it , and it was as hot and stuffy and smelly as  --  as  --  the pantry of a steamer , I 'd go . Only take me out of this ! My spirit is broken . She falls upon his shoulder and he slowly trails her from the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre pares to follow them , with a cursory glance at the wreckage . VII THE NIGHT CLERK AND THE STOUT GENTLEMAN The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk She got in some good work , but she could n't disturb him . Oh , he 's a bird ! Hullo ! The stout gentleman appears at the door in a varied deshabille of pajama jacket and black trousers ; he wears a silk hat . The Stout Gentleman : The Stout Gentleman What 's been going on here ? The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk Going on ? Oh , nothing ! Did you hear anything ? The Stout Gentleman : The Stout Gentleman I heard a cat-fight , or a cyclone ! The Night Clerk : The Night Clerk Ha , ha , ha ! Oh , no ; oh , no ! You must have been dreaming . Sorry you waked youself up . The Stout Gentleman : The Stout Gentleman I have n't been to sleep yet . But now , look here ! I 've been out with some friends tonight , and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should make it lively for them . The Clerk , The Clerk following him to the door : Oh , I sha n't put anybody in here . Do n't be afraid of that ! And I hope you wo n't hear any more cyclones or cat-fights  --  ah , ha , ha ! Good-night , good-night , sir !
