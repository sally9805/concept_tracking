txt The State Department has received from Consul General Mason , at Frankfort-on-the-Main , Germany , a translation of an article appearing in the Frankfurter Zeitung , written by a German military critic , on the results of the war between the United States and Spain . It is as follows : " The conclusion of peace which ends the Spanish-American war marks a new epoch in history not only for the United States , but likewise for Europe . The United States has taken an important step toward the exclusive control of the American continent ; it has also reached beyond that and claimed its share in the conduct of the world 's affairs . " Since it now controls the West Indies , the construction of the Nicaragua Canal no longer will be delayed . Then with the eastern and western portions of the country in union they will be brought into closer relations , which will be of important significance , not only for the commerce , but for the naval power of the United States . From San Francisco westward , by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be developed into strongholds of American power , the United States will reach across the Pacific Ocean to the Asiatic coast and will have a powerful voice in deciding the destiny of Eastern Asia , for it has there just as important commercial interests to foster and protect as any of the European powers . That it realizes fully the importance of this and other questions at issue is evinced by the promptness with which it is proceeding to a notable strengthening of its navy and standing army . America 's Vast Resources . " With what force and energy the United States enters upon its rightful position among the controlling nations of the world will be shown by a glance at its material resources and productive capacity . There is , first , the fact that in the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1898 , the United States had a surplus of exports over imports amounting to 2,500,000,000 marks , ( $595,000,000 , ) while all the European nations show a more or less important deficit in their balances of trade  --  Germany about 700,000,000 marks , ( 8166,600,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( $571,200,000 . ) " Other comparisons are equally instructive . John Shafroth , in his speech before the House of Representatives on the 26th of May last , gave the following statistical data : In the year 1890 the property of the United States was valued at $62,000,000,000 , while the property of the whole world was estimated at $290,000,000,000 . The American people , who number 70,000,000 souls , or one-twentieth of the population of the globe , possess , therefore , more than one-fifth of the entire wealth of the human race . The United States has 182,000 miles of railways , half as much as the remainder of the entire world . In the year 1S92 the freight transported in the United States was equivalent to 845,000,000 tons carried a distance of one mile . The annual earnings of the railways of the United States are about $1,000,000,000 , nearly half of the railway receipts of the whole world , which amount to $2,515,000,000 . The steam marine of the United States registers 14,400,000 horse power , one-third of the registered steam tonnage of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000,000 bales of cotton , and out of the 13,000,000 bales produced by - the whole world the United States alone consumed 3,500,000 bales  --  that is , more than one-fourth of the entire cotton consumption of the human race . Its production of cereals is more than one-fourth of the crops of the world . Its output of coal in 1897 reached 198,000.000 tons , while all other countries combined produced only twice as much ? in round numbers , 400,000,000 tons . The telegraph lines of the world included in 1897 4,908,000 miles of wires , of which 2,256,000 miles are in the United States . The postal service of the world transports yearly 17,000,000,000 letters , of which the United States alone sends 5,000,000,000 . The mechanical appliances which the United States employs to aid and supplement human labor comprise more than one-fourth of the equipment of the entire world . Beyond All Other Nations , " These figures , to which might be added others equally significant , will suffice to show that the people of the United States in respect to their resources and capacity of performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the comparison must be made with the entire rest of the world . They form the clearest and most convincing proof that the United States is in fact a great world power , and as such must have a world policy . " Thus far there is not the slightest cause to regret the development of this power . We believe , on the other hand , that it is a cause for rejoicing to all mankind . We can , indeed , see the numerous dark spots which shadow the condition of the American people , but when one compares with these the many bright spots it is seen that there are far more lights than shadows . The American National character wins when compared with that of other nations , and it must be remembered that in the frank , ness and intelligence of this National character its tireless energy and ardor for improvement . are found the conditions and the strength which modify even the defect of the people and shield them from the dangers of degeneration . Labor , freedom , tolerence  --  these are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can securely rest in future . " The Americans have no aristocratic caste , born with the pretension of being better than other men , and for whose benefit the masses should toil ; they have no clericalism which seeks to rule and finds in all progress an enemy that must be resisted at every cost ; they have , finally , no bureaucratic traditions which stifle every movement toward freedom and make the citizen the slave of the machinery of State . This does not please many European diplomats and their adherents , and they give unrestrained expression to their aversion to the - free-and-equal masses , ' the ' plebeians , ' &c.; They would even give expression to this aversion in overt acts if , indeed , the United States had not already become too great a power to be bullied . Republicanism Not the Secret . " The Kreuz-Zeitung of Berlin has been greatly distressed over the reasons which have led us in the present war to the side of the United States . After considering and demolishing several of such reasons . it is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the United States is a Republic . ' That is very superficially conceived . If we had ever rhapsodized over the republiCan form of government , as such , we should have been long ago thoroughly cured of such delusions by what has happened in France . We are not concerned with the outward form , but with the substance  --  the independent , self-reliant citizenship ; the respect for honest labor ; the tolerance of free thought and action ; the generous , unprejudiced humanity of thought , feeling , and deed . All these things we have not found in Spain . nor among many of the friends of Spain . " What would have happened had Spain triumphed in this war ? National darkness , narrowness , and corruption would have prevailed , and everywhere the advocates of political and clerical absolutism , which the Spanish governmental system breeds and fosters , would have gained new and important strength . But this has not happened , and for these reasons it can be fairly said that the victory of the United States is a triumph for progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now some new and difficult problems to solve . Cuba will present a serious task , and the Philippine question will be still more complex and difficult . Cuba can be managed by the Americans alone , but the Philippines are a realm in which the interests of other great powers meet and collide . From the manner in which the United States Government meets and solves this problem will be seen and demonstrated whether it can command the wisdom and moderation proportionate to its opportunity and power .
