txt It would be a melancholy Outcome of the great struggle the Republican Party has made , and the great victory it has won , if Mr. REED were to be put out of the Speaker 's chair to make room for , say , Mr. GnosvENol% . We Shall not be accused of a special fondness for Mr. REED . We have been forced many times to criticise and reprove him . nut it has always been when he has fallen short of his own best , when for reasons we can not explain he has been less clear , courageous , firm , and faithful than we had a right to expect that he would be . When , at the last Republican Convention , the principles With which Mr. REED has been more closely identified than any other Republican leader became the basis of the party platform , while its candidate was a man who less , than any other Republican leader was linked with those principles , we felt , with many others , what a profound pity it was that Mr. REED was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as did many of Mr. REED 'S friends , that the candidate he would have been had he stuck to his principles without any thought or care how it would affect his possible nomination . Nevertheless , it remains true that in intellect , in experience , in all that constitutes real statesmanship , Mr. REED is far and away ahead of all other Republican members of the House of Representatives . And if now he is passed by , and a. smaller , narrower man is put in the Speaker 's chair , especially if this be done with the assent and aid of Mr. , every one familiar with the situation will draw inferences unflattering to the new Administration . It will be said , and it can not be gainsaid , that Mr. REED has been put to one side because he is too strong a man , because the President that will be can not brook even an apparent rival of such importance in a place of such power and prestige . Such a change would be particularly unfortunate because , as to the tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Administration , Mr. REED has shown more sense and prudence and real patriotism than any other- Republican leader . If he is to be reduced to the ranks , the country ? - will infer that it is precisely because of his prudence and his sense and his moderation that this is done . It is true that he has not been able to check his party as he would have been glad to check it . But he is about the only man of any consequence in the House who has even tried to do so . He has also been , or striven to be , a restraint upon the extravagance of his party . He actually held up something like $50.000,000 of appropriations in the last session . It will be an ugly omen for the Republicans if the moment they attain power they throw over a leader of pronounced views as to the gold standard , moderate ? as Republicans go ? on the tariff , and willing to be economical .               @ @ @ @ @ @
