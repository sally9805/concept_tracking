txt Fifty years since a good deal was talked and written about the " manifest destiny " of the United States . In those days what was generally understood by that term was the plain purpose of the Almighty that the people of this country should spread the blessings of negro slavery in all the regions where it could profitably be established . When that young scapegrace , " C'CrrLT Tee ' WALKER , - *hose energetic " literary bureau gave him the title of the " gray-eyed man of destiny , " invaded the States of Central America , where he ultimately met his death , the first use of the Dictatorship he declared was to decree the legality of slavery . His crazy enterprises were quite in the line with the previous and much more important ones planned and carried through by the National Government in the hands of the Slave Power , as it was then called . The motive of the acquisitions of territory from Mexico , whether by war or by purchase under duress , was not essentially different from that of the filibusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their system must expand or perish . Nor will it do in the cold light of history to denounce their purpose unqualifiedly . It was far more an economic necessity , imposed by a system of labor which it was difficult , if not impossible , to change , that impelled them than it was any perversity of moral judgement . If they found their interests quite consistent with the dictates of revealed rdligion , and were convinced that they were called upon to save the souls of all the Africans they could import or breed , they were not the first men or the last to read their own desires into the Divine will . If we go back a little further in our history and trace the steps by which the claim on the Florida territory Was es , tablished under the calm direction of 1 MADISON , we shall find that they were in Pretty flagrant violation of the equities and involved a. , clear usurpation on the part of the Executive , and previous to that ' the Louisiana Purchase had been made by JEFFERSON in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on subsequent approval of the people , which , however , was never asked for . In short , every stage in the movement that'has given the United States a continental character and made it possible for our people to extend from ocean to ocean and from British America to the Gulf has been stained by violence or accompanied by a wide departure from the orderly and authoritative methods of Constitutional government . If we can not say that the means justified the end , who of us is prepared to say that the course ' of events was not shaped by a beneficent force , impelling the blind passions of men toward a result that is now plainly enough seen to be good ? We have used the term " continental " in describing the character of the present United States . It is not without significance that this term was adopted by the Revolutionary leaders for the Government that they set up to overthrow that of King GEORGE III . and to take its place . When Col. ETHAN ALLEN demanded the surrender of Ticonderoga " in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave half unconscious expression to the spirit of his time and race . They were bent on possessing the continent , and they believed that it was the express purpose of the Almighty that they should do so . Precisely the same spirit moved the young WASHINGTON twenty years before , when , in the wilderness of the Ohio , he planned the expulsion of the French posts that disputed the pathway of his people westward . From the earliest days the men who founded the empire of our race in America were animated by an invincible impulse toward expansion . It was , in their blood , and wherever any obstacle presented itself they were ready to shed their blood to overcome it . The same impulse determined the restless and irregular but effective movements to which reference has already been made , which have made realities of the wildest dreams of the fathers . Undoubtedly this impulse counts for much in recent events . ** reasonably and accurately ascribe as the immediate cause of the war with Spain the offensive and injurious policy of that country in Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the weakness of our foe . But the vast results that have flowed from our victory have no logical connection with our object in making war or with any definite general purpose of our Government or our people in the past . The power of Spain crumbled before our arms , and we were called upon to decide what should be done with the possessions she could no longer administer . Every formal limitation of our Constitutional system , every dictate of our political traditions , suggested that we should return to the development of our own land and avoid the perils and temptations of expansion within the sphere of European complications . Instead , we have taken upon ourselves the responsibilities of a world power . It would be foolish to say that it was done deliberately or in obedience to a formal expression of the public will . It was done suddenly and even rashly , and few , if any , of those that were intrusted with the decision can say that they clearly foresee the ultimate consequences . But unquestionably it was in the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so rash as the decisions that have already been made . We have a right to hope and to believe that its final outcome will not be less fortunate
