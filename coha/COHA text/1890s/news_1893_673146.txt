txt Secretary of State FOSTER said yesterday that the department had received no communication from the British Minister at Washington on the subject of Hawaii . In the meantime Mr. HAnrusalsT has very properly conveyed to the respective committees on Foreign Affairs of the Senate and the House such information as the Executive possesses , in order that they may be prepared intelligently to consider any question that may come up . It is reported that Mr. IlAnnisox is confident that , when all the facts are known , it will be within the power of the Government to aid in sustaining the independence of Hawaii and to secure snnicient influence there fairly to protect our interests . The people of the United States will be entirely satisfied if this be done , and will be relieved if it can be done without the assumption of the responsibilities and possibilities of complication involved in the annexation of the islands . The latter method of guarding American interests is by no means to be regarded as inadmissible , but it is clearly one that should be resorted to only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .11.1.1. mcessa , If those interested in railways in the - United States would think out the staternentsin the letter of Congressman HARTER , published in another column , they would find them entirely sustained by the facts , and a pressure would be brought on Congress for the stoppage of silver buying that could not be resisted . That the process , if not stopped , must give us a seventy-cent or a sixty-cent dollar is perfectly true , and that such a dollar threatens bankruptcy to the railroads is equally tree . A bill was passed by the Assembly yesterday which , if it shall become a law , will institute an interesting . experiment in local government . It is in the form of an amendment to the charter of the City of Oswego , and is intended to carry cut a plan of reform long advocated by Dr. C. C. P. Capnit of that city . It divides the city into four election districts , each of which ' deludes two of the present wards , and provides for dividing the registered voters of each district into sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names after the manner of drawing jury panels . Each of these sections of voters is to hold a meeting of its own and choose by a majority vote a representative elector . The representative electors for each election district are to form an electoral college for that district and choose all the officers of the wards of which it is composed . The representative electors for all the districts are to constitute the electoral college for the whole city and choose all its public officers . The registration is to be revised and the division of voters into sections is to be newly made each year , but new representative electors are to be chosen only to fill vacancies or when a new meeting of a section shall bo held on application of half its members . All public officers are to hold office until their successors are chosen by the electoral colleges , which can remove and appoint at will by a majority vote . The whole scheme is intended to destroy machine politics . The special committee of the State Senate which has been investigating the coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly that has been established in proper-terms and points out its effects very clearly , and its suggestions in regard to a remedy are judicious so far as they relate to the enforcement of the laws against such combinations . But its proposal for granting licenses to coal carriers and coal dealers and giving the Railroad Commission power to fix the maximum charge for carrying coal in this State and the maximum price at which it can be sold by dealers strikes us as a remedy likely to prove worse than the disease . It ought to be within the power of State and Nation to prevent monopolies in restraint of trade and for the advance of prices without resorting to the vicious principle of attempting to regulate prices by public authority . What is desired is the legitimate play of the forces of competition , and in no other way can the prices of commodities be regulated with advantage to the public . The municipal commission , in its proposal for a new City Hall , seemed to contemplate an open competition or a prize competition , in which only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is a natural view for laymen to take , but it is to be expected that the professional advisers of the commission will inform them that it is not the way to get goods plans . Nothing is better settled than that architects of standing will not enter what they describe sometimes as a lottery and sometimes as a scramble . In order to bring them into a competition they must be invited and paid to compete . The choice of an architect , to be judicious , must be by either direct selection or a limited and paid . competition . It is recognized by commercial corporations that one of these methods gives the best results , and there is no reason why the city should not show as much intelligence as a life insurance company . The unrecognized genius who has never built anything may still be allowed to enter the competition as a volunteer ; but to make sure of having places worthy of consideration , the service must be invoked of architects known to be able to make such plans , and such architects will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
