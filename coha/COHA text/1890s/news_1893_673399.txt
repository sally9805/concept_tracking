txt This was the assertion of the leading high-tariff association in the country . The organ of the Pennsylvania high-tariff association , which is called the Manufacturer , said , when the Allison bill was before the Senate , that the duties on carpet wool as fixed by that bill would not induce wool growers to produce wool of that kind , and explained as follows : " The reason for this , of course , is that no enlightened American is going to feed and Dare for a sheep whose fleece is worth 50 cents when the same amount of food and care will produce a sheep with a fleece worth $1.50 . Nor is it desirable that he should do so . The success of the Senate bill as it stands will raise the price of carpet wool and also the prices of carpets , and will do good to nobody . " The absurdity of a protective duty on carpet wools has been admitted . by the journals of the wool trade and by all unbiased persons who are familiar with the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports of these wools comes from Asia , where wool growers are still willing to produce wool of ? this grade . Our tariff on it simply increases the . cost of our carpet makers ' raw material and the cost of manufacturing carpets . Although it was admitted by supporters of the protective system that the duty was not required for the protection of producers of similar wool in this country , and would not , cause such wool to be grown here , the tariff not only retained the old duties , but considerably increased them . The old specific duties were equivalent to 2412 and 3012 per cent . for the two grades . respectively ; the rates of the tariff are 32 and 50 per cent . The additions were made in response to the demands of Messrs . LAWRENCE , DELANO. and HA.RPSTER Of the Ohio Wool Growers ' Association , a pestilent trio of high taxers , and the preparation of the schedule was intrusted to LAWRENCE himself , who asserted that carpets were luxuries , and who inserted in the bill several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the The Wilson bill puts all kinds of raw wool on the free list . Nearly three-quarters of the wool imported into this country is the coarse wool used in the manufacture of carpets , the average value of it being less than 10 cents a pound . The following table shows the quantities of all kinds of wool , and also the quantities of carpet wool , imported in the last four years : It will be seen that the carpet wool imports were 70 per cent . of the entire quantity imported last year . There has been no reasonable excuse for imposing a duty on these coarse wools , which are the carpet manufacturers ' raw material , for wool of this kind is not produced in the United States in appreciable quantities . The American wool grower does not produce it , for the very good . reason that he can produce much more valuable fleeces by the same expenditure of labor and money that would be required for the production of this coarse and cheap wool . This has been freely admitted by some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote the following from the Bulletin of the American Protective Tariff League : " The assertion is again advanced in an address published by LAWRENCE 'S Wool Growers ' Association that the United States is capable of producing the balk of the carpet wools used in this country . We think this is an unfortunate position for the wool growers to take , for It is very far from an undisputed truth that the lower grades of carpet ' wool can be produced in this country except under such conditions of protection as would make the business an absurdity . It Is well known that the lowest grades of carpet wools are from wild sheep , and could never be produced in this country except at a cost for production which . would require from 500 to 1,000 per cent . of protection . It would be far better to concede this truth , and endeavor to reach a combination with the carpet manufacturers based upon a reasonable and fair statement of facts . " assistance of an Administration favorably inclined to his schemes , to make the duties much higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his avowed desire and purpose to exclude carpet wools altogether , if that end could be accomplished by high duties and Treasury decisions that should make them still higher . The carpet manufacturers have repeatedly rebelled , but LAWRENCE and his associates have succeeded in controlling them by threats and by procuring the imposition of high duties on carpets . The average duty on carpet wools in 1892 was 33 per cent. , and the average duty on carpets was apparently 62 per cent . In reality it is higher , for the rates are practically prohibitory , except on Eastern rugs . The domestic manufacturers have had substantially the entire home market , and although their productive capacity exceeds the home demand , they have been unable to export carpets . owing to the effect of the wool tax and other raw material taxes upon the cost of production . The exports last year were only 18,631 yards , a quantity almost too small to be mentioned in the reports ; The Wilson bill gives the manufacturers untaxed wool , and reduces the duties on carpets to 35 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for Brussels , and 25 per cent . for ingrains and tapestries . Prominent manufacturers have said that the removal of the duty on carpet wool would widen their market and increase exports . We do not see why the duties of the Wilson bill are not ample . If it be true that . with raw wool free , certain manufacturers can export carpets , then they would need no duty whatever . Even under existing conditions a considerable quantity of carpets was recently exported from this city to London and sold there in competition with the carpets of England , against the sale of which here at home the domestic manufacturer is protected . We presume that this exportation was made possible by a rebate of the duty on the wool . If the tax on wool should be repealed , the manufacturer who sent these goods to London would be able to export his products more easily . The removal of the duty would reduce the cost of production and the pride to consumers at home , while it would , in all probability , enable our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets , and thus to increase the quantity manufactured .
