THE UNITED STATES AND THE ANGLO-SAXON FUTURE . IT is one of the commonplaces of our time that the world has become small and closely united , but the practical consequences of this fact , as bearing on our own future , we of the United States have not yet appreciated . We are entering with the rest of the world upon a new era of history , in which the conditions that have prevailed in the past will no longer be the determining conditions , and in ii*hich our own best and highest interests can no longer be measured by the standard of Washington 's Farewell Address . The drama of international politics has already passed into a new act , whose stage is the world , and whose actors are no longer nations in the sense of a hundred years ago , but great races or nations with a world-position ; an act in which the petty questions of European boundary lines or the balance of power - the chief objects of the entangling alliances against which we were warned - will sink , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the dawn of this era which gives to the Napoleonic struggle its real significance in the history of the world as distinguished from the history of Europe . It is the consciousness of this fact , as can easily be ascertained , which is behind the desperate efforts of France and of Germany to secure colonial empires before it is finally too late . It is this fact which gives all its peculiar importance to the rise of Japan to the possible headship of the Mongolian world , and to the struggle with Russia for the control of China which seems inevitable ; and this the Japanese most clearly recognize . No doubt the mere independence of the small nation has never been so secure as it will be in the future , but it is equally certain that the uncombined or " unexpanded " nation is doomed to sink to a constantly lower depth of provincial insignificance . The fate which has overtaken the peoples of Wales and of Scotland , of Provence and of Aragon , in competition with stronger peoples , lies now before all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be avoided . The final result to which this stage of history will lead can be nothing less than the domination of the world , in ideas and arts and institutions , by some one racial type . The conditions of the classical world at the beginning of the second Punic war seem now to be reproduced , but in this later age for the whole globe , and as an introduction to a final epoch of history in which no reversal will be possible . In the year 220 B. C. , to any observer of ancient international politics who saw the Mediterranean Sea surrounded by a series of independent and apparently powerful states , and who did not reckon Rome the greatest of these , the prediction would have seemed extremely rash that before the close of another century the whole civilized world would be under the control of the Romans , and would be rapidly learning their language , institutions , and laws . Indeed , the Roman of that date did not have so fair a start for leadership in his world as the Anglo-Saxon has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome in the struggle with Carthage . Yet the world of that time which was united under one rule was practically larger than the whole earth of our day . The strategic points of the Roman Empire , measured by any true standards of distance , - the transmission of news and the concentration of men and supplies , - were as far from Rome as the strategic points of the world to-day are from London or New York . We can understand that a prediction of the result which was so soon to follow would have seemed rash to the men of 220 n. c. , but we ought not // to find it difficult to realize the strong probability of a similar result which stands before us , - the domination of the earth by some one race , one civilization , one type of ideas and institutions , not to the exclusion or extinction of the others in a greater degree than in the older case , but to their real and increasing subjugation and to their absorption in the dominant type . The Anglo-Saxon race , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f oremost place in the world . This is true not merely because the area of its domination is the largest , all in the best regions of the globe , and likely soon to be filled with the largest population ; it is true also because it stands for the best yet reached in ideas and institutions , the highest type of civilization , the fairest chance for every man yet offered in the world . Is it going to be able to maintain this position ? It is by no means dear as yet what answer will be given to this question . Geographically the race is widely scattered , and the problem of defending its integrity against any race of equal power and greater concentration of position , in a conflict waged to the bitter end , would be one of extreme difficulty . But a far more serious danger arises from the lack of unity which prevails in the race , and which would make the use of its full power in such a conflict practically impossible . This shows itself not merely in the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which is comparatively unimportant ) , but in the absence of the idea of its urgency and value , and in a disposition to throw upon a single member of the race the whole burden of providing for its defense ; and these are more serious matters . If we examine the present opinion of the Anglo-Saxon world on this subject , we shall find that no large body of men anywhere regards the existing condition as likely to continue long , and that no large body of men anywhere is united on any policy for the future , but that there are three tendencies which may affect the character of the final result . The first tendency is the movement for imperial federation . This movement is extremely interesting in its beginning and growth . It is more than interesting as a sign of the awakening of mind to the demands of the future . But it has always been very vague as to practical methods , and it has never taken strong hold anywhere in the British Empire . Imperial federation , could it be secured , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the hope of its adoption is very remote . The second tendency is the idea - it can hardly be called a movement - of the independence of the separate parts of the British Empire , or its dissolution into several independent states . This is the idea which Mr. Goidwin Smith has so long and so vigorously proclaimed . The Venezuelan excitement has served him as an opportunity for a reiteration of some of his arguments in a very effective form . There was a time , a quarter of a century ago , when it was the almost openly avowed idea of the home government itself , and it is still the ultimate , though perhaps not avowed conviction of many in England , that some such result will be the only possible outcome of the situation . In every colony there are many individuals who hold this belief strongly , and who urge it whenever occasion offers , but there can not be said to be anywhere a real party in its support . If the character of the era upon which the world is now entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this article , then the realization of this idea would be a great misfortune . It might not be fatal , because alliance and reunion would still be possible , but the chances against any effective union would be vastly increased , as well as the probability that considerations of narrow and temporary selfishness would come into controL Happily , however , this tendency // can be regarded as oniy very slight . It seems altogether certain , on the contrary , that " schism in Greater Britain " has gone as far as it will ever go . The third tendency which may decide the future of the Anglo-Saxon world is that toward civil war . We need only to look back over the past few months to see how inflammable the material is , and what a little matter might *et it ablaze . Had passion in England been as hot and language as extreme as with us , we should be even now on the verge of war , if not actually engaged in it . A renewal of such conditions is at any moment possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a war to the finish , very likely to the finish of both . It would almost certainly result in the ruin of the empire of the world which now belongs to our race , and of the greater future which we may still command . These three are the only discernible tendencies in the Anglo-Saxon world looking toward the determination of its future , unless we dignify with the name of a tendency , or policy , the deplorable habit of drifting which seems to belong to the race ; the doctrine , very comfortable for the present , that England , at least , has so far consistently followed , of " why not let well enough alone , " which prefers to put off to a moment of supreme danger the task of finding a workable basis of union , and to think that the wisest solution of a great political difficulty can be found under the pressure of a compelling necessity . But the practical result of all these tendencies , if we except the apparently hopeless movement in favor of imperial federation , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained in the world , - a position in which it comes so near , even in its present nncombined condition , to a command of all the races , and to the power of determining in all its important details the future uniform civilization of the globe , - and to sink into the comfortable security of a dominated and declining race . It is in view of this situation of things - the absence of any clear policy for the future held strongly enough anywhere to command for it general support and a prospect of success , and the presence of tendencies which threaten the most signal disasters - that the action of the United States becomes of vital importance in its relation to the future of the race . If our position is such that by hasty or passionate action we can destroy the empire of the race , it may also be such that by judicious action , in the i*ight way and at the right time , we may assume for ourselves that position of leadership in organization which England hesitates to take , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never was a people more clearly marked out , by geographical position and by its peculiar institutions , for that world-leadership which , in everything except gunpowder and trade , England seems fatally incapable of taking . Gunpowder and trade have been of immense importance in the past in building the empire and in maintaining it , but something more is needed for the future if the race is not to become stationary and finally to decline* The centre of the race in the coming age , if it is to have the future which it ought to have , can be found only in a people capable of solving the institutional problem of a real union for such a wide and diversified empire . That problem the United States has already solved , to all intents and purposes , and we reached the solution in the midst of difficulties greater than any which now confront the Anglo-Saxon federationist . This question of the relative fitness of the two greatest of the Anglo-Saxon nations for the leadership of the race is one which the events of the future may very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for which the events of the past appear to have but one answer . // In reaching a conclusion in regard to it , one should notice at the outset the real meaning of the term which is so common in the mouths of us all , and which appears to shut the United States out of court , - I mean " the British Empire. ** The term is a convenient one . It is more than two hundred years since it was first applied to England 's colonial system . But whatever else may he thought of Mr. E. A. Freeman 's argument on imperial federation , he was undoubtedly right in saying that there is no British Empire , in any true sense of the word . The term can he used only in the sense of a geographical expansion . There never has been any imperial government . Such government as there is has been obtained by the adaptation of a local government , heavily burdened with domestic concerns , to the settlement of such colonial questions as could not he longer delayed . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsatisfactory , - in the words of one of its sharpest critics , thoroughly un-English ; a system , indeed , which has given the English at home no experience or training , as a people , in dealing with really imperial difficulties . It has given them abundant opportunity to criticise and hamper , but no opportunity to hear responsibility . Yet , while the English are disposed to admit the clumsy character of the machinery which grew up from small colonial beginnings , it is a very suggestive fact that they have made scarcely any attempt to improve that machinery . They have certainly never attempted to establish an imperial government , nor ever seriously discussed the question , unless we take account of the few who have been recently interested in imperial federation . But more important still is the fact that England has never had an imperial policy . She never has had a definite plan , - never has had before her any clear purpose to be attained . The interest of the moment , and that chiefly the commercial interest , has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the result of accident than of any intention . She has merely drifted into empire . This argument must not be understood to mean more than it does mean . I am not criticising the past policy of England in these matters . That has been , probably , the best on the whole which could have been pursued , and England has been so successful in establishing a great series of prosperous colonies because she has followed so consistently the policy of laisse*faire . What is meant here is that the time for this policy is past . The next step in advance is that of constructive union . But in this direction the apparently unavoidable inferences from England 's past colonial management are of the most discouraging character . In every stage of its history her colonial government has exhibited an incapacity for understanding the colonial mind and feeling which seems to be invincible . It is not possible to produce here the full proofs of this assertion , but it is not necessary . They are written at large in the records of every question of importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two hundred years . Has there ever been a difficulty of this sort in which England has really understood her colonies , or seemed to care whether she did or not , until compelled by brute force , or something like it ? Nor has the variety of cases been small , from the comic seriousness of the Connecticut charter oak down to the serious comedy of Victoria 's threat to transport her convicts to England . Take the most important possible case . Much has been said of the lesson which England learned from the American Revolution . But when the next case of the sort arose , how much did she seem to have learned ? The position of the ministry of the day in the Canadian rebellion of 1837 was closely parallel , as Lord Brougham long // ago pointed out , to that taken by Lord North 's ministry in the American Revolution . It had been said in print before that date , in effect , that England had learned the lesson , but the " practical statesman evidently needed another taste of the colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson was learned , observe the striking result : the practical statesman was carried so far in the opposite direction , toward belief in an inevitable colonial independence , that he arrived at an equally profound misunderstanding of the feeling in the colonies , as witness the policy of cutting the colonies adrift practically adopted by Mr. Gladstone 's ministry in 1869 . Indeed , the evidence of England 's past is so clear as to her inability to appreciate the feelings of others , and as to her incapacity to learn , that it is almost hopeless to expect her to adapt herself to the demands of the next stage of Anglo-Saxon growth . This defect , however , really reaches much further than merely to make a change of policy hopeless . It is in itself a positive disqualification , for no characteristic will be mere surely demanded of a leader of the nations than the ability to enter into the feelings of others . England is in another way equally disqualified for the position of leader by her surprising failure to comprehend federal government . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be formed . No American who has followed the recent discussions on Home Rule for Ireland , though he may fully recognize the real and peculiar difficulties of the problem , can fail to perceive that the English have created for themselves other and imaginary difficulties because they do not know what federal government is . Could the people of England , by some miracle , have a real experience of federal government , it would be no longer possible for them to entertain the fears they now so often express , that the granting of Home Rule to Ireland would mean the dissolution of the empire , or that it would be impossible to prevent the local from encroaching upon the general government , - fears which Americans can hardly characterize by any other word than " absurd . " If any one finds this not sufficient proof , let him turn to the discussions which have been aroused by the idea of imperial federation . He will find in them added proof of a failure to understand the federal method of government ; and that , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scheme . As a single example the following from the historian of federal government may suffice . Mr. Freeman says , in his essay on imperial federation , speaking of the position which England would occupy in such a federation : " It will be quite another thing to ask a great power , a ruling power , a mighty and ancient kingdom , which has for ages held its place among the foremost nations of the earth , to give up its dominion , to give up its independence , to sink of its own will to the level of the State of New York and the Canton of Bern . This point has been repeated by others , and is apparently one of the most serious obstacles in the way of creating a public opinion in England in favor of some practical move towards federation . It is , of course , not necessary to say to Americans that such a deplorable result would not be brought about even by adopting the Constitution of the United States without change , nor to suggest to them that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the English mind . This difficulty in the way of English leadership may be set down as fatal , for no state can lead in the formation of such a union which does not understand the only system of union possible in the case . Turning now from the mere suggestion of the contrasts which the United States may present to English defects , // and looking at the positive advantages which we may justly claim as our own , we are naturally led to notice first our geographical position . The advantage of this position can be seen at a glance . With a long coast-line upon each of the two great oceans of the world , the one looking directly to Europe and the other to Asia and Australasia , and with a number of lines of rapid communication between the two coasts , placed at such a distance from one another that it would be practically impossible for any contingency to interfere with them all at once , we occupy a strategic position with reference to the rest of the world which is , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which is not in the least approached by any other nation , Anglo-Saxon or foreign . The only serious weakness in the case is that created by the situation of Canada , bordering upon a long and exposed frontier ; but if some actual plan of union under the lead of the United States were under consideration , this would not be an element of weakness in our case , but of strength . It is hardly too much to say that the admission of Canada into the American union would settle for all time the question of the centre of the English-speaking world . In the second place , the matter that is fundamental to this whole discussion is the method of union ; not merely the method as sketched in a paper constitution , which is indeed of great importance , but the still more essential point of the success with which any given paper constitution can be placed and kept in operation . The paper constitution may show the ability of a people to deal intellectually with a difficult problem of government . The ability to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually solves the problem . In this matter of method , it is impossible to deny that in both directions , theoretical and practical , the United States has made decisive contributions to the solution of the two greatest difficulties in the way of the formation of an AngloSaxon union . They are its method of federal government and its method of territorial government . These are decisive contributions , because any workable union of the Anglo-Saxon world must , in these two directions , proceed upon the lines laid down by the United States . I do not propose to raise the question whether our history presents an independent invention of federal government . Whether it does or not , the great service of the United States to the practical politics of the world was to show beyond doubt that federal government furnishes an easy and simple method by which a vast territory - the largest ever occupied in history by a homogeneous and civilized people , containing within itself the widest variations of condition , interest , and feeling - can be united in a real national government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while leaving all local differences free to express themselves . This is the unsolved problem of Anglo-Saxon union , but as an accomplished fact of our own history it needs no proof . Had an especial effort been made to test this quality of federal government experimentally for all time , no better test could have been found than the slavery question ; and the attitude of the country toward that question , and particularly the attitude of the Republican party from 1856 to 1864 , is equivalent to a demonstration . The position of the Republican party in the matter , as expressed in the platform of 1860 or in Lincoln 's first Inaugural , was the concentrated common sense of the nation awakened by the experience of the preceding generation ; and it affords a conclusive proof of the elasticity of the federal system , as the civil war which followed , growing out of a violation , or perhaps we ought to say out of a misunderstanding , of the federal system , is the best conceivable proof of its strength . // We have demonstrated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice the size of the Roman Empire at its widest extent ; and this demonstration leaves no room to doubt that the federal system will permit the formation of a strong and efficient national government for the whole Anglo-Saxon world , even as at present constituted , preserving all local freedom of development or of idiosyncrasy which any individual member of the union might reasonably desire . Even the actual Constitution of the United States would accomplish this , though it could probably be improved for such a purpose . It is interesting to note the fact that representatives from all the English-speaking world now fitted for admission into our Union in the capacity of states , the British Islands included , could be introduced into our House of Representatives , upon the same ratio of representation to population that is the rule of the present Congress , without increasing that body to the size of the House of Commons . I can not avoid remarking , in passing , that Melbourne is not farther from Washington now than San Francisco was when California became a State ; it is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a barrier , the sea is a bond of union more useful than continuous territory . Nor would Australia represent conditions differing more widely from the rest of the Union than California did . One of the local differences which any system of union must take into account - the varying tariff policies of the separate parts of the English-speaking world - has often been referred to as an insuperable obstacle to a common organization . But if this disagreement should , unfortunately , be found irreconcilable , the federal system would allow the most diverse regulations to exist side by side under a common general government , with no more friction than in the present system , and probably with less . This the federal government of Germany has clearly proved ; but the principle could be applied to the sharply divided members of an Anglo-Saxon federation with greater ease than to immediate neighbors in the German Empire . If , on the other hand , an Anglo-Saxon union should carry with it internal free trade , it would not be long before this would be considered one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal free trade secured by the Constitution of the United States is now universally regarded . The problem of forming a workable union for the nations of our race now fitted for union is not , however , the only problem of difficulty which confronts the federationist . One of the questions often asked by the objector , as if it were incapable of answer , is , What are you going to do with the colonies and dependencies which are not yet fitted for admission into a union of states ? It is at this point that the United States has made its second important contribution to the political machinery of the world . This was made at the same time with the framing of the Constitution , in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 , our fundamental charter of territorial government . This method of government has proved in practice most simple and yet most successful . It has enabled us to make territorial annexations of the widest extent , empires in themselves and inhabited by foreign races , and to govern them effectively , without sacrificing in the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lack of friction which are without example , except possibly in the surface appearance of a strict military despotism . Take as an instance the Mormon colony in Utah , which would not present an easy case to any form of government , and compare the relations of the general government with that community with the English management of the Dutch troubles in South Africa . It seems certain , in this latter case , that under our territorial system no necessity // for the Dutch emigration , which established their present independent republies , would ever have arisen . Even the events which might be considered the most serious impeachment of this proposition , the territorial troubles which followed the Mexican war , are rather examples to the point ; for the chief difficulties of that time were occasioned by an attempt , for whatever reasons , to depart from the principles laid down in the Northwest Ordinance . The conclusion seems inevitable , that , both by points of contrast to England and by positive excellencies , the United States is better fitted for leadership in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true it may be that the United States is better fitted than England for leadership in this work of organization , it must be admitted that at least tbree most serious obstacles stand in the way of any practical realization of such a leadership . The first of these is the lack of opportunity . The United States has at present no standing-ground from which to exercise such a leadership , and , under ordinary circumstances , can do nothing directly to secure it . The cordial invitation of any one of the great quarters of the Anglo-Saxon world would secure it to us , or , still more , the admission of any one of them into the Union . But these are hardly to be expected in the present condition of things , although there have been indications enough , during the past twenty-five years , that in times of trial there would be a strong current of feeling in the colonies in favor of turning to the United States for assistance , which might be withheld by England . In the mean time , something can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , in an increased participation in international affairs wherever a natural occasion offers , and in the improvement of our navy and of our mercantile marine . These last , indeed , not merely look to the future , but are most obvious present duties . But there is little else we can do except to wait secure in the conviction that if England continues her traditional policy of thoughtless drifting , our opportunity must come , and with it the duty of action . The second obstacle is the fact that England would not be willing to join a union of which the United States was the acknowledged centre . In the present stage of the discussion , this unwillingness must be regarded as a serious obstacle , chiefly because it will render it difficult for the colonies to accept the leadership of the United States ; but when the time for action has at last come , it will probably be found no longer serious . It is by no means necessary , either for her own advantage or for results of the best sort from such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had progressed so far that a union was actually formed , England could hardly fail to be in close alliance with it , and in that case her position would be stronger than it is now and her burdens lighter , while the two indispensable requisites of the future would be met , the smaller Anglo-Saxon nations would undertake their full share of burdens and responsibilities , and the United States would be brought permanently into the Anglo-Saxon system . Expressed in another form , these two results would mean that the Anglo - Saxon race , even with England in form outside the union , would henceforth present a united front to the world , with all its beneficent consequences . One beneficent consequence , for example , might follow , which ha* been often suggested in the discussion of this subject , - that such a united power might be able to prevent any further warfare among civilized nations . The third obstacle is the prevalent feeling concerning the traditional policy of the United States against " entangling // alliances . " While this must be admitted to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a temporary obstacle . It is indeed already high time for us to get rid of this now completely obsolete notion . It was the wisest possible policy for the conditions of 1797 , but those conditions have entirely disappeared and can never return . Then the politics of continental Europe controlled the world . Now they have sunk almost to the rank of provincial questions , and the issues of wider world politics are beginning to control everything , continental Europe included . In a short time the United States will be forced to become an active participant in these affairs , whether it may wish to do so or not . It has already begun to step outside the traditional limits , and it must do so more and more . It is the part of folly not to recognize the changed conditions and be prepared for the necessary consequences . I am not arguing for the adoption by the United States of what I understand to be a " jingo " policy . In the first place , as said above , our present position must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the best method which could be chosen of destroying our fair prospect . But more important still , one of the most essential conditions of any future leadership among the nations of the world will be that the leading state shall be righteous , shall serve justice and obey the regulations of international law . An overriding of the rights of others , a selfish seeking of immediate advantage , a disregard of the principles , or even of the forms , prescribed in the laws of nations , might all be useful in the establishment of a tyranny . But the leadership of the future can not be based upon force ; it must be the result of reasonable conviction . The United States has far more to gain by occasionally sacrificing some of its rights for the benefit of others , and by convincing weaker nations that they may be sure of justice and of honest treatment , that they may expect even more than really belongs to them rather than less , than it has to gain by any policy of aggression . But , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a position of leadership as this , we must first be able to meet one indispensable condition . We must learn to realize , as we do not yet , the true identity of interest between ourselves and the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world . England stands for everything for which we stand or of which we boast . We all know that every English colony is a democratic republic . The political institutions in which we most firmly believe , and which we hope in some vague way - by the force of our example , perhaps - to make the possession of all men , she is actually planting and maintaining throughout large regions of every continent . Our easiest way to make these institutions prevail in the world is by alliance with her . Our surest way to hinder their spread is to join the alliance of her enemies . But this is not all . This identity of interest may well be argued on a lower ground . The warnings which we have heard now and then in the past few years , from very competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy with races whose rivalry we have never yet felt may prove well founded . The Oriental , whose keenness of mind and talent for business , whose faculty of patience and frugal standard of living , make him a most formidable competitor , and who has already begun to exploit the world in his own interest , may soon gain all that the West has to teach him ; and in learning the lessons of our civilization he may learn the greatness of his own advantage . For in a struggle of this kind , if it should come , the odds would not be so clearly on our side as we should like to believe . In numbers and in economy the odds would be against us , and the most that we could claim in mental gifts would be an even // balance . ' Such a struggle would not be one for supremacy only , but for existence itself . If there should prove to be a situation like this before us , isolation would mean defeat . The close alliance of the Anglo - Saxon world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial condition - would alone provide the requisites of safety in a common policy of defense . The possibility of this leadership for us may be remote . The opportunity may never come . Very likely England may arouse herself , as it is to be hoped that she will , to a realization of the necessity of union and to a solution of the difficulties which it presents . If this should be so , there can be no question , if we are willing to look toward the future , and not the past , that we ought to stand in close alliance with such a union . We ought , even in the immediate present , to be able to see that our own best interests imperatively demand that we should maintain the Anglo - Saxon race in the occupation of every foot of land which it now justly holds anywhere on the globe , and that , wherever we can do so righteously , we should endeavor to increase its influence and its possessions . It is the worst conceivable policy , at the opening of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is England or the United States which seems to be immediately interested . This is a question of no importance if we look at it aright . If , for example , we should stand by indifferently , and allow , if it were possible , the Anglo-Saxon possessions in Africa to be broken up , where almost as great a future is opening before our race as opened before it in North America at the close of the struggle with the French , and where can be found that room for the expansion of the race which will be a For an elaboration of these points see the very suggestive article by Mr. Lafcadio Ream vital necessity of the not distant future , it would not be many years before we should bitterly regret the mistaken policy . Many have been tempted to say , in view of the vain rumors of wars of the past few months which have affected four continents , that we have seen the last great war . It might indeed he so if all nations were on the same level of civilization . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will inevitably be the leading actors in the coming drama , still in such different stages of advancement , who will dare predict that we have yet entered upon a millennium of perpetual peace ? The odds are altogether in favor of at least one more great struggle of physical force , compared with which , very likely , the greatest struggles of the past will seem but child 's play , before we enter upon the era of the peaceful competition of ideas and institutions and racial types which will introduce the real millennium when it comes . If such a conflict of force should come , there is only one place for us . We must be on the side of our own ideas and institutions and race , and we can not afford in the mean time to be training ourselves to consider our natural allies our natural enemies , or to weaken the sum of our resources by any civil strife that can be honorably avoided . The purpose of this article is not so much to go into details as to suggest a text for thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove themselves surely enough , if they are once carefully thought upon . The thing that is now most of all demanded is to give some heed to considerations of this kind ; it is , if I may say so , to face the future in our foreign relations , and to come to a consciousness of the fact that we should be no longer bound by obsolete conditions and waning interests . George Burton Adams . in The Atlantic Monthly for April of the present year . // LETTERS OF D. G. ROSSETTI . III . 1855-1857 . THE introduction to this series of papers I wrote , as my readers may remember , at the little town of Alassio , on the western Riviera . The proofs of this third article I am correcting in Florence . It is no longer by the waves of the Mediterranean , but by the murmur of the Arno as it falls over a weir , that my ears are soothed . I am in that beautiful city which had so profound an influence on Rossetti 's mind , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florentines , even though he passed all his days on the banks of the Thames .

I have just come back from a ten-days ' trip to Paris , in pursuit of various things and persons . The Brownings are there for the winter , on account of the cholera at Florence , and had previously been some time in London , where I saw them a good many times , and indeed may boast of some intimacy with the glorious Robert by this time .

The comparative stagnation , even among those I see , and complete torpor elsewhere , which greet this my Elixir of Life , are awful signs of the times to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - for it is n't fair to Browning ( besides , indeed , being too much trouble ) to bicker and flicker about it . I fancy we shall agree pretty well on favorites , though one 's mind has no right to be quite made up so soon on such a subject . For my own part , I do n't reckon I ye read them at all yet , as I only got them the day before leaving town , and could n't possibly read them then , - the best proof to you how hard at work I was for once , - so heard them read by William ; since then read them on the journey again , and some a third time at intervals ; but they 11 bear lots of squeezing yet . My prime favorites hitherto ( without the book by me ) are Childe Roland , Bishop Blougram , Karshish , the Contemporary , Lippo Lippi , Cleon , and Popularity ; about the other lyrical ones I ca n't quite speak yet , and their names do n't stick in my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me the gripes at first , though I ye tried since to think it did n't , on finding the Athemeum similarly affected . 8 January , 1856 . A month and a half actually , dear A. , since the last sheet , already long behindhand , yet which has lain in my drawer ever since , till it is too late now to wish you Merry Christmas , too late to wish you Happy New Year , only not too late to feel just the same towards you as if I were the best correspondent in the world , and to know you feel the same towards me . I am sure , too , you believe that , little as I do to deserve and obtain frequent letters from you , your letters are as great a pleasure to me as any I get , - greater , I think , than any , except certain ones which you 11 be glad to hear come now dated Nice , their writer having left England three months ago , and benefiting already , I trust , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bitter cold weather was ailing us here , remained as warm as the best English May . Many thanks indeed for your New
