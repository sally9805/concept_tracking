txt The fund for the projected new building of the Church of the Strangers was enriched last week by the gift from a stranger of a house and about twenty acres of land valued at several thousand dollars . The donor , a woman , made the gift absolutely , with the single condition that her name should not be made public . She told the Rev. D. Asa Blackburn , the pastor of the church , when she handed him the deeds of the property that some unseen agency had impelled her to make the gift , and that it represented her savings for twelve years . On Sunday morning , Sept. 5 , Mr. Blackburn took as the text for his sermon the twelfth verse of the One Hundred and Sixteenth Psalm : " What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me ? " The next morning he found in his mail a letter inviting him to call Tuesday at an address given .

" And he told her it was an everyday occurrence for him to receive letters from strangers . " Well , " she said , " I think I have something to say you will like to hear . I was so impressed with your sermon Sunday that I could not get the text out of my head . It kept repeating itself in my mind all day and the night that followed . I awoke in the middle of the night with the words ' What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me , ' ringing in my ears . I went to sleep again to be awakened in the same way . I resolved then to give to the Lord the property I had just bought with my savings of the last twelve years . I had intended it as a home for my old age , but I am impelled to render it unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me .

She said she was in business , and her business was prosperink beyond her expectations . All she asked in return for the gift was that her name be not made public . She told him she happened into the church Sunday without design . She was passing , and went in . It was her first visit there , as she was a member of another church of a different denomination . Mr. Blackburn explained that when the time came to transfer the property to the church it would be impossible to keep her name secret , and she suggested that the property be sold and the money realized applied ananymously . She was satisfied , however , to leave that point to the discretion of the Trustees . They will consider the question at their next meeting .

When asked after the service for further particulars , he said there were no further particulars . He was pledged not to give the woman 's name , and he declined to describe her beyond saying she was a spinster , he judged , of middle age , although she had no gray hairs . He did not know the value of the gift , but thought it might be anything from $10,000 to $15.000 . The land on which the Church of the Strangers stands is controlled by the trustees of the Sailors ' Snug Harbor . The church was built In 1834 by the Mercer Street Presbyterian congregation . The first meeting of the Young Men 's Christian Association in America was held there . In 1870 Commodore Vanderbilt bought it for $50,000 and made a gift of it to the ? Rev. Charles F. Deems , who organized the Church of the Strangers and was its pastor until two years ago , when Mr. Blackburn succeeded him . On May 1 the lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renew It . A new church will be built as near the location of the present church  --  Mercer Street and Waverley Place  --  as a site can be secured . About $100,000 is needed before work can be begun . Of that amount nearly $38,000 has already been subscribed , and the , , trangers ' gift will bring the total very near to $50,000 . The new church will be called the Deems Memorial Church of the Strangers . HORSE , WAGON AND LOAD STOLEN 4 . Produce Peddler in Brooklyn Trusted a Young Man to His Cost .
