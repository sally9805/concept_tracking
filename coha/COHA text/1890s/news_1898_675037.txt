txt At a great public conference held this afternoon In St. James 's Hall favoring an international ratification of the Czar 's peace proposals , William T. Stead said that though he could root give the exact words of the Czar in a recent interview , the substance of what his Majesty said was as follows : " I look out over the world ; I study our civilization , and I do not find it very good . I see nations all engaged in seizing , or trying to seize , all territory not yet occupied by European powers . " I look at the results . They do not seem to me to be good . " For the native races - what does imperial expansion mean ? Too often opium , alcohol , and all manner of foul diseases , a great gulf between the governed and those who rule , and crushing taxation upon the natives for the blessings of this civilization . " And for the nations who seize , what does it mean ? A continual increase of suspicion , jealousy , - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to take part in a scramble with the world , with the result that the army and navy are swallowing up more and more millions that should be used for the welfare of the people and the advancement of the world . " On top are a few very rich and comfortable . Down below , with an ever-increasing pressure of taxes for armaments , is the great mass of poor people whose position is not very good . There is an ever-increasing multitude of those below with their brooding discontent ripening into Socialism and developing into all kinds of anarchy . " No , I do not find our civilization good . Why do we make it so ? We have at the present moment arrived at this stage that we have put all our very best manhood in the army . So much is this the case that we can not mobilize the whole of our troops in European countries without dislocating the whole fabrigc of the social community . " War has becc me so expensive that no State can stand the strain of Rrotracted war without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so perfecting our modern weapons of destruction that no army can go into the field without losing so large a proportion of its officers that when the war is over , even if that army be victorious , the war will have inflicted irreparable loss on the country . What with disconnection caused by mobilizing , what with empty exchequer , what with decimated ranks of leading and governing men , I see nothing before any nation but a terrible heritage of revolutionary anarchy . " There was much enthusiasm at the meeting , which was presided over by William Macdonald Sinclair , Archdeacon of London and Canon of St. Paul 's Cathedral . A letter was read from Lord George Hamilton , Secretary of State for India , suggesting that ' advantage should be taken of the Czar 's proposals in effecting closer relations between England and Russia . A note from Lord Rosebery approving the purpose of the meeting was also read , and resolutions were adopted unanimously looking to the achievements aimed at by the callers of the conference .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
