txt The Democratic State Convention met at 10 o'clock this morning with 1,200 delegates present . The morning session was devoid of interest . Gov . A. B. Fleming presided , W. L. Wilson being detained at Washington . United States Senator G. J. Faulkner was made permanent President . At the afternoon session there was a prolonged and bitter fight over the report of the Committee on Basis of Representation . The state Executive Committee recommended that the basis be the vote for Cleveland in 1388 . The Committee on Basis of Representation , by a vote of 7 to 4 , set this aside and brought in a majority report making the basis the vote for Gov . Fleming in 1888 , alleging that the Presidential vote ought not to be taken , because it gave a representative to Democrats who , after voting for Cleveland , scratched Fleming for Governor and voted for Golf , Republican . Incidentally , the majority report made a gain of four votes for McCorkle for Governor , so the Bennett minority on the committee brought in a minority report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon . with no result , the convention being unable even to vote upon the matter , because the Committee on Credentials was taking evidence on the Wayne County contest , and was unable to report . By common consent the matter was allowed to go over until evening , when it was settled by a compromise . The balloting for State officers will commence to-morrow morning , and the convention may be prolonged until Friday . The only change in the situation is a substantial gain by Col. McCorkle for Governor . lie and Judge Bennett are now about even , with about 300 votes each out of 786 . The platform adopted to-day is very long and deals chiefly with State matters . The use of Pinkertons is roundly de nounced , and the convention demands that their use in West Virginia be made a criminal offense.
