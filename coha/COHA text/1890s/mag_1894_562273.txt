txt THE consular service of the United States has received much attention of late , at least in certain sections of the country , not so much from the development of any sudden public interest in the service itself as from the rapid and violent manner in which an almost complete change in its personnel had been wrought . This change was the immediate result of a transfer of the control of the national government from the Republican to the Democratic party , and had itself been for the most part accomplished in the unprecedentedly short period of time of four months at the beginning of the new government . It was therefore but natural that the unusual upheaval and overturning of the service within so short a space of time should be embraced as furnishing an admirable opportunity to compare the inconiing and the outgoing governments in the light of previous acts and declarations bearing on the extension and enforcement of the spirit of civil-service reform . Ordinarily the constitution and condition of the consular service of the United States are subjects of entire indifference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less energy of executive action in regard to it no particular notice is taken of the peculiar characteristics of the service , and nobody turns his attention to it unless he is desirous of occupying some post within its circle himself , of procuring such a position for some one of his friends , or of obtaining some assistance from a member of it when in need or alone in a foreign country . The cousular reports are little known and little read except by those who are interested in certain business enterprises in the countries whence they proceed , or by those at whose instigation the consuls // have been instructed by the Department of State to render them . The consular despatches to the Department of State are mostly of a confidential and private nature , and the public has ordinarily little knowledge of their existence , much less any idea of the value of their contents . It seems to be the common opinion that anybody can fill a consular office , and it is curious to note how the character of the applicants for these offices has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , they have been largely made up of politicians in the narrowest meaning of the term , of broken-down and unsuccessful professional or business men , of invalids , of men of moderate means who desired to stay abroad to educate their children and at the same time wanted some occupation for themselves as a pastime , and sometimes of men whose sole claim to an appointment was that they had worn out the patience and endurance of their friends in this country by their worthlessness , and were to be sent away to free their friends from the burden of caring for them . It very rarely happens that a man offers himself for appointment to the service because he is attracted by its character or hopes to make it his profession . As a rule the service is entered into as a makeshift to tide over a difficult season , or as furnishing an opportunity to study for a time in a foreign country , or to recuperate from the hard work and cares of a professional or business career . The reason for this is of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life before him , and with all the hopes and ambitions that that implies , will voluntarily take up with a service which offers no stability of tenure in office , and in a large majority of its posts presents no reasonable expectation of furnishing more than a bare subsistence at the best for his old age , nor will a man of riper age , if he has any prospects whatever in the world , sacrifice what he has and enter , as a profession , a service which presents to him so poor an outlook . It is not intended by the foregoing to convey the impression that the consular service of the United States is wholly bad . There are good men in the service , and their work is valuable , and their influence and example are admirable . But this is not enough to those who have the welfare and the improvement of the service at heart . They desire to place the consular service on a securer and broader foundation , either because they have had experience in it and desire to see remedied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as existing , or because they are interested in it as a branch of that government to which they are wholly devoted . They realize that with the growth in power and wealth of this country its position in the great family of nations is growing daily of greater importance , and that its commercial interests are of more and more vital interest . They know that its influence commercially depends in a marked degree upon the character and bearing of its commercial representatives abroad , which its consuls are ; and as the commerce of the country increases so the necessity arises of insuring a more perfect representation of its commercial interests in foreign countries , and a fuller and more competent assistance in the development of its commercial relations . They are always looking earnestly for an improvement of the service . Now there are at least three directions by which the consular service can be approached with a view to improvement ; namely , the manner of appointment , the tenure of office , and the compensation . The limits of this paper will allow only a cursory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertinent to these subjects . The Constitution provides , in Article II , Section 2 , that the President shall appoint consuls by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , and one of the first duties of the incoming President , under the present practice , is to see to the filling of these offices . The persons to be appointed are generally agreed upon by the President and his Secretary of State , the latter being the officer under whose instructions the future consul is to do his work . The President naturally has little time in the first months of his administration to attend , himself , to these appointments , and the Secretary of State has largely within his sole control the selection of the persons to be recommended for favorable action by the President . The Secretary of State is , in the ordinary course of events , entirely new to the duties of his office . It very seldom occurs in present times that he has had any diplomatic or consular experience whatever , and he can know but little , if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is ignorant of the kind of men who should be sent respectively to the different posts . In the exercise of the best judgment he can form , he can not know , except from a vague confidence in a man 's ability , that he is in any way suited to the position for which he is named ; and yet he is expected , under the present // practice , to select the persons to be appointed to the greater * number of consular offices within the first six months of his incii mbency . The applicants , moreover , themselves , for the most part , are strangers to the service . They have no knowledge of its requirements , nor can they judge of their own fitness for the positions to which they lay claim . Naturalized citizens seek to be accredited to the country whence they originally came , and persons living in the United States on the borders of Canada petition to be appointed to a post just over the boundary line from their home ; the former because they desire to revisit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may live and carry on their business at home , slipping across the border when it is convenient to attend to consular matters , thus evading the spirit , at least , of the rule which forbids consular officers receiving salaries in excess of $1,000 from transacting business within their districts . No examination is made into their qualifications . Some few may have been in the consular service before , but usually it is their political or social influence , and not their experience , which eventually secures a new place for them . Political backing brings better results than the claims of previous experience and of good service . The most the appointing power can do is to make the sponsors vouch for the character and the ability of the applicant , and hold them responsible if their representations eventually are proved to have been false . There can be no question that the present method of selection &amp;s applied to the existing consular system is bad . If there is to be no change in that system , some different method from that which now exists should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only men who have been proved to be fit in character and ability and attainments presented to the President for his selection , free as far as possible from political pressure . But how to determine the fitness is the stumbling , block . This might be done by examination conducted under the direction of the Civil-Service Commission , only persons who are certified by them to be eligible for appointment ; but among other objections to this method it is not at all clear that it would be a satisfactory manner of selecting the fittest person , because , as can be easily understood , there are elements which go to make up a good consular officer which could hardly be ascertained or determined by such an examination . There is no advantage in making // a change for change 's sake oniy , and it seems that the method of selection might with safety be left as it is at present , if only the system of the service were so changed that the tenure of office in the service itself were securely fixed to last during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be so organized that if a man were once appointed to any consular office he should thereby become a member of the consular service during good behavior and be removable only for cause , not necessarily to remain always at the port to which he was originally appointed , but subject from to time to time to be transferred by the President from one port to another , as it might be deemed best for the interests of the service . If the elements of permanency of tenure and of adequate compensation were assured , there would , in the nature of things , be few vacancies at any one time , and at the time of a change of administration there would be no more than at any other . The pressure upon an incoming administration would be avoided , there would be time in which to make a proper selection , and the knowledge that the appointment was to be made for good behavior would place a greater responsibility upon the appointing power and upon the persons recommending the applicant , while correspondingly greater care would be exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems inevitable that with fixity of tenure joined to proper compensation would come a better class of persons seeking appointThent . The tenure of office of consular officers now is dependent solely upon the will of the appointing power and has long been governed by the exigencies of political expediency . It would not be worth the while for Congress to change this and fix a period of time by statute unless at the same time they increased the pay for the different offices . The fixity or certainty of tenure must go pan jassu with an increase in pay . What is wanting is to tempt able and stirring men to enter the service for what it can offer them as a life career , and it can not be expected that such men would find any inducement in the assurance of a permanency of service at an inadequate compensation . With the exception of a comparatively few posts the compensation at present allowed is totally inadequate to the proper or , in many instances , decent maintenance of the dignity of the officer or of the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humble position in the community in which he lives , and many persons are perfectly // content to occupy such a position so far as they individually arc concerned , and their being so is a subject of reproach to them . But if the representative of a great nation , in a foreign country , is unable for lack of means to maintain himself in a manner similar to the like representatives of other nations , it is a reproach to all men of the nation which he is sent to represent . Of course it is always possible to send somebody of private means to the places where the compensation is too small for a ; man to live properly without such means , but assuredly nothing could be more undemocratic and contrary to the true spirit of all of the institutions of this country than to have a branch of the public service in which the compensation of most of the offices is so small that for the sake of the dignity of the country abroad they can only be filled by persons of independent fortune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices , of which about three hundred and thirty are principal offices , so called , the remaining four hundred and fortyseven being designated as consular agencies . A consular agency is subordinate to the principal office within whose jurisdiction it comes . It is created ordinarily at the suggestion of the principal consular officer , or of the people of the place itself , with the consent of the Department of State , and in almost every instance the agent is nominated by the principal officer and approved by the Department of State . The agent is paid solely from the fees received and is almost invariably a citizen of a foreign country engaged in business in the place where he is agent , often hardly able to speak a word of English , who accepts the place simply for the honor and position which come to him from being the representative of the United States in the locality to which he belongs . As has been intimated , he is paid no salary , but obtains what emoluments he can from that amount of the fees or receipts coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his superior officer , which amount is usually fixed by agreement between himself and such officer . It should be remembered in this connection that the superior officer has named him for the agency , and is entitled under the regulations to pocket his share of the fees coming from his agencies as unofficial fees up to *1 , OOO in amount . Otdinarily the purpose of creating these agencies is to accommodate merchants who desire near them a consular office for the authentica - tion of invoices of goods exported to the United States , and // seek very naturally to avoid the delay and expense which may be caused to them if they are obliged to apply to the principal office which may be at some distance from them . The business of the shipper of goods to the United States has been the governing reason for the creation of lhe consular office , and the imjossihility of finding a citizen of the United States to take the office for the compensation has obliged the government to resort to the device of a consular agency . Besides the manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the commercial interests of the citizens of this country , it can readily be seen that inasmuch as the principal officer shares in the fees collected by his agent the temptation to the former to lend his influence in favor of the creation of agencies within his district , and thus help out his meagre and inadequate salary , is often great . Fees which naturally in the absence of an agency would be collected for services rendered at the principal office , and which would be turned in that case into the Treasury of the United States , are in this manner diverted , and being collected for services rendered at the agency are divided between the principal officer and his agent . It would be most advantageous that all consular agencies should be abolished , and that the official fees which now go to their support should go to the principal office , which ought in every case to be a salaried one , and be turned into the Treasury with the other official fees which come to that office . If these agencies were abolished there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which two hundred and thirty-seven are now salaried , and ninety-three receive no salaries . These last are compensated entirely by the official and unofficial fees which they may from time to time collect . The highest salary paid is $7,500 , and that amount is paid only at Seoul , Korea , where the Consul-General is also Minister Resident , and consequently occupies a diplomatic position with all the expenses incident thereto . The Consul-General at Athens , Bucharest , and Belgrade is paid $6,500 . He is also Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece , IRoumania , and Ser.via , and serves in all the above offices for one and the same salary . The Consul-General at Havana receives $6,000 , and the Consul-General at Melbourne $4,500 . There are twelve offices where $5,000 are paid , viz. : Rio de Janeiro , Shanghai , // Paris , Calcutta , Hong Kong , Liverpool , London , Port an Prince , Boma , Teheran , Cairo , and Bangkok ( where the Consul is also Minister Resident ) ; seven offices where $4,000 are paid , viz. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monrovia , and Mexico ; seven where $3,500 are paid , viz. ; Vienna , Amoy , Canton , Tien Tsin , Havre , Halifax , and Callao ; thirty-one where *3,000 are paid ; thirty where $2,500 are paid ; and fifty-one where *2 ) 000 are paid . The remaining ninety-five of the salaried officers receive salaries of only $1,500 or *1,000 per annum . Consular officers are not allowed their travelling expenses to and from their posts , no matter how distant the latter may be . They are simply entitled to their salaries during the transit , provided they do not consume more than a certain number of days itt lransilu , which number is fixed by the Secretary of State , nor are they allowed to transact any business in the place to which they are accredited where their salary exceeds *1,000 . They are allowed a certain sum of money for rent of consular offices , which has been fixed at twenty per cent . of the salary , but this sum is spent under the direction of the Department of State , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so speaking , and can not be applied to the rental of their own house or lodgings . A clerk is allowed in some cases , and sometimes also a messenger where there seems to be an absolute need of such ; but the appropriations made by Congress for clerk hire and for contingent expenses of consuls for many years past have been so grossly inadequate to the needs of the service that in most posts the offices are miserably equipped both as to clerks and messengers . There are certain emoluments coining to consuls at certain posts of an unofficial nature , such as fees for taking depositions , oaths , etc. , which are not considered , official in their nature , and which a consular officer is therefore allowed to retain as his private property . All official fees  --  and these are prescribed by the President-every consular officer receiving a salary is bound to account for and to ' turn over to the Treasury of the United States . The unofficial fees in some places amount to large sums , and in London , Liverpool , Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , render the office of unusual value . In London , for instance , the unofficial fees amount to five or six times the prescribed salary . But the places where such large // fees are to be secured are very few indeed , and might almost be said to be covered by the three places above named . By an odd perversion of justice , the receipts from unofficial fees are largest in the places where the largest salaries are paid . It is not difficult to picture the plight of the man who finds himself , for example , in Ceylon , Auckland , or Cape Town , or , not quite so bad , but bad enough , in Malta , or Santos , or Para , all of which are places where the salaries are fixed at $1,500 , with no financial resources except his salary . What must be the desperate financial embarrassment of the consul to either of these places who starts off for his post with the month 's pay allowed him for what is called his instruction period and with 110 opportunity even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for his traiisit period , which can only be paid after he has rendered his accounts upon his arrival at the post , and with the remainder of his $1,500 to keep him for the rest of the year ? It is not to be wondered at that some of our consular officers get into financial difficulties and leave their offices at the expiration of their terms , with debts unpaid . It is rather a matter of surprise that they manage as well as they appear to do . It may not , to be sure , cost a great deal for a man to live at Ceylon or Cape Town , when once he manages to reach those places ; but even if that be a fact , he must live away from his family and in a most meager manner to eke out existence upon the present allowance . So too in Europe , in such places as Liege , and Copenhagen , and Nice , and many others where the salary is $1,500 and the unofficial work yields hardly any return . These are only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man without property of his own sufficient to make him practically independent of his salary so far as subsistence is concerne ( l who goes for instance to Trieste , Cologne , Dublin , or Leeds , or to Sydney , New South Wales , or to Guatemala , or Managua , or to Tamatave , Madagascar , or to Odessa , or Manila , or Beirut , or Jerusalem , on a salary of $2,000 is relatively little better off . Nor is the position of a consul at Buenos Ayres , or at Brussels , or at Marseilles , Hamburg , Sheffield , Nuevo Laredo , Athens , Ningpo , or Victoria , B. C. , with a salary of $2,500 to be envied , with the necessary demands which he is obliged to meet . It is of course notorious that there are many more applicants for even the worst of these offices than there are offices , and that // numberless men will be readily found to sacrifice themselves for t good of their country and go to Tamatave or sydney on he 2,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of the citizens of the United States is presumably centred more upon the welfare of the public service than on furnishing places for self-sacrificing individuals . They take no satisfaction in the creation of a consular office unless its existence is for the efficiency of the service as organized for their benefit . If such conditions are annexed to its creation as to militate against its effectiveness to accomplish the purpose for which it is created , the reason for its creation ceases to exist . That reason is primarily that the consular officer may encourage the increase of trade between his country and the country to which be is accredited by giving assistance in the way of information and protection to his fellow-citizens . In order to do this effectively he must be a man whose character inspires respect among the people with whom he associates and who has influence threugh his character , abilities , and position , not only as an officer , but also as a man among the people with whom he is to transact the business of his office . If the pecuniary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render it impossible for him to live on an equality with his colleagues , or to maintain a social position in the community such as they are able to maintain , his government is the loser . It is far better to have no consular office in any given place than to cripple its efficiency by the conditions of its creation . Unless Congress can see its way to make more generous appropriations for the consular service with a view principally to creating larger salaries , it would be far wiser to reduce the number of salaried offices and to distribute the sum of money now appropriated for the pay of two hundred and thirty-seven officers among one-half that number with salari3s proportionately greater . Jn any case there should be no unsalaried officers whatever and no salary below twenty-five hundred dollars . There are now , as we have seen , besides the subordinate agencies which we have suggested should be abolished , about ninety-three unsalaried principal officers who receive their compensation in fees . These offices should either be abolished or should be made salaried offices and the fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries the United States maintains a far greater number of consular offices than is required by the demands of // commerce and one which seems , moreover , disproportionate to the number maintained by these countries respectively in this country . For instance , in Germany we have fifty-one consular officers , while Germany has twenty-two in this country . In France the United States has thirty-seven , and France has twenty-five in this country . In the islands of Great Britain alone the United States has fifty-seven , in British North America about onehundred and thirty , besides others scattered over the world in other possessions of the British Empire . Great Britain has , in all , forty-two consular offices in this country . A great reduction in the number of United States consular officers could most advantageously be made in Canada , especially in the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario . It is not going too far to state that two-thirds of the offices in these provinces could be discontinued with the best results for the interests of the service . If the prizes are larger , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not compete for an inferior prize , and in order to induce such men as should be in the consular service te enter it as a life career , there should be assured to them as long as they remain in it at least a livelihood approximate to that which they would have secured if they had remained in the ordinary walks of life . It is inno way in conflict with the spirit of our institutions that a man who has once been proved competent for a branch of the government service should remain in it as long as he behaves himself , or , if the duties which he performs therein are worthy of performance , that the pay should be sufficient to support him . Tenure of office during good behavior , in the sense above indicated , and adequate compensation , would free the service from some of its existing evils and threatened dangers , and , whether effected in the manner here suggested or however otherwise accomplished , are necessary elements in its reformation . And they should go together , for the reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can work.
