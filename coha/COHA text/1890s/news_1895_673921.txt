txt We are in a state of contented ignorance as to the antecedents or associations of the attorney who yesterday served Mayor Strong with notice of mandamus proceedings . From tee fact that he has invoked the authority of . the courts to compel the Mayor to " observe the bi-partisan provision of the law under which the Police . Board is organized , " and select Commissioners from the regular Republican organization and from Tammany Hall , it may be inferred that he is himself attached to one or the other of these political machines . But it is also supposable that he is a legal practitioner with an extreme devotion to logic , and that he sees in Messrs . Roosevelt and Grant , Parker and Andrews the result of an imperfect or perverted interpretation of the famous statute to which Mayor Strong gave life by his approval . If the latter hypothesis be correct , we have sympathy with the attorney , though we are far from predicting what view the courts will take . of his case . The Mayor 's Police Board is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and certainly not in the sense in which Mr. Strong himself used the term in explaining his acceptance of the law . On the contrary , both the acts and the words of his Commissioners proclaim their purpose not to be bi-partisan in any sense , but to be non-partisan -- that is , to do their plain duty without the slightest reference to their own partisanship or that of those under them , or even the Mayor 's . Undoubtedly Mr. Strong is well satisfied with this result , being a very honest man at heart and much better as a citizen than as a politician or logician . When we contemplate the remarkable excellence of his Police Board , and remember the amazing weakness of his avowed theory of Police Boards , we incline to regard him as one of those who " Do good by stealth , and blush to find it fame . " It may be that the courts will hold him to his theory , and to the ordinary interpretation of the preposterous law , and if they do so , he can hardly complain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Carlyle would have . said , get itself repealed , for the people of New-York like the actual situation very much , and will not consent to give it up .
