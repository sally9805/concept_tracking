By Winfeld ? Nevins . Hawthorne at 36 . HAWTHORNE was indeed a migratory being . During the fifty years of his New England life he resided in Salem , in Raymond and Brunswick in Maine , in Boston , West Roxbury , Lenox , West Newton , and Concord . During the seven years he was in Europe he lived in two or three houses in and around Liverpool , and in London , Paris , Rome , and Florence . Not only was he migratory with regard to his homes , but wherever he lived he was restless and constantly going about from place to place , roaming the woods , fields , and pastures . His Note Book tells us much of his perambulations in the neighborhoods where he resided ; hardly an entry in it but describes some walk during that day or the preceding . Born in 1804 and dying in 1864 , Hawthorne lived among men sixty years . For thirtyfive years of that time , including the college years , Salem was his home , and during that period he resided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 289 " I sat last evening , as twilight came on , and thought , rather sadly , how many times we have changed our home since we were married " ; and then he names the places where they had lived . His son Julian , writing of his father 's restlessness , says : " After freeing himself from Salem , Hawthorne never found any perfect rest anywhere . He soon wearied of any particular locality . . Partly necessity or convenience , but partly also his own will , drove him from place to place , always wishing to settle down finally , but never lighting upon the fitting spot . In America he moved from place to place and longed for England . In England he travelled constantly and looked forward to France and italy . In Paris , Rome , and Florence his affections reverted to England once more ; but having returned thither he made it but a stepping-stone to America . " Yet after all , Hawthorne was not much of a " traveller " in the ordinary meaning of the term . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip abroad . He made two or three vacation trips to Maine and New Hampshire . At some time he must have visited Niagara and Ticonderoga ; and he went on a carriage journey up the Connecticut Valley with his uncle when a young man . In 1853 , and again in 1862 , he visited Washington . This comprises substantially all that he saw of his own country . A man 's birthplace , if he become famous in after life , almost always possesses the most interest of any place with which his name ever becomes associated . It is so in the case of Hawthorne . The number of pilgrims from all parts of the world who go to Salem to look at the old , brown , gambrel-roofed house , numbered 21 Union Street , because nearly a century ago Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in its northwest corner , second-story room , is very large , and each year increasing . It is the same THE // old house , with the same monster chimney , that it was in 1804 or , for that matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is said to have been built by Capt . Benjamin Pickman , who was a Salem shipmaster , in i 700 . At all events , Nathaniel Hawthorne 's grandfather lived in it as early as 1772 , and it was the home of his father and mother from their marriage until i8o8 , when the father , also a shipmaster , died in foreign parts . The house is now the abode of a well-todo family of foreign extraction , and is well preserved , neat , and tidy . In 1873 I saw this historic old house " knocked down ) ' under the auctioneer 's hammer in as prosaic a manner as if it had always been inhabited by Smith , Brown , or Jones . The " third and last call " was for $2,375 . It was only for four short years that Hawthorne lived in the Union Street house . Immediately on the death of Capt . Hawthorne , Mrs. Hawthorne moved to No. 12 Herbert Street , a house owned and partly occupied by her father , Richard Manning . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , and the back yards of the two houses joined . Mr. Manning had a large stable and a stage office near by on Union Street . The Manning house was a large threestory one , severely plain . To-day it is a very common tenement house , and as one looks at it and its surroundings he finds it difficult to associate the great Salem romancer with such a place . It was Hawthorne 's home for nearly a quarter of a century in all . Here he lived during nearly all his boyhood days . and until i8i8 , when he went to Raymond with his mother . Returning the next year to fit for college , he lived with his grandfather two years , and with his mother during the three years following graduation . Horatio Bridge writes in a recent magazine article : " In two or three flying visits made him by invitation after graduation I saw no evidence of narrow circumstances in their environment . The family occupied the old home of Mrs. Hawthorne 's father , their moderate income being sufficient for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . These had been defrayed by his maternal uncle , Robert Manning . ' * It was of his life atthis time-from 1825 to 1828 - that Hawthorne himself wrote : " 1 had always a natural tendency towards seclusions ; and this I now indulged to the utmost , so that , for months together* I. Hawthorne 's Birthplace 2 . The rear of the Herbert Street House , showing Window of Hawthorne 's Study , // I scarcely had human intercourse outside my own family , seldom going out except at twilight , or only to take the nearest way to the most convenient solitude , which was oftenest the seashore . . . . Once a year or thereabouts I used to make an excursion of a few weeks . . . . I had very few acquaintances in Salem , and during the nine or ten years that I spent there , in this solitary way , I doubt whether so much as twenty people in the town were aware of my existence . " Hawthorne 's sister , Elizabeth , wrote of him about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went out for about an hour , whatever the weather was ; and in winter , after his return , he ate a pint bowl of thick chocolate crumbed full of bread . " From Herbert Street , some time in 1828 , the Hawthornes moved to Dearborn Street in North Salem , remaining about fniiv yerws , when we again find them - nning homestead . Haw The Dearborn Street House . thorne lived there most of the time during the next six or seven years . He boarded in Boston a few months at a time on one or two occasions while engaged in editorial and other literary work there , but came down to Salem every week or two . Again , soon after his marriage , he and his wife boarded at the Herbert Street house about ten months and this is the last we hear of him there , save for an occasional visit . The life of the family in this house was a most extraordinary one . The members rarely met together . Mrs. Hawthorne took her meals in her room and alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have already seen how Nathaniel withdrew himself from the world . There was certainly no " family circle " in that household . But it was in this house that Hawthorne wrote most of the first volume of " TwiceTold Tales , " and many other of those short sketches that have delighted the world for half a century ; and here he wrote some of the finest passages that adorn the " American Note Book . " He occupied a room on the westerly The chestnut Street House . // corner in the third story ; and here , he says , his " mind and character were formed . " It was in this room and of it that he wrote , while on a visit to Salem , in October , 1840 , those words that every biographer feels in duty bound to quote : " Here I sit in my old accustomed chamber , where I used to sit in days gone by . . . . Here I have written many tales - many that have been burned to ashes , many , doubtless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have a biographer , he ought to make great mention of this chamber in my memoirs , because so much of my lonely youth was wasted here , and here my mind and character were formed . " The Hawthornes moved into the Dearborn Street house soon after its completion in 1828 , Mr. Manning having built it partly on their account . It was a pretty little gambrelroofed cottage ; and the street is one of the most delightful in Salem , especially in summer , when the great elms on either side fairly arch it with their wide-spreading branches hung with bountiful foliage ; OF HA WTHORNE. beautiful even in winter when those branches are bowed to the ground with snow and ice . In Hawthorne 's day there were few houses on Dearborn Street , nor was the neighborhood thickly settled. ; and the contrast between it , with its rural beauties , and the general gloom and antiquity of narrow Herbert and Union Streets must have been very striking . The cottage stood where No. 31 now stands , on the northerly side of the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The neighborhood beyond Dearborn Street was especially attractive then , with its fields and pastures , orchards and oak groves ; and through these Hawthorne roamed at his own sweet will . It was in 1832 that the family left this house and moved down town again . I take it these frequent changes were the result of living at all times in Mr. Manning 's houses , and were made to accommodate him or his family . The next Salem house in which Hawthorne lived was on Chestnut Street , the house now numbered i 8 . He rented it in August , 1846 , after his appointment to the Salem surveyorship . The house must The House of Seven Gables . The Mall Street House in which Hawthorne wrote The Scarlet Letter . // have been quite modern in those days , for it is now probably less than a century old . It was of fairly liberal dimensions , yet much unlike those aristocratic mansions that have given the street its air of dignity and exclusiveness for more than a hundred years . Why Hawthorne located here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common with most of his neighbors , and his salary of twelve hundred dollars was not sufficient to enable him to live in Chestnut Street style . He did not belong in the " upper class " of Salem society , and he should have known that he could not get there by living on Chestnut Street : others before him and since have found that out . His living there may have been purely accidental . At all events , he soon changed to decidedly less pretentious quarters on a down-town side street . He does not appear to have done any literary work during the time he lived on Chestnut Street . No. 14 Mall Street , where we next find him , is to my mind the most noted of all the Hawthorne houses in America or Europe , because in it he wrote his masterpiece , " The Scarlet Letter , " the book that brought to him world-wide fame , and which is to-day his best-known work . The Mall Street house dates back into the last century , but it is still well preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a desirable one for the good average Salem citizen , the trader or professional man . The house was quite large , three-storied , and surrounded by trees and shubbery . Hawthorne 's study was in the third-story front room , but the room where he kept the manuscript of " The Scarlet Letter " is believed to have been on the second floor , near the middle of the house . It was in this house , in the winter of 1849-50 , that James T. Fields found Hawthorne , " alone in a chamber over a sitting-room of the dwelling , and as the day was cold he was hovering near the stove . " After trying to get from him some statement as to what he had been writing , and failing of a satisfactory answer , Fields started to go down-stairs , having bade his host good by and shut the door . Quickly after , Hawthorne opened the door and came running down-stairs with a manuscript in his ' hands , which he handed to the publisher , and hurried back to his chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Scarlet Letter " made its author famous - the most noted man of letters of his time and country . It was substantially the only ' work he did while living in the Mall Street house ; but if it had been all that he ever did , there or anywhere during life , it would have rendered his name and fame imperishable , and the house in which it was penned of the greatest historic interest . Hawthorne evidently had the story in mind some time before he began to write it , but he did little or no literary work until after his removal from the surveyorship through the trickery and betrayal of professing friends . He had saved nothing from his salary , and , but for the forethought of his wife in laying aside a hundred or two dollars of the money given to her for household expenses , The Custom House Salem . // they would have been penniless . As it was , sickness in the family and the death of Hawthorne 's mother reduced them to straitened circumstances . A liberal contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and until " The Scarlet Letter " was published . From that time to the end , Hawthorne 's reputation enabled him to earn enough with his pen to provide the necessaries of life , and much more if he would work . From Mall Street , in the summer of 1840 , the Hawthornes went to live in Lenox . It was then t1*at they left Salem for good . Here a word needs to be said about the Salem Custom House , now and forever a historic building , annually visited by thousands of pilgrims to the old Puritan city . It is a two-story brick building fronting on Derby Street , opposite the head of the old Derby Wharf . The entrance is reached by a flight of stone steps . Over the door is the eagle described in the introductory chapter of " The Scarlet Letter " as " an enormous specimen of the American eagle with outspread wings , a shield before her breast and , if I recollect aright , a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150,000 a year ; now they average some pro , ooo . Derby Wharf , which stretches out in front of the Custom House for an eighth of a mile , a dilapidated and partially deserted structure , with a street-car house and stables at the upper end , was in Hawthorne 's day alive with merchantmen from all the principal ports of the world . In a room here ( then unfinished and used as a storeroom , now the collector 's private office ) , Hawthorne tells us , he found the now historic scarlet letter ( A ) . The obliging government officials will show this room to the visitor ; likewise the books kept by " Nathaniel Hawthorne , Surveyor . " One other house in Salem calls for particular mention in connection with Hawthorne , the old house at the foot of Turner Street , known as the House of Seven Gables . During a portion of his residence in Salem , Hawthorne was a frequent visitor to the place , then the home of " Susie " Ingersol . Here , too , lived Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of his jaunts around the city and suburbs , and who occasionally accompanied him on a more distant trip . Connolly was one of the very few persons who was on intimate terms with the great romancer . The Turner Street house was built a century and a quarter before Hawthorne was born . We do not know just how it looked when new , for it had undergone great changes even before Hawthorne 's day . It originally had many gables . Some of these existed in his day , but most of them have now disappeared before the march of modern improvements , until the place has very much the appearance outwardly of a modern nineteenth-century dwelling . Fortunately , the artistic tastes of the musician and artist who occupy it have preserved* much of the original of the interior . The identity of this house with the original of the story of " Seven Gables " has been questioned . Lathrop , Hawthorne 's son-in-law , once wrote that Hawthorne himself " said distinctly that he had no particular house in mind . " Julian Hawthorne says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ; but he does not do it , nor say which way it would be settled , although he leaves one to infer that he entertains the same view as Grimshawe House . // Lathrop . Per contra , Hawthorne wrote to Fields , his publisher : " I am beginning to puzzle myself about a title for the book . The scene of it is one of those old projecting storied houses familiar to my eye in Salem ; and the story , horrible to say , is a little less than two hundred years long , though all but thirty or forty pages of it refer to the present time . I think of such titles as The House of Seven Gables , there being that number of gable ends to the old shanty ; or Seven Gabled House ; or simply The Seven Gables . " After such a positive declaration as this , why should people believe that the writer had no particular house in mind ? But there is still further evidence in his own handwriting . In the Preface to the book he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assign an actual locality to the imaginary events of this narrative . If permitted by the historical connection which , though slight , was essential to his plan , the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature . " Thus he acknowledges that some things were actual history . In the first chapter he says further , " Thus the great house was built . Familiar as it stands in the writer 's recollection , for it had been an oblect of curiosity with him from boyhood ; " etc . Other lines in the book re-enforce the claim . It would seem , then , unquestionably , from his own writings , that he did have a particular house in mind . Was it the Turner Street house ? That is somewhat more difficult to prove . It is certain that it answers more nearly the descriptions given in the book as regards the building itself , its surroundings and locality , than any other in Salem or elsewhere ; and it was the only house of the kind in Salem with which Hawthorne was familiar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Philip English house on lower Essex Street , and the Roger Williams house , farther up town , have been suggested as possible originals . But they were not " half-way down a by-street " ; nor were they on such a street that the pennypostman would keep a letter in his pocket three or four days because he " happened to have no other business in Pyncheon Street , " and " had not made it convenient to call at the House of Seven Gables " ; nor was either in a retired neighborhood ; nor had Essex Street ever Bowdoin college in 1830 . Hawthorne 's Home at Raymond , Me. // been known as a " lane . " But the location of the Turner Street house answered perfectly each and every one of these descriptions ; and more , " it was surrounded by habitations of more modern date , small , but built entirely of wood , and The Little Red House near Stockbridge Bowl . typical of the most plodding uniformity of common life . " In some unimportant respects it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , a political procession would not have passed it , because it is near the foot of the street next to the water , with no outlet at the end . But in the story the procession was made to pass the house for the purpose of exhibiting a phase of Clifford 's peculiar mental condition . Hawthorne was famous for making use of real personages and places , very slightly changed , in his stories and sketches . So frequently did he do this , and so closely to the originals were the portraits drawn , that we often find him apologizing in prefaces , and letters to some who feel aggrieved at being thus portrayed . " The House of Seven Gables , " like most others of his works , is full of persons and places drawn from life , notably in the case of Judge Pyncheon , where the real name of a former resident of Salem was used , although the portrait is that of another man . A house of seven gables was no doubt quite common in Hawthorne 's day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roof , two gable windows in the rear , where we now have dormer windows , and three in front , one being in the centre over the door . It can hardly be said that Hawthorne had any particular haunt in and around Salem . He went almost everywhere about the city , and to Danvers , Marblehead , Swampscott , Beverly Shore , Manchester Beach , and even as far as Gloucester sometimes . The " American Note Book " teems with accounts of these excursions . The opening page of the first volume tells of " a walk down to the Juniper , " under date of June 15 , 1835 , where " the juniper-trees are very aged and mossgrown . The grass about the hospital is , rank , being trodden by nobody but myself . " He notes a sail " cut with a penknife on the corner of the house , " implying that there was then only one house , which is true . " The Juniper , " on Salem Neck , is now a summer settlement , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being reached only on foot , as in Hawthorne 's day , is connected with the town by electric cars , and has electric lights and telephones . June iS , it wa* " a walk in North Salem in the decline of yesterday afternoon . " He " bathed in the cove , overhung with maples and walnuts . " Under date of Aug. 31 , he records a " drive to Nahant yesterday afternoon " ; and , Sept. 7 , " a drive to Ipswich " ; Aug. 3 , 1836 , " a walk down to the shore near the hospital " ; and Oct. // through the village of Danvers . " Dark Lane was a narrow country road in Danvers , almost under the shadow of Browne 's hill , sometimes called Browne 's Folly , or Folly Hill , then and now a most picturesque and romantic bit of highway . Hawthorne often included it in his pedestrian tours . Just a year later - October , 1837 - he walked " through Beverly to Browne 's hill . This Browne 's hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying in the midst of a level plain ; it looks at a distance somewhat like a whale , with its head and tail under water , but its immense back protruding , with steep sides , and a gradual curve along its length . " On the summit of this hill , in 1750 , Hon. William Browne of Salem built a palatial mansion , with a large central hall , having two wings , and giving a frontage of more than seventy feet . Browne failed , and the house was taken apart and moved off the hill ; hence the name , Browne 's Folly . Aug. 22 , 1837 , Hawthorne writes of " a walk yesterday afternoon down to the Juniper and Winter Island . " Winter Island is a small peninsula just to the west from Juniper Point ; and on it , . in 1779 , the frigate Essex was built . Oct. 7 , it was " a walk in Northfields in the afternoon . " He notes with minuteness the various objects encountered : " In sunny spots beneath the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage , as I passed , I disturbed multitudes of grasshoppers basking in the warm sunshine . " He passed an orchard where two men were gathering apples , and records minutely how they did their work and what they said to each other . Ten days later he " spent the whole afternoon in a ramble to the seashore near Phillip Beach " ( Swampscott ) . He " crossed the fields near the Brookhouse villa ( Marblehead Farms ) and came upon a long beach , at least a mile long , I should think , terminated by craggy rocks at either end . " This walk from Salem to Swampscott and return must have covered ten miles at least . The Danvers walk , whether through the village or by way of Beverly , would have been an equal distance , and the Northfields or Juniper walk and return , three or four miles . There are many other localities in and around Salem that Hawthorne visited more or less frequently ; but enough have already been mentioned to indicate the extent of his wandering tendencies . Bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Romans in the days of Caracalla , for his Note Book makes repeated mention of the exercise . When in 1862 he and his son were at Pride 's Crossing in Beverly , he visited the beach once or twice daily , usually bathing in the ocean every day ; and at Concord he records that he bathed in the river twice a day very often . Somehow , this world seemed constantly to turn its disagreeable side to him , or else he persisted in looking on the dark side . Writing from Beverly one day he said : " I am not much more discontented than with many other spots in this weary world . " Hawthorne dwelt in Raymond scarcely a twelvemouth at one time . The family went there late in i8i8 , and he returned to Salem to fit for coltege early the next fall . Mrs. Hawthorne and her daughters remained three or four years longer , Nathaniel visiting them occasionally . They lived in a large two-story wooden Hawthorne and his publisher , , Ticknor and Fielda. // house near the shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hawthorne by her brother Robert . Subsequently it was sold to Richard Manning , another brother , and by his will he provided that this house should be left for the use of the community as a union meetinghouse ; and it was so used for a long time . The partitions and ceilings were taken out and a high pulpit constructed in one end , and old-fashioned straight-backed pews with doors at the ends put into the body of the house . Raymond is one of the most rural towns in the southerly section of Maine , sparsely settled , having a hilly and in many portions an unproductive surface , but abounding in many natural beauties . It was in Raymond that Hawthorne began his life of restlessness . Here , he says , he " got his cursed habit of solitude . " He would skate for hours on the great lake in the solitude of night , and if he got too far away from home to return would seek shelter in some logger 's lonely cabin and there pass the night , warmed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer he would pass whole days roaming the woods with a gun on his shoulder . He could hardly be said to be hunting , for he took little note of game . If the journal published as Hawthorne 's in the Portland Transcript some years ago was genuine , then it was in Raymond that he began his literary career , and especially so much of it as afterward became famous as the Note Books , American and English . Of Hawthorne 's life in Bowdoin College we have only such information as is found in his letters to his mother , sister , and uncle , and the very recent magazine articles of his friend and classmate , Horatio Bridge . The habit of roaming the country , begun at Raymond , was continued in Brunswick . The companionships there formed are as widely known almost as is the story of Hawthorne 's own life . There were Longfellow , destined later to become the first poet of his time , as Hawthorne was to become the most celebrated man of letters ; and Franklin Pierce , destined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Horatio Bridge was a man who was destined for most responsible trusts , which he fulfilled with not more honor to himself than his country . With Bridge , Hawthorne explored the country around for many miles . Trout-fishing was one of his favorite recreations . Toward Bath there was a famous trout brook , much frequented by Hawthorne , sometimes alone and sometimes with Bridge or others . " In this brook , " says Bridge , " we often fished for the small trout that were to be found there ; but the main charm of these outings was in the indolent loitering along the low banks of the little stream , listening to its murmur or to the whispering of the overhanging pines . " This has come to be known locally as Hawthorne Brook . " Another of our strolls , " he says , " was in a sparsely settled street by the ( Androscoggin ) river , where , " says Bridge , " Hawthorne and I often walked , silent or conversing , according to the humor of the hour . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting an old fortune-teller . Hawthorne probably began his drinking habits while at college , - habits that unfortunately lasted him through life and constituted always his greatest weakness . Bridge says : " In a corner of the present campus stood Ward 's tavern . There oftener than elsewhere Hawthorne indulged in the usual convivialities of the period . The customary pastimes included card-playing and wine-drinking , in which he joined his friends through good-fellowHawthorne 's House at West Newton . // ship , but he rarely exceeded the bounds of moderation . " He was fined on one occasion for playing cards , and wrote to his sister that " when the president asked what we played for , I thought it proper to inform him it was for fifty cents , although it happened to be a quart of wine ; but if I had told him that , he would probably have fined me for having a blow . " The president 's letter to Mrs. Hawthorne about the affair was forwarded to Nathaniel , and he wrote to his sister " It is not so severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been led away by the wicked ones , in which , however , he is mistaken . I was fully as willing to play as the person he suspects of having enticed me . " He had a great mind to begin playing again , to show that he scorned to be seduced by another . Whether he did begin again while in college , certain it is that cards and wine were favorite indulgences of his during much of his life in Salem . On July 23 , 1838 , Hawthorne left Salem for a visit to the western part of the State , most of which was spent in and around North Adams . He was absent about two months . Why he made this trip the Note Book does not inform us , although it is unusually full of those days , covering over eighty pages . His letters and his biographers are equally silent . The trip from Salem to Boston by stage on this occasion was undoubtedly the last one he ever made in that conveyance , for the Eastern Railway was opened to public travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have been made by easy stages , the traveller stopping at different places on the way for a day or more at a time . During his stay in North Adams he resumed his tramping habits and visited every part of the surrounding country . Trips were made to Hoosac Mountain , Greylock , Saddleback , Shelburne Falls , Williams College , and many other places . One day he took a walk of three miles beyond the village , which brought him into Vermont . The Notch back of the town was frequently visited , where the cool water of the mountain stream afforded him excellent bathing . " I bathed in the stream , " he writes , " in this old secluded spot , which I frequent for that purpose . " Perhaps nowhere did Hawthorne ever enjoy the beauties of nature more than around this Western Massachusetts village . His Note Book of that period is teeming with charming descriptive passages . Possibly he saw Lenox at this time , and that was how he happened to go there to live twelve years later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mall Street house , Salem , that he again sought the hills of Berkshire ; and here he produced his other great romance , " The House of Seven Gables . " The success of " The Scarlet Letter " contributed , no doubt , very largely to Hawthorne 's incentive to do other litererary work . Besides , he was in need of money . Lathrop tells us that he and his family were " ensconced in a small red house near the Stockbridge Bowl . It The Old Manse , from the Battle Ground . // was far from a comfortable residence ; but he had no means of obtaining a better one . Meantime he could do what he was sent into the world to do so long as he had the wherewithal to live . " The three years following the removal to Lenox , July , 1850 , to June , 1853 , were the most productive of Hawthorne 's life . Not only did he write " The House of Seven Gables " during that period , but also " The Blithedale Romance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pierce , " and " The Snow Image . " " The Wonder Book " is the only other one written in Lenox , it is true ; but that and the " Seven Gables " were the work of one year . Hawthorne continued his meanderings around the country where he lived , but there were no other interests to interrupt his work or distract his attention . He would have spells of working , when he would write for many hours a day , and day after day . He began the romance very soon after getting settled in the little red house . In October he writes to his publisher : " I sha' n't have the new story ready by November , for I am never good for anything in the literary way till after the first autumnal frost . " In November he wrote : " I write diligently , but not so rapidly as I had hoped . " He found he " had to wait longer for a mood " than when writing " The Scarlet Letter . " About the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , finished ; only I am hammering away a little at the roof , and doing up a few odd jobs that were left incomplete . " Before the end of the Walden . month the manuscript was in the publishers ' hands . As he began the story about the ist of September , he completed it in one hundred and twenty-five working days . It contains nearly one hundred and twenty-five thousand words , so that he must have averaged a thousand words a day during all that time . When we remember how he wrote and rewrote , and often threw away whole chapters , and pruned and polished , we realize that Hawthorne was not idle during those five months . The Note Book for this period gives evidence that most of the afternoons were devoted to rambles along the roads or through the woods , often accompanied by the son , and sometimes by the daughter Una . On the first day of December he records that he " saw a dandelion in bloom near the lake . " Lenox was not , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few literary people lived in or near the town . Mrs. Hawthorne wrote to her mother : " We are so happily // arranged , and we seem to have such a large house inside , though outside the little reddest thing looks like The Scarlet Letter .

We give only three cents a quart for the best milk . Butter is fourteen cents a pound , and eggs eleven and twelve cents a dozen ; potatoes , very good ones , two shillings a bushel . " " The Wonder Book " was written during the summer of 185 I , in about six weeks , being one of the few works Hawthorne ever wrote in warm weather . He undoubtedly worked at it in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole family left Lenox by rail on Nov. 21 of that year ; and the same evening they were located at West Newton , in the Horace Mann house . Hawthorne immediately set himself diligently at work on " The Blithedale Romance , " and completed it the last of April . The winter was a severe one , and he does not appear to have gone about much . He was not in the best of health , and probably did not devote himself to work as he had the previous winter . The Note Book of this period contains less than a page . Hawthorne had lived near Newton some years before . It was in 1841-42 , when he was a member of the Brook Farm community . The story of this venture into communism is too well known to require repetition , and if it were not , it forms no part of the field this article is intended to cover .

I will go forth and stand in a summer shower , and all the worldly dust that has collected on me shall be washed away at once , and my heart will be like a bank of fresh flowers for the weary to rest upon . " Just previous to entering the Custom House , Hawthorne had become engaged to Miss Sophia Peabody . The Peabodys lived in a fine old mansion on Charter Street , Salem , adjoining the Charter Street burying-ground , and but a short distance from Herbert Street , where Hawthorne then lived . The house has since become familiar to the public as the Grimshawe house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story , " Dr. Grimshawe s Secret , " published in an incomplete form since Hawthorne 's death . The Peabody girls were first attracted to Hawthorne by reading some of his writings in the Neze ' England Magazine between 1832 and 1836 ; but they did not discover that he was the author of the articles until 1837 , and it was nearly a year later that they made his acquaintance . From that time until Dr. Peabody and his family moved to Boston , Hawthorne was a frequent visitor to the Charter Street house . Next to Salem , Concord was Hawthorne 's home for the longest time . He went thither to reside soon after his marriage in July , 1842 , having hired the Old Manse of Dr. Ripley . Early in August he wrote : " Happiness has no succession of events , because it is a part of eternity ; and we have been living in eternity ever since we came to this old manse " ; implying much happiness in their new life . " This antique house , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by Providence expressly for our use , and at the precise time when we wanted it , stands behind a noble avenue of balm-ofgilead trees . . . . It is one of the drawbacks upon our Eden that it contains no water fit either to drink or to bathe in " ; and he wonders why Providence does not cause a fountain to bubble up at their doorstep . " Only imagineAdam , " he writes , " trudging out of Paradise with a bucket - &lt;7 in each hand , to get water to drink , or for Eve to bathe in . Intolerable " After breakfast one morning he took his fishing-rod and went down through the orchard to the riverside , but as three or four boys were already in possession of the best spots he did not fish . The Concord River was one of the most sluggish he had ever seen . " I had spent three weeks by its side , and swam across it every day , before I could determine which way its current ran , and then I was compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my own observation . I bathe , " he continued . " once , and often twice , a day in our river , but one dip into the salt sea would be worth more than a whole week 's soaking in such a lifeless tide . " The next night at sunset he " ascended the hilltop opposite our house ; and , looking downward at the long extent of river , it struck me that I had done it some injustice in my remarks . " Here is a description of the house from his own pen : " It is two stories high , with a third story of attic chambers in the gable roof . The rooms seem never to have been painted ; at all events , the walls and panels , as well as the huge cross-beams , had a venerable and most dismal tinge of brown . The furniture consisted of high-backed , shortlegged , rheumatic chairs , small , old 11 ( I S/s/A The Pemigewasuet House , Plymouth N H THE ROOM IN WHICH HAWTHORNE DIED wAS ON THE // tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking-glasses in antique black frames . " However old and Hawthorne 's Pine . ancient all this may seem to the present generation , it was very fashionable during the early part of this century . It was the furnishing used in the house by the venerable Dr. Ripley , who preceded Hawthorne in the occupancy . In the rear of the house was the little room Hawthorne called his study . It had been Dr. Ripley 's study before him , and even earlier was the study of Dr. Emerson , the grandfather of Ralph Waldo . From one of its windows Dr. Emerson beheld the first fight of the Revolution , and here he saw and heard fired " the shot heard round the world . " I should judge that this was the happiest period of Hawthorne 's life . His letters and journal are much less encumbered with sombre musings and complaining passages than at any time before or after . He enters in the Note Book , Aug. is " My life at this time is more like that of a boy , externally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is usually supposed that the cares of life come with matrimony ; but I seem to have cast off all care , and live on with as much easy trust in Providence as Adam could have felt before he had learned that there was a world beyond Paradise . My chief anxiety consists in watching the prosperity of my vegetables , in observing how they are affected by the rain or sunshine , in lamenting the blight of one squash and rejoicing at the growth of another . It is as if the original relation of man and nature were restored in my case . I awake in the morning with a boyish thoughtlessness as to how the outgoings of the day are to be provided for , and its incomings rendered certain . After breakfast I go forth into my garden and gather whatever the bountiful Mother has made fit for our present sustenance . Then I pass down through our orchard to the riverside , and ramble along its margin in search of flowers . . . . Well , having made up my bunch of flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my study , and generally read , or perchance scribble in this journal and otherwise suffer Time to loiter onward at his own pleasure , till the dinner hour . So comes the night ; and I look back upon Hawthorne 's Grave . // 305 a day spent in what the world would call idleness , and for which I myself can suggest no more appropriate epithet , but which , nevertheless , I can not feel to have been spent amiss . True , it might be a sin and shame , in such a world as ours , to spend a lifetime in this manner ; but for a few summer weeks it is good to live as if this world were heaven . " This seems a very plausible excuse , and no doubt Hawthorne convinced himself it was such , for the life of indolence which he was leading ; but the fact is , the greater part of his life was equally indolent . But for the demands of his finances , or the promptings of his peculiar ambitions , it is doubtful whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very fact that he could live on week after week thus quietly , unruffled by the turmoil and strife of the great busy world around him , explains how he could frame those beautiful sentiments so smoothly and charmingly . No man mingling daily with the world 's strifes can do it . The peculiar charm which is the characteristic of all Hawthorne 's writing is given only by those who mingle little among life 's vanities or business . Hawthorne made almost daily excursions to different parts of the neigborhood . Besides the fishing and flower-picking along the banks of the river , and the bathing in its still waters , he and Thoreau spent much time paddling up and down the stream in a canoe made by the latter . There was " a walk to Walden Pond " one day with George S. Hillard ; and a week later he took " a walk through the woods to Emerson 's , with a book which Margaret Fuller had left . " After leaving the book he returned through the woods , and , entering Sleepy Hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Margaret herself . " The ist of September , Hawthorne learned to row or paddle the canoe-like boat , and for some weeks appears to have idled away most of his time on the river . He made a two-days ' pedestrian tour with Emerson the last of the month , visiting Harvard and the neighboring village of Shakers . The following spring - in March - he enters in the journal that he has " written with pretty commendable diligence , averaging from two to four hours a day ; and the result is seen in various magazines . " Most of his writing at this time was contributed to the Democra/ic Review . As the " magazine people " did not pay their debts , he says : " We taste one of the inconveniences of poverty . " For exercise during the winter he would " trudge through snow and slosh to the village , look into the postoffice , and spend an hour at the reading-room , and then return home , generally without having spoken a word to a human being . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides writing the m4gazine articles , which included many of those delightful short sketches since published in the collected editions of his works , he put forth most of the numbers of the second volume of " Twice-Told Tales , " edited the African Journal for Bridge , and laid the foundation for " Mosses from an Old Manse . " At Concord , Hawthorne was thrown much into company with the finest minds of the country . Ralph Waldo Emerson , who had formerly lived in the Manse , was a near neighbor ; so were Thoreau , Alcott , and Ellery Channing . Longfellow often came out from Cambridge , and Margaret Fuller was a frequent guest , as was Hillard . On his appointment as surveyor of the port of Salem , Hawthorne left Concord , residing for a few months on Carver Street , Boston , where the first child , a son , was born . In November the family went to Salem , as already stated . The Hawthornes returned to Concord in the early summer of 1852 , after the winter in Newton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Writing of it in July of that year to George William Curtis , Hawthorne said : " Before Mr. Alcott took it in hand , it was a meanlooking affair , with two peaked gables ; no suggestiveness about it and no venerableness , although from the style of its construction it se*ms to have survived beyond the first century . He added a porch in front , and a central peak , and a piazza at each end , and painted it a rusty olive hue , and invested the whole with a modest picturesqueness . . . . The hillside is covered chiefly with locust-trees , which // come into luxuriant blossom in the month of June . From the hilltop there is a good view along the extensive level surfaces , and gentle hilly outlines , covered with wood , that characterize the scenery at Concord . The house stands within ten or fifteen feet of the old Boston road , along which the British marched and retreated . . . . In front of the house , on the opposite side of the road , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued as of old , and the old friends and neighbors appear again in his letters ; but his Note Book contains only a few entries during the second stay at Concord . It was during this first year at The Wayside that Hawthorne wrote " Tanglewood Tales " and the " Life of Franklin Pierce , " finishing the " Tales " on March 9 , 1852 . The last entry in the " American Note Book " was made here on June 9 of that year . He had been at the Isles of Shoals with Pierce the first two weeks in September , and the entries in the Note Book during that time were made nearly every day and with much fulness . In the spring of * Pierce was inaugurated President , and on March 26 following Hawthorne was nominated and confirmed as consul at Liverpool . He sailed for that port in June . It was seven years later , June , r 86o , that he again entered his own home in Concord . Four years had been passed in the consular service , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XVe have no Note Book concerning this later period at The Wayside to tell us of his mode of life and work ; but from such glimpses of him *s his biographer and his occasional letters afford , it is evident that he resumed his walks in the neighborhood only to a limited degree . His son says , " He took few or no long walks after his return to America . Walden Pond , two miles distant , was the limit of his excursions , and he generally confined himself to his own grounds except on Sunday . " Much time was passed in looking over his own small domain , and he found a favorite spot to walk and muse on the hill above his house . Soon after returning from Europe , Hawthorne made extensive changes in his house . A story was added to the western wing and two rooms built on in the rear , while for his own purposes he built a strange-looking tower or room on the roof . This tower was reached through a trap door in the floor by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here he lived to the end , which came in four years , save an occasional vacation of a week or two . Here he wrote " Septimus Felton , " " The Doliver Romance , " " Dr. Grimshawe 's Secret , " and " Our Old Home . " The two romances were neither of them published in his day . " The Doliver Romance " was not finished : it was little more than begun , only the first chapters having been published in the Atlantic Monthly when the fatal illness overtook him . " Septimus Felton " was in an incomplete state , but was published as a serial after Hawthorne 's death . " Dr. Grimshawe 's Secret " was also unfinished . It was while these works were lying in his study uncompleted that he started , in May , 1864 , for a trip to the White Mountains , with his friend , Ex-President Pierce . At the Pemigewasset House , at Plymouth , N. H. , on the *8th of May , he passed away .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
