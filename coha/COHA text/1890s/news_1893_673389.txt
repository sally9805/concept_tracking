txt The history of the exportation of American meats to Europe has not been creditable to the European countries concerned . The American hog labored for years under imputations upon his character for wholesomeness that were the more difficult to refute because there was no foundation for them . They were made under false pretenses , and in order to meet the wish of the European breeder who found himself undersold . That is to say they were lies , bred in that fruitful source of lies , the spirit of protection . As American animals are no more liable to epizootics than animals of any other continent , and as some sixty millions in America were eating the , slandered pork without detriment to their well-being , the false pretense could not he maintained , and one after another the nations that made it have receded from it . In the case of Great Britain the effort was mainly directed to the exclusion of American beef . The matter of sanitary regulation was intrusted , until the formation . two or three years ago , of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty 's Privy Council . That august body is composed largely of landlords of that class that resisted the repeal of the corn laws and would like to see them re-enacted . In spite of the coquetry of various Tory statesmen with " fair trade , " they all know that the re-enactment of agricultural protection in any form is hopeless , and that what is to be accomplished in excluding competing food products must be accomplished by indirection . Accordingly , the sanitary pretext was invoked to exclude American competition with home-grown beef , and the most monstrous statements were accepted and made the basis of action by the landlords of the Privy CounciL They were assisted in their efforts by that numerous and powerful body , the snobs of England . There was a time when it was considered downright disreputable for an Englishman " of a certain position " to consume American beef . The action of the British landlords on the question of excluding AmerJoan beef was about as patriotic and enlightened as their action in voting down the Home-Rule bill . Since a special tribunal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to decide in their own interests without investigation , very little has been heard of the absurd untruths about American beef that used to pass current . It appears , however , that the landlords are by no means satisfied with this posture of affairs , and the report is now published of a committee of the House of Lords which has been sitting and " investigating " in the spirit of the old committee of the Privy CounciL The immediate question is of the propriety of marking imported meats . By marking , of course , the landlords mean stigmatizing . But the testimony taken in support of this proposition can by no means be satisfying to the British " lord of fat oxen and prize sheep . " Some of it was to the effect that it was impossible to distinguish American from home-crown beef , while the body of it was to the effect that the average of the imported beef was higher than the average of the native beef . That is to say , American beef is grown and fed with a more intelligent care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The landlords have taken their stand upon a detail with the importance of which not many of the consumers are concerned . It is that the shanks of American beef are apt to be bruised and discolored and to become tainted earlier than the shanks of British beef , because the animals are roped and run up by the hind legs in order to be killed . The contention that American beef is unfit for food is thus reduced to the contention that the hind legs of American beef are less eligible than the hind legs of British beef , or rather one hind leg of each beast , since it is only one , we believe , upon which the executioner operates . One shank of the American ox is thus the citadel and last refuge of British agricultural protectionism . Naturally , the committee reported in favor of stigmatizing the imported beef , but sensible Britons will be more apt to seek tbau to avoid the shops where the stigmatized product is sold .                @ @ @ @ @
