txt The large figures which are published in the reports concerning the new speculative craze in and near the gold-mining districts of Colorado may be misleading to those who do not indulge in certain calculations and comparisons which the reports suggest . There are now in Colorado Springs , a city of less than 20,000 people , four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers . At these Exchanges the daily sales are about 1,000,000 shares , although the number is sometimes larger , and the daily sales for all the Exchanges in Colorado are about 5,000,000 shares . These are impressive figures , but when we consider the statement that " one thousand shares of cent stock " is the favorite investment , and the report in our dispatches that " a majority of the stocks traded in are of the cheaper class , ranging in price from a fraction of a cent to 12 or 15 cents per share , " the daily transactions become less formidable from a financial point of view . At the New-York Stock Exchange the sale of 300,000 shares in a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is a difference between a share which sells for a cent , or a fraction of a cent , and a share which sells for $100 . We should say that for some time past the average value of shares sold at the New-York Exchange may have been $75 , for the heaviest transactions have been in stocks selling in the neighborhood of their par value , or in the range between $60 and par . Now , the price of 300,000 shares at $75 is $22 , - 500,000 , to which may be added bond sales of from $1,000,000 to $3,000,000 . But 1,000,000 shares in the four Exchanges of Colorado Springs at 1 cent are only $10,000 , and at 16 cents ( which is above the average ) the price of so many shares is only $100,000 ; and if in all Colorado 5,000,000 shares are sold in a day , this means , at an average of 10 cents , only $500,000 . So much for those impressive figures . Colorado Springs is a resort for consumptives or persons having weak lungs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their health are many Englishmen , and it is now stated that these gentlemen , being well informed , by private correspondence with friends in London and by published reports , concerning the notable speculative movement in South African gold mines in London and Paris , were instrumental in procuring the establishment of the first of the four Exchanges in this little Colorado city . From this beginning there has grown up a speculative movement in the shares of mines and projects in the neighboring mining district of Cripple Creek  --  a movement which promises to become very much greater before it loses the impetus now being imparted to it . Undoubtedly there is much gold at Cripple Creek . The monthly output of the mines there which ship ore to be reduped is now about $1,000,000 , and it is probable that this output will be increased . But the ore is shipped and the profits are made by a few mines which are closely held by a few fortunate owners , not by the mines whose shares are sold for " a fraction of a cent , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of these paying mines are not on the Colorado market , with perhaps one or two exceptions . We notice that the shares of one are selling at about $2 , but we suspect that the number sold in the Colorado Exchanges is very small . The shares which are " active , " at prices ranging from " a fraction of a cent " to 15 cents , and which are sold by the thousand or the hundred thousand , are those of new companies which have not turned a spadeful of earth , or which may be capitalized upon a little hole in the ground from which not an ounce of ore has been taken . During the last few days such companies have been created and placed upon the market by the score . They own small areas of Colorado soil under which , in some cases , gold-bearing ore may be found if the managers dig deep enough for it . In some instances the small sums received for shares will be expended in digging , and if no gold be found that will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be no digging whatever . The buyer of such shares takes the chance of selling profitably to some other buyer in the near future , or the chance that the company will find paying ore . He is encouraged and stimulated by no end of stories , some of them true , about the luck of STRATTON or some other Cripple Creek millionaire who was a day laborer two or three years ago . How far will this Cripple Creek speculative movement spread ? It is the hope and desire of the brokers and small investors or traders in Colorado that it will reach Chicago , New-York , and even Europe . Stranger things have happened . If the Colorado shares should be listed . In Eastern cities , either in existing Exchanges or in Exchanges established for the purpose , there might be some active trading ; but the efforts made to procure a reception of the shares in Chicago and elsewhere have thus far come to nothing .                   @ @
