by 7oseplz Lee . E all of us believe that America has a mission . We believe that she has a great part to play in the world 's history . Whatever outsiders may see or fail to see , we have deep down in us the instinct that the future belongs to us , that far more remains to say that we have ever yet succeeded in saying , and that when the message shall have got itself uttered and understood the world will know that a new service has been rendered , that a new altitude has been gained and a new horizon opened to humanity . And yet our country is not prospering as we would have it prosper . Great and powerful as we are as a nation , rich and thriving beyond the dreams of any previous epoch , we yet feel that we are not succeeding , that we are not doing what we set out to do nor getting for ourselves the things that we really want . Life in America is not life as we believe in making it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time appreciably advancing in the direction of our ideal . This shortcoming is not the result of any one thing . Doubtless whatever we have done that was not directly in obedience to our own national ideal has stood as an impediment in the way of its realization . But some things are of more and some of less importance ; some are causes and some merely results . One influence which seems at least to be among the important causes is to be found in our false and undemocratic ideas as to the uses of wealth and the duties of its possessors , ideas no more undemocratic than those prevailing in other countries , perhaps not so much , but utterly incompatible with our own democratic institutions , hopelessly removed from the inspiration of our national genius . The genius of this country is the genius of democracy . Its influence is one from which no one here can escape . Our rich people are as subject to it as their less wealthy fellowcitizens . It is the source of whatever we have o'f inspiration , and our obedience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better or worse , America 's lot is cast in with that of democracy , and her fulfilment of her mission - the bright star in which we all believe - is dependent on her loyalty to her democratic faith . The way of living of our rich men is hostile to this genius . It is not democratic nor in harmony with the democratic spirit . Its whole effect is to prevent our success in the only direction in which success is for us worth having or that real success is possible . Not that our rich men themselves are not patriotic ; probably no class of men in the community is more so . Harvard sent twelve hundred graduates to the war , eight hundred of them enlisting as private soldiers ; and we may be sure that whenever the question is brought up squarely of choosing between the sacrifice of their own fortunes or lives and the integrity of the country , our rich men , like the great majority of their fellow-citizens , will choose the former alternative . The difficulty is that they do not realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical nature of our present situation . It seems sometimes as if our opportunity were slipping away without our knowing it , as if our birthright were being stolen from us while we sleep , and that we may wake up some morning to find too late that it is gone , that the realization of the true democracy has been postponed until the ap 53 // pearance of some more loyal people at some later age . There are , however , some object lessons so striking that they may serve as an awakening shock , some signs of the times so clear that he who runs may read . When we look upon the palaces planted in some of our mountain and seashore towns , the great lawns and gardens requiring the attendance of forty or fifty men , the four-in-hands whirling along the country roads , blowing horns to warn all humbler vehicles to clear the way , the great yachits with their crews awaiting the rare visits of their owners , we may not be able to formulate the grounds for our belief , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certainty , that all this is out of harmony with the spirit of American institutions , and that sooner or la't*r one or the other must go . Looking a little closer , we can see the old New England country life still going on in these same towns , though dimmed and obscured by the showy importations from the cities . - We see the country people still striving , in a somewhat dispirited way perhaps , to make good their inherited belief that character rather than wealth is the true basis for social position ; we see them working hard and living hard to send their son to college , strenuously seeking after culture according to such light as they can obtain ; and on the hill , looking down silently over all , we see the white Puritan meetinghouse , with its simple lines , an architecture a little stern perhaps - that does not proclaim itself nor strive to rival the stone and stucco magnificence around it ,  --  reticent but beautiful with a quiet beauty that can bide its time . The Puritan faith and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never yet proved une ( lual to their task ; and T believe we are warranted in our conviction that the victory in the end will not be with the palace and the steam yacht and the gods of splurge and extravagance . The instinct of the " plain people " on a matter like this , which stands out clear and visible , is a pretty safe guide . But in this case the sense of the danger is not confined to the " plain people , " but is shared by the majority of our rich men , even by a majority of our millionaires themselves . But , assuming that our instinct is correct , that the existing extreme of luxury is hostile to our institutions , the question remains whether these obvious instances constitute in themselves the real evil or whether they are only the surface indications of something deeper . The answer , I think , is plain . In this case at least the conspicuous instrument of the evil is certainly not its responsible cause . In questions of fashion , style of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general be expected to take the world , with its prevailing ideals , about as he finds it ; and it is the world as he finds it , and not the millionaire , that is mainly responsible for the result . In spite of their shortcomings , few classes of men have served us so well as our millionaires have done , both by what they have directly accomplished and by the example they give us of pluck and nerve and of the success that at* tends upon far-reachino* conceptions where the execution is bravely planned and steadily carried through . They have had their work to do , and , better than most of us , they have done it . The service required of them was not social reform , and they should not be held accountable for failure to excel in that direction . I think that , if we will faithfully consult the instinct which tells us that the great expenditure of our millionaires is out of harmony with our national ideals , it will tell us also that they and their way of living do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous symptom . They have the means of carrying matters further than others , and their frequent bad taste helps to emphasize the evil in their case ; but the spending of money // on a style of living utterly at variance with the spirit of our institutions is by no means confined to them . Nor is the evil confined to such spending of money upon the part of a certain number of individuals , millionaires or otherwise ; it lies chiefly in the fact that such expenditure tends to become more and more the fashion , and so to become obligatory not only upon " society " so-called , but upon all persons having social aspirations , - and there are very few persons who have not . As there is no higher earthly bribe than social position , so is there no way in which a false and undemocratic idea could more effectively get itself promulgated than by being embodied in the way of living of those who to the great mass of their fellow-citizens seem to have social position at their command . What the richest people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , of what others would like to do . What fashion dictates is held up before all men as the practical object best worth striving for . The style of living of the rich is the message of those who have succeeded to those still at the bottom of the ladder , to the poor boy coming up to the city from the farm , to the bank clerk , the " counter jumper , " and the struggling lawyer ; it is the authentic revelation of the true uses of preeminent power as discovered and understood not by preachers and philosophers but by those actually possessing it . It is , I think , sufficiently clear that the existence of expensive fashions implies the existence of caste . The fact that a standard of living unattainable by the great majority of the people has become a social obligation and a condition of being treated as an equal by a considerable section of society means social plutocracy ; it implies that people with large incomes are not quite of the same clay as those with small ones , that human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation , by horizontal lines separating social strata . It means that we have social classes in America and that what they owe to each other is not quite what man owes to man in the simple neighborly good-will of fellowcitizens , but is what superiors choose to give in Christian charity to those below them . These are the obvious implications of the existence of expensive fashions , visible in the light of our customary every-day view of things . To see the significance of such fashions more accurately , to know just where and how far we have strayed from our ideal , it is necessary to remind ourselves of what our ideal is , to return upon our inner instinct , and to see and feel just what our social faith implies . The belief that drove the Puritans to this country was a belief in the infinite value and uprightness of the human soul . They could not bear that pope or bishop , that priest or saint , should presume to stand between the man and God . They thought that the kingdom of heaven is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best guide . They called it belief in the Bible , because Englishmen will never depart further from established ways of thought than their solution of the practical question of the hour actually demands ; but what they had in their hearts was belief in man . Their whole theory of government was based upon this instinct of the sacredness of the individual and the paramount importance of his spiritualwelfare . The state with them was to be but the instrument of the church , a power for righteousness . Their criminal law was not like that of other nations , a mere matter of police regulation and suppression of certain lines of action because of their practical inconvenience , modified by the survival of the ancient blood feud . The changes in the English law which they introduced were based upon a sense of moral indignation , resentment that a man could so insult and belie his own true nature . In European countries religion has been supported partly as an effective // ally to the police in upholding law and order . With the Puritans , law and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . Out of their poverty they started schools in every town at the public expense and founded Harvard College . The excuse that they gave to themselves was that they were " providing for the instruction of ministers of religion , " or enabling people to read the Bible . If that was all , why did they not have a religious test at Harvard ? Why was it that this narrowminded , bigoted community , as it is so often called , never did what every other denomination has always done in the way of common precaution against the well known tendency of free thought to beget heresy and*back-sliding ? It was because , unconsciously to themselves , their belief in the natural goodness of man was deeper even than their belief in the church . They thought that the soul could be trusted to find its own in the world unexpurgiated as the Lord had made it . The college has two mottoes , Christo et ccclesiae and Veritas . They believed , as many others have believed before and since , though few have been so resolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their church contained the living truth ; and they shared the belief of all earnest men of their time that open opposition to or disregard of what they conceived essential to salvation must be put down with the strong hand ; but their introduction of the plan of universal education at the public expense , two centuries and a half before its adoption by England or any of the leading countries of Europe , and the religious freedom of their college , show that they also believed , as very few had possessed the faith to believe before them , that the security for the ultimate triumph of truth was to be found not in the careful repression and stunting of the human intellect , but , on the contrary , in giving to the mind of every man the freedom of the world of thought , turning it loose in the great field of human knowledge , and trusting to its natural rectitude to find the way . And this faith of the Puritans in the individual soul was no passing phase of the religious movement of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teutonic races it dates back farther than Protestantism and farther than Christianity . It is the faith that drove the German of Tacitus alone into the sacred wood to pray ; it is the faith that has made the Englishman in all ages believe that the king , like others , is subject to the people 's law . It created the town meeting before the race appears upon the page of history , and has preserved it to the present day ; it gave England her Magma Charta and her parliament ; it swept the Armada crushed and beaten from the English Channel , and set aside the Stuarts from the throne ; it has built this country and freed it from provincial dependence and from the curse of slavery . It is the religion that underlies democracy . We are proud of these great deeds of our ancestors , and we still hold , in its essence , the faith that carried them so bravely , the democratic belief in the trustworthiness and infinite importance of the individual soul . For every . American* is a democrat . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On that point no choice has been given us . All that remains to decide is whether we shall live like gentlemen , showing forth and justifying the faith that is in us , or whether we shall crouch and apologize and offer up a mendicant imitation for the approval of races whose beliefs we do not share . What are the teachings of this democratic faith of ours as bearing especially upon this question of fashionable expenditure ? This faith demands that we should reverence every human being as an end in himself , to which all other ends shall be subordinated . It teaches us that in the face of the real differences between man and man all distinctions based on money or occupation are frivolous and unimpor // tant , useful only so far as they may in any case be an outcome and true indication of the soul within ; that every honest calling is the calling of a gentleman , and that it is possible to live like a gentleman on any income upon which it is possible to live at all . Melville can speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Melville is a true protestant , a true democrat , to whom the difference between the elect and the non-elect shin*s so bright that all other differences have become invisible . The democratic spirit as we become possessed of it will teach us gradually to make it clear that with us a certain standard of expenditure is not one of the important qualifications for high social standing and consideration , that the American idea of the gentleman is not that his behavior and way of living should constantly remind his poorer neighbors of their poverty and of a social gulf created by it , but that he should so honor the paramount claims of character that neither wealth nor poverty shall serve as a screen or an excuse for moral feebleness or obliquity . But it may be said that to accomplish this is a question not of the uses of wealth but of the spirit in which it is used , that the end is to be gained no't by doing away with these differences but by disregarding them , by rising superior to ' mere questions of expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a certain amount of truth underlying this contention ; it is a truth of essential importance that the spirit of democracy and not its outward manifestation is the important thing ; but there are , nevertheless , several reasons why a change in the spirit in which it is carried on is not the whole of the remedy for the evils of fasliionable expenditure . First , such a doctrine is a dangerous one and full of snares for the unwary . The deceitfulnes 's of riches is very capable of lulling us into false contentment with ourselves and a false belief in the nobility of our own motives . When the mo'nks decided that the mere crass outward poverty of a St. Francis was but a poor material sort of poverty after all , and that true humility was rather to be found in possessing all the comforts of this world , but with a meek spirit , as though they possessed them not , there began to be a suspicion that there was a screw loose somewhere either in their intent or in their reasoning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if nothing else , must prevent our persuading ourselves that it is really because of our superiority to material things that we permit ourselves so great indulgence in regard to them . Even if the rich man could be unconscious of and superior to the difference between his way of living and that of his poorer neighbor , it is a much harder task for the poorer neighbor to do the same . It may be said that our poor men ought to be able to set their own fashions and live their own lives like gentlemen with a royal self-respect which could disregard or contemplate with nothing deeper than amusement the vagaries of their more fortunate *neighbors . Doubtless that is the standard which the ideal democracy demands of its poorer citizen 's ; but it is an heroic standard , and but few men are capable o'f attaining it . In one sense , indeed , it is more than heroic , it is impossible . Comparison between our o'wn ho'mes and way of living and o'ur neighbors ' is involuntary and inevitable . No style of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same regardless of the background against which we see it . No man can ride an old-fashioned high bicycle with the same satisfaction he used to feel before a better style came in . After the rich city people have come with their horses and carriages , their hired o'rchestras and expensive entertainments , the village sociables and sewing-bees may still retain their flavor ; but it can never be just the same , a dro'p of bitterness must be // mingled with it by the inevitable comparison . When the difference in style is made the pretext for rudeness and the assertion of a non-existent superiority , the case is bad indeed . But even without that there is damage done ; justifiably or not , the society of the village has been made a less happy one than it was before the city people came . But there is another reason why the retaining of our luxuries in a spirit superior to luxury , in a democratic spirit , is not a solution of our difficulty . The reason is that the thing can not be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our situation are such that the possession of the democratic spirit must render our retention of our luxuries impossible . The spirit of democracy tells us , and every democrat is forced by his inner conviction to believe , that the command , " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , " is to be taken seriously , that its demand upon the rich man is not necessarily limited to one-tenth of his income nor to nine-tenths ; it requires that those of us who have money beyond our needs should use it in the hundred ways that are open to us for raising up our less fortunate fellow-citizens and for the good of our state or country as a whole ; it does not permit that we should spend upon ourselves an income ten or fifty times as large as that on which the average of our fellowcountrymen must manage to get along , while we daily refuse calls upon us which , upon any possible theory of the relative importance of different classes of human beings , should come next to the support of our own children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by carrying it on in the democratic spirit because the democratic spirit will not allow of our carrying it on at all . As a matter of fact , the spirit that underlies it is not democratic , nor compatible with the democratic creed . The social gospel under which children are brought up to believe that the maintaining of a certain style of expenditure , the having of certain luxuries and niceties far beyond the reach of the great majority of their fellow-citizens , is a sacred duty , coming before all other obligations of wealth , is not the gospel of democracy ; nor is it a part of the democratic creed that a man who , for the sake of charity or of public duty , foregoes these niceties of fashion , loses caste - ceases to be quite a gentleman . If the democratic theory is true , if , that is to say , a poor man is really and in sober earnest a man , like yourself , if he has a soul as you have , can aspire to heaven or feel the degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other words , he is a real person , it can not be that the way in which many of us live and our way of treating him is the right one . It ciannot be well that we should lie so warm and sleep so soft and exercise so wide a command over the good things of this world while this other man is suffering from actual physical want and his children are roaming the streets subject to all kinds of temptation and evil influence . It can not be our duty to God that we should follow with such anxious solicitude every latest revelation vouchsafed us by the tailors of London or the courtesans of Paris , while there are thousands of our fellow-citizens going the road to pauperism and despair . The only possible excuse would be utter inability to assist , to do anything really effective to put a stop to or to mitigate the evil . " But if we can not help them - if all this is inevitable ? " My friend , have you ever tried to help them ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drowning and the other rpan smoking his cigar on the bank ? It is a good old maxim of English pluck , that " where there 's a will , there s a way , " and in this matter of charities those who have had the will - the John Howards , Octavia Hills and Col. Aucbmutys-have shown that there is a way , if we choose to follow it . Modern philanthrophy has shown us , indeed , that poverty can not be cured by // giving . The trouble is too deep for applications of " charity " in the crude state . Faithful analysis has shown that it is in most cases an affection of the will and not of the pocket , that lack of physical means is in fact only the symptom , not the disease itself . Many a man is to-day sheltering himself - trying to keep his money and his selfrespect , to believe that at last God and Mammon have made it up and gone into partnership - behind this discovery of the inefficacy of the money dole . Starvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food is a picturesque sort of distress . A man wh'o has tried so much of it as is involved in missing his train and getting late for luncheon can not for a day or two after easily refuse a dollar which he believes will go to relieve that special form of want . But when he learns that the dollars he has spent for this purpose have probably caused more starvation than they have cured , he is apt to say to himself that as giving can do no good he can hereafter be as selfish as he pleases without blame and without degradation . But the real appeal for the relief of poverty is stronger and more worthy of being honored than ever before . The disease is found to be moral rather than physical ; but it is not the less real or the less pitiable upon that account . Moral degradation is a thing which , in what we know to be our saner moments , we moire dread for ourselves than physical suffering . It is the same for the other man as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imagination . The motive to help is strong enough to compel us if we could only see the facts as they are . Stories of poverty and its degradations are often called sensational , and their intention and methods may often deserve the epithet ; but no one ever succeeded in painting the deeper shadows as dark as nature makes them . Let any person go into one of our large almshouses and look at the faces of the men and women he will find there . Their life , in the great majority of cases , has been a failure , morally as well as physically , and the time for reform has passed ; they have mostly come there to die ; and if one has the gift of reading a person 's story in his face , I think he will agree that no physical suffering is needed to make this as good an idea of Hell as he cares to carry around with him . And the disease is curable - sometimes by hard work in the individual , often so in the family ; what could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole town or state we have , as yet , but little means of guessing . There is no use in trying to hide behind this plea that nothing can be done . In the case of our own children we never act upon that idea . We act upon what we know as well as we know anything of human affairs , upon our convictions that a great deal can be done , that surroundings do make a difference , that there is such a thing as a good moral atmosphere and such a thing as a bad moral atmosphere , that there are good schools and bad schools , good amusements and bad ones . We know that the good surroundings and good influences consist to a great extent in things that money can buy , in well trained , high priced teachers , in school ventilation , playgrounds , books , music , seashore . We know it and act on it in the case of our own children . We know it just as well in the case of other people 's children . But we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pauperized by sending our sons to Harvard College ? It is a pauper institution supported by the subscriptions of our less scrupulous fellow-citizens . Are we pauperized by the parks , by visiting the art galleries , or listening to the music that have been given us by private benevolence ? Does the access to a sea beach or to a mountain peak which we owe to the generosity of some rich man relax the springs of self-reliance ? We do *ot feel it in our own case ; it is less apt to be felt by those to whom these things are far less attainable by their // own exertions than they are to us . While modern philanthropy teaches that poverty is not a mere physical ailment and that it can not be cured miraculously by the touch of gold , it teaches that it is worse than physical and that it is curable by natural means , many of which money can supply . It shows us , in short , that whatever may be our duty in the matter , the purpose for which we withhold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saving of some of our fellow-citizens from mortal degradation and despair . It is utterly and inexcusably wrong that in a country as rich as ours any wisely planned and strenuously conducted enterprise for the public good should be hampered for funds , however much it needs . Whatever experts are required to conduct investigations preliminary to any such enterprise ought to be employed , at adequate salaries and for so long as may be necessary . If it seems best to convert a business block into a playground , the money should be subscribed as a matter of course . There are some twenty students to every acre of playground at a well equipped college ; city boys have as much need of playgrounds as college boys ; and what is true of playgrounds is true of a hundred other things . We have only begun to do an inconsiderable fraction of the things that we all know are good things and that we all know ought to be done . Preventive philanthropy is in its infancy , and its growth is mainly hindered by lack of means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if , as the Puritans believed , the human soul is really the important thing , if , as we Americans can not help believing , our fellow-citizen is really a human being very much like ourselves , then it must , be that the doing of some of the things which we know can be done to make life a little better and happier for those who are less fortunate than ourselves must be more important than the keeping up of a fashionable style of expenditure . The country people in our summer towns are right in their instinct that the expenditure of the rich city people itself , as well as the manner of making it , is undemocratic . It is so necessarily and in its essence . It can not be justified except on the theory that we are gods ; the satisfaction of whose whims is more important than that of the serious needs of the mere mortals around us . We can talk and try to feel as condescending as we choose ; our acts state our working theory of our relative importance too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought all , to he miserable because some must be ; that there ought to be no homes of happiness and refinement because some people must live in attics or in holes in the ground . A certain amount of wealth is necessary to the preservation of culture and morality . Character and taste can not grow without objects upon which the mind may impress itself . Without a piano a Paderewski is impossible ; and in a condition of penury the mind as well as the body is starved . From cutting his eye teeth to building the Parthenon , man has to have things to act upon before he can act , - a platitude , the truth of which constitutes the necessity* underlying the institution of private property . The spirit of American democracy is not destructive ; it does not demand of us the sacrifice of anything that really goes to make life miore beautiful or better worth living . It has little in common with the dogmas , some of which have appeared sporadically in this country , of democracy in the European sense - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the prejudices of the lower castes in aristocratic countries . European democracy has never had existence in outward fact ; it is still in the region of the imagination . It is materialistic in its aim and mechanical in its methods . It would destroy the family and cripple the institution of private property as obstacles to that // mathematical equality of outward condition which constitutes its ideal . Democracy in the American sense is founded not on an abstract idea , but upon a practical instinct ; it was not evolved by students and fostered by beer-inspired enthusiasts amid the mists of tobacco smoke and German metaphysic , but was worked out by generations of law-loving Englishmen in old England , and has been lived out for two and a half centuries in this country , until it has become as much a part of us as the love of manly sport is a part of the Englishman or the love of music of the German . The democracy in which we believe is not a formula to be learned , but a spirit to be imbibed ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taste of a new and rare tropic fruit can be conveyed to the home circle in the letters of the traveler . It can no more be understood by the European than modern Europe could have been understood by the ancient Greek or by the builders of the Pyramids . The aim of American democracy is not material , but spiritual ; it is founded not on a desire for outward equality as an end , but upon trust in the individual soul and the desire to make human institutions serve and minister to it . Getting rid of glaring inequality of outward ways of life is important as a preliminary clearing of the ground , partly because such inequalities are found to be a hindrance to mutual trust and friendly intercourse ; but equality is not therefore to be exalted into a religion and to be sought at a sacrifice of all that gives to life the coherence which alone makes moral and mental growth possible , the coherence which allows the outer life to become more and more moulded into a faithful living-out and emanation of the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - far more important . We would not surrender one working day of Shakespeare for what a dozen good and philanthropic men have accomplished by their lives . We would not part with Galileo for all the pious labors of the monks in his generation . If a man can sing for us so as really to say what we had in mind , if he can tell our love for us like Burns , or our feeling for graceful motion like Chopin ; still more , if he can teach us like Socrates , pray for us like the Psalms , or speak out our aspirations beyond the scope of words like the great cathedrals or the symphonies of Beethoven , we would not lose him nor have his powers diverted for the sake of very much philanthropy . Philanthropy , or at least charity , is after all chiefly the raking up behind the cart , - the business of picking up the pieces after the chariot of progress has passed by . The work of curing evils is never the important work . The achievements that make life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want for their own sake , which we should continue to want , though every ill that flesh is heir to should have been forever banished from the world , things which extend the frontiers of the mind and are a foretaste and a prophecy of the inheritance which is some day to be ours . Democracy admits a justification o* the refusal of philanthropic aid for the sake of the maintenance of culture and of refined and decent ways of life . Nor can it , any more than any other view of life , offer a set rule or formula for deciding the practical problems that daily arise , for drawing the line between selfishness and self-culture . No one rule fo'r the solution of such a question could be right for everybody . If a formula could be found suitable for one person it would not be true for anybody else . The right way will be different for every man according as his tastes and his abilities lie chiefly in the one direction or in the other . But though it has no formula to offer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remember that the other man 's welfare is nearly or quite as important as our own ; that if culture and refinement are good , they may be as good for // him as they are for us ; that if we believe in culture , perhaps the conclusion is that we should make sacrifices to bring it within the reach of others , not that we should monopolize it for ourselves . The relegation of philanthropy to a subordinate position does no't make it a matter of small importance . On the contrary , it is true importance can only be realized when we begin to appreciate what lies beyond . If physical health were the end and aim of life , it would be a comparatively light affliction to be kept in bed . It is the thought of what we could do with our health if we had it that makes sickness intolerable , and it is the beauty and brightness of man 's possible career , the breadth and freedom of his true horizon , that move us most to help remove the fetters that bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we are to forego the lending of aid to the distressed in order to devote our lives wholly or partly to culture , we must make our culture worth the sacrifice ; it must be a noble culture , not merely a soft luxuriousness . The distress around us is very real , very terrible and largely preventable . It is not quite like fiddling while Rome is burning , but the situation is enough like that to demand of us that if we are going to fiddle we shall put our heart into it and attain to a fairly high standard in our performance American democracy is ; I have said , not a formula but a spirit , a living faith ; and it is a spirit and not a formula which is wanted for the solution of this question of personal expenditure as for every other practical problem . The question of how much to spend on one 's self and how much to spend for public and philanthropic purposes ought not to be approached as a question of drawing the line between two conflicting duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing worth doing was ever achieved in that spirit . The way in which our life can amount to something , can make its mark as we know we have it in us to make it , is not by balancing between two conflicting views of duty , each with something in its favor , but by giving ourselves heartily to some third view in which we do thoroughly believe , enlisting under some banner which we are truly willing to follow , and , without too much anxiety and searching conscience , leaving the line to draw itself as it may . Approached in the right way , the question will turn out to be not a question of drawing the line , not a perpetual choosing between culture on the one hand and philanthropy on the other , but of attaining at once the truest culture for ourselves and rendering the best and highest service to others through devotion to a third and higher aim . The fallacy at the root of our modern skepticism and ineffectiveness , - and of older skepticism , too , if the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in assuming that problems of life and action can be solved with the element of life and action left out . A healthy judgment can not be formed in so cold a way . History is a mighty drama in which our country has its part . To leave out the dramatic sense in making our decision is to steer the vessel on the assumption that she is standing* still . For every American the chief element in the question will be the mission and destiny of America ; and his most practical way to answer it in his own case will be to feel that mission as fully as he can and let that feeling guide him . To him the alternative is not presented of being a Venetian noble or an English lord . Doubtless they had their light to walk by , - but it is not his . He has not been born , and does not belong , in places in general , but in America ; and he can not do his duty in other countries and times , but as an American citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our inspiration has been settled for us ; all that we can do is to take it or leave it , - there is no other Egerian Spring for us. // To the American the fine arts , in whose name so much of our private expensiveness is sought , sometimes believed to be justified , are not to be the offspring of aristocratic or luxurious expenditure and ways of living . If we seek for art and culture at the expense of our homely duties , we shall be disappointed . Cultivation and refinement are not to be bought in the market and brought home ; they are the slow outgrowth and precious ornament of lives sincerely lived , of a nature at one with itself , which has dared to stake its life upon its own ideal and has won . The palaces of Venice are a splendor and a joy to all the world ; her portraits have added a dignity to our conception of human character ; the sumptuous magnificence of her wealth has wrought itself into forms for which we are all of us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty and the art . The genius of that people was luxurious , gorgeous , aristocratic ; the very soul of Venice was proud and sumptuous , and that soul found its voice and sung its own song in her art . The art needed money to support it , it is true , as Shakespeare doubtless needed some three meals a day to enable him to write his plays ; but a similar lavishness of expenditure is as little likely to reproduce a Venice as the average man 's three meals a day are to make him into a Shakespeare ; nay , if it is contrary to our national instinct , the likelihood is even less , for in that case the chance of such a result is reduced to zero . There is more money spent for art 's sake in one year in America than was spent in all Italy during the sixteenth century . True ornament is as fundamentally connected with the structure of the building as is the corner stone ; whatever the architect attempts beyond what the central idea demands is seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . No more can a nation acquire a grace or refinement that jars with its everyday life or puts to shame the performance of its homely duties . Art is the ex uberance , the glad , triumphal song of our own genius , obeyed , lived out , . satisfied . To be untrue to ourselves is deliberately to cut loose from the only possible source from which culture or refinement can come . Under such conditions the inspiration which should have been our life and our joy and which would have added art and song to duty heartily done is reduced to the low , stifled ' voice of an unsatisfied conscience . And to the American philanthropy need not be the sad-eyed , rather discouraging struggle of the rich to help the poor , that most of even the noblest charity work has so far been . He is not to look on his poorer neighbor chiefly as poor and pitiful , but as a fellow-citizen in distress . It is not to be from me to you , but both together for the honor of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rich , out of our great goodness and kindness of heart , should help you , the poor , but that we all of us are proud of our country , proud of our town and its institutions , proud of our schools , our parks , our library and our base ball nine , - and that we insist on being proud also of the sort of citizen we produce ; for the honor of the family we can not have rags and drunkenness . It is not with us to be a sacrifice that a rich man should spend his money for public purposes . He is not to feel that he is depriving himself in sending in what he can for the purification and adornment of the city that he loves . As the motive of the prosperous citizen to aid , so must the motive of the shiftless to amend , be a public one . More clearly than ever will public opinion bring it home to the weakest will , to ' the boy with the poorest start , that for the honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " England expects " something of him , too , if it is only to die like a man . Where the appeal is to the rich as rich to help , and to the poor as poor to struggle , it is not inspiring ; btit when both are appealed to as citizens of a proud city , when it is " What will you do for // Rome ? " ' then things that we do not dream of become possible . The power of the lightning was in the bayonets of the armies of Napoleon and of the Revolution because " every soldier carried a marshal 's baton in his knapsack , " because for once a nation 's faith called upon the soul in every individual man , and the soul awoke as to a trumpet . The philanthropy of an aristocracy is kind , pitying , conscientious ; the philanthropy of a democracy is proud , stern , triumphant . It is a part of our inheritance in America that we are permitted to enter into the privileges of the latter sort . The courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if any , have before us been called upon to proclaim and live out a new ideal at variance with those hitherto prevailing , without the advantage of some privacy and separation . The architects of the Norman or Elizabethan periods could not have done their work under the shadow of the Pai'thenon . Even the Greeks , with all their genius , consciously suffered from nearness to the softer and less noble civilization of Persia , and had a word ( medizein ) for being a Medo-maniac , - a disease to which some of their greatest men succumbed . It is hard for us to uplift the psalm of our newer faith amid the din of military bands and of cannon saluting royalty . But this courage we must have or be forever mute save as we serve as echo to the " European concert . " So long as we are content to follow Europe , we shall go , as now , sadly about our work , feverishly striving for things we do not want , wearing our lives out in a race in which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands who can put their whole souls into the struggle for wealth and high social position and can feel happy and justified in the pursuit . The American works with perhaps a fiercer activity , but it is fiercer and more ' feverish because he knows that the prize is not worth striving for , because he has discounted his success in advance and knows that it will not even tend to satisfy him . He takes a cynical view of himself and his work because his inner self has stood from the first outside , utterly unmoved by all the fuss and fury , saying to him : " What is the use of all this ? You know that this was not your dream , that there is nothing in it for you . " We are the most efficient but the least successful race on earth . And it is because we have in us an ideal to which we are afraid to surrender ourselves , a message which we dare not speak out . For us in America to turn back on our own ideals , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile to our democratic faith , for the sake of art and refinement , or for any other reason , is peculiarly base and peculiarly foolish . The spirit of the times is democracy , and America stands for democracy as no nation has ever stood for an idea before , and as no nation can ever stand for this idea again . As Greece and Rome best embodied the ideals of the ancient world , as Italy most fnlly vibrated to the spirit of the Renaissance , and Holland and England to that of the Reformation , so now it is America 's turn to carry the torch . In this age Americas s success is the world 's success . If we have not the inspiration of the time in us , nobody has it ; and if we are untrue to it , we have sold the cause of humanity .
