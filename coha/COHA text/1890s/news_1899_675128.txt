txt We did rather an injustice , we find , to Assemblyman ElanntinnEn in denouncing his bill to make every hotel owner hang his hotel on all sides with so-called fireescapes as " a silly proposal . " Not that it was not a silly proposal . It eminently was . But not pre-eminently . For when it was introduced there were also introduced two other equally silly and in effect identically silly proposals  --  one by Mr. GREENE and one by Mr. HOFFMAN . The delusion at the bottom of the three bills was precisely the same . It was that if you allow a man to erect a pile of combustibles 200 feet each way and seven stories high , and conceal its combustibility with plaster and call it a hotel and entice hundreds of people into it , you are going to insure the safety of these people , provided the heap of combustibles takes fire , by hanging a lot of iron ladders around the edges of the fire and inviting the inmates to descend by means of them . The thing is ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire , or they would know how ridiculous it is . It is not even locking the stable door after the horse is stolen , because it promises no security for the future . If the Windsor Hotel had been girdled and defaced with the structures that these bills proposed there is not the slightest reason to believe that a single life which was lost would have been saved . What we need to prevent a recurrence of such a disaster as that of the Windsor is an assurance that no more buildings not better fitted than that was to withstand fire shall be built , and that no more buildings not so fitted shall continue to be occupied as hotels . The first of these conditions is already fulfilled . As a mere matter of self-interest , no owner will henceforth build in New York for a hotel a bulding not fire-proof , or at least slow burning . The law will not allow him to carry it high enough to be profitable unless it is a fire-proof building . We have no reason to believe that the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected since its enactment . tut it is very well worth Pointing out , as a correspondent points out , that the power and responsibility of the Superintendent of Buildings are , in respect to this class of buildings , as complete over old buildings as over new . The law explicitly says that not only every building more than three stories high to be used as a hotel " that may hereafter be erected , " but every building already erected that is used for and occupied for that purpose , " shall be provided with such good and sufficient fire-escapes , stairways , or other means of egress in case of fire as shall be directed by the Superintendent of Buildings , and said Superintendent shall have full and exclusive power and authority within said city to direct fire-escapes and other means of egress to be provided upon and within said building . " This power and authority have been construed by the Superintendent of Buildings , who has been pretty continuously Mr. BRADY , with an interval of Mr. CONSTABLE , since the law of 1892 was passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply fire-escapes , so-called , to the outsides of hotels . That was the cheapest way oat for the owners . That was also the way in which the activity of the Superintendent of Buildings was rendered most conspicuous to the wayfaring man . It was incidentally the most disfiguring . There are buildings , architecturally attractive by their design , which have been shockingly defaced by the external application of iron ladders . And , as we now see , this cheap and conspicuous method of pretending to comply with the law amounted to nothing whatever . The Windsor was fitted at the time of its aestruction with all the means of escape which the Superintendent of Buildings had prescribed , and they amounted to nothing whatever . They are cheap and flimsy substitutes for real safeguards . The only real safeguard , as we have been preaching , is sound construction , which , if not fire-proof , is at least slow burning . The absolute minimum of precaution in the case of a lofty hotel of flimsy construction is an independent fire-proof staircase , accessible at every story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case of fire This latter security may be obtained by detaching the staircase from the main building . It may also be obtained , in case the detachment be not practicable , either by separating it altogether from the elevator shaft , or by providing that from bottom to top this shaft shall contain nothing combustible , and by supplying a metal door to it at every landing . Mr. BRADY has full power , full discretion , and full responsibility in the premises . Therefore are the three bills introduced into the Legislature superfluous as well as silly . No new legislation is needed . The enforcement of the existing law is all that is required . If , this day six months , there is a single " fire trap " left among the hotels of New York , a single one in which sufficient means of egress in case of fire are not supplied , the fault will be entirely that of Mr. BRADY , or of whoever may by that time have succeeded him as Superintendent of Buildings         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
