THE IRRIGABLE LANDS OF THE ARID REGION . BY MAJOR J. W. POWELL , DIRECTOR OF THE U. 5 . GEOLOGICAL SURVEY . EARLY half of the lands of the United States , exclusive of Alaska , are arid . By this characterization it is meant that the rainfall is insufficient to fertilize crops from year to year . In favorable seasons some of these lands receive sufficient rains during the months of growing vegetation to produce fair crops , but the years are infrequent when such conditions prevail , and the areas thus favored are not of great extent . That arid lands may be available to agriculture it is necessary that they be artificially supplied with water ; and this is called irrigation . Every farm , orchard , vineyard , and garden is dependent upon an artificial supply of water . The tree on the lawn , the rose on the parterre , and the violet on the baby 's grave must have some loving hand to feed it with the water of heaven or it withers and dies . When the farmer sows his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , if the clouds are kind and come with gentle showers , he reaps a bountiful harvest ; but when the heavens are as brass , famine stalks abroad , and when storms desolate the land , he plants in vain . But in the western half of the United States physical conditions like those of ancient Egypt and Assyria prevail . The clouds no longer fructify the fields with their showers . They rarely hover over the valleys and plains where the fields and gardens lie , but they gather about the mountains and hurl their storms against the rocks and feed the rivers . The dweller in the valley waits not for showers , or waits in vain ; for the service of his fields rivers must be controlled . But will not the hills of New England , the mountains and plains of the sunny South , and the prairies of the middle region be sufficient for the agricultural industries of the United States ? The area is vast , the soil is bountiful , and the heavens kindly give their rains ; why should the naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West be redeemed ? Why should our civilization enter into a contest with nature to subdue the rivers of the West when the clouds of the East are ready servants ? Gold is found in the gravels of the West ; silver abounds in the cliffs ; copper is found in the mountains ; iron , coal , petroleum , and gas are supplied by nature . The mountains and plateaus are covered with stately forests ; the climate is salubrious and wonderfully alluring . So the tide of migration rolls west*vard and the arid region is being carved into States . The people are building cities and toxvns , erecting factories , and constructing railroads , and great industries of many kinds are already developed . The merchant and his clerk , the banker and his bookkeeper , the superintendent and his operative , the conductor and his brakeman , must be fed ; and the men of the West are too enterprising and too industrious to beg bread from the farms of the East . Already they have redeemed more than six million acres of this land ; already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have won the first battles . An army of men is enlisted and trained , and they march on a campaign - not for blood , but for bounty ; not for plunder , but for prosperity . But arid lands are not lands of famine , and the sunny sky is not a firmament of devastation . Conquered rivers are better servants than wild clouds . The valleys and plains of the far West have all the elements of fertility that soil can have . As the blood in the body is the stream which supplies the elements ofits growth , so the water in the plant is its source of increase . As the body must have more than blocd , so the plant must have more than water for its vigorous growth . These conditions of plant growth are light and heat . While the roots of the plant are properly supplied with water and other elements ofplant growth , the leaves must be supplied with air and sunshine . The light of a cloudless sky is more invigorating to plants than the gloom of storm . Abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant growth , and that agriculture is the most successful which best secures these twin primal conditions ; and they are obtained in the highest degree in lands watered by streams and domed PRINCIPAL DEAINAGE DISTRICTS OF THE ARID ERGION. // by clear skies . For these reasons arid lands are more productive under high cultivation than humid lands . The wheatfields of the desert , the cornfields , the vineyards , the orchards , and the gardens of the far West , far surpass those of the East in luxuriance and productiveness . In the East the field may pine for delayed rains and the green of prosperity fade into sickly saffron , or the vegetation may be beaten down l ) y storms and be drowned by . floods ; while in the more favored lands of the arid region there is a constant and perfect supply of water by the hand of man , and a constant and perfect supply of sunshine by the economy of nature . The arid lands of the West , last to be redeemed by methods first discovered in civilization , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lands be redeemed because of the wants of the population of that country , they must be redeemed because they are our best lands . All this is demonstrated by the history of the far West , and is abundantly proved by the history of civilized agriculture . All of the nations of Egypt were fed by the bounty of one river . In the arid region of the United States are four great rivers like the Nile , and scores of lesser rivers , thousands of creeks , and millions of springs and artesian fountains , and all are to be utilized in the near future for the hosts of men who are repairing to those sunny lands . There are nearly i , ooo , ooo , ooo acres of these arid lands in the United States , of which nearly 120,000,000 acres can be irrigated when all such waters are used . Already more than 6 , ooo , ooo acres are cultivated through the agency of canals . Thus the experiment has been tried , and doubt no longer rests upon the practicability of western irrigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands is profitable to capital and labor . An acre of western land , practically worthless without irrigation , when the works are constructed to supply it with water at once acquires a value marvelous to the men of the East . In new California , settled but yesterday , cultivated lands command better prices than in Massachusetts or Maryland , and this is because an acre of land there will produce two or three fold the quantity of food for man or beast that an acre will here , for the average year . We of the East must recognize that while the lands of the West are limited in quantity to comparatively small and level tracts in the valleys and plains which can be served with water by canals , yet the limit in quantity has compensation in quality . To accomplish the redemption of the arid region capital in large amounts is needed . Some lands can be reclaimed at a cost of two or three dollars an acre ; others , ten or twelve ; while in some cases , where lands are of great value by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per acre will be expended to bring waters from distant springs or from the depths of the earth . A rough estimate may be made that 100,000,000 acres can be redeemed at the rate of ten dollars per acrethat is , for i , ooo , ooo , ooo dollars . In this work vast engineering enterprises must be undertaken . To take the water from the streams and pour them upon the lands , diverting-dams must be constructed and canals dug . With most streams the water is insufficient to serve the lands , and a selection must be made . The conditions which should govern this selection , though somewhat complex , are of grave importance . The rains fall chiefly on the mountains and high plateaus , where the lands are nearly or quite valueless for agriculture . Cliffs , gorges , and steep declivities are not attractive features to the farmer . At great elevations snows fall and accumulate in vast fields , deep drifts , and icy glaciers , and linger long through the spring , sometimes remaining all summer . On these elevated lands late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July and August are not wholly exempt from their ravages . Thus the elevated lands are not attractive to agriculture . The farms , hamlets , towns , and cities have their sites away below on the sunny lands . Here and there mines of gold and silver attract a population and induce men to build homes in the upper region of snow . But their supply of food must come mainly from below . The mountain streams while yet small , as brooks and creeks , can not be used to advantage , and when they leave the mountains they are in most cases already great creeks or rivers . A mountain stream flows in a deep , narrow gorge , down which torrents of water roll in mad energy . Such is the crystal river of the mountains . When it strikes the plain it is suddenly transformed . The steep declivity is changed to one of low degree , and a deep , narrow stream spreads into a broad sheet of water ten , twenty , fifty times as wide as above . When the river is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below it gathers the sands and dust , and the deep , crystal stream becomes a shallow river of mud . Such are the characteristics of the greater number of streams of all the arid region . The place of transformation , where the mountain stream of pure water is degraded into a lowland stream of mud , is an important point when the stream is to be used in irrigation . If the waters are turned out in the valleys above , they are used where they will perform the least service , for the climate is unfavorable to agriculture . Such lands are chiefly valuable as pasturage . Grass , potatoes , and rye , and in // general the crops of Norway and southern Alaska , may be cultivated with some success ; but , in sight of the sunny plains below , it is a waste of water to use the rivers in these regions of ice . On the other hand , the streams can not be used with the greatest advantage far down their course and distant from the mountains . The storm-waters and fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid and dusty for most days of the year , fill the valleys and shallow channels of the mud-bearing rivers with vast accumulations of sand . In these broad stretches the waters spread and are largely lost by evaporation . Very many of the streams of the arid regions , perhaps two out of three , are thus swallowed up by the sands , and are called " lost " rivers or creeks . Others have a sufficient supply from the mountains during seasons of flood to enable them to cross the hungry sands and deliver a part of their volume to lower channels in more humid lands , through which they find their way to the sea . They die in seasons of drought and live in seasons of storm . Still other rivers flow perennially but dwindle on their course over the dry plains . The " lost " streams must be used near to the mountains or not at all . The intermittent streams and the diminishing rivers should be used near to the mountains before a large part of their waters is lost . A stream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sufficient to serve only two or three hundred thousand acres a hundred miles away . There are other reasons why the river should be taken out from its channel where it emerges from the mountains . At that point diverting-dams can be constructed with the least expense and maintained at the least cost , and be made to command lands to the greatest advantage in the construction of minor canals ; while the waters below , when charged with great quantities of sand , speedily destroy the works of irrication , and the sands injure the fields . Most irrigated lands ultimately require drainage . The bottom lands of the great rivers soon become filled with water , and are transformed into swamps and destroyed for the best agriculture . The low plateaus are ultimately far superior to them for all agricultural purposes . Thus it is that the higher lands away from the rivers and near to the mountains should be first served . Only a part of the water poured upon lands for their irrigation is evaporated to the heavens ; another , and perhaps larger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upland creates many springs , which unite to form brooks and creeks , and the waters can thus be used again and again , but in diminishing quantities . A proper system of drainage not only improves the land drained , but conserves the water to be used VOL . XXXIX. - io6. again . It is thus that with every system of supply-canals a related system of drainagechannels and canals must be planned for the benefit of the fields first irrigated and for the increase of the area of irrigation . The season of irrigation is short , varying in different latitudes and altitudes from two to five months . In some regions of country the season of flood precedes and extends into the first part of the season of irrigation ; in other regions flood-time comes late , when the time for supplying water is nearly past . In a few cases maximum supply and maximum want are coincident in time . In all cases where they are not synchronous the excess runs to waste ; the unused waters are lost in the sea . During all the months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unused , if the only structures are divertingdams and canals . To save this water reservoirs are needed . In their construction and the selection of their sites many interesting problems are involved . Some of the conditions which govern the selection of sites are of great importance . Evaporation from the surface of water varies , under different climatic conditions , from thirty to one hundred inches . A reservoir most favorably located may lose less than three feet of water during the year , while , under most unfavorable conditions , the loss may be more than eight feet annually . Evaporation is greater in the hot , dry lands below and less in the cold , humid lands above . The law of diminution is complex , having many factors , and is not yet very well known , but the general statement made is substantially correct . For this reason storage-reservoirs should be constructed in the mountains . In many of the northern ranges of the West favorable sites are found . Already many mountain lakes exist that can be used for this purpose by deepening their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes to be filled when the waters are not needed and to be tapped when a supply is demanded . There are many mountain valleys that are morainal basins admirably adapted to this purpose , and where reservoirs can be constructed at small cost . The mountain regions of the West have many lakes of cold , emerald waters , and these are to be multiplied by the art of man and made to hold the waters needed to refresh the arid plains below - treasure-houses where the clouds are stored . The mountain ranges of the western portion of the United States differ very greatly in their topographic characteristics . Sometimes advantageous reservoir sites can be found in the upper regions ; sometimes low valleys , or parks , are found nearly inclosed by mountains // 770 and foothills , while there are many ranges which have such steep declivities and terminate so abruptly on the plains that sites are infrequent . For such reasons not all of the mountain waters can be stored in mountain lakes , and it becomes necessary to construct reservoirs on the plains below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulty of maintaining works on broad floodplain lands composed of incoherent sands , and because the muddy waters below discharge their silt and fill the reservoirs with great rapidity , so that the life of such a reservoir is too short to warrant the expense of its building . Under such circumstances a river should be turned from its natural course into a canal near the point of transformation , and be conducted into some lateral valley which has been excavated by storm-waters . In general , favorable sites of this character are frequent . The valley is utilized by selecting some point where the inclosing hills converge , and there constructing a retaining-dam . When all the perennial waters of springs , brooks , creeks , and rivers are used by canals and reservoirs , the total supply of available water for irrigation is not exhausted . All of the arid lands below have some rainfall , varying from three to twenty inches , from year to year , and from region to region . The rains which fall upon these thirsty lands are in part absorbed and ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and local floods arise therefrom . These storm-waters can be caught and stored in basins among the hills and used for agricultural purposes . The amount of water that can thus be saved is no mean quantity . But it must often be stored in small reservoirs of a few acres each ; and this means the construction of ponds on farms , scattered here and there among the hills where sites are favorable ; and the waters will thus be used on small tracts of land distributed far and wide over the arid plains and valleys . Ultimately the whole region will be covered with a mosaic of ponds fringed with a rich vegetation ; and crystal waters , and green fields , and blooming gardens will be dotted over all the burning , naked lands , and sand dunes , alkali stretches , and naked hills will be decked with beautiful tracts of verdure . Not all the storm-waters will thus be caught ; much will still fall into the great sand valleys and flood-plains , and there disappear in the sands ; but such valleys have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored in the silt of ancient floods , where they may be brought to the surface again by pumps and other hydraulic devices , and be made to irrigate many a stretch of farm land . There is one more source of water . In the flexing of the strata of the earth through geologic agencies subterranean basins are formed , where rocks below , impervious to water , are separated by water-bearing strata from the rocks above through which the water will not pass . Into these water-bearing strata wells may be sunk , and the water will often flow to the surface . Such artesian wells are often used in irrigation , and they will be used to a much larger extent in the future . Artesian waters are not found everywhere in the country , but only in geologic basins , and to select sites for them a knowledge of the geologic structure is necessary . By the use of all the perennial streams during the season of irrigation , by the storage of the surplus water that runs to waste in seasons when irrigation is not practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery of the floods accumulated in valley sands , and by the utilization of the artesian fountains , a vast area of the arid lands will ultimately be reclaimed , and millions of men , women , and children will find happy rural homes in the sunny lands . From the brief account given it will be seen that in order to redeem the arid lands it becomes necessary : first , to select properly the lands to be redeemed ; secondly , to select the reservoir sites where the water is to be stored ; thirdly , to select canal sites ,  --  and these should be dedicated to public use , so that individuals may not acquire title to the lands for the purpose of selling them to the farmers when the irrigating works are to be constructed , and thus entailing upon agriculture an unnecessary expense ; fourthiy , the extent and method of utilizing the flood-waters stored in the sands must be determined ; fifthly , the artesian basins must be discovered and their extent and value revealed . For this purpose there are necessary : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , and valleys may be outlined and their relative levels determined , and the whole represented on appropriate maps . ( b ) A hydrographic survey . The waters of the streams must be gauged , in order to determine the volume which they carry through the different seasons of the year . Then the rainfall must be determined , for the amount of water to be supplied by canals is supplementary to this . Where the rainfall is twenty inches a small artificial supply serves the land ; if it be but five inches a large supply is necessary . Then the amount of precipitation for various sites of reservoirs must be determined , to discover the amount which can be saved . And finally , it becomes necessary to determine the amount of water which is needed to serve an acre of land . This is called the " duty " of // water , and in the United States it varies widely . In some regions of country , where the rainfall is great and the soil favorable , the duty of water is large a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But where aridity is excessive and the soils are unfavorable , such given amount of water will irrigate but a small tract . For the purpose of measuring stored water many engineers have come to use an " acre foot " as a unit , which means an acre of water one foot in depth . In some portions of the United States an acre foot of water will irrigate two or three acres of land for one season ; in other regions two acre feet are necessary to the acre ; but these are extreme conditions . The general average , which largely prevails , may be stated as an acre foot of water to an acre of land ; and a lake which contains 100,000 acre feet of water will serve ioo , ooo acres of land for one year . In the practice of irrigation it is found that it takes two or more years properly to fill the ground with water , and for these first years a much larger supply than has been indicated is necessary . Where a supply has been secured for 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will ultimately serve can be redeemed only through a course of years . Perhaps a third or a half of the land can be supplied for the first year , and to this new areas can be added , from season to season , until at last the whole duty of water is secured . ( c ) An engineering survey . The reservoirs , canals , and ancillary appliances must be planned and their cost estimated . ( d ) Finally , a geologic survey , to utilize the waters of the sand reservoirs and artesian wells . Such are the scientific problems involved in the redemption of the arid lands . A brief survey of some of the more important irrigable districts of the West will serve to set forth other interesting facts relating to this subject . In central Colorado the " Continental Divide " is a wilderness of desolate peaks that rise far above the timber line into regions of rime and naked rock . Here , with other rivers , springs the Arkansas , in deep cai'ions and narrow rocky valleys . Many silver creeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river which plunges down a steep mountain valley until it passes the foothills and spreads in a broad , turbid stream at the head of the great valley of the Arkansas . Then it creeps over the sands in tawny ripples , down the incline of the plains , becoming less in volume by evaporation and the absorption of the waters in the sands , but growing in size from the accession of smaller tributaries that come from distant mountains on either hand . After crossing the Colorado line it grows perceptibly smaller until a more humid region is reached , where other tributaries join it , and it soon becomes a great river . In the stretch that begins just above the State line and extends across Kansas its channel often becomes dry , and the sands drift in the winds from bank to bank . But in seasons of flood a broad , shallow torrent rolls across Kansas into the State of Arkansas and bears along to the lower region vast loads of mud , choking the navigable stretch below with " sand-bars , " that act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley , and the fields are ofttimes destroyed . Already the farmers of Colorado have taken the water on their lands , and the river is made to do duty to its utmost capacity in seasons of drought . But the surplus waters yet run to the sea . Some of them can be stored on the plains ; but the land available for irrigation is far in excess of the amount which the river can serve . Where shall this water be used ? If in the mountain valleys , it will largely be wasted ; if in the great valley below , how shall it be divided between Colorado and Kansas ? It is worth millions of dollars annually . To whom shall it be granted ? If the larger part is to be used in Colorado , how shall it be divided between the several districts through which it passes ? The law is practically silent on the subject . Heretofore every man might help himself ; but at last the question has arisen , controversies have sprung up , and the States are almost at war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a great body of comparatively level land . Here the waters have been taken out and many hundred thousand acres irrigated . Neglecting the tributaries , let us follow the river across the line into New Mexico . Again the water is taken out to irrigate valley stretches until the White Cafion in the Tewan Mountains is reached and the river rolls through a deep , rocky gorge for more than forty miles . Emerging , its waters are again taken out upon the land from point to point until the entire territory is traversed , and the river passes out of New Mexico and becomes the boundary line between Texas and Mexico . From its source to the mouth of the Chama above the White Cafion it is a clear , deep river ; below , it is a shallow river of mud . In this valley irrigation was practiced by the aboriginal village Indians centuries before the discovery of America . Prior to i6oo it was populated by Spanish peoples coming up from Mexico . So the gardens and fields of the territory and the region along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the acquisition of the territory by the Government of the United States irrigation has greatly developed in Colorado and New Mexico , along the river itself in part , but mainly on the tributaries . No waters have yet been stored in // reservoirs , but the seasonal flow in dry years is now wholly utilized ; and more : the river for hundreds of miles along its lower course is entirely cut off from a supply , and the gardens and farms are now lying desolate and the winds are drifting the sands over vineyard and field . During the past year more new works have been p.rojected than now exist in the valley . How are they to be supplied in scant years ? Who owns the water ? Shall the men of Colorado take all that falls in their State ? and if so , shall the settlements in the valley of the Rio Grande be destroyed by the new settlements on the tributaries ? Just across the line of New Mexico the town of El Paso , in Texas , is found ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , in Mexico . Here large areas have been irrigated and many thousand people are engaged in agriculture ; but they had little water last year , and the next dry season they will have none . Shall the people who have cultivated the land for more than a century be driven away ? The Green River heads in the Wind River Mountains , and , rolling over elevated cold plains , it at last reaches the Unita Mountains , and plunges through cafions to the mouth of the Grand . At its source the Grand inosculates with the Arkansas and the Rio Grande del Norte and rolls through a succession of cafrnns to the Green . Then the two rivers , joining in wedlock , become or1e indeed , and assume a new name , the Colorado of the West , which rolls into the Gulf of California . Its way for nearly 500 miles is through a succession of deep cafions , where it flows from 100 to 6ooo feet below the general surface of the land . At last it emerges from the gloom of the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its course , now and then interrupted by a low range of volcanic mountains , through which it cuts its way in deep , black gorges . The region drained by the cafion portion of the Colorado and its tributaries and the region drained by the Grand and Green and their affluents are in the main inhQspitable . Allthe streams flow through deep cafions between great blocks of naked rock , which are plateaus with cliff escarpments . Sometimes cafions widen into narrow valleys , and others are found at the foot of the mountains on the east and west , while far to the north are broad valleys inclosed by mountains ; but these are cold and desolate . Some agriculture can be practiced by means of irrigation in the broad cold valleys above and the narrow warm valleys below , but a very small portion of the water of the Colorado will thus be used . A mighty river will ever flow from the mouth of the Grand Cafion . The region below the cafion on each side of the Colorado is one of great aridity , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches . It is also a region of high temperature in summer , and it has almost a frostless winter . Here date palms flourish with a luxuriance never known in Egypt . Oranges , lemons , pomegranates , and figs grow and bear in abundance , and the lands are well adapted to sugar and cotton . On the west lie Nevada and California . On the east Arizona stretches away to the summit of the Rocky Mountains . The lands to which the waters can be taken greatly exceed the area that can be served . How shall they be divided ? The low flood-plain along the river is narrow , and only small tracts within it can be redeemed . If the waters are to be used , great works must be constructed costing millions of dollars , and then ultimately a region of country can be irrigated larger than was ever cultivated along the Nile , and all the products of Egypt will flourish therein . The northern third of Arizona is a lofty table-land ; the southern part is a stretch of desert valley over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowlands is marvelously abrupt , for it is marked by a line of cliffs , the escarpment of a geologic fault . Along this fault there is a fracture in the rocks below , and the tableland side has been uplifted several thousand feet . Through the fissure of the fracture lavas have poured in some places , so that here and there the escarpment is masked by volcanic rocks . All of the perennial streams of the territory , that run to join the sea , head on the table-land or in the Rocky Mountains of New Mexico . The rainfall of the lowlands is insufficient to create ever-living waters . The land has never a carpet of verdure , but a few scattered desert plants are found , many of which belong to the cactus family . Everywhere the landscape is weird and strange . Most of the mountains are naked of vegetation or bear dwarfed gnarled trees of pine and cedar , with aloe and cactus . The floodwaters that pour down these mountains sweep the disintegrated rocks into the valley below , and much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel . The storm-waters that come from the mountains sink into these valley sands and disappear ; and the problem of this country is to gather the mountain waters into reservoirs at the foothills , and to recover them from the sands by artesian wells and pumps . In southern California there is another drop of the land from San Bernardino Mountains to the coast , but its line is not so clearly marked as that of Arizona . From this southward to San Diego and from the coast eastward but a few score miles there is a land // of beauty . It is forever fanned with mild breezes from the Pacific , and thus cooled in summer and warmed in winter . When the rainy season comes its billowing hills are covered with green , and when the dry season comes the hills are covered with gold . The rainfall is almost sufficient for agricultural purposes ; springs burst from the hills , and creeks meander to the sea . The little valleys open into broader marshes near the shore that are hardly above the tide , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wave-formed embankments beat back the high tides and protect the meadows that are inclosed by hills . Among the hills natural basins abound , into which the clouds may be enticed as they fall upon the ground , and into which the fountains may pour their waters . It is a region of country singularly well adapted to lakelet-reservoirs , where every man may construct one or more on his own farm . Little artificial supply is needed , and this can be easily secured ; and a region of country about the size of Italy , with the climate of Italy , is rapidly becoming covered with the gardens of Italy . The Sierra Nevada culminates in altitude near its eastern margin . It is a great plateau declining westward , and carved into transverse ridges and valleys , that extend from the high eastern summit of the system to the low warm valley of California . Between the valley and the sea the Coast Range rises . The San Joaquin River heads in the heights of the south , and runs northward . The Sacramento heads far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snows that fall on these peaks sink away into the scoria and sands of volcanic cones , and the mountains where the clouds gather and the storms rage are yet streamless ; but away from the mountains , where volcanic sands disappear , the mountain waters burst out in mammoth springs , and creeks and rivers are born full grown . The Sacramento and the San Joaquin unite to flow through the Golden Gate . In the southern or San Joaquin valley irrigation is already practiced , and the streams are partly or wholly used during the season of growing crops . The chief development of the area of agricultural lands in this region is to come from the construction of reservoirs for river and storm waters , and through the development of drainage systems , so that the water may be compelled to do double or treble duty . In the Sacramento valley irrigation has been practiced to a very limited extent , for the rainfall is considerable , and the people until the last year or two have been proud to affirm that their climate was humid ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them irrigation is highly advan tageous , and that the product of the field may be multiplied more than threefold through the agency of rivers . It is in the valley of the Sacramento and its tributaries that the great deposits of gold gravels are chiefly found , and that extensive hydraulic mining has been carried on . The rivers of the Sierras were turned into reservoirs , and their waters , under high pressure , through the agency of monitors , were set to tearing down the hills of gravel and washing them away into the Sacramento . But these operations soon choked the stream and caused it to overflow the adjacent lands , and the sands and gravel brought down were deposited over the lands , and thus fields and towns were buried and populous regions were temporarily destroyed . Then the farmers of the valleys , through the legislature and the courts , stopped the mining operations ; but strife still rages . The greed for gold and the hunger for fruit and wheat still spur the miners and farmers , and the conflict is irrepressible . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will quietly discover that both parties are equally interested in the control of the rivers ; that all of the waters of these regions can be stored in reservoirs and used at will , and that the valley of the Sacramento can be irrigated to multiply its agricultural products and its gold mines worked by the same agency , and that the miners and the farmers have common and harmonious interests in the hydraulic problems of the fairest land under the sun . In geologic times , not long ago as speaks the scientific man , but very long ago indeed as speaks the chronicler of human follies , there was a deep valley on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada at the headwaters of the Truckee River . About this valley towered granite mountains . But earthquakes came , and rents were formed in the rocks , and out of the fissures poured monstrous streams of lava . One of these fissures crossed the lower end of our mountain valley , and through it poured floods of molten rock . Stream after stream issued , to cool in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the valley two or three thousand feet in height , and above it was a deep basin five or six hundred square miles in area . The storms that fell on the granite and volcanic mountains rolled in rivers to fill the basin , and Lake Tahoe was created . When filled , at last , its waters overflowed the rim of lava , and the Truckee River now springs from the Tahoe fountain . Its deep waters are dark with profundity , like the clouds of a stormy sky , but about its shores a few shallow bays are found , and emerald waters , like festoons of beauty , encircle the deeper and more somber lake . Back from the waters forest-clad slopes rise // towards the heavens , and above are seen naked crags and domes of granite . Farther to the north , Donner , Independence , and other mountain lakes discharge their waters into creeks that join the Truckee . Itis thus that a large hydrographic basin is formed in the mountains where torrential rains fall and deep snows accumulate in winter months , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which leaves the mountains in a dance of delight and with a never-ending song of laughing waters . Sweet valleys are found below , for the people have in many places reclaimed the desert and encircled their homes with verdant fields . But the waters are all caught in California , while the irrigated lands are in Nevada ; so the farmers of the Silver State must go to the lands of the Golden State to construct their reservoirs . The water of the lake can be partly discharged each year by deepening its outlet and the water used for irrigation in Nevada , and after the irrigating season is over the gates may be closed and the lake permitted to refill ; but this perhaps will mar a pleasure resort . Who shall judge between the States ? A very large part of all perennial waters to be used in Nevada have their sources in California . Who shall judge between the States ? In southern Utah a bold escarpment or cliff of rocks two thousand feet in height is presented towards Arizona . This is the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is cut in two by a river which heads a little back from the brink of the cliffs and runs to the north ; and so , except at the very southern extremity , two plateaus are found , which unite between the head of the river and the verge of the cliffs . This one-two plateau lies high and is covered with great forests , where rains and snows fall in abundance , and the waters gather to form the Sevier River . Along its upper course and beside some of its tributaries there are small valleys that are high and cold ; yet grass , rye , oats , and potatoes can be raised in the short summer . Forty miles from its source the river enters a deep cafion , and when it emerges a broad and beautiful valley is found . Down this the stream meanders , and then turns westward and vanishes in the sand . It is a lost river . Just above the sink and along the valley through which the river meanders there is good and abundant land-much more than the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have institutions and customs like nations of the Oriental world in more than one respect , cultivate the soil by irrigation in the same manner . There are lands above the central cafion and lands below ; but the river can not serve them all . The earliest settlements were below . Later settlements have been planted above , in the sub-arctic lands , and they are taking the waters away from the older towns and farms . And how is justice to be rendered between these conflicting interests ? North of Mt . Nebo lies Utah Lake , which is fed by the Provo River and a number of beautiful creeks . About the lake and along the streams the people are cultivating the land by irrigation . But the surplus water is still discharged into the lake , which constitutes a great reservoir . From the lower end of the lake the river Jordan flows on to the Dead Sea of Utah , the Great Salt Lake , on whose shore the Mormon Temple stands . Large areas in the valley are watered from the river . The Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams above there are favorable sites for reservoirs , and there are areas of land that can yet be irrigated ; but if the waters are used in the upper valley they can not be used along the banks of the Jordan . All increase of the irrigated area above will decrease the irrigated area below . Who shall divide the waters and relegate them to the best lands in the interest of the greatest number of people ? Bear River has its sources partly in Idaho and partly in Wyoming . Where its upper affluent creeks are assembled it runs northward across the Utah-Idaho line . At this point it expands into a broad sheet of water known as Bear Lake , which is divided into two nearly equal parts by the territorial line . The surface of the lake is about six thousand feet above the level of the sea . The river , after leaving the lake below , runs northward for a long course into Idaho , and then turns upon itself and recrosses the territorial line into Utah . The course of this great curve is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three points the valleys expand so as to present small areas of irrigable land . In general , above the Utah line , the region drained is mountainous . From this point the river flows through a steadily expanding valley until it empties into Great Salt Lake . Now it is possible to use much of the water of this stream in the upper region on mountain valley lands , where hay can be cultivated and some other of the crops of cold climates . Another portion can be used in Idaho , while the great valley along the whole stretch of the river is admirably adapted to irrigation . Bear Lake itself , which lies in two Territories , is ultimately to become the chief reservoir , but others can be constructed above , and still others below . Thus the reservoir system must be distributed between the two political divisions , while the great body of the lands to be redeemed are in Utah . How these lands are to be selected , and water-rights relegated to such lands , is a serious problem which demands immediate solution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions have been kindled , and war would ensue were it an international instead of an interstate problem . The Snake or Shoshone River heads in the great forest-clad mountains of Wyoming and runs across the line into Idaho , then passes quite across the Territory until it becomes the boundary line between Idaho and Oregon . Passing the northeastern corner of the last mentioned State , it enters the State of Washington , and runs westward for a long reach until it debouches into the Columbia . The Shoshone River is one of great volume , second only to the Colorado . Reservoir sites along its course in Wyoming and Idaho have already been revealed by the surveys , and it is shown that in the upper region water can be stored to an amount of more than 2,000,000 acre feet . This will irrigate at the first usage at least 2,000,000 acres of land ; and if they be properly selected , so that the waters can be collected again and again after serving the land , the area redeemed will be more than 4,000,000 acres . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is safe to say that the waters of the Shoshone with its tributaries may ultimately serve from 8 , ooo , ooo to Io , ooo , ooo acres . In its utilization three classes of problems are involved . If the waters are taken out in small canals near to the river and the lowlands served first , and prior rights and interests established on such lands , then but a small part of theotream can be used , and the greater part will run away to the Pacific Ocean ; and subsequently the region of irrigation can be enlarged only by buying out vested water-rights scattered along the course of the river . But if at the very beginning the water can be taken out high up the river and carried in great canals to either side and there distributed to the higher lands , and used over and over again on its return , a complete utilization can be secured , and the cost of the construction of the system of irrigation by reservoirs and canals will be greatly reduced per acre . To irrigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals taken out along its course here and there will cost more than half as much as the construction of hydraulic works that will serve from 6 , ooo , ooo to 8 , ooo , ooo ; while the scattered minor works will be forever subject to destruction by the floods , and the agriculture secured will be of less value per acre , because the best lands will not be served , and only imperfect drainage will be secured . The valley of the Shoshone has an interesting structure . In late geologic times it has been the site of great volcanic activity . The eruptions have not produced cones and mountains , but fissures have been opened and broad sheets of lava have been poured out over the region . It is a valley of volcanic mesas or low table-lands . On the basaltic rocks thus poured out a peculiar surface is developed . The floods of cooling lava roll down in waves and bubble up in domes , which often crumble and fall in , leavifig many pits , and the general surface is thus exceedingly irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to produce high hills and mountains . The process of degradation by frost and heat , by wind and rain , smooth out these irregularities ; the higher points are degraded and the lower places are filled . Many of the eruptions in this valley are of such age that their surface has been smoothed out in this manner ; but there are many others so irregular that the mesas are covered with pits and naked rocks , and are thus wholly worthless for agricultural purposes . The second great problem is properly to select the mesa lands to which the waters shall be distributed . A part of the storage of the water must be in Wyoming , while the lands to be served must be in Idaho , Oregon , and Washington . These are interests over which nations would speedily be at war ; in this country they involve interstate questions , and must be settled by the General Government . Space fails me to describe the beautiful lands of the Columbia and its tributaries , but interstate and international problems are involved . The Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kootenay , heads in British territory , passes into Montana , and returns to British territory . Passing over to the Missouri , some of its waters head in foreign lands , and Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , and Nebraska are interested . Along the hundredth meridian from Mani : toba to Mexico there is a zone of semi-arid land . Years ago , when the writer first began investigations into the agricultural prospects of the far West , he abandoned the designation " desert " and adopted the term " arid , " as more properly characteristic of the country . For the one hundredth meridian zone he at first adopted the term " sub-arid , " but it gave great offense , and the suggestion that irrigation was necessary to its successful cultivation was received with denial and denunciation , for at that time the advantage of artificially supplying water to cultivated lands was generally unknown . Seeing that the term " sub-arid " was a red flag to kindle anger , it was dropped , and the term " sub-humid " was adopted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " sub-humid " region . The average rainfall , which varies much from year to year , is about eighteen inches on its western margin , and increases to about twenty-four on its eastern edge . Passing from east to west across this belt a wonderful transformation is ob // served . On the east a luxuriant growth of grass is seen , and the gaudy flowers of the order Cornposliw make the prairie landscape beautiful . Passing westward , species after species of luxuriant grass and brilliant flowering l ) lants disappear ; the ground gradually becomes naked , with " bunch " grasses here and there ; now and then a thorny cactus is seen , and the yucca thrusts out its sharp bayonets . At the western margin of the zone the arid lands proper are reached . The winds , in their grand system of circulation from west to east , climb the western slope of the Rocky Mountains , and as they rise they are relieved of pressure and lose their specific heat , and at the same time discharge their moisture , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried roll down the eastern slope into lower altitudes , when the pressure increases and they are heated again . But now they are dry . Thus it is that hot , dry winds come , now and then , and here and there , to devastate the sub-humid lands , searing the vegetation and parching the soil . From causes not well understood the rainfall often descends in fierce torrents . So storms and siroccos alternately play over the land . Here critical climatic conditions prevail . In seasons of plenteous rain rich crops can be raised without irrigation . In seasons of drought the fields are desert . It is thus that irrigation , not always a necesity , is still an absolute condition of continued prosperity . The rainfall is almost sufficient , and the artificial supply needed is small - perhaps the crop will rarely need more than one irrigation . A small supply for this can be obtained from the sands of the river valleys that cross the belt . In some regions artesian waters are abundant ; but the great supply must come from the storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well adapted to this end . Under such conditions farming can not be carried on in large continuous tracts . Small areas , dependent on wells , sand-fountains , and ponds , must be cultivated . It is a region of country adapted to gardens , vineyards , and orchards . The hardier fruits can be cultivated at the north , and sub-tropical fruits at the south . From this region the towns and cities of the great valley and the capitals of trade in the East will be supplied with fruit and vegetables . It is the region of irrigation nearest to them , where gardens and fields produce richer , sweeter products than those of humid lands . Already the people are coming to a knowledge of this fact and are turning their industries in the right direction . The earliest settlements have been planted in seasons of maximum of rain , and the people who came had dreams of wealth to be gathered from vast wheatfields . Now wholesale farming is almost wholly abandoned . In the last twenty years , during which the writer has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and traversed it in many ways , he has seen in different portions two or three tides of emigration , each ultimately disastrous , wholly or in part , and settled regions have become unsettled by migration to other districts . But from each inflow a few wiser men have remained and conquered prosperity ; and now that the conditions of success are known , he is willing to prophesy - not from occult wisdom , but from a basis of fact - that the sub-humid r*ion will soon become prosperous and wealthy . The Arid Land is a vast region . Its mountains gleam in crystal rime , its forests are stately , and its valleys are beautiful ; its caiions are made glad with the music of falling waters , its skies are clear , its air is salubrious , and it is already the home of millions of the most energetic men the world has ever known .
