txt The differences of opinion that have caused the delay in the'conference at the City Club , from which much was expected , appear to have arisen from a confusion as to the purpose of the movement . That purpose , as originally announced and as generally understood by the public , was to secure the nomination and election of judicial candidates pledged to not give any contribution for party uses . The purpose apparently pursued by some of the conferees seems to have been to form an anti-Tammany combination . The two are not necessarily the same . This confusion was largely due , we Should infer , 10 the views advanced by Mr. PEcKaAm at the general meeting of the City Club on Tuesday . At that time he addressed himself to a sharp criticism of the course of Tammany in the matter of judicial nominations and judicial patronage , basing his remarks on the testimony of RICHARD CROKER . before the Mazet committee . The criticism was just , but it had the natural and inevitable effect of placing the speaker and , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renomination of Justice BARRETT , who is recognized as a Tammany man and who had testified on the stand at the Mazet inquiry that he had used his personal influence with Mr. CHOKER to promote the selection of candidates . It is pretty well understood that the delay that ensued , compelling the holding of the successive meetings , was caused by opposition to Justice BARRETT . It has appeared to many earnest advocates of the abolition of all political contributions by candidates for the bench that it would have been much better to confine the action of the conference called by the City Club to that end . This view is firmly held by some who are as stringent opponents of the general policy of Tammany as Mr. PECKHAM , and who feel as keenly the disgrace that has been inflicted on the city by the domination of Mr. CROKER in its politics . It is probably possible at this time so to arouse and guide public opinion and sentiment as to do away forever with the mischievous and demoralizing and scandalous practice of political contributions from candidates for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control of the city or Mr CROKER from the control of Tammany . It is the part of common sense to pursue the good that can be got and not to obscure , delay , and impede it s by insisting on chasing after the good that at present can not be had . Moreover , it has been shown that Mr. CROKER himself professes to be in favor of asking no contributions from judicial candidates when the expenses of an election can be met by other means , and Justice BARRETT stated on the stand that no contribution had been asked from him at the time of his last election , when he was the candidate of both parties , though he had given a small amount . This is an indication that Mr. CROKER is to some extent sensitive to the fueling that has been aroused in this matter . It was surely not the part of wisdom to provoke him unnecessarily to defy it , as was the effect of the opposition to Justice BARRETT on the ground of his close connection with Mr. CHOKER . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferees at the City Club is not known . The considerations we have suggested are pertinent , whatever may be the action of the conference or of the various bodies there represented . It has been intimated that the nomination of Justice BARRETT will in any case encounter opposition . That would be most unfortunate . Not that he would be in any danger of defeat . His election would be perfectly secure if he were named by Tammany only , and even if he should decline , to make the pledge contemplated by the conference at the City Club as to contributions . But it would be most unfortunate for the best interests of the community if a man of his ability , probity , long and faithful and brilliant service on the bench should not receive the general recognition that he so richly merits . That is the price that the city must pay to get the best service ; if it is niggardly or perverse in its paymeat it discourages the fidelity that it should in every way stimulate .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
