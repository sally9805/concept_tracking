txt Seth Low w has announced himself against an independent movement in the State this Fall , and a letter written by him to a promlinent independent has caused consternation and no little confusion in the ranks of the Independent Citizens ' Committee. ? Mr. Low 's letter was generally accepted as indicating that the organization of which he was the head during the municipal campaign of last year is not going to take any hand in State politics , even though it has lent - its name and emblem to the Independent Citizens ' Committee . Mr. Low 's letter , which was yesterday the topic of discussion among independents , is as follows : I have your letter of Sept. 13 . I am not very well acquainted with the details of the situation , but so far as I can base an opinion on the Sti ? - face of things I should think that the proposed action of the independents in this State is the one thing that can cause the defeat of Col. Roo3e-vett and the possible loss of a sound-money Senator from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , I can see absolutely no benefit to accrue from the course which has been taken and which is proposed . It seems to me to be unreasonable and unprofitable , and similar to the attitude of the Prohibitionists , who sacrifice all practical results . year after year for the sake of a theory . I regret to differ so radically from one whose opinion I value so highly as yours , but under the circumstances you can perceive that I can take no part in an independent movement this year . Yours sincerely , SETH LOW , Mr. Low Stands for It . To whom this letter was sent , Mr. Low last night declined to state , nor would he add anything to it , saying that the letter was authentic and that it embodied his views and spoke for itself . While some of the independents claim to have had knowledge of Mr. Low 's position in regard to their movtment , others are noticeably sore that he should have thus made a direct slap at them . Isaac H. Klein , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he and others had known for six weeks how Mr. Low stood on the question , and that the letter did not come as a surprise to him . Preble Tucker , also of the committee , and who was prominent in the Citizens ' Union , said : " When some of the candidates on the ticket with Mr. Low last year were asked to run on the Gearge ticket Mr. Low advised against it , as being possibly indicative of disloyalty to him . That was the first time I had ever heard this idea advanced . Now it appears tat Mr. Platt favors Col. Roosevelt 's declination of an independent nomination on exactly the same grounds . I am not surprised at such a sentiment from Mr. Platt , yet it seems that he and Mr. Low are now agreed . " Both Mr. Klein and Mr. Tucker , however , have no doubt that Col. Roosevelt will accept the nomination of the independents , and their views are shared by other members of the committee . John E. Parsons said yesterday that he did not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , " said Mr. Parsons , " quote him as saying quite the reverse , and in my opinion Mr. Roosevelt would say just what is attributed to him . As I understand his position he will not be a candidate unless he receives the regular Republican nomination , but that if he is nominated by the Republicans he will then be pleased to receive nominations from any other organizations . I think that every one must commend this position . I have confidence enough in Mr. Rposevelt to believe that he will run to win , and that if he is elected he will be absallite.y independent of outside control . Always a Good Republican . " He has always been a good Republican and I see no reason why he should separate himself from his party . I hope that the party will nominate him and that the independents will indorse him . I hope every one will vote for him and that he will be elected . I do not think that even should the Democrats nominate a man who is sound on the money question they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any complications with the scandals which I suppose will be made use of in the coming campaign against the Republicans . " William B. Hornblower , who , although a Democrat , supported Seth LOW ? , last Fall , said he was of the opinion that should Col. Roosevelt refuse an independent nomination , such action would affect the sentiment of the independent voters to the extent of causing a large number to vote for the Democratic nominee , " always provided , " said Mr. Hornblower , " that the Democrats ignore the Chicago platform and put up a good man . " Mr. Hornblower said he thought the Democrats could win on a platform which rejected the silver issue , but said he did not think they could get together and agree on the right man or the right issue . While agreeing that the strength of Col. Roosevelt throughout the State is enormous , the Independents are still uncertain as to how far a declination by him of their nomination for Governor would hurt him with independent voters . Some argue that , even if he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with independent Republicans , who would willingly vote the regular organization ticket so long as Col. Roosevelt was at the head of it . On the other hand , they think there would be a great defection of independent Democratic voters . GOSSIP AMONG REPUBLICANS . Much Talk as to What Will Be Done in Convention Next Week : The vicinity of Republican State headquarters in the Fifth Avenue Hotel wore an ante-convention aspect last night . The lobby was filled with politicians of high and low degree , including several members of the present State administration . All the talk ran on what is to be done when the delegates get together at Saratoga next Tuesday . There was little discussion of the Gubernatorial question for the reason that among all those Republicans who affiliate with the Platt machine it is accepted that Col , Theodore Roosevelt ' will be nominated on the first ballot . State Chairman Odell was asked if he was ready to " move up his pegs " on his last week 's estimate of 700 votes for Roosevelt , but he said there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a delegate here and there added to the column in the last few days . " he said , " but I still stick to the original figures , and I think you will see them verified when the roll is called . " County Chairman Quigg , who saw many of the local delegation to Saratoga during the day , said last night : " I do not see where Gov . Black can get any votes in New York County outside of Mr. Gruber 's district . He may get some there . " Mr. Quigg said that he did not expect to call the delegation together until after they got to Saratoga . " What is the use , " he asked , " when they are practically all one way ? " While the Governorship , in the opinion of the Platt managers , is a settled question , the matter of the second place on the ticket was still regarded last evening as " wide open . " Senator Platt would be gratified personally to see Lieut . Gov . Woodruff renominated , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entanglement with Gov . Black 's fight on the Senator are believed to . make his success highly improbable . State Chairman Odell is confident that the place will go to the centre of the State , and Francis Hendricks of Syracuse may be the mail . Other Places on the Ticket . Concerning the other places on the ticket final decisions will not be made until the leaders get together at Saratoga . They will be pieced with due regard to geographical conditions and special effort will be made in their distribution tD placate that element in the organization which is inclined to feel that the turning down of Gov . Black has been a trifle summary . By a judicious an , portionment of the minor offices the Platt managers hope to remove or at least allay some of the bittrness aroused by Gov . Black 's persistent fight for renomination . Louis F ' . Payn , who has been in the city for two days , will return to Albany to-day ' . He will not be able to report to the Gov. governor any acquisitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists that no matter whether he has any chalice of nomination or not , Got ' . Black will go ben fore the convention and leave to the delegates the task of taking him out of the race . Senator Platt returned last night from a flying visit to Washington , where he went , it is understood , for the purpose of consulting President . on the references to National isuc 's in the platform to be adopted at Saratoga . The importance of holding up the hands of the National Administration is recognized by the Republican leaders and Mr. Platt is desirous that the planks on the war and kindred questions shall be satisfactory to the President . The party leaders are considering a rough draft of the platform which has been made , and it is understood the usual plank indorsing the present State administration will have a place in it . A prominent leader at State headquarters sail yesterday that there was no disposition to humiliate Gov . Black by leaving out the usual indorsement . A denial is made that Col , Roosevelt has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his home in Newburg to-night and to Saratoga on Friday . Senator Platt will start on Saturday . County Chairman Quigg will probably leave for the convention city this evening or tomorrow , and will open the New York headquarters at the United States Hotel .
