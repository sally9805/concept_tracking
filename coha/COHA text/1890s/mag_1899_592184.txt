THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A REVOLUTIONIST . THE FORTRESS ; THE ESCAPE . I. Ti*rs was , then , the terrible fortress where so much of the true strength of Russia had perished during the last two centuries , and the very name of which is spoken in St. Petersburg in a hushed voice . Here Peter I. tortured his son Alexis and killed him with his own hand ; here the Princess Taraktinova was kept in a cell which filled with water during an inundation , - the rats climbing upon her to save themselves from drowning ; here the terrible Minich tortured his enemies , and Catherine II . buried alive those who objected to her having murdered her husband . And from the times of Peter I. for a hundred and seventy years , the annals of this mass of stone which rises from the Nev* in front of the Winter Palace were annals of murder and torture , of men buried alive , condemned to a slow death , or driven to insanity in the loneliness of the dark and damp dungeons . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banner of republican rule and the abolition of serfdom , underwent their first experiences of martyrdom , and traces of them may still be found in the Russian Bastille . Here were imprisoned the poets Rykeff and Shevch6nko , Dosto6vsky , Bakiinin , Chernysh6vsky , Pisareff , and so many others of our best writers . Here Karak6zoff was tortured and hanged . Here , somewhere in the Alexis ravelin , is still kept'Nechdieff , who was given up to Russia by Switzerland as a common-law criminal , but is treated as a dangerous political prisoner , and will never again see the light . In the same ravelin are also two or three men whom rumor says Alexander II. , because of what they know , and others must not know , about some palace mystery , ordered imprisoned for life . One of them , adorned with a long gray beard , was lately seen by an acquaintance of mine in the mysterious fortress . All these shadows rose before my imagination . But my thoughts fixed especially on Bakilnin , who , though he had been shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wall , after 1848 , and then handed over to Nicholas I. , who kept him here , yet came out , when the Iron Tsar 's death released him after an eight years ' detention , fresher and fuller of vigor than his comrades who had remained at liberty . " He has lived it through , " I said to myself , " and I must , too : I will not succumb here ! " My first movement was to approach the window , which was placed so high that I could hardly reach it with my lifted hand . It was a long , narrow opening , cut in a wall five feet thick , and protected by an iron grating and a double iron window frame . At a distance of a dozen yards from this window I saw the outer wall of the fortress , of immense thickness , on the top of which I could make out a gray sentry box . Only by looking upward could I perceive a bit of the sky . I made a minute inspection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say how many years . From the position of the high chimney of the Mint I guessed that I was in the southwestern corner of the fortress , in a bastion overlooking the Nevti . The building in which I was incarcerated , however , was not the bastion itself , but what is called rn a fortification a reduit ; that is , an inner two-storied pentagonal piece of masonry which rises a little higher than the walls // of the bastion , and is meant to contain two tiers of guns . This room of mine was a casemate destined for a big gun , and the window was an embrasure . The rays of the sun might never penetrate it ; even in summer they must be lost in the thickness of the wall . The room held an iron bed , a small oak table , and an oak stool . The floor was covered with painted felt , and the walls with yellow paper . However , in order to deaden sounds , the paper was not put on the wall itself ; it was pasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire grating , back of which was a layer of felt ; only beyond the felt could I reach the stone wall . At the inner side of the room there was a washstand , and a thick oak door in which I made out a locked opening , for passing food through , and a little slit , protected by glass and by a shutter from the outside : this was the " Judas , " through which the prisoner could be spied upon at every moment . The sentry who stood in the passage frequently lifted the shutter and looked inside , - his boots squeaking as he crept toward the door . I tried to speak to him ; then the eye which I could see through the slit assumed an expression of terror and the shutter was immediately let down , only to be furtively opened a minute or two later ; but I could get not a word of reply from the sentry . Absolute silence reigned all round . I tried to catch some sound from the Nevd , or from the town on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The main thing , " I said to myself , " is to preserve my physical vigor . I will not fall ill . Let me imagine I am compelled to spend a couple of years in a hut in the far north , during an arctic expedition . I will take plenty of exercise , practice gymnastics , and not let myself be broken down by my surroundings . Ten steps from one corner to the other is already something . If I repeat them one hundred and fifty times , I shall have walked one verst " ( two thirds of a mile ) . I decided to walk every day seven versts , - about five miles : two versts in the morning , two before dinner , two after dinner , and one before going to sleep . " If I put on my table ten cigarettes , and move one of them each time that I pass the table , I shall easily count the three hundred times that I must walk up and down . I must walk rapidly , but turn slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time a different way . Then , twice a day I shall practice gymnastics with my heavy stool . " I lifted it by one leg , holding it at arm 's length . I turned it like a wheel , and soon learned to throw it from one hand to tbe other , over my head , behind my back , and across my legs . A few hours after I had been brought into the prison the governor came to offer me some books , and among them was an old acquaintance and friend of mine , the first volume of George Lewes 's Physiology , in a Russian transla*jion . I asked , of course , to have paper , pen , and ink , but was absolutely refused . Pen and ink are never allowed in the fortress , unless special permission is obtained from the Emperor himself . I suffered very much from this forced , inactivity , and began to compose in my imagination a se , ries of novels for popular reading , taken from Russian history , - something like Eug'ene Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the descriptions , the diakgues , and tried to commit the whole to memory from the beginning to the end . One can easily imagine how exhausting such a work would have been if I had had to continue it for more than two or three months . But my brother Alexander obtained pen and ink for me . One day I was asked to entera four-wheeled cab , in company with the same speechless Georgian gendarme officer of whom I have spoken before . I was taken to the Third Section , where I was allowed an interview with my brother , in the presence of two gendarme officers . // Alexander was at Zurich when I was arrested . From early youth he had longed to go abroad , where men think as they like , read what they like , and openly express their thoughts . Russian life was hateful to him . Veracity - absolute veracity - and the most openhearted frankness were part of his creed ; he could not bear deceit or even conceit in any form . The absence of free speech in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veiled words to which our writers resort , were utterly repulsive to his frank and open nature . Soon after my return from Western Europe he removed to Switzerland , and decided to settle there . After he had lost his two children - one from cholera in a few hours , and another from consumption - St. Petersburg became doubly repugnant to him . My brother did not take part in our work of agitation . He did not believe in the possibility of a popular uprising , and he conceived a revolution only as the action of a representative body , like the National Assembly of France in 1789 . As for the socialist agitation , he knew it only by means of public meetings and public speeches , - not as the secret , minute work of personal propaganda which we were carrying on . In England lie would have sided with John Bright or with the Chartists . If he had been in Paris during the uprising of June , 1848 , he would surely have fought with the last handful of workers behind the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed Ledru Rollin or Louis Blanc . In Switzerland he settled at Zurich , and his sympathies went with the moderate wing of the International . Socialist on principle , he carried out his prin ciple in his very frugal and laborious manner of living , and toiled on passionately at his great scientific work , - the main purpose of his life , - a work which was to be a nineteenth-century counterpart to the famous Tableau de la Nature of a Revolutionist. 107 of the Encyclopiedists . He soon became a close personal friend of the old refugee Colonel P. L. Lavr6ff , with whom he had very much in common in his Kantian philosophical views . When he learned about my arrest , Alexander immediately left everything , - the work of his life , the life itself of freedom which was as necessary for him as free air is necessary for a bird , - and returned to St. Petersburg , which he disliked , only to help me through my imprisonment . We were both very much affected at this interview . My brother was extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms of the gendarmes , - those executioners of all independent thought in Russia , - and expressed his feeling frankly in their presence . As for me , the sight of him at St. Petersburg filled me with the most dismal apprehensions . I was happy to see his honest face , his eyes full of love , and to hear that I should see them once a month and yet I wished him hundreds of miles away from that place to which he came free that day , but to which he would inevitably be brought some night under an escort of gendarmes . " Why did you come into the lion 's den ? Go back at once ! " my whole inner self cried ; and yet I knew that he would remain as long as I was in prison . He understood better than any one else that inactivity would kill me , and had already made application to obtain for me pen and ink . The Geographical Society wanted me to finish my work on the glacial period , and my brother turned the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support his application . The Academy of Sciences was interested in the matter ; and finally , two or three months after my imprisonment , the governor entered my cell and announced to me that I was permitted by the Emperor to complete my report to the Geographical Society , and that I should be allowed pen and // ink for that purpose . " Till sunset only , " he added . Sunset , at St. Petersburg , is at three in the afternoon , in winter time ; but that could not be helped . " Till sunset " were the words used by Alexander II . when he granted the permission . F ' . So I could work ! I could hardly express now the immensity of relief I then felt at being enabled to resume writing . I would have consented to live on nothing but bread and water , in the dampest of cellars , if only permitted to work . I was the only one to whom writing materials were allowed . Several of my comrades spent three years and more in confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - three " took place , and all they had was a slate . Of course , even the slate was welcome in that dreary loneliness , and they used it to write exercises in the languages they were learning , or to work out mathematical problems ; but what was jotted down on the slate could last only a few hours . My prison life now took on a more regular character . There was something immediate to live for . At nine in the morning I had already made the first three hundred pacings across my cell , and was waiting for my pencils and pens to be delivered to me . The work which I had prepared for the Geographical Society contained , beside a report of my explorations in Finland , a discussion of the bases upon which the glacial hypothesis ought to rest . Now , knowing that I had plenty of time before me , I decided to rewrite and enlarge that part of my work , which accordingly grew in the fortress to the size of two large volumes . The first of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geographical Society 's Memoirs ) ; while the second , not quite finished , remained in the hands of the Third Section when I ran away . The manuscript was found only in 1895 , and given to the Russian Geographical Society , by whom it was forwarded to me in London . At five in the afternoon , - at three in the winter , - as soon as the tiny lamp was brought in , my pencils and pens were taken away , and I had to stop my work . Then I used to read , mostly books of history . Quite a library had been formed in the fortress by the generations of political prisoners who had been confined there . I was allowed to add to the library a number of staple works on Russian history , and with the books which were brought to me by my relatives I was enabled to read almost every work and collection of acts and documents bearing on the Moscow period of the history of Russia . I relished , in reading , not only the Russian annals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pskof , - the best , perhaps , in Europe* for the history of such cities , . - but all sorts of dry documents , and even the Lives of the Saints , which occasionally contain facts of the real life of the masses which can not be found elsewhere . I also read during this time a great number df novels , and even arranged for myself a treat on Christmas Eve . My relatives managed to send inc then the Christmas stories of Dickens , and I spent the festival laughing and crying over these beautiful creations of the great novelist . I ' . The worst was the silence , as of the grave , which reigned about me . In vain I knocked on the walls and struck the floor with my foot , listening for the faintest sound in reply . None was to be heard . One month passed , then two , three , fifteen months , but there was no reply to my knocks . We were only six then , scattered among thirty - six casemates . When the non - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk , and I asked him , " What // kind of weather have we ? Does it rain ? " he cast a furtive side glance at me , and without saying a word promptly retired behind the door , where a sentry and another non-commissioned officer kept watch upon him . The only living being from whom I could hear even a few words was the governor , who came to my cell every morning to say " good-morning and ask whether I wanted to buy tobacco or paper . I tried to engage him in conversation ; but he also cast furtive glances at the non-commissioned officers who stood in the half-opened door , as if to say , " You see , I am watched , too . " There were no sounds whatever except the squeak of the sentry 's boots , the hardly perceptible noise of the shutter of the Judas , and the ringing of the bells on the fortress cathedral . They rang a " Lord save me " ( " Gospodi pomilni " ) every quarter of an hour , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each hour , the big bell struck slowly , with long intervals between successive strokes . A lugubrious canticle followed , chimed by the bells , which at every sudden change of temperature went out of tune , making at such times a horrible cacophony which sounded like the ringing of bells at a burial . At the gloomy hour of midnight , the canticle , moreover , was followed by the discordant notes of a " God save the Tsar . " The ringing lasted a full quarter of an hour ; and no sooner had it come to an end than a new Lord save me * announced to the sleepless prisoner that a quarter of an hour of his uselessly spent life had gone in the meantime , and that many quarters of an hour , and hours , and days , and months of the same vegetative life would pass , before his keepers , or maybe death , would release him . Every morning I was taken out for a half hour 's walk in the prison yard . This yard was a small pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building - the bath house - in the middle . But I liked those walks . 109 of a Revolution&amp;*t . The need of new impressions is so great in prison that , when I walked in our narrow yard , I always kept my eyes fixed upon the high gilt spire of the fortress cathedral . This was the only thing in my surroundings which changed its aspect , and I liked to see it glittering like pure gold when the sun shone from a clear blue sky , or assuming a fairy aspect when a light bluish haze lay upon the town , or becoming steel gray when dark clouds obscured the sky . Winter is gloomy at St. Petersburg for those who can not be out in the brightly lighted streets . It was still gloomier , of course , in a casemate . But dampness was even worse than darkness . In order to drive away moisture the casemate was overheated , and I almost suffocated ; but when I obtained my request at last , that the temperature should be kept lower than before , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if a pail of water had been poured upon it every day , - the consequence being that I suffered a great deal from rheumatism . With all that I was cheerful , continuing to write and to draw maps in the darkness , sharpening my lead pencils with a broken piece of glass which I had managed to get hold of in the yard ; I faithfully walked my five miles a day in the cell , and performed gymnastic feats with my oak stool . So time went on . Then sorrow crept into my cell and nearly broke me down . My brother Alexander was arrested . Toward the end of December , 1874 , I was allowed an interview with him and our sister ll6l*ne , in the fortress , in the presence of a gendarme officer . Interviews , granted at long intervals , always bring both the prisoner and his relatives into a state of excitement . One sees beloved faces and hears beloved voices , knowing that the vision will last but a few moments ; one feels so near to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // there can be no intimate conversation before a stranger , an enemy and a spy . Besides , my brother and sister felt anxious for my health , upon which the dark , gloomy winter days and the dampness had already marked their first effects . We parted with heavy hearts . A week after that interview , I received , instead of an expected letter from my brother concerning the printing of my book , a short note from Polak6ff . He informed me that henceforward he would read the proofs , and that I would have to address to him everything relative to the printing . From the very tone of the note I understood at once that something must be wrong with my brother . If it were only illness , Polak6ff would have mentioned it . Days of fearful anxiety came upon me . Alexander must have been arrested , and I must have been the cause of it ! Life suddenly ceased to have any meaning for me . My walks , my gymnastics , my work , lost interest . All the day long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nothing but Alexander 's arrest . For me , an unmarried man , imprisonment was only personal inconvenience ; but he was married , he passionately loved his wife , and they now had a boy , upon whom they had concentrated all the love that they had felt for their first two children . Worst of all was the incertitude . What could he have done ? For what reason had he been arrested ? What were they going to do with him ? Weeks passed ; my anxiety became deeper and deeper ; but there was no news , till at last I heard in a roundabout way that he had been arrested for a letter written to P. L. Lavr6ff . I learned the details much later . After his last interview with me he wrote to his old friend , who at that time was editing a Russian socialist review , Forward , in London . He mentioned in this letter his fears about my health ; he spoke of the many arrests which were occurring then in Russia ; and he freely expressed his hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post office by the Third Section , and they came on Christmas Eve to search his apartments . They carried out their search in an even more brutal manner than usual . After midnight half a dozen men made an irruption into his rooms , and turned everything upside down . The very walls were examined ; the sick child was taken out of its bed , that the bedding and the mattresses might be inspected . They found nothing , - there was nothing to find . My brother very much resented this search . With his customary frankness , he said to the gendarme officer who conducted it : " Against you , captain , I have no grievance . You have received little education , and you hardly understand what you are doing . But you , sir , " he continued , turning toward the procureur , " you know what you are doing . You have received a university education . You know the law , and you know that you are trampling all law , such as it is , under your feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you are simply - a scoundrel ! " They swore hatred against him . They kept him imprisoned in the Third Section till May . My brother 's child - a charming boy , whom illness had rendered still more affectionate and intelligent - was dying from consumption . The doctors said he had only a few days more to live . Alexander , who had never asked any favor of his enemies , asked them this time to permit him to see his child for the last time . He begged to be allowed to go home for one hour , upon his word of honor to return , or to be taken there under escort . They refused . They could not deny themselves that vengeance . The child died , and its mother was thrown once more into a state bordering on insanity when my brother was told that he was to be transported " for an undetermined term " to East Siberia , to // a small town , Minusinsk . He would travel in a cart between two gendarmes , and his wife might follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me , at least , what is my crime , " he demanded ; but there was no accusation of any sort against him beyond the letter . This transportation appeared so arbitrary , so much an act of mere revenge on the part of the Third Section , that none of our relatives could believe that the exile would last more than a few months . My brother lodged a complaint with the minister of the interior . The reply was that the minister could not interfere with the will of the chief of the gendarmes . Another complaint was lodged with the Senate . It was of no avail . A couple of years later , our sister H6Thne , acting on her own initiative , wrote a petition to the Tsar . Our cousin Dmitri , governor-general of Khttrkoff , aide-de-camp of the Emperor and a favorite at the court , also deeply incensed at this treatment by the Third Section , handed the petition personally to the Tsar , and in so doing added a few words in support of it . But the vindictiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander II . He wrote upon the petition , " Pust posidit " ( Let him remain some time more ) . My brother stayed in Siberia twelve years , and never returned to Russia . Iv . The countless arrests which were made in the summer of 1874 , and the serious turn which was given by the police to the prosecution of our circle , produced a deep change in the opinions of Russian youth . Up to that time the prevailing idea had been to pick out among the workers , and eventually the peasants , a number of men who should be prepared to become socialistic agitators . But the factories were now flooded with spies , and it was evident that , do what they might , both propagandists and workers of a Revolutionist. 111 would very soon be arrested and hidden forever in Siberia . Then began a great movement " to the people , " when several hundred young men and women , disregarding all precautions hitherto taken , rushed to the country , and , traveling through the towns and villages , incited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs , and proclamations . In our circles this summer received the name of " the mad summer . " The gendarmes lost their heads . They had not hands enough to make the arrest nor eyes enough to trace the steps of every propagandist . Yet not less than fifteen hundred persons were arrested during this hunt , and half of them were kept in prison for years . One day in the summer of 1875 , in the cell that was next to mine I distinctly heard the light steps of heeled boots , and a few minutes later I caught fragments of a conversation . A feminine voice spoke from the cell , and a deep bass voice - evidently that of the sentry - grunted something in reply . Then I recognized the sound of the colonel 's spurs , his rapid steps , his swearing at the sentry , and the click of the key in the lock . He said something , and a feminine voice loudly replied : " We did not talk . I only asked him to call the noncommissioned officer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonel swearing in whispers at the sentry . So I was alone no more . I had a lady neighbor , who at once broke down the severe discipline which had hitherto reigned amongst the soldiers . From that day the walls of the fortress , which had been mute during the last fifteen months , became animated . From all sides I heard knocks with the foot on the floor : one , two , three , four , . . eleven knocks , twenty-four knocks , fifteen knocks ; then an interruption , followed by three knocks and a long succession of thirty - three knocks . Over and over again these knocks were repeated in the same succession , until the // neighbor would guess at last that they were meant for " Kto vy ? " ( Who are you ? ) the letter v being the third letter our alphabet . Thereupon conversation was soon established , and usually was conducted in the abridged alphabet ; that is , the alphabet being divided into six rows of five letters , each letter is marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered with great pleasure that I had at my left my friend Serduk6ff , with whom I could soon talk about everything , especially when we used our cipher . But intercourse with men brought its sufferings as well as its joys . Underneath me was lodged a peasant , whom Serduk6ff knew . He talked to him by means of knocks ; and even against my will , often unconsciously during my work , I followed their conversations . I also spoke to him . Now , if solitary confinement without any sort of work is hard for educated men , it is infinitely harder for a peasant who is accustomed to physical work , and not at all wont to spend years in reading . Our peasant friend felt quite miserable , and having been kept for nearly two years in another prison before he was brought to the fortress , - his crime was that he had listened to socialists , - he was already broken down . Soon I began to notice , to my terror , that from time to time his mind wandered . Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two perceived , step by step , day by day , evidences that his reason was failing , until his talk became at last that of a lunatic . Frightful noises and wild cries came next from the lower story : our neighbor was mad , but was still kept for several months in the casemate before he was removed to an asylum , from which he never emerged . To witness the destruction of a man 's mind , under such conditions , was terrible . I am sure it must have contributed to increase the nervous irritability of my good , true friend Serduk6ff . When , after a four years ' imprisonment , he was acquitted by the court and released , he shot himself . One day I received a quite un*expected visit . The Grand Duke Nicholas , brother of Alexander II. , who was inspecting the fortress , entered my cell , followed only by his aide-de-camp . The door was shut behind him . He rapidly approached me , saying , " Good-day , Kropotkin . " He knew me personally , and spoke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance . " How is it possible , Kropotkin , that you , a page de chambre , a sergeant of the corps of pages , should be mixed up in this business , and now be here in this horrible casemate ? " " Every one has his own opinions , " was my reply . " Opinions ! So your opinions were that you must stir up a revolution ? " What was I to reply ? Yes ? Then the construction which would be put upon my answer would be that I , who had refused to give any answers to the gendarines , " avowed everything " before the brother of the Tsar . His tone was that of a commander of a military school when trying to obtain " avowals " from a cadet . Yet I could not say No : it would have been a lie . I did not know what to say , and stood without saying anything . " You see ! You feel ashamed of it now - This remark angered me , and I at once said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the inquiring magistrate , and have nothing more to say . " " But understand , Kropotkin , please , " he said then in the most familiar tone , " that I do n't speak to you as an inquiring magistrate . I speak quite as a private person , - quite as a private man , " he repeated , lowering his voice . Thoughts went whirling in my head . To play the part of Marquis Posa ? To tell the Emperor through the grand duke the desolation of Russia , the ruin of the peasantry , the arbitrariness of the officials , the terrible famines in prospect ? // To say that we wanted to help the peasants out of their desperate condition , to make them raise their heads , - and by all this try to influence Alexander II. ? These thoughts followed one another in rapid succession , till at last I said to myself : " Never ! Nonsense ! They know all that . They are enemies of the nation , and such talk would not change them . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could not look upon him as a private man . He then began to ask me indifferent questions . " Was it not iu Siberia , with the Decembrists , that you came to such ideas ? " No ; I knew only one Decembrist , and with him I had no talks worth speaking of . " " Was it then at St. Petersburg that you got them ? " " I always was the same . " " Why ! Were you such in the corps of pages ? " " In the corps I was a boy , and what is indefinite in boyhood grows definite in manhood . " He asked me some other similar questions , and as he spoke I distinctly saw what he was driving at . He was trying to obtain avowals , and my imagination vividly pictured him saying to his brother : " All these examining magistrates are imbeciles . He gave them no replies , but I talked to him ten minutes , and he told me everything . " That began to annoy me ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could you have anything to do with all these people , - peasants and people with no names ? " - I sharply turned upon him and said , " I have told you already that I have given my replies to the examining magistrate . " Then he abruptly left the cell . Later , the soldiers of the guard made quite a legend of that visit . The person who came in a carriage to carry me away at the time of my escape wore a military cap , and , having sandy whiskers , bore a faint resemblance to the Grand Duke Nicholas . So a tradition grew up amongst the soldiers of the St. Petersburg garrison that it was the grand duke himself who came to rescue me and kidnapped me . Thus are legends created even in times of newspapers and biographical dictionaries . V. Two years had passed . Several of my comrades had died , several had become insane , but nothing was heard yet of our case coming before a court . My health gave way before the end of the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and the five miles became an endless distance . As there were about sixty of us in the fortress , and the winter days were short , we were taken out for a walk in the yard for twenty minutes only every third day . I did my best to maintain my energy , but the " arctic wintering " without an interruption in the summer got the better of me . I had brought back from my Siberian journeys slight symptoms of scurvy ; now , in the darkness and dampness of thi* casemate , they developed more distinctly ; that scourge of the prisons had taken hold of me . In March or April , 1876 , we were at last told that the Third Section had completed the preliminary inquest . The " case " had been transmitted to the judicial authorities , and consequently we were removed to a prison attached to the court of justice , - the house of detention . It was an immense show prison , recently built on the model of the French and Belgian prisons , consisting of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window overlooking an inner yard and a door opening on an iron balcony ; the balconies of the several stories were connected by iron staircases . For most of my comrades the transfer to this prison was a great relief . // There was much more life in it than in the fortress ; more opportunity for correspondence , for seeing one 's relatives , and for mutual intercourse . Tapping on the walls continued all day long undisturbed , and I was able in this way to relate to a young neighbor the history of the Paris Commune from the beginning to the end . It took , however , a whole week 's tapping . As to my health , it grew even worse than it had lately been in the fortress . I suffocated in the close atmosphere of the tiny cell , which measured only four steps from one corner to another , and where , as soon as the steam pipes were set to work , the temperature changed from a glacial cold to an unbearable heat . Having to turn so often , I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of outdoor exercise , in the corner of a yard inclosed between high brick walls , did not refresh me in the least . As to the prison doctor , who did not want to hear the word " scurvy pronounced " in his prison , " the less said of him the better . I was allowed to receive food from home , it so happening that one of my relatives , married to a lawyer , lived a few doors from the court . But my digestion had become so bad that I was soon able to eat nothing but a small piece of bread and one or two eggs a day . My strength rapidly failed , and the general opinion was that I would not live more than a few months . When climbing the staircase which led to my cell in the second story , I had to stop two or three times to rest , and I remember an elderly soldier from the escort once commiserating me and saying , " Poor man , you wo n't live till the end of the summer. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister H*l*ne tried to obtain my release on bail , but the procureur , Sh4bin , replied to her , with a sardonic smile , " If you bring me a doctor 's certificate that he will die in ten days , I will release him . " He had the satis* faction of seeing my sister fall into a chair and sob aloud in his presence . She succeeded , however , in gaining her request that I should be visited by a good physician , - the chief doctor of the military hospital of the St. Petersburg garrison . He was a bright , intelligent , aged general , who examined me in the most scrupulous manner , and concluded that I had no organic disease , but was suffering simply from a want of oxidation of the blood . " Air is all that you want , " he said . Then he stood a few minutes in hesitation , and added in a decided manner , " No use talking , you can not remain here ; you must be transferred . " Some ten days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated on the outskirts of St. Petersburg , and has a special small prison for the officers and soldiers who fall ill when they are under trial . Two of my comrades had already been removed to this hospital prison , when it was certain that they would soon die of consumption . In the hospital I began at once to recover . I was given a spacious room on the ground floor , close by the room of the military guard . It had an immense grated window looking south , which opened on a small boulevard with two rows of trees ; and beyond the boulevard there was a wide space where two hundred carpenters were engaged in building wooden shanties for typhoid patients . Every evening they gave an hour or so to singing in chorus , - such a chorus as is formed only in large carpenters ' artels . A sentry marched up and down the boulevard , his box standing opposite my room . My window was kept open all the day , and I battened in the rays of the sun , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balmy air of May with a full chest , and my health improved rapidly , too rapidly , I began to think . // I was soon able to digest light food , gained strength , and resumed my work with renewed energy . Seeing that by no means should I finish the second volume of my work , I wrote a r6sum6 of it , which was printed in the first volume . In the fortress I had heard from a comrade who had been in the hospital prison that it would not be hard for me to escape from it , and I made my presence there known to my friends . However , escape proved far more difficult than I had been told . A stricter supervision than had ever been heard of before was exercised over me . The sentry in the passage was placed at my door , and I was never let out of my room . The hospital soldiers and the officers of the guard who occasionally entered it seemed to be afraid to stay more than a minute or so . Various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - some of them very amusing . I was , for instance , to file through the iron bars of my window . Then , on a rainy night , when the sentry on the boulevard was dozing in his box , two friends were to creep up from behind and overturn the box , so that it would fall upon the sentry and catch him like a mouse in a trap , while I , in the meantime , was to jump out of the window . But a better solution came in an unexpected way . " Ask to be let out for a walk , " one of the soldiers whispered to me one day . I did so . The doctor supported my demand , and every afternoon , at four , I was allowed to take an hour 's walk in the prison yard . I had to keep on the green flannel dressing gown which is worn by the hospital patients , but my boots , my vest , and my trousers were delivered to me every day . I shall never forget my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me a yard full three hundred paces long and more than two hundred paces wide , all covered with grass . The gate was oJ*en , and through it I could see the street , the immense hospital opposite , and the people who passed by . I stopped on the doorsteps of the prison , unable for a moment to move when I saw that yard and that gate . At one end of the yard stood the prison , - a narrow building , about one hundred and fifty paces long , - at each end of which was a sentry box . The two sentries paced up and down in front of the building , and had tramped out a footpath in the green . Along this footpath I was told to walk , and the sentries walked beside me , - so that I was never more than ten or fifteen paces from the one or the other . Three hospital soldiers took their seats on the doorsteps . At the opposite end of this spacious yard wood for fuel was being unloaded from a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen peasants . The whole yard was inclosed by a high fence made of thick boards . Its gate was open to let the carts in and out . This open gate fascinated me . " I must not stare at it , " I said to myself ; and yet I looked at it all the time . As soon as I was taken back to my cell I wrote to my friends to communicate to them the welcome news . " I feel wellnigh unable to use the cipher , " I wrote with a tremulous hand , tracing almost illegible signs instead of figures . " This nearness of liberty makes me tremble as if I were in a fever . They took me out to-day in the yard ; its gate was open , and no sentry near it . Through this unguarded gate I will run out ; my sentries will not catch me , " - and I gave the plan of the escape . " A lady is to come in an open carriage to the hospital . She is to alight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fifty paces from the gate . When I am taken out , at tour , I shall walk for a while with my hat in my hand , and somebody who passes by the gate will take it as the signal that all is right within the prison . Then you must return a signal : The street is clear . ' // Without it I shall not start : once beyond the gate I must not be recaptured . Light or sound only can be used for your signal . The coachman may send a flash of light , - the sun 's rays reflected from his lacquered hat upon the main hospital building ; or , still better , the sound of a song that g*oes on as long as the street is clear ; unless you can occupy the little gray bungalow which I see from the yard , and signal to me from its window . The sentry will run after me like a dog after a hare , describing a curve , while I run in a straight line , and I will keep five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , I shall spring into the carriage and we shall gallop away . If the sentry shoots - well , that can not be helped ; it lies beyond our foresight ; and then , against a certain death in prison , the thing is well worth the risk . " Counter proposaf 's were made , but that plan was ultimately adopted . The matter was taken in hand by our circle ; people who never had known me entered into it , as if it were the release of the dearest of their brothers . However , the attempt was beset with difficulties , and time went with terrible rapidity . I worked hard , writing late at night ; but my health improved , nevertheless , at a speed which I found appalling . When I was let out into the yard for the first time , I could only creep like a tortoise along the footpath ; now I felt strong enough to run . True , I continued to go at the same tortoise pace , lest my walks should be stopped ; but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my comrades , in the meantime , had to enlist more than a score of people in the affair , to find a reliable horse and an experienced coachman , and to arrange hundreds of details which always spring up like mushrooms around such conspiracies . The preparations took a month or so , and any day I might be moved back to the house of detention . At last the day of the escape was settled . June 29 , old style , is the day of St. Peter and St. Paul . My friends , throwing a touch of sentimentalism into their enterprise , wanted to set me free on that day . They had let me know that in reply to my signal " All right within " they would signal " All right outside " by sending up a red toy balloon . Then the carriage would conic , and a song would be sung to let me know when the street was open . I went out on the 29th , took off my hat , and waited for the balloon . But nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard the rumble of a carriage in the street ; I heard a man 's voice singing a song unknown to me ; but there was no balloon . The hour was over , and with a broken heart I returned to my room . " Something must have gone wrong , " I said to myself . The impossible had happened that day . Hundreds of children 's 1*alloons are always sold at St. Petersburg , near the Gostinoi Dvor . That morning there were none ; not a single balloon was to be found . One was discovered at last , in the possession of a child , but it was old and would not fly . My friends rushed then to an optician 's shop , bought an apparatus for making hydrogen , and filled the balloon with it ; but it would not fly any better : the hydrogen had not been dried . Time pressed . Then a lady attached the balloon to her umbrella , and , holding the umbrella high over her head , walked up and down in the street along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of it ,  --  the wall being too high , and the lady too short . As it turned out , nothing could have been better than that accident with the balloon . When the hour of my walk had passed , the carriage was driven along the streets which it was intended to follow after the escape ; and there , in a narrow street , it was stopped by a dozen or more carts which were carrying wo*d to the hospital . The horses of the // carts got into disorder , - some of them on the right side of the street , and some on the left , - and the carriage had to make its way at a slow pace amongst them ; at a turning it was actually blocked . If I had been in it , I should have been caught . Now a whole system of signals was established along the streets through which we should have to go after the escape , in order to give notice if the streets were not clear . For a couple of miles from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to walk up and down with a handkerchief in his hand , which at the approach of the carts he was to put into his pocket ; another was to sit on a stone and eat cherries , stopping when the carts came near ; and so on . All these signals , transmitted along the streets , were finally to reach the carriage . Friends had also hired the gray bungalow that I had seen from the yard , and at an open window of that little house a violinist stood with his violin , ready to play when the signal " Street clear " reached him . The attempt had been settled for the next day . Further postponement would have been dangerous . In fact , the carriage had been taken notice of by the hospital people , and something suspicious must have reached the ears of the authorities , as on the night before my escape I heard the patrol officer ask the sentry who stood opposite my window , " Where are your ball cartridges ? " The soldier began to take them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of minutes before he got them . The patrol officer swore at him . " Have you not been told to-night to keep four ball cartridges in the pocket of your coat ? " And he stood by the sentry till the latter put four cartridges into his pocket . " Look sharp ! " he said as he turned away . The new arrangements concerning the signals had to be communicated to me at once ; and at two on the next day a lady - a dear relative of mine - came to the prison , asking that a watch might be transmitted to me . Everything had to go through the hands of the procureur ; but as this was simply a watch , without a box , it was passed along . In it was a tiny cipher note which contained the whole plan . When I read it I was seized with terror , so daring was the feat . The lady , herself under pursuit by the police for political reasons , would have been arrested on the spot , if any one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw her calmly leave the prison and move slowly along the boulevard . I came out at four , as usual , and gave my signal . I heard next the rumble of the carriage , and a few minutes later the tones of the violin in the gray house sounded through our yard . But I was then at the other end of the building . When I got back to the end of my path which was nearest the gate , - about a hundred paces from it , - the sentry was close upon my heels . " One turn more , " I thought ; but before I reached the farther end of the path the violin suddenly ceased playing . More than a quarter of an hour passed , full of anxiety , before I understood the cause of the interruption . Then a dozen heavily loaded carts entered the gate and moved to the other end of the yard . Immediately , the violinist - a good one , I must say-began a wildly exciting mazurka from Kontsky , as if to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I moved slowly to the nearer end of the footpath , trembling at the thought that the mazurka might stop before I reached it . When I was there I turned round . The sentry had stopped five or six paces behind me ; he was looking the other way . " Now or never ! " I remember that thought flashing through my head . I flung off my green flannel dressing gown and began to run . For many days in succession I had practiced how to get rid of that immea // surably long and cumbrous garment . It was so long that I carried the lower part on my left arm , as ladies carry the trains of their riding habits . Do what I might , it would not come off in one movement . I cut the seams under the armpits , but that did not help . Then I decided to learn to throw it off in two movements : one casting the end from my arm , the other dropping the gown on the floor . I practiced patiently in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle their rifles . " One , two , " and it was on the ground . I did not trust much to my vigor , and began to run rather slowly , to economize my strength . But no sooner had I taken a few steps than the peasants who were piling the wood at the other end shouted , " He runs ! Stop him ! Catch him ! " and they hastened to intercept me at the gate . Then I flew for my life . I thought of nothing but running , - not even of the pit which the carts had dug out at the gate . Run ! run ! full speed ! The sentry , I was told later by the friends who witnessed the scene from the gray house , ran after me , followed by three soldiers who had been sitting on the doorsteps . The sentry was so near to me that he felt sure of catching me . Several times he flung his rifle forward , trying to give me a blow in the back with the bayonet . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was so convinced that he could stop me in this way that he did not fire . But I kept my distance , and he had to give up at the gate . Safe out of the gate , I perceived , to my terror , that the carriage was occupied by a civilian who wore a military cap . He sat without turning his head to me . " Sold ! " was my first thought . The comrades had written in their last letter , " Once in the street , do n't give yourself up : there will be friends to defend you in case of need , " and I did not want to jump into the carriage if it was occupied by an enemy . However , as I got nearer to the carriage I noticed that the man in it had sandy whiskers which seemed to be those of a warm friend of mine . He did not belong to our circle , but we were personal friends , and on more than one occasion I had learned to know his admirable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there was danger at hand . " Why should he be there ? Is it possible ? " I reflected , and was going to shout out his name , when I caught myself in good time , and instead clapped my hands , while still running , to attract his attention . He turned his face to me - and I knew who it was . " Jump in , quick , quick ! " he shouted in a terrible voice , calling me and the coachman all sorts of names , a revolver in his hand and ready to shoot . " Gallop ! gallop ! I will kill you ! " he said to the coachman . The horse - a beautiful racing trotter , which had been bought on purpose - started at full gallop . Scores of voices yelling , " Hold them ! Get them ! " resounded behind us , my friend meanwhile helping me to put on an elegant overcoat and an opera hat . But the real danger was not so much in the pursuers as in a soldier who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spot where the carriage had to wait . He could have prevented my jumping into the carriage or could have stopped the horse by simply rushing a few steps forward . A friend was consequently commissioned to divert this soldier by talking . He did this most successfully . The soldier having been employed at one time in the laboratory of the hospital , my friend gave a scientific turn to their chat , speaking about the microscope and the wonderful things one sees through it . Referring to a certain parasite of the human body , he asked , " Did you ever see what a formidable tail it has ? " " What , man , a tail ? " " Yes , it has ; under the microscope it is as big as that . " " Do n't tell me any of // your tales ! " retorted the soldier . " I know better . It was the first thing I looked at under the microscope . " This animated discussion took place just as I ran past them and sprang into the carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact . The carriage turned sharply into a narrow lane , past the same wall of the yard where the peasants had been piling wood , and which all of them had now deserted in their run after me . The turn was so sharp that the caridage was nearly upset , when I flung myself inward , dragging toward me my friend ; this sudden movement righted the carriage . Two gendarmes were standing at the door of a public house , and gave to the military cap of my companion the military salute . " Hush ! hush ! " I said to him , for he was still visibly excited . " All goes well ; the gendarmes salute us ! " The coachman thereupon turned his face toward me , and I recognized in him another friend , who smiled with happiness . Everywhere we saw friends , who winked to us or gave us a Godspeed as we passed at the full trot of our beautiful horse . Then we entered the large Nevsky Perspective , turned into a side street , and alighted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a staircase , and at its top fell into the arms of my sister-in-law , who had been waiting in painful anxiety . She laughed and cried at the same time , bidding me hurry to put on another dress and to crop my conspicuous beard . Ten minutes later my friend and I left the house and took a cab . In the meantime , the officer of the guard at the prison and the hospital soldiers had rushed out into the street , doubtful as to what measures they should take . There was not a cab for a mile round , every one having been hired by my friends . An old peasant woman from the crowd was wiser than all the lot . " Poor people , " she said , as if talking to herself , " they are sure to come out on the Perspective , and there they will be caught if somebody runs along that lane , which leads straight to the Perspective . " She was quite right , and the officer ran to the tramway car that stood close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses to send somebody on horseback to the Perspective . But the men obstinately refused to give up their horses , and the officer did not use force . As to the violinist and the lady who had taken the gray house , they too rushed out and joined the crowd with the old woman , whom they heard giving advice , and when the crowd dispersed they went also . It was a fine afternoon . We drove to the islands where all the St. Petersburg aristocracy goes on bright spring days to see the sunset , and called on the way , in a remote street , at a barber 's shop to shave off my beard , which operation changed me , of course , but not . very much . We drove aimlessly up and down the islands , but , having been told not to reach our night quarters till late in the evening , did not know where to go . " What shall we do in the meantime ? " I asked my friend . He also pondered over that question . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naming one of the best St. Petersburg restaurants . " iNo one will ever think of looking for you at Donon , " he calmly remarked . " They will hunt for you everywhere else , but not there ; and we shall have our dinner , and a drink too , for the success of your escape . " What could I reply to so reasonable a suggestion ? So we went to Donon , passed the halls flooded with light and crowded with visitors at the dinner hour , and took a separate room , where we spent the evening till the time came when we were expected . The house where we had first alighted was searched less than two hours after we left , as were also the apartments of nearly all our friends . Nobody thought of making a seareh at Donon. // A couple of days later I was to take possession of an apartment which had been engaged for me , and which I could occupy under a false passport . But the lady who was to go with me took the precaution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by spies . So many of my friends had come to inquire whether I was safe there that the suspicions of the police had been aroused . Moreover , my portrait had been printed by the Third Section , and hundreds of copies had been distributed to policemen and watchmen . All the detectives who knew me by sight were looking for me in the streets ; while those who did not were accompanied by soldiers and warders who had seen me during my imprisonment . The Tsar was furious that such an escape should have taken place in his capital in full daylight , and he had ordered , " He must be found . " It was impossible to remain at St. Petersburg , and I concealed myself in country houses in its neighborhood . In company with half a do*en friends , I stayed at a village frequented at this time of the year by St. Petersburg people bent on picnicking . Then it was decided that I should go abroad . But from a foreign paper we had learned that all the frontier stations and railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by detectives who knew me by sight . So I determined to travel in a direction where I would be least expected . Armed with the passport of a friend , I crossed Finland , and went northward to a remote port on the Gulf of Bothnia , whence I crossed to Sweden . After I had gone on board the steamer , and it was about to sail , the friend who was to accompany me to the frontier told me the St. Petersburg news , which be had promised our friends not to tell me before . My sister H6kne had of a Revolutionist. been arrested , as well as the sister of my brother 's wife , who had visited me in prison once a month after my br.pther and his wife went to Siberia . My sister knew absolutely nothing of the preparations for my escape . Only after I had escaped a friend bad told her the welcome news . She protested her ignorance in vain : she was taken from her children , and was kept imprisoned for a fortnight . As to the sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something was to be attempted , but she had had no part in the preparations . Common sense ought to have shown the authorities that a person who had officially visited me in prison would not be involved in such an affair . Nevertheless , she was kept in prison for over two months . Her husband , a wellknown lawyer , vainly endeavored to obtain her release . " We are aware now , " he was told by the gendarme officers , . " that she has had nothing to do with the escape ; but , you see , we reported to the Emperor , on the day we arrested her , that the person who had organized the escape was discovered and arrested . It will now take some time to prepare the Emperor to accept the idea that she is not the real culprit . " I crossed Sweden without stopping anywhere , and went to Christiania , where I waited a few days for a steamer to sail for Hull , gathering information in the meantime about the peasant party of the Norwegian Storthing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anxiety , " Under which flag does she sail , - Norwegian , German , English ? " Then I saw floating above the stern the union jack , - the flag under which so many refugees , Russian , Italian , French , Hungarian , and of all nations , have found an asylum . I greeted that flag from the depth of my heart .
