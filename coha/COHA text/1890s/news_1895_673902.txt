txt E. R. Chap-man 's attorneys have been successful so far in their efforts to prevent the trial of their client fixed for the 17th inst. in Judge Cole 's court , by means of a writ of prohibition . The Court of Appeals for the District this morning overruled the motion of Messrs . Edmunds , Shella.barger , and Wilson for a rule requiring Judge Cole and District Attorney Birney to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not issue to prevent them proceeding with the trial of Chapman as stated , and the formal order fn the case Was entered this afternoon . The petition for the writ , which was filed with the motion , sets forth the several steps in the proceedings against Chapman , his refusal to answer the questions propounded by the Senate committee investigating the alleged Sugar Trust scandal in connection wit , ' the passage of the tariff bill ; his indictment by the District Grand Jury under certificate from the Senate ; his failure to secure freedom by proceedings in habeas corpus , and the fixing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . The ground upon which the writ is asked is that Judge Cole 's court has no jurisdiction to try the case , for the reason that the Senate committee had not the authority to propound the questions asked Chapman , and that his trial under ' the conditions would be in contempt of the Constitution and laws . It was expected that the matter would be argued in the Court of Appeals this morning , but the case was disposed of and the papers filed . Judge Wilson said he had anticipated the action taken , that the Government 's object was to get a record upon which the matter could be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States on appeal . This will doubtless be done , and the trial , as fixed , will probably not occur . The petition for a writ of prohibition is a proceeding almost wholly unknown here , but two such writs having been granted in the history of the Supreme Court of the United States  --  one in 1706 and the other in 1886 .
