txt The membership of the Oneida Senatorial Convention will be pretty evenly divided between delegates favorable to Henry J. Coggeshall and those favoring Frederick G. Weaver . Both sides are claiming a majority of the delegates elected , but a little calculation will show that Senator Coggeshall has the best of it , and is likely to be renominated at the convention , which will be held within ten days . Charles V. Schram and Thomas Wheeler have been engineering the campaign for Mr. Coggeshail , and they know pretty well how matters stand . Mr. Schram said to-day that Mr. Coggeshall had fifty-one delegates , three more than a majority . " How do you reconcile this estimate with the Weaver men 's claim of sixty-two delegates ? " was asked . " They are simply carrying cut a preconcerted plan , " answered Mr. Schram . " We learned Friday that the Weaver men were going to flood the country districts with the story that Tammany Hall had tient money into this Senatorial district to re-elect Coggeshall . I would like to have seen some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have told . As it was , we broke into Weaver 's stronghold , the Dairy Tier , and captured fifteen delegates . With fifteen elected in this city and Rome , we have thirty , and the southern tier of towns gives us twenty more . " Mr. Schram said Saturday that the Weaver men were going to tend out the information , whether it was true or not , that Weaver had a big majority of the delegates . He said to-day that Coggeshall bad a majority of the delegates , if he could only hold them , but he feared that big inducements would be held out to just enough delegates to throw the result . It is said that T. C. Platt has held his hands off thus far , but if he sees that Mr. Coggeshall is going to win , he will support him . Railroad Commissioner Beardsley and Secretary Mitchell of the Fish and Game Commission came down from Utica to-day , and both said that it looked as though Mr. Coggeshall had the majority cf the delegates elected .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
