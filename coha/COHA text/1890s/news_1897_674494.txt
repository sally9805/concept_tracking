txt Senator Aldrich 's confidence that the Tariff bill as reported by the Republicans ' of the Finance Committee will be acceptable to the Senate when it is better understood is not shared by those Democrats who have found out that the experts who prepared the explanatory tables for the Finance Committee have made about MO errors in their computations , necessitating the going over of the work and postponing the day when the tariff debate is to begin in the Senate .

Most of the Senators reported to have been polled are sc qualified in their expressions that they can vote either way . " " But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Possibly it is , in the newspapers . But do the critics know what they are criticisinF ? " Then you think that the Finance Committee can demonstrate that the sugar schedule does not give the advantage to the Sugar Trust that is popularly supposed to have been accorded to the trust In the bill ? " " I do think so , and any man of sense can demonstrate it if he will but take the trouble . I have no doubt that the committee will be able to do so .

Most of the complaints have come from newspapers that were expected to object to the schedules and the rates . " Notwithstanding the hopefulness and light manner of the Rhode Island Senator , the opponents of the sugar schedule and of some other schedules in the bill say that the rates offered- have three-fourths of a cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more than the indefinite assurance ? of the Senator from Rhode Island to carry the Senate bill through. ?
