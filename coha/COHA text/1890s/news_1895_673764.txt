txt In turning the office of Chief Magistrate of this State over to his successor , Mr. Flower gave utterance to these exceedingly sound sentiments : " The experience of the past , and the verdict of the present upon the past , point out but one straight and sure course to enduring popular esteem  --  the course of duty conscientiously and fearlessly performed . Attempts to win public confidence by hypocrisy and deception may-bring temporary applause , but can give neither adequate personal satisfaction nor substantial and lasting popular respect . " If Gov . Flower had fully appreciated the soundness of these sentiments when he entered upon his office , and had resolutely acted in accordance with their dictates throughout his term , he would retire to private life with a measure of honor which he can not now count upon . ' While much of his official record has been creditable , as a whole it can not be regarded with satisfaction even by himself . It has been his peculiar defect that under pressure he has failed to adhere " conscientiously and fearlessly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear perception of what duty required of him or from want of that keen scruple which gives life to conscience and courage . In the main , Gov . Flower 's impulses have appeared to be right , but he has shown himself a man in need of counsel and subject to influence , and his mistake has been in accepting counsel from the wrong source and yielding to influences that proceeded from " hypocrisy and deception " in others . In matters of official routine he has been capable and painstaking , and has shown a disposition to deal fairly with public interests , and in emergencies , like that demanding provision for landing passengers from cholera-infected vessels and that calling for the suppression of riot at Buffalo , he has been prompt and decisive in action . It is on such occasions that he has won applause . But where there was a conflict between the sense of duty and the demands of what was made to appear to him as party expediency , he has yielded easily to more wily natures than his own . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been known as the Hill-Murphy machine , and one of the lessons of his experience at Albany , though he may never have occasion to profit by it , ought to be that such subserviency can result in neither personal satisfaction , popular respect , nor real party expediency . Gov . Flower 's besetting weakness was displayed conspicuously in twice appointing Maynard to the bench as a reward for dirty political work at the order of Senator Hill , and in attempting to make a merit of a disgraceful performance . That did not even bring temporary applause , and it unmistakably forfeited public confidence . The same quality was exhibited again in consenting to join with Mr. Sheehan in taking from the Mayor of Buffalo his legitimate power of appointment , that it might be exercised for the benefit of local factions , and it was shown in a less degree in dealing with measures passed by the Legislature and in making appointments . It was this subserviency to the machine that led him virtually to nullify the civil service law of the State . And what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an honorable man of business intrusted with official duties ? Having lost " public confidence " and " popular respect " by obedience to political " bosses , " they found him of no further use , and neglected to pay him the poor homage of asking whether he desired a renomination . He was not consulted in regard to the action to be taken in view of the expiration of his term , but was as completely ignored as though he had never been of service either to the party or to the politicians , whereas if he had followed " the course of duty conscientiously and fearlessly performed , " he would nave been stronger than the politicians and could have been renominated in spite of them . His record , with its mingling of the creditable and the discreditable , is the more disappointing because of the constant indication that he was capable of better things if he would only be true to himself and take counsel of the " better element " in his party .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
