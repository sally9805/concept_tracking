Cawein , Madison Julius , 1865-1914 : LOVE I HAD BANISHED . from Lyrics and idyls ( 1890 ) Love I had banished away for a day , Banished a thorn to the thorns of Scorn , Passing , behold how he lay like a ray , Lay like the creamiest cluster of may , Clad on with myrrh and with morn ! Stricken of bitterness fleet were my feet , Fleet to the side which my heart had denied ; Fain for his laughter , a seat at his sweet Side , and hard kisses to heal him and heat The ice of his wounded pride . Holding him there , with the night lying light As plumes that are stirred of a sleeping bird ; Crushing him close to me , slight beat the white Rose of his members , like rain that is bright ' Neath the sun riding kingly and spurred . Kissing him there in the glow and the blow , Glow of the blue and blow of the dew , Leaned to him , happy and slow as the flow Of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his cheeks ' hale hue . Blossoming limbs that breathed rare , and as bare As beauty who dreams in the gray moonbeams ; Glamorous gold fell his hair that was fair Lit of his eyes , starring lustrous the lair Of curls that were shadowy gleams . Love , I had taken for mate , as the late Hours crept slow through the shy night 's glow , Stole from me leaving a weight as of fate , Fate and all scorn , and the harshness of hate , Hard on my slumbering woe . Love , I had held to my breast and caressed , Hiding him deep in the eyes of sleep , Waking had flown from the nest he had pressed , Pressed with his fondling limbs , and the rest  --  Remembrance that only can weep . Cawein , Madison Julius , 1865-1914 : LOVE A-MILKING. from Lyrics and idyls ( 1890 ) I " Hoard no more hope ! believe me ! "  --  " Thou wouldst not make me poor ! "  --  " Wouldst lead me to deceive me ? As many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ?  --  Say no more , sir , say no more ! " " Love trusts ! sweet faith ! thereof , my lass , Trust wins to trust above , my lass  --  Love 's older than our love , my lass , Not wiser than of yore . " II " Thy love is over simple To woo one on the leas ; One 's kirtle torn ; in wimple Unbusked ; tanned by the breeze . "  --  " Thou needest but that dimple  --  On thy knees , Love , on thy knees ! " What 's wiser than thine eyes , my lass ? Thy heart ?  --  Beneath God 's skies , my lass , Love ! wiser than the wise , my lass  --  We blind ! ' t is Love who sees . III " ' Low apple blossoms breaking Pay me the kiss dost owe . "  --  " ' T is thine , thine be the taking . "  --  " Aboon the afterglow Three kiss-soft stars are waking  --  Walk slow , my love , walk slow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; More sweet the stars when few , my lad ; Life 's trials , when love is true , my lad , Are lighter than we know . " Cawein , Madison Julius , 1865-1914 : HIS SONG . from Lyrics and idyls ( 1890 ) Sing to me how I pine to blow The flower beneath thy lattice low  --  Then wouldst thou cull me , sweet , and wear A captive in thy slumberous hair , Thy hair ? Sing to me how I yearn to shine Yon pearly star above yon pine Thou gazest on  --  I , of the skies , Should thus be taken to thine eyes , Thine eyes ? Sing to me how I 'd be the breeze Which dips the dandelioned leas Thy footsteps find  --  I , of the south , Might live a kiss upon thy mouth , Thy mouth ? Sing to me how my heart doth long To be the burden of some song Thou lovest ; so myself might be The melody of memory To thee .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
