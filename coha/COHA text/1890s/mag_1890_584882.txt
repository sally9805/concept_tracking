txt HE effect of the Appalachian Mountain system upon the distribution of slavery , and consequently on the political and social history of this country , was of great importance . Slavery , as is well known , depended , for its extension , on two important crops , both of which demanded a large amount of cheap labor , and afforded articles which commerce greatly demands . The institution rested on the industries of tobacco and cotton growing . Only where one of these crops could be profitably tilled did the institution ever firmly establish itself . A glance at the map will show that the Appalachian system of mountains widens as we go southward from Pennsylvania , until it occupies nearly one-fifth of the Southern States , extending southward so as to include half of Virginia and North Carolina , a considerable part of western South Carolina , much of Georgia , Tennessee , and Kentucky , and a part of Alabama . In this section the character of the soil and form of the surface , and the nature of the climate , make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton . The result was , slavery never firmly established itself as an economic institution in any part of this vast territory . Here and there in the more fertile valleys a few slaves were employed , but there are counties in this area where a slave was never held , and where , to this day , a negro is so great a curiosity that people will journey miles to behold him . The natural result of this distribution in the negro population was that the mountain districts of the South were separated in their political motives from the plain country . When the rebellion occurred the Appalachian country was a region where disaffection toward the ConfedVOL . VIIL-49 eracy prevailed ; to a great extent the men cast in their lot with the North , or at least gave their sympathies to the Federal cause . The peoples of eastern Kentucky and Tennessee and western Virginia  --  and generally those of western North Carolina as well-recruited the ranks of the Federal army . Some of the counties of eastern Kentucky sent more troops to the Union forces than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Owing to these conditions the Appalachian upland region divided the South in a political and geographical way , and served greatly to enfeeble the resistance which it opposed to the Federal arms . About one-fourth of the population of the slave-holding States lay in this upland country . Not only did this district afford over a hundred thousand soldiers to the Federal army , but the prevailing sympathies of the population were with our troops in every stage of their work . It is to this non-slave-holding element of the Appalachian districts that we owe the adhesion of Kentucky to the Federal cause and the effectual sympathy of half of the Old Dominion , now known as West Virginia . But for the existence of this extensive territory inaccessible to slavery and the consequent weakening of the South , it is doubtful if the Federal arms would have been able to prevail in that momentous contest . It would be possible to extend these considerations concerning the influence of geographic features on the development of European settlements and the history of our peoples on this continent . Analysis would show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had its effect in controlling the distribution of the population in its westward march . It would also be easy to show that the climatal characteristics have vastly affected the political conditions through the character of the crops which are tilled . Thus , for instance , the Western prairies , // which apparently owe their origin , as before remarked , to the Indians ' habit of burning the plains to favor the spread of the buffalo , greatly affected the distribution and the prosperity of our population . The forests being removed from the prairie countries , they were ready for the plough , without the arduous labor required to clear the woods away . Possibly owing to their long deforested condition , the soil greatly abounded in the elements fitted for the production of corn crops . The climate excluded the profitable culture of cotton and tobacco , the staples on which slavery rested . The result was the rapid economic development of that region through the export of grain and the consecration of the country to the interests of free labor . History shows us that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution of slavery within their territories . If the isothermals had been drawn one or two hundred miles farther north , so that the southern crops would have prospered in these States , the evil of slavery might well have been fastened so firmly that it could not have been up-. rooted from our State . Manifold and interesting as are these considerations , we must turn from them for a glance at certain other features dependent on the structure of the continent which have had a profound influence on the development of our American population , and are to have yet other important effects in the high time to come-those which arise from the distribution of the soil and the deeper-lying mineral resources of the national area . In his savage state man 's dependence on the under earth , or even upon the soil , is very slight . It is true that in a fertile country the game is commonly somewhat more abundant than in a region of scanty soil , but differences in this regard do not greatly or immediately affect the people . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of tools a slight relation with the metallic resources of the under earth is instituted . With each step in the further development of the arts , man 's interest in the crust of the earth increases . At first the non - precious metals-iron , copper , lead , and zincare sufficient for his needs ; but in everincreasing ratio with the development of civilization this dependence on the under earth is augmented . The greater portion of these geologic materials are either prepared for the use of man , or brought nearer to the earth 's surface by the process involved in mountain-building . Thus the solar force of past geological ages buried in our coal deposits depends for its formation upon the changes which have brought it into the state of coal , as well as for the uplifting which brings it into the surface of the earth , to a great extent , on the forces which build mountains . The development of the Appalachian axis , as well as the similar processes which led to the formation of the Cordilleras , has produced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to the needs of man , and has placed these stores in remarkably advantageous positions in relation to the regions suited for the purposes of agriculture . In general the continent of North America is divided into three regions of arable land and three great mineral districts . Along the Atlantic coast and east of the Appalachians there is the tolerably fertile country of the Atlantic slope , extending from Florida to the St. Lawrence . The agricultural capacity of this district compares favorably with any equal section in the world . In the Mississippi Valley we have , considering the circumstances of the soil and climate , the largest and most fertile area , the area best suited to maintain a great body of our English race which the world affords . On the Pacific slope we find a third arable field , containing less area than the Atlantic territory , but with great agricultural possibilities . ) ividing these three fields , and facing them on the north , we have the mineral districts . On the east the Appalachian country , abounding in coal and iron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Cordilleran districts we have , as far as known , the most plentiful deposit of the more important of metals , except of tin ; which the world affords within equal area . On the north , in the Laurentian field lies a third mineral area extraordinarily rich in iron , phosphates , copper , and other valuable earth materials . In // the great valley between the Cordilleras and the Appalachians , and , to a certain extent , on either shore-land , there are extensive beds of coal and important deposits of the fluid fuel petroleum , as well as of natural gas . This distribution of agricultural and mineral resources of this country is singularly*favorable for the conjoint development of tillage and of mining , and for a vast interstate and foreign commerce , of which we , in our day , see but the beginning . Before we proceed to consider the details of this natural order in the distribution of the earth resources of North America , we must turn aside for a moment to note the effect of modern economies in producing local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man the nurture places of the races depended for their effects on the presence of strong geographic barriers-seas or mountains-which might fend thepeople from the interference of their neighbors , and thereby enable them to undergo the nurturing process which led to racial or national peculiarities . It is easy to see that the effect of commerce is to destroy these boundaries . The Alps , once a formidable barrier , are now pierced by tunnels , and are as easy of passage as the plain lands to the north and south . A season 's earnings will now carry a man to the farthest civilized countries . But while commerce and the industries on which it depends have served to break down the natural barriers between peoples , they have served also , in a singular way , to create other limitations of habit and action which are likely to have even greater influence in the cradling of people than the old geographic bounds . It is evident to any one who has studied the varying effects of occupations , that the herdsman , the soil-tiller , the manufacturer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , that men who follow them become in hand and mind specialized and unlike those of other occupations . A German phrase has it that a man is what he eats ; we may better say that a man is what he does ; and that persistent doing in one line of deeds for a few generations will serve to give character to a population in much the same manner as a thousand years of isolation in a penin sula or an Alpine valley . Within the limits of either of the great classes of occupations noted above we find a wide range of diversities dependent on the peculiarities of the employment . Thus the population employed in the iron furnaces or rolling-mills differs widely in character from the folk employed in weaving and spinning fibres . The watchmaker and the shoemaker are both , in a sense , manufacturers ; but the mental training which the two receive , and the consequent habits of life , both moral and physical , differ in a very wide way . The orange gardener of Florida and the wheat farmer of Nebraska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one labors throughout the year with his tasks , the other is subjected to the peculiar influences which come from seasonal activities ; the wheat field of the Far West calls for action on but four months of the year ; for the rest the workman is but a drone , unless he turns his attention to other tasks than his field affords . Indeed , the variety of character which occupations give to a population is much greater than that which in the same time could be instituted by any purely natural circumstances . Although North America is almost destitute of the geographic divisions which in the earlier conditions of man served to diversify the character of peoples , the diversities of occupation are easily and necessarily instituted in the great American mixture of folk . Varieties of men as characteristic and as important in the history of our people as those which nature has produced in the folk of the Old World , divisions resting upon modes of activity bred in men by occupations and by habits of thought which occupations engender , will at once unite and diversify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one interest and habit of thought and actions , and separating those districts on the basis of industry from the folk who pursue diverse habits of life . I now propose to make a general review of that part of this continent which is occupied by English-speaking folk , with the hope that we may thus obtain a basis on which to foretell , in a general way , the divisions of character in our // people which are likely to arise from the varieties of their occupation . We have already noted the fact that the continent of North America is divided into three great mineral and three great agricultural districts . We may profitably add to the consideration the fact that there are three regions of a maritime sort where the people have experienced the important effects of close contact with the sea . These maritime districts consist of the North Atlantic shore , from Cape Hatteras to Labrador ; the Pacific coast , from Alaska to the Gulf of California , both regions abounding in good harbors ; and the third , the southern coast , from Hatteras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ports , and where the maritime conditions are less important than along the other shores . Despite the imperfection of the harbors from Hatteras southward , the coast of North America is , on the whole , the most completely maritime of any continent except Europe . Its landlocked waters , including the great lakes , are of vast extent ; the total number of ports possibly exceeds that of the Old World . It is clear , therefore , that we are to have in North America two great maritime districts , and a third in the south , of less importance , to add to our list of national labor-fields . In this general survey we have to consider the natural - employment divisions of this country and endeavor to forecast their economic history and the quality of the population which their condition is likely to induce . This task may advantageously begin with the New England section , a region which , by its geographic as well as its economic conditions , is one of the most specialized parts of North America . In our considerations it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line which now separates Canada from the United States . Whatever be the political future of these countries , there can be no doubt of their destined economic and social unity . The several questions which now separate them are of such a nature that we may be sure they will in the end lead to a closer union . The New England section of North America , including as such all the tillable ground from Newfoundland to the Hudson , is well named . On the whole it more closely resembles , in its conditions of shores , the surface and soil , the islands and peninsulas of northern Europe , in which our Northmen folk developed . The geological history of the two regions is very similar . Both are mainly composed of ancient rocks , and both these ancient rocks have been much crumbled by the mountain - building forces . Both have been subjected to a vast amount of glacial wear ; their soils have certain common qualities given by ice action . In both we have a close combination of agricultural and mineral resources . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence district in that field , is essentially the maritime portion of North America . Within its limits we find the largest amount of shore line for a given distance along the main coast of the continent . There are more deep bays and fjords , and larger islands , than along any other portion of the Atlantic border of the continent . The surface of the New England and Laurentian district , throughout its whole extent , may be described as mountainous . Save in the southeastern portion of the country , every part of the field contains decided mountain ridges worn to their roots by the recurrent action of glaciers and sea , but still giving the surface a truly mountainous character . The result is here , as elsewhere , that in a large part of the mountainous districts not far from one-half of the whole field is sterile from the lack of sufficient soil , or fit only for the growth of forest trees . This feature insures to the district the permanence of the timber industry . The tillable soils of the New England and Laurentian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges ; they are glacial soils , formed of the materials brought to their place by ice action ; they have certain peculiar characteristics . When first won to the ploughthey are of only moderate fertility . Largely composed of pebbles and bowlders the amount of plant food they contain does not compare with that which is held in the prairie soils , where for // ages the conditions have favored the preparation of the materials required by vegetation . They have , however , the peculiarity that they gain in fertility by skilful tillage , even without artificial fertilizing , while the prairie ground steadfastly diminishes in its productiveness under cultivation . All the pebbles in our stony fields , except , those composed of quartz , are constantly yielding some part of their materials to refresh the soil . A pebble of granite , or of the kindred crystalline rocks , contains considerable quantities of potash , soda , lime , and phosphorus , substances which are most rapidly brought into the state where they may be appropriated by plants when the soil is used by man . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , where cheap lands with their great though unenduring store of fertile materials await the settler . This stage in our history , where cheap but unpermanently fertile lands are to be had almost for the asking , is now nearly passed by . In another generation these opportunities will no longer exist , and it is thus likely that with the relative increase in the value of soil products the agricultural position of New England will be improved . From a somewhat careful study of the New England States , as well as a portion of the Laurentian district , I have become convinced that this northeastern field has far greater agricultural possibilities than is commonly supposed . A very large part of the neglect to which these fields have been subjected is due to the withdrawal of the population from the fields to manufacturing life , to occupations which for a time afforded a larger remuneration than the tillage of a stubborn but not unfruitful soil . When the Western country is fully occupied through immigration , and the natural increase of our native people , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our country will attain to something of the relative importance which it had in those districts a century ago . This seems the more probable when we note the fact that a large portion of the richest soils of New England , viz. , the swamp-lands , were never won to the plough . In the Laurentian and New England district we have not far from ten thousand square miles of morasses , areas which demand a considerable expenditure of capital before they can be brought to the tiller 's use , but which , when so won , afford fields of surpassing fertility . Up to the time when the great West was opened to settlement , the population of New England had not become dense enough to drive the people to this class of soils ; but with the inevitable crowding of our American population which the next century is to bring about , these swamps will be drained , and by their drainage a vast area of excellent land will be won to tillage . This northeast section of the continent has a fair share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very plentiful and varied store of building materials . Last of all it is peculiarly the seat of the greater water-powers of this country . This abundance of streams suited for mechanical purposes is due to the relatively considerable height of the district and the frequent great thickness of the glacial deposits in which the rain-waters are retained and slowly yielded to the streams . It is easy from the facts stated above to foresee that , in the future , the New England district , including , as we have done , the region about the St. Lawrence , is to be the seat of the most varied occupations . No other part of the United States so well combines the conditions for maritime , agricultural , mining , and manufacturing labor as this territory . Further variety in the life to come is insured by the remarkable mixture of races in this territory . In Nova Scotia we have perhaps the largest body of Highland Scotch outside of the mother country , and in this region where this blood is so little mingled with that of other lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In lower Canada there are several large settlements where the people are almost entirely derived from northern France . New England proper has many areas where Irish Celts and their descendants outnumber the original New England stock . Here and there there are considerable colonies of other peoples , Scandinavians , Germans , and Portuguese . At present it seems likely that the peo // pies presumably of Celtic stock - the Irish , Canadian-French , and Highland Scotch-will , in another fifty years , greatly outnumber the original New Englanders . So far , however , the immigrants from continental Europe have in the main betaken themselves to the cities of New England and have shown little disposition to obtain control of the soil . The rural neighborhoods are still characteristically English , and , for all that we can see at present , bid fair to remain so for a hundred years to come . Although much of the strength of New England has gone West to found new States , enough remains to insure the perpetuation of the original stock , so that we may look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherein the towns will be largely composed of descendants of foreigners and the country districts of folk of English blood . South and west of New England we have another characteristic group of States in New York , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and Delaware , a region tolerably well marked by its conditions of surface and climate so far as those affect the development of man . In this district , which is about as extensive as the New England and Laurentian district above described , we have an area in which the maritime conditions are less pronounced , the agricultural resources-as determined by the soil and climate-proportionately more considerable , and the mineral resources very much larger than in the more northern realm . While in the New England section , practically , the whole of the surface is mountain built , and not more than one-third of the area is suited to agriculture , in the New York district , as we may term it , the mountainous sections occupy not over onethird of the total area , and the soil is , on the whole , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly those which are applied to the production of power-coal , petroleum , and natural gas are the staples of its geological wealth . Including a small portion of Ohio , we have in this section the largest store of these materials that is afforded by any equal portion of the earth . On the other hand , while the power derived from ancient sunshine and stored in the form of carbon in the rocks is more plentiful in this district than in New England , the immediate energy of water-power , due to the heat of the present day , is less available than in New England . Except at Niagara Falls , where there is a vast , but as yet unusable store of river energy , this district , owing to the relative thinness of its glacial accumulations and the consequent impermanence of the rivers , presents no such advantages to the manufacturer as are afforded by the New England streams . In general , the physiographic conditions of this group of States afford the basis of a very varied life . The different forms of activity are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . The natural manufacturing centres are widely distributed , and the mineral resources lie well in the body of the tillable land . South of New Jersey and Pennsylvania we have a somewhat characteristic group of commonwealths , including Virginia and the Carolinas . This , which we may call the Virginia group of States , differs in many ways from the two northern associations which we have just considered . The first and most important peculiarity consists in the character of the soils . The whole of New York and a large part of Pennsylvania and New Jersey have had the character of their soils determined by the peculiar grinding of the surface and distribution of the waste which was brought about by the glacial period . Although a trace of this ice action is observable in Virginia , the region as a whole was substantially un. - affected by the tread of the marching ice . This difference leads to a great modification in the character of the soils . In place of being the product of that distinct carriage which has brought the soils of the glaciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States is covered by an earthy coating derived from the immediate decay of the rocks beneath the surface . The Appalachian Mountain system , in its two elements of the Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies , widens as we go southward from the Potomac . The result is that an even greater share of these States // consists of moantainous elevations than we find in the New York group . The western portion of each State is occupied by heights which rise so far above the level of the sea that the climate is greatly affected by the uplift . These mountains are , however , far less sterile than those of the New York and New England districts ; not having been swept over by the ice , they retain their original soils and thus afford larger areas for tillage than are found in the more northern highlands . In each of these States , by way of contrast with their upland districts , we have along the shore a broad belt of lowlands , territories which were , until very recent times , beneath the level of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey southward , widening as we go toward the equator , affords , compared with the mountain districts , the sharpest contrast of conditions which are found in any part of this country . Owing to the slight elevation of the plain region , its nearness to the Gulf Stream , and the protection which the mountains afford on the northwest , the climate becomes very much warmer on this plain as we proceed southward . Between dawn and dark of a winter 's day we can journey from the frigid conditions of New York to the semi-tropical climate of Charleston-from the realm of frost to one of flowers . With a shorter journey from the mountainous heights of the western Carolinas , which have a winter temperature about as low as that of New York , we may pass toward the sea through the same range in temperature conditions . This contrast in climate is equalled by that between the under-earth resources of these two sections . In the mountainous portion of these States of the Virginia group we have an abundance of mineral wealth , the search for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zinc , and various other substances of economic importance abound in the upland portion of this area , while the lowland parts have as yet afforded but small supplies of such materials , phosphates being the only geologic element of any importance . It is evident , therefore , that the plainland region of this district is to develop purely agricultural industries , while the upland section , by its admirable combination of soil , noble forests and mineral resources , is to have more varied industries , and therefore a more diversified life . Although within the above-mentioned States the resources of fossil fuel are limited , we find , immediately on the west of the district , and everywhere convenient to it , the vast coal measures of Tennessee , Kentucky , and West Virginia fields , which afford bituminous coals quite equal to those which have been the foundations of the commercial industries of Great Britain . Thus , this region of southern uplands has in its soil , its forests , and its mineral resources , a combination of advantages perhaps greater than those of any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favoring conditions the region possesses an admirable climate . In winter the temperature falls low enough to insure the preservation of bodily vigor ; in summer the heat is less ardent than in the lower-lying regions of the New England and New York group of States . In the Virginia section we find a climate resembling in its range of temperatures those which characterize the most favored regions of the Old World , and it is there perhaps we may look for the preservation of our race 's best characteristics . The lowland country , on the other hand , appears to be too warm to afford the most satisfactory conditions for our people . Although the whites appear to be able to work in the fields during the summer season , the malarious influence common to a large part of the territory , as well as the lack of a really tonic winter , does not promise a brilliant future for European peoples in the seaboard portion of the district . The population of this group of States is as diversified as their physical conditions . In the lower-lying lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , physically , the most successful portion of the population . In the plains between northern Florida and Chesapeake Bay the negro finds apparently the most satisfactory environment which this continent affords him . His contacts with the whites are sufficiently close to stimulate his languid industrial // motives , and the climate fits his needs m a very tolerable way . It is doubtful if the tribes of Africa , from which our blacks came , are in any better physical condition than their descendants on the Atlantic coast . Although the negroes constitute the largest element in the population along the shore-lands of the Carolinas and Georgia , the upland section is almost devoid of Africans . This peculiar feature in the distribution of the blacks was brought about , as before remarked , by the unfitness of the upland country for the crops on which the plantations of the South depended . It has been maintained by the disinclination of the negro to dwell in cold countries and the indisposition of the white population to tolerate their presence . There is good reason to believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the South than it is at the present time . On the contrary , it is most likely that they , will spontaneously gather to the warm lowlands , leaving the cooler grounds to the white race . If this be the case , if the Southern mountains are left to the whites , we may reasonably expcct this region will become one of the most important seats of an unmixed American population . It is not in the pathway of immigration ; as yet it is occupied almost altogether by the descendants of British immigrants . South of Georgia we find ourselves at the base of the most singular peninsula of this country , if indeed it be not the most remarkable mass of land on the borders of any continent . The peninsula of Florida affords the most distinct field in a physiographic sense of any part of North America . Including the northern portion of the State it has a length of about six hundred miles , an average width of near one hundred miles , and a total area greater than that of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all this great realm the maximum height above the level of the sea does not exceed about four hundred feet . The whole of the soil is composed of materials recently brought together on the sea-floor . About onefourth of the soil area is limy , due to the coral rock which underlies it . The remainder is nearly pure sand of an infertile nature . All the soil owes its value in the main to the wonderful climate which the region enjoys . The mineral resources of the Florida peninsula are of the most limited nature . Certain deposits of phosphatic rocks exist , apparently of sufficient richness to give them economic importance . From the point of view of geological values , it is perhaps the most absolutely sterile section of North America . Owing to its peninsulated form it has a shore line of more than two thousand miles in length ; owing also to the vanous system of harbors which the coral reefs have created , this region has a maritime character and fitness of contact with the sea which is not enjoyed by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The harbors , though shallow , afford tolerable protection to small vessels , and the extraordinary wealth of fish in the waters make it certain that in the future this region is to have an industry resting upon the harvest of marine life such as is afforded by no other section of the Atlantic coast . Not only do the food fishes abound , but the waters afford vast quantities of sponge , and the species of marine turtles find a better station along this shore than any other section of the continent . The physical conditions of Florida make it plain that this peninsula is to develop its life on the lines of agriculture and of marine industries . The agriculture is destined to be of a peculiar sort , gardening , in fact , rather than the ordinary field tillage . The tropical and subtropical fruits , the orange , the lemon , the lime , and tenderer sorts of vegetables may be easily reared and assure the agricultural possibilities of this district . It can never be a corn-bearing country , and the grazing industry is practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that this land is wrapped around by the seas , the summer temperature as well as the winter is insular in its character ; although at present the region is a prey to fevers , they seem due not to an essential u.nhealthfulness of the climate but to the bad sanitation . Even in the extreme south , on the Keys and // the shores of the beautiful Bay of Biscayne , the population appears to be very healthy ; the children are vigorous , extreme old age is frequently attained , and there appears to be an exemption from deadly malarial fever . We may best judge as to the climatal effect on man by the condition of the Indians , which is excellent . No portion of our aborigines appear to be in a better physical or moral state than the Seminoles of Florida . It is an advantage enjoyed by this section , which it shares with the highlands of the South , that the negro population is very small . Although the climate is one which suits the negro , the present industries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it likely that this race will be slow to take possession of the country . On the west of Florida and Georgia lie a group of States which face the Gulf of Mexico . Between western Florida and western Louisiana , and back to near the northern border of Alabama and Mississippi , we have a region of lowlands which derive their quality fropa their relations to the Mexican Gulf . The lowland portion of these States is , in its geological history , like the lowland section of the Atlantic coast . It is an old seabottom which has recently been elevated above the ocean . The soil , save along the banks of the rivers , is of only moderate fertility ; but it bears luxuriant forests and is excellently suited to the great staple cotton , on which the commercial development of the section has rested . Owing to the fact that these States lie at the southern end of the Mississippi Valley and are unprotected by mountains from the winter blasts , they are subject to great variations in temperature . The summer heats are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , on the other hand , is considerable , sufficient indeed to bring something of the tonic effect upon which our race is so accustomed to depend . The northern part of Alabama , as is well known , abounds in stores of coal and iron . In topography it is sharply contrasted with the southern portion of the State , and its wealth of mineral resources insures in that section a large manufacturing industry dependent on the materials from below the soil . The population of the States between western Florida and eastern Texas is , on the whole , a less satisfactory part of our American people , for the reason that the negro element is at present , and is likely , for all the foreseeable future , to have a greater place in this territory than it has in any other part of the United States . It is true that at present South Carolina abounds in blacks in an equal measure with Alabama and Mississippi ; but with the growth in population of the highland district of the former state we may fairly expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , in southern Alabama , in Mississippi and Louisiana , the conditions of the soil and of the climate clearly point to a vast increase in the number of blacks , without a proportionate gain in the European population . There is more danger of Africanization in this section than in any other part of the United States . North of the Gulf States , and thence to the great lakes , and westward to the Mississippi , we have the valley of the noblest tributary of the Mississippi , the Ohio , containing within its basin the northernmost portions of Mississippi and Alabama and a portion of western Georgia , North and South Carolina , a part of Virginia and West Virginia , the whole of Tennessee and Kentucky , and the greater part of Indiana and fllinois . Although the geographic limitations of this great basin are not sharp , they are sufficiently accented to make it one of the most characteristic divisions of the continent . This individuality is further affirmed , as we shall see , by its qualities of soil , climate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the exception of some parts of its headwaters , the upper Kanawha and the tributaries of the Tennessee , lies well within the broad trough of the Mississippi Valley . It is thus in the path of the great air movements from the Gulf of Mexico northward , and from the Arctic Sea southward . Atmospherically considered , it is like the other parts of the Mississippi Valley , a region of combat between torrid and frigid conditions . In the winter season the dominance of // polar winds brings a low temperature upon all parts of the area . In the summer-half of the year , the superior power of the tropical , northward-setting winds brings it into almost torrid heat . The range of dimatal variation , measured by the periods of seasonal length , is perhaps greater in this valley than in any other part of the continent . The surface of this region is essentially without mountains . Though the western tributaries of the Ohio rise in the highest land on the Atlantic side of the continent , the portion of the valley which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its area . The result is that nearly the whole of the surface is tillable . Probably not more than one-fiftieth of the total area is permanently unfitted for the uses of the husbandman . The soil of the Ohio district has been but little affected by glacial action . It is true that the ice in the most developed state of the old continental glaciers overlaid the greater part of the Ohio , touching ' the surface of Kentucky immediately south of Cincinnati , and occupying perhaps one-half of Indiana andlllinois , as weliaathos*partaof the hea&amp;waters7 of the Ohio which lie in Pennsylvania and New York ; but over the most of this district the ice was thin and the amount of glacially transported material much less considerable than in the normally glaciated districts of the north and east . As a whole , the soils may be classed as those of immediate derivation , those originating with the decay of the subjacent rocks . As the geological strata of the Ohio Valley vary greatly in their mineral constitution , the soils derived from them are naturally divided into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee a wide range of Silurian limestones , which by their decay afford soils of extraordinary fertility , those which give character to the wellknown blue-grass district . It is worth while to note in passing that this singular richness of the earth is due to the fact that in these limestones there are certain thin layers composed almost altogether of the remains of minute creatures which had the peculiarity of taking lime phosphate from the sea and building it at their death in the deposits formed on the old sea-floors . When elevated into land and subjected to the process of decay , these rocks afford , under the action of the atmosphere , soils of great fertility ; so we see that the fruitfulness of our fields may depend upon the nature of organic beings in the remotest past . Throughout the Ohio Valley , except along the margins of the streams where the soil has been brought to its restingplace by flood waters , we find everywhere sharp contrasts in the fertility of the soiL Already , although the history of the country extends back for but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been of great importance in differentiating the people . There is no greater contrast in any country between neighboring people of the same blood than that which exists between the so-called mountaineers of eastern Kentucky , who occupy the soil of sandy carboniferous beds , and those who dwell in the rich grass country of the central district of the commonwealth . The fertile soil of the limestone region has given abundant wealth to the inhabitants oithat region ; wealth has brought cultum and all the cir*uxastaLuces of a high civilization . The sandy *oilL giving little to tillage , the people have remained poor ; their contacts with the world have been slight , and they yet abide by their customs and intellectual development in the conditions of the eighteenth century . It is worth our while to go one step further and to note the effect of these diversities induced by differences of soil . When , in 1861 , it was to be determined whether Kentucky should go with the South or North , the question turned in the main on the occupations of the population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the slave element was large , and in general the voice of the people was for union with the South . Where the soils were thin the people had no interest in slavery , for they owned no negroes . Old frictions with the slave-holding portions of the State existed , and consequently the people of this sterile land were generally devoted to the Union . A soil-map of Kentucky would in a rud&amp; way- serve as // a chart of the politics of the people in this crisis in the nation 's history . If Kentucky possessed a soil altogether derived from limestone , there is no question but that it would have cast in its lot with the South . The mineral resources of the Ohio Valley have a somewhat singular distribution . From western Alabama around to the headwaters of the Ohio in Pennsylvania , we have a continuous belt of country abounding in coal and iron . Nowhere in the world , so far as it has been explored , is there any region of equal extent where these two substances , both of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important uses , are geographically so united . In the western part of the Ohio Valley , and separated from this eastern and southern section by a wide interval of fertile lands , lies the western coal field , extending from central Kentucky to central Indiana and Illinois . Taken as a whole , the area of the Ohio Valley has a more perfect association of fuel and iron resources together with those which are afforded by a fertile soil than any other part of the world . In addition to the supply of energy contained in the coal-beds tributary to this district there are two other sources of power accessible to the inhabitants of this valley-petroleum and natural gas . The deposits of petroleum appear to be in the main limited to a field occupying a portion of western Pennsylvania , western Virginia , and eastern Ohio , and to another smaller and less important district on the waters of the Cumberland River near the point where it crosses the division between Kentucky and Tennessee . Although the quantity of petroleum accessible at any one point in this valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained in the famous Caspian or Baiku field , the district is probably , all things considered , the most extensive source of supply of this substance which the world is likely to afford . The natural gas of the Ohio Valley appears to be far more considerable in quantity than that contained within any other equal area . Thus in this district we have three known sources of valuable subterranean energy - coal , petroleum , and natural gas-in more advantageous conditions , as regards quantity and nearness to fertile agricultural areas , than in any other region of the world . We thus see that the Ohio group of States has , from the point of view of its resources , singular advantages over any other part of the continent for the maintenance of a vast population engaged in industries , both those of the soil and those of the shop . Within a century the area occupied by these States is likely to contain a larger population than that which now exists in all English-speaking countries . Although this population is destined to be to a great extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country for an agricultural people exceeding in numbers the present population of the United States ; for , as before remarked , there is hardly any untillable land in its area , and except for the limitations which the necessary preservation of the forests put upon the extension of the tilled fields , ninety-eight hundredths of its area can be won to husbandry . There remains , in the part of the continent east of the Mississippi , another interesting district , which constitutes a singular physiographic unit . It is the basin of the Laurentian lakes , commonly known as the Great Lakes of North America . In this great district of inland waters we have an area situated so far north that the rigors of the climate limit the operations of agriculture to less than half of the year . The soils are throughout glacial in their character , of remarkable fertility , but more enduring to tillage than those which lie to the south of the glaciated country . This district includes the whole of the Canadian provinces of Ontario , the northern part of Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , a small part of the northern sections of Indiana and Illinois , and a portion of Wisconsin and Minnesota . Although the northerly site of this area gives it a short season for the growth of plants , the region near the lakes has the climate somewhat modified by these great areas of water during the time when they are not locked in frost . The northern portion of this // area , nearly the whole of the region north of the Great Lakes , and a considerable part of the Michigan peninsula is mountain-built , having been subjected to the disturbances attendant on the formation and growth of the Laurentian system . The elevations have , however , a small relief . In the Canadian section nearly , if not quite , one-half the surface is barren or of moderate fertility ; while perhaps nearly the whole of the district south of the Great Lakes is covered by tilled fields or luxuriant forests . The soils and the climate afford , on the whole , as favorable conditions for tillage as are found in the Scandinavian peninsula and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthplace of great peoples . The mineral productions of this area are extremely varied . Coal of valuable quality does not exist within its limits . There is a considerable area of carboniferous rocks in Michigan , but they have as yet given little promise of important contributions of fuel . Iron , copper , silver , the phosphates of lime and salt are the geological staples of this region . All these substances , both as regards the mass of the deposits and their purity , appear to have in this region a pre-eminence among all the fields of this continent . The distribution of these resources of the under earth and the variations of climate in this continental Mediterranean district , provide an ample basis for a great differentiation in the population . Thus western New York and the northern border of the Ohio States which come to the Great Lakes are destined to be agricultural communities with a certain share of manufacturing industry . These parts of this field are not to be the seats of mining . The same is true of southern Michigan and southern Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterility of its soils and the rigor of its climate , is not likely to be the seat of a considerable agriculture or of much manufacturing . It is evidently destined to be a region engaged in mining and in timber culture . The foregoing inadequate glance at the conditions of North America , east of the Mississippi and south of the region which is sterilized by cold , shows us that , despite the generally consolidated character of its geography , the variations of the soil , of climate , and of the under - earth resources are such as to insure the profound diversifying influences which come to man from his occupations . This measure of diversity will increase with each step in the advance of civilization.
