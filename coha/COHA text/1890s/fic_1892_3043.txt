In Macao . A Story from the " Grasshopper 's Library . " I was seated one pleasant day in the garden , which was given to the city of Macao by the Marcos family , near the grotto sacred to the poet Camoens , when a Portuguese priest came from among the wilderness of flowers and sat beside me . He spoke English with a pleasant accent and we read Bowring 's effusion together , as it is engraved on the marble slab nearby . Scarcely had we finished , and the father was telling me of Goa in India , when my uncle Robert came from beneath the great banyan tree and stood before us . The father jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rushed forward toward my uncle with a stilletto held ready for an upward stroke . Quickly my uncle drew a revolver and fired -- and the father fell dead at my feet . I To those who have been in Southern Europe and have seen the towns along the Riviera , the first view of Macao , as the steamboat approaches from Hong Kong , gives the impression of having been suddenly transported to the sunny Mediterranean . Were it not for the colour of the water , and the Chinese junks , Macao would indeed be a perfect representation of any of those lovely spots , as she lies along her crescent bay , from Mount Nillau to Mount Charil , defended by the frowning forts of Sam Francisco and Our Lady of Bom Parto . Beautiful as this picture is , it was doubly so in the brilliant sunset colouring of a certain March day , as the steamer slowly came to her wharf and the passengers stepped ashore beneath the blue and white flag of Portugal , in this , her farthest eastern possession . The houses with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with white stucco ornaments , now golden in the light , had a warmth of colouring well set off by the dark foliage of camphor and banyan trees showing above the garden walls . The few passengers soon dispersed , in chairs or on foot , leaving but one of their number upon the wharf . He was apparently expecting some one to come for him , for he refused all offers of assistance from the coolies and seated himself just outside the gate . American , of medium height , brown haired and tanned by a tropical sun , Robert Adams was as good a specimen of Anglo Saxon youth as England herself could boast of . He was the last descendant of a New England family , which had preserved its purity for three centuries as unmixed with continental blood as though the three centuries had been passed in the quiet vales of Devon , instead of in the New World with its broken barriers . For three years , after a successful college course , he had been in the only shipping house in Hong Kong which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the once flourishing China trade . A small fortune and a good salary , a constitution which even an Eastern summer could not break down , and above all , the heart of the girl he loved , were surely possessions which any king might envy him . Presently a neat bamboo chair borne by three liveried coolies came at a trot down the street , and being placed before this last of the passengers , carried him away into the darkness which , with the suddenness of the tropics , had fallen upon the city . The stillness was broken only by the noise of escaping steam from the boat and the regular patter of the barefooted chair carriers . When the chair had disappeared up the narrow , winding street , a Portuguese wrapped in a black cloak came from behind a wall , then by another way walked rapidly over the hill and down the other side to the Praya , arriving in front of one of the largest houses on that most beautiful promenade just as the coolies put down their burden . The oil lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Estrada Sam Francisco , where the bright windows in the hospital of Sam Januarius seemed to be the lake of lights into which this long stream flowed . No one was abroad , no steps sounded along the pavement except those of the sentry as he walked , and smoked , before the neighbouring residence of the Governor . Death at night and sleep in the day time are the characteristics of Macao . No one seems to work , play , sing , dance or even read unless the latter indeed may be done in what Alphonse Daudet calls la Bibliotheque des cigales . As Robert Adams stepped from the chair , the Portuguese came forward with outstretched hand saying : " What is the news Dom Robert in Hong Kong ? " " Oh , Dom Pedro , you came out so suddenly I thought I was attacked . No news , unless it is that the rector of St. John 's is to join me to the loveliest girl in Macao or the world , in just three weeks . " " I hope you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to-night , " said Pedro de Amaral with a laugh . " How , pray ? " asked Adams as they entered the now unbarred gate . " You were within three feet of the water , if you had fallen in , that would have disappointed him . Not ? Three feet is near . Not ? " " Yes , and the boiler might have burst , " replied Adams laughing . " Or more improbable yet the Portuguese government might have revived Macao , which would kill me with astonishment my dear Amaral . " Having entered the house he was followed by Dom Pedro , who bent upon him such a look of hatred as only the eyes of Latin races can give . The Portuguese turned to the right to his own apartments and Adams following a servant to the left , was soon in the dimly lighted library of Dom Luiz de Amaral the father of Dom Pedro . There were not many books on the shelves but a superb collection of Oriental swords and knives was arranged in the cases from which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poet Camoens and the other of Catarina de Atayde , his beloved , who died of grief at his banishment , hung on the wall ; the rest of the furnishings was of that cosmopolitan character which is sure to collect in the home of a European resident in the far East . " Ca n't you see me Robert ? " said a laughing voice of great sweetness from a corner of the study . " One would think that both your eyes had met the same fate that the right one of poor Camoens did in Morocco . " " My darling Priscilla how could I see you ten feet away from the light ? You know olive oil do n't give the brightest illumination . But its enough though . " " Do n't ! " " Just one , " and then a sound not unknown to many of us put a stop to the conversation . " Shall I leave the room children ? " came in merry tones from another corner and immediately an old lady came forward giving both hands to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put me into a pretty mess , " said Adams half annoyed , but laughing as he greeted the lady . " Do n't berate me before my face dear friend about my light , especially when you are so soon to take our brightest light away from us . " " Fairly trapped , Dom Amaral , " cried Adams laughing heartily at this third interruption . " And here is Dom Pedro dressed for dinner , " he continued as the younger Amaral entered the room . " I 'll be with you presently and have my eyes toned down to your Macao standard . " Being so constant a visitor , Robert Adams had his own rooms at Dom Amaral 's , where he found his bags unpacked and the clothes laid out by those deftest of servants , the Chinese . According to custom the dinner of Macao was served at the late hour of nine . Dom Luiz Diego de Amaral was one of the wealthiest Portuguese in the city , having , unlike most of his fellow citizens , investments abroad which brought him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left it a city of the past , of poverty and pride . Having in his youth married a Spanish woman who bore him one son , Pedro , he was left a widower before the age of twenty-five . Some years after , being in Boston where he then had large shipping interests , he took a second wife , Priscilla Harvey , and returned to Macao . Madam de Amaral 's only sister , wife of Captain Fernald had one child which was left an orphan at an early age by the drowning of both parents in Portsmouth harbour . This orphan , Priscilla Fernald , was taken to her aunt in China and became a member of the household of Dom Amaral . It was a strange transplanting for such a flower from the cold coast of Puritan New England to the tropical , Roman Catholic colony in the heart of heathendom . But the flower of so sturdy a stock remained true . It was long accepted by all , even by the maiden Priscilla , that young Amaral was to be her husband though nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small circle of Macao society , of which poverty and pride were the ruling features , became too dull for the young girl and her foster parents took her often to Hong Kong where she met with those of the outer world . In that hospitable society of the " city of the fragrant streams , " where the dinner table seems to be the only rendezvous , save a garden party now and then , a Tarrantella dance or a Government House ball , the fair Priscilla met young Robert Adams , a native of her far away and almost unknown home . The acquaintance blossomed into friendship and ripened into love . The lover was accepted , and now a courtship of two years was in three weeks to see them married . There were many disappointed youths and envious of Robert Adams , but all took their misfortune as in the way of the world , except young Amaral , who , in silence , had watched the course of events and now hated the happy suitor with all the fierceness of his Southern blood . That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy , light-hearted fellow , fell asleep without a sigh , listening to the waves as they broke regularly on the stone embankment before his window . In the room below , Dom Pedro walked until the early morning , no beating of waves could lull him to sleep , for his head ached and his eyes burned in the fever of jealousy . Thus he brooded over his loss till the sun gilded the hermitage fort of Our Lady of Guia . II . The following day was Sunday , the liveliest , or rather the only day with any life at all , in Macao , for the visitors from Hong Kong then go about the city sight seeing to be ready for the early return of the steamboat on Monday morning . A pleasant spot , and one not often molested by visitors on account of the somewhat toilsome climb required to reach it , is the church of Our Lady of Pehna on the summit of Mt . Nillau . Built in 1622 on this high point to be more easily protected from any possible invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the church serves now only as an addition to the picturesqueness of Macao , and though repaired in 1837 is again in ruin . Priscilla and her affianced chose this for their Sabbath walk , for it is only through nature that the Protestants in Macao can worship nature 's God , and surely the incense of flowers could bear to Him on high the thanksgiving of those two happy hearts , as truly as the frankincense and myrrh which the good Fathers of the last century burnt upon Mt . Nillau . The narrow but well paved streets with their stuccoed houses , barred windows and little peep-holes at the doors , for questioning the doubtful applicants for admission , even the two months old posters of Chiarini 's circus had a new charm this Sunday morning ; for Adams it was a day of quiet after his week of noise and bustle in Hong Kong , while for Priscilla it seemed a gala day full of life after the six silent days of sleepy monotony . " I can see that Pedro is not friendly toward you Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking during all the night and am sure he is planning something to annoy you , I know his ways so well . " " Do n't worry , Priscilla , Dom Pedro was probably troubled over some loss at the fan-tan table ; they say he won five hundred Mexicans last week and then lost that sum doubled . " " That may be so , Robert , but our approaching marriage is a great cross to him . It is hard to tell what Pedro 's thoughts are ; his eyes are like our Macao windows of isinglass and let very little light either way . " The winding road between ruined walls of gray stone , half covered with clinging ficus , spanned by broken arches , with here and there a fallen urn , led them through picturesque turns and by mossy steps to the foot of the huge black cross erected before the empty church . Neither spoke ; they did not care for words and the only expression which framed itself audibly was that oft repeated jubilate of health and youth , " How beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of almost the same shade as the sky , rose the White Cloud Hills ; lesser hills more distinct in waving outline lay before them ; then rocky promontories and islands with grotesque forms like the twisted dragons of Chinese embroideries , and the low stretch which marked the position of the wonderful city of Canton . On the yellow water here and there were junks with tanned sails and gay banners ; islands with graceful pagodas were seen , and the huge white cathedral of the near dependency of Taipa . Then in the foreground at their very feet was Macao , a feast of colour , red roofs , many-hued walls , green trees and brilliant gardens , beautiful as the jewel-set sheath of a Venetian dagger , with its poison and death-dealing wickedness hidden . Dom Amaral with his wife had gone to the new cathedral to services ; their well appointed chairs had scarcely left the court and the gates been bolted behind them when Dom Pedro came from his room . His face had changed greatly since the day before ; the loss of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale and thin . For the first time in his life he had spoken harshly to his valet , and that meek Celestial wore an expression of grief and surprise , for Pedro Amaral , whatever his faults , did not have the vulgar one of venting his spleen upon his inferiors , so that his lifelong servant was at a loss to account for the sudden change . Dom Pedro walked to the library and drawing the curtains behind him sat down before the cases filled with brilliant steel . Suddenly he looked away and picked up a book from the table , opening it at random but constantly his eyes reverted to the cases before him . Slowly his features relaxed and with a broken sigh he was about to replace the book when a small photograph card fell from its pages ; the face was that of Robert Adams , the book Priscilla 's " Common Prayer . " Like a flash the old lines came back in his forehead ; he went to the case and opening the glass doors , carefully took down a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wherein the influence of both India and Europe showed in the execution . The pressure of a button pushed out a grooved dagger which fitted so low in the sheath as to show only the head of its jeweled hilt . Dom Pedro removed the dagger , wrapped it in his handkerchief and then putting it in his breast pocket replaced the empty sheath in its old position . III . The government of Macao derives its greatest revenue from the licensing of gambling houses , and these form one of the principal attractions in the city to the European from Hong Kong as well as the native Portuguese and Chinese . Whatever fault the visitor finds , on moral grounds , with these houses he must admit the fact that they are quiet and orderly , while the picturesqueness of the life within them and that peculiar glamour which varnishes all that pertains to a great gambling hall where fortune shows herself directly face to face with us , has a charm which hides the immorality from even the most straight-laced Puritan . One of these houses was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played high or low according to the state of his finances at the moment . Dom Amaral , though himself a devotee of the fan-tan table , observed with fear this controlling passion of his son which he believed would some day destroy the comfortable fortune he had amassed with so many years of labour . Adams would have certainly preferred to spend the whole evening in the family circle , but Dom Pedro urged him with so much , and such unusual kindness to accompany him to the gambling house that he consented , and at about eleven o'clock the two young men left the Praya and walked into the town beneath the soft lights of the oil lamps . The streets were deserted as usual , here and there a policeman , hooded like a pilgrim , sauntered leisurely along , or the Chinese watchman with drum and clapper woke the echoes of the lonely ways warning thieves of his approach . The only illuminated houses were fan-tan houses and these presently became numerous ; now and then music was heard but not of a very seductive kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dom Pedro and Robert Adams went , climbing to the second floor by stairs bordered with shrubs in huge Chinese pots . The main playing room contained several tables or counters arranged along the walls , behind which sat the croupiers ; at one of these Dom Pedro stopped . On the table was a plate of metal divided into quarters of about a foot square by deep cut lines crossing it , each square being marked in Chinese characters indicating one , two , three and four . The croupiers rattled a pile of bright brass coins , with square holes in them , called cash ; then as Dom Pedro made a sign that he was about to play , the croupier drew away a part of them under a bowl and Dom Pedro placed his wager on number three . The croupier with a bamboo wand then counted out the remaining cash one at a time in sets of four , until finally there were but three left ; this being Dom Pedro 's number , he won the stakes . " In good luck to-night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is a lucky day for you . " Robert Adams placed his money on the same square which Dom Pedro had won from , and again the croupier counted the remainder slowly , having drawn away some of the cash under the bowl , four at a time until but two remained and Adams ' stake became part of the bank . " Lucky in love , unlucky at play " he said with a laugh , " I shall bet no more to-night . " Dom Pedro 's face darkened but in silence he continued winning at every count . Above the table was a square hole in the ceiling opening into an upper room where those could sit who did not wish to be seen , and were thus able to let their bets down in a little basket and with the same draw up their winnings . This upper room being purposely kept in half light enabled its occupants to see those below without being seen themselves . Dom Pedro 's luck was astonishing and quite a crowd of onlookers gathered about . Robert Adams growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , left , saying that he would walk slowly as far as the ruined cathedral of St. Paul and on his return step in again . As he stepped back from the table he looked up toward the opening in the ceiling where were two women with faces wrapped in black silk robosas , which showed only the eyes ; as the eyes seemed fixed upon him he raised his hat . The action seemed to cause the women considerable consternation , for both hurriedly sprang back from the rail and in doing so one let fall , upon the table below , the basket with a bit of paper and several Mexican dollars which rolled about the room . Everyone looked up laughing at the accident but no one from above claimed the money . Adams left the room glad to be in the fresh air under the clear , starlit sky . No more lonely or picturesque ruin ever existed than the church of St. Paul ; though human habitations crowd close upon it , they are however the houses of Chinese and make the Christian edifice seem the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of architecture so common in new and old Spain , which always brings to the mind of the wanderer in foreign lands the name of good San Xavier . The half moon had risen high enough to illuminate the whole front as Adams climbed the broad , massive steps to the paved space before it . Leaning against the heavy balustrade he enjoyed the picture . The shadows were deep and through the sightless windows shone a few silver stars . The magnificent front of solid granite with graceful scroll-work and carved outline , blackened here by smoke and there by age , with vines and trees growing from crevices , stood in wondrous beauty . The detail showed clearer than by day ; the panels in high relief , of full rigged ship , the double dolphin and the skeleton seemed too fragile to have stood through earthquake and typhoon and the conflagrations of war for more than two hundred years . The exquisite frieze composed of many unconventionalized flowers extending across the front , wherein the artist and worker had been one , was a petrified garland . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had viewed and sketched the ruin , he had never been there by moonlight when its beauties were enhanced and its defects hidden . He could see plainly each Chinese character upon the carved scrolls and the words " Mater Dei " above the doorway . Slowly the shadows crept along , making the six broken saints in their niches seem alive ; slowly the shadows upon the ruin crept along , but a swifter shadow suddenly came forward from the steps and Adams having forgotten , in the entrancing scene the murderer and thief who lurk in all Macao 's corners , turned as he heard a soft step , just in time to receive in his right arm the upward blow of a dagger aimed at his side . He lost his balance falling backward down the steps , striking his head upon a heap of broken roof-tiles where he lay insensible . As he fell , a woman 's scream pierced the night . There was hurried tramping of sandaled feet , as of a dozen or more coolies . The shriek was again heard and then all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after the attempted assassination of Robert Adams was treated to a sensation such as had not been its experience since the memorable day in 1848 when the old Governor de Amaral lost his head at the Porta de Cerco . Murder , attempted or accomplished , could not have stirred them up to such an extent , for that was too common an occurrence , but the mystery of the event was the cause . Priscilla Harvey and her maid with one of Dom Amaral 's most trusted men servants had disappeared as completely as though the earth had swallowed them . Robert Adams , since the night of the attack had not recovered his senses , and lay in the house of Dom Amaral apparently between life and death . The surgeons from Sam Januarius hospital had decided that to save him , the amputation of his arm would be necessary , for the dagger which had cut it had been poisoned . In the midst of this trouble , Priscilla 's absence was discovered , and Macao was alarmed . Men were sent from the Governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fishing boats , and every possible place within the small territory . Word was sent to Taipa . While the officials were thus employed , private parties of searchers went over the entire peninsula looking among the rocks and copses of the Estrada and even the Parsee Tower of Silence was examined , but all in vain . The fan-tan house proprietor told of two unknown women with a Chinese servant who had visited his house , but when they had left he did not know . No more was learned though the search still continued , for large rewards were offered by Dom Amaral as well as by the Governor . Dom Pedro directed the movements , taking greatest interest in all that seemed possible to form a clue , and did not rest for nearly forty-eight hours . Days soon formed a week but no news came , and Macao began to drowze again . Detectives from Hong Kong came , made the usual fuss and reached the usual conclusions of their kind , that it was a mysterious event . Contrary to all predictions Robert Adams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost his arm having proved successful when having heard the awful news , did not have a relapse into the fever but seemed with a determination to become more rapidly strong , and in five weeks was able to be about . He , of all Priscilla 's friends , was most hopeful . To his mind vividly came the scene at the Ruins of St. Paul and that last sound he had heard . Adams ' first walk was to the scene of his attempted assassination and Madam de Amaral , who was much broken with grief at the terrible event , accompanied him in her chair , Dom Pedro going with them . It was the month of May and the heat being oppressive Madam d'Amaral after viewing the scene was carried home and the two young men walked on to the Marcos garden . " I have a clue Dom Robert , " said Dom Pedro as they seated themselves beneath a broad banyan tree from which a view of St. Paul 's ruin could be had . " There began your troubles , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper which will I hope lead to a solution of this mystery . " He handed Adams a bit of Chinese paper on which was written in Portuguese , " Come to the Praca de Luiz de Camoens at 8 A.M. to-morrow ; follow the guide who meets you , and the lady Priscilla will be found . " " I do not trust anonymous communications , " said Adams , " but we must clutch at a straw now . " " Nor do I , " replied Dom Pedro , " and I will go with you ; we will go well armed . " Adams glanced down at his own empty sleeve and a cruel smile passed over the face of Dom Pedro as he noticed his comrade 's pain . The 22nd of May will be long remembered in Macao and never forgotten by the family of de Amaral . Early in the morning Robert Adams was up and impatiently waiting for Dom Pedro , who appeared a little before eight o'clock and the two , after a hurried breakfast , went to the Praca de Luiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him to the shore where a sampan was waiting in which they seated themselves and were soon gliding rapidly toward a huge junk of fine build which lay at anchor some distance beyond the Portuguese man-of-war , in the direction of Taipa . The tide was very low and the vessel did not seem far from shore . The Sampan reached and made fast to the junk , and Adams followed by Dom Pedro climbed upon the deck . Quick as a flash Adams ' arm was seized and bound to his side while Dom Pedro stepped before him . " Fool ! " he cried , " you have stepped into the trap with little trouble . It was I who stabbed you , Dom Robert , it was I , who took the bride who rightfully belonged to me , as it is I who will use you for my own good till I may throw you away . You of Northern blood are fools . " " I thought you my friend , Dom Pedro , and I thought you a man , " was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish , such as is seldom seen , and kept scrupulously clean . The men at work on deck , with usual Mongolian nonchalance , went about their business without giving the least notice to the events occurring . " The lady Priscilla waits you in the cabin , " said Dom Pedro . " She knows my plans and though I shall not intrude upon you I have a Chinese on guard who will kill you if any attempt is made to free you . Enter . " Adams stepped toward the cabin at the stern , where the usual shelf-like arrangements of a junk had been transformed into a cabin suited to European taste , with comfort and luxury . Adams entered and the door was closed . By it stood a guard with drawn sword ; in the farther corner sat a woman at a table with her face buried in her hands . " Robert , as you love me stay where you are . Do not move a step , but sit down where you are . " Her voice was so full of pleading that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know all that has occurred dear Robert , your sacrifice and pain and the pain of all my friends during these sad weeks . Do not move toward me or you will be killed . I will not look up , dare not look up . On that Sunday , which now seems so long ago , when I bid you good-night at the library door , when you and he went to the fan-tan house , I followed you with his valet and my maid , for I had been fearful of his intentions toward you , and when his valet told me that he had seen him secrete a dagger in his coat that morning , and when I found one missing from the case , I had my fears confirmed . We followed and sat in the floor above you and tried to call your attention . When I won at the table at last I put in a warning note and then overturned the basket . You did not see the paper but he did , and read it . For the rest , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible followed both , but only in time to see you fall and to be seized and carried away in a closed chair to the yellow house in the Marcos square where , till yesterday , I have been confined to the court and inner rooms , with only my maid as company and a daily visit from him at which I learned the news of your progress toward recovery . Last night we were removed to this vessel , and I have expected your arrival with hope and fear . His idea is to force a marriage with me by threats against your life , or to sail for Hainan or Formosa and accomplish his designs where law and justice for us are unknown . " Hurried cries from the deck and a call at the door in Chinese were heard and the guide sheathing his sword rushed from the cabin . In a moment the lovers were together . The bonds which held Adams ' arm were cut and Priscilla pointing to the little window cried , " Robert , God is with us ! " With his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently a strong gale had suddenly sprung up from the south east and rain was falling in torrents ; the wind continued to increase though the rain passed by , but in the distance appeared a dark tower of water slowly moving toward Macao , rushing with bending , changing outline from water to sky . The gale became fiercer and the tumult on deck increased . Immediately from Taipa came the sound of cannon and it was answered by Macao with her heaviest ordnance as if a battle were raging , and , indeed it was a terrible battle , one between man and the elements , but man was victor and the water spout was broken . The force of the tornado however had yet to reach its climax and for fully five minutes swept over the terrified city and bay with fearful power . Sampans and junks were hurled like egg-shells upon the shore , where but for the low tide , thousands instead of hundreds of lives would have been sacrificed . The men-of-war and the river steamboats did good service , for the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards from its limit of violence they were untouched . Dom Pedro 's junk with others was torn from its moorings and overturned , but not before Adams and Priscilla had jumped from the deck . Even in the awful confusion and the terror of the first plunge which carried them below the surface of the angry waves , she kept her hand clasped upon the empty sleeve of her recovered protector . Being both good swimmers they assisted each other with that knowledge of the water and the trust which all coast born people have in the mother sea . A boat from one of the war vessels picked them up and in a short time they were both beneath the roof of good Dom d'Amaral , and rumor with unusual tread , but suited to Macao , slowly announced the fact of Priscilla 's return . Dom Pedro weak , and with a broken arm , was also carried to the house of his father and none but the principal actors in the tragedy understood the mystery . Priscilla had returned in the midst of the tornado , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostrated by the terrible experiences through which she had lately passed and lay as if lifeless . The physicians dreaded an attack of fever would follow , and their worst fears were realized . Several weeks went by in anxious watching by the sick woman 's bedside when at last the fever turned and she gradually grew better . Nothing was said of the occurrences which had brought the illness about , and Priscilla remembered nothing of them apparently , for she asked for no one and seemed happy and content to be left with her Chinese ama . When she had recovered strength enough to be carried into the court-yard it was with joyful expectancy that Adams went to greet her , yet his heart sank with sorrow when he saw the marks of the great suffering in her face and a terrible desire for revenge seized him , which became the dominant passion of his life . The saddest part of this tale may be given in a few words . Priscilla Harvey never regained her reason , though she found pleasure in all the beauties of nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Dom Pedro went to Hong Kong and soon disappeared . Robert Adams remained in Macao taking charge of the d'Amaral foreign business . He was the daily companion of the unfortunate Priscilla in all her walks and it was but a year after her death , when I visited my uncle Robert in Macao , when the tragic event occurred which is narrated at the beginning of this history . My uncle is near my own age and we are more like brothers and have been together , since the death of Dom Pedro at Camoen 's Grotto . The Courts of Macao exonerated Adams and though the good Dom d'Amaral would willingly have had him remain in the house at Macao it was not pleasant to think , that , even justified as he was , he had killed the only son of his host . It was early in the morning when we left the drowsy city ; the sun had just touched the windows of Sam Januarius , and as the river boat dropped into the stream , the church of Our Lady of Guia received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of love and loss , and the book closed . Perhaps it is just as well not to work , or play , or read except in " the library of the grasshoppers " as do my own good , sleeping friends in Macao . My Sapphire Ring . Where have I seen the sapphire rimmed with gold ? When on the dark blue Carribbean sea , Floating at sunset , dreaming lazily , I saw the God of Day the world enfold ; There did my eyes the sapphire rare behold . I saw the sapphire , when the day was young In royal Venice , as I lay and gazed Into the morning sky , and saw , amazed , Its deep hued brilliance , ere a bird had sung , Or Matin bells from San Stefano rung . Once when my course , with myriad sea-flowers strewn , Was o'er Formosa 's waves of purple dulse , Rising and falling like a fevered pulse , Moved by the hot and southern born monsoon , I saw the sapphire glow in tropic noon . But in our home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these treasures of the Earth , I saw the sapphire of far greater worth --  The first born friendship in your boyhood 's eyes --  Of which this ring as token now I prize . The Hen That Could Lay and Lie . I had the following story from the bill of an old Spanish hen , an inveterate cackler , who used to fly over the neighbouring fence and wander , with happy , self-communing clucks about my vegetable garden . " Yes young man you are young , you may feel bigger than I am , but you are not quite so tough , indeed toughness alone has saved me my life for a good many Christmas mornings . I am a tough old hen , I have seen the world ; I have traveled . You know the island in the Napa River just above the railroad bridge ? Well , I was wrecked there in my young days and it happened in this manner . " The spring of the year 18 --  was a wet one ; snow fell in the foothills and when it melted , the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our coop , ( I say ours as I had a husband then , ) stood near the bank , and the rising water carried it away . I shall never forget the night . It was Billy 's last night on earth ; Billy was my better half , and a handsome , young cock he was , all the young pullets in the yard had yellow combs , from envy , the day we were married . Old Partlett with her brood of twelve ducks tried her best to get him , but Billy said he did n't think it was quite the most moral thing in the world for a hen of her age to hatch out ducks and it set a bad example to the young ' broilers ' who were growing up about us , so he declined her proposals with thanks and sent her off with her ugly-mouthed off-spring . Well , as I was saying , our coop was carried down the stream , Billy and I balancing ourselves on the upper roost and speaking words of comfort to cheer up each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , ' A life without hope is an egg without a yolk , a gizzard without gravel , ' and that night proved the words to be true . Suddenly down went Billy into the roaring flood . I can see his yellow spurs as he went under , and his clutching claws , those beautiful , shining claws that only walked the path of virtue , as far as I knew . Alas how I fluttered , I tried to crow for help but it was useless , I could no more do it than the hens of your genus can whistle . Billy went out forever . " How I remember his kindness now ; how he would find the best worms and grasshoppers and always call me to see them before he ate them , not as that old beast Cochin China does , who not even lets his wife look at the delicious morsels he swallows . " Billy is gone , so I will not regret him for he is probably chief crower in St. Peter 's hennery now . How Peter must blush when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his past sins . They say St. Peter has to keep all the dead cocks as a sort of punishment and reminder . " That night I pulled all the yellow feathers out of my tail , ( I have Cochin blood in my veins , ) and I have gone in black Spanish costume ever since out of respect for Billy . " By morning I was cast with the coop upon a deserted island ; there was nothing but a coarse grass that was eatable , but I was almost dead with hunger , and was about giving up in despair when a happy thought struck me , and , I laid an egg , which with a little grass made me a good meal . Each day I laid an egg and ate it , feeling that my life at least could be saved , though I must be forever without society , yet I thanked heaven that hens were made with such resources . Alas ! I began to notice that the eggs grew smaller each day and I felt starvation again taking me by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horrible ! Alone ! Why ? Can I not hatch these eggs , can I not raise a brood of little pullets who shall lay eggs for themselves and me ? Time passed and I brought from the shells eight little chicks , but alas they were all cocks ; poor me . What are they good for on a desert island ? They can not even keep themselves . Perhaps I had thought too much of Billy during the setting and that influenced the eggs . But my complaint was punished , for all of the brood were caught one day in the current and carried away . Poor , little , posthumous chicks , how your father Billy would have loved you and taught you to crow . Again I tried ; this time with more success and brought from the eggs six little , fluffy pullets . All lived and we took turns , off and on , supplying the family with eggs , till one day men passing in a row boat , saw us and took us aboard . We had been on the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , and are now in the yard over the fence . " All this time I had been so interested in the story , that I had not noticed the narrator who was in the midst of my lettuce bed busily pulling up the young plants . " Shew there ! What are you doing ? " I cried . Off she flew with a cackle of derision . Looking after her in astonishment and at my poor lettuce bed , I caught the eye of an old turkey , roosting in an apple tree ; he was smiling grimly . " So you have been taken in too , " he said , with a suppressed gobble . " You need n't believe a word of that tale , and if you knew anything about raising poultry you would have seen the weak point in her story . It was only to play on your sympathy while she made a meal of your lettuce . That old hen is one of the toughest confidence operators in the yard , and if you take my advice , ( and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye open for all black Spanish hens who have lost a husband . " I thanked the old fellow and came into the house , and since then have kept on the guard against widows of every genus , with better success than Mr. Weller the elder attained . " Oceanic " at Sea . What shall I sing of thee , my ship , Lone center of this orb of blue , Horizoned by the rosy light Of peeping dawn , and sleeping evening too ? Thou art the pupil , ship of mine , Which lights this round and azure eye , Rimmed by the rosy lids of dawn , And lost in sleep when evening rules the sky . ***
