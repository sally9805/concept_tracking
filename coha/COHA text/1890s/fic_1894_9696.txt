( He goes in and closes the door softly behind , then the sound of drawing a bolt . JIM leaps down from the porch . As he reaches the ground WESTON enters L. He is a good-looking man between thirty and forty  --  a selfish man , thinking only of his own pleasures , honest with men from habit , dishonest with women for the same reason . ) WESTON .

( Passes , snearing , and speaks as he moves with his back to JIM L.E . without looking around ) The first thing you know I 'll have the sheriff look after you as a dangerous character . ( Crosses R. and up to door . ) ( JIM grunts and slowly exits L. WESTON tries door  --  it is locked . Knocks  --  there is no answer . He knocks again  --  no answer . He whistles . ) RANSOM . ( Inside  --  confidently ) Is that you , Jim ? WESTON . It 's Weston . RANSOM . ( Disappointed  --  without thinking ) Oh , damn ! WESTON . What 's up ? RANSOM . Nothing !

By the way , be careful you do n't say anything before the girl  --  she does n't know the brute 's being strung up . It would hurt her tender little heart . We want to just let his memory and himself die out of her life . ( Far in the distance is heard men 's voices , singing the air of " Hang Jeff Davis on a Sour Apple Tree , " etc . This grows louder slowly as the men approach . ) There are the fellows now coming back from the lynching . I hope they wo n't meet her . WESTON . ( Looking up at RANSOM cunningly ) So you 're looking after the girl now . ( READY Shot R. ) RANSOM . ( Angry ) Do you mean an insult ? WESTON .

I mean to say that Tanner 's daughter is a child of God 's mountains  --  not of his blackguardian of your dance hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you had better pretend to believe that , too , if you want to come to this ranch . ( WESTON whistles . ) WESTON . But my dear man , you must acknowledge the way she lives  --  ( Interrupted . ) RANSOM . ( Interrupting ) Teddy went this morning to do his best to persuade her to come and live with us . WESTON . Here with two men ? RANSOM . I am drawing out the papers now which will make Midge legally Teddy 's sister . WESTON . Oh !  --  RANSOM . And , to finish , I am gradually losing my temper , Weston . Do n't make me lose it altogether . ( A rifle shot is heard R. ) There she is ! Hurrah ! Teddy 's brought her with him  --  WESTON . ( Depreciatingly ) What 's North shooting ? RANSOM . That was n't Teddy 's rifle . That 's Midge 's usual signal ,  --  she calls it ringing the front door bell . Have you been here a fortnight and do n't know she 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter , I 'll bet of the world ? ( The men singing have been coming nearer , and now they enter L. DAVE , JOE , PETER and four others . MIDGE enters R.U.E .  --  holds her rifle over her R. shoulder . They notice MIDGE and the singing suddenly stops . ) MIDGE . ( Very girlish  --  free in gesture and manner from the purity of her nature and her unconventional life . ) Hello , boys . What 's the matter ? Where 've you been to ? JOE . Where have we been to ? ( MIDGE R.C. with men L.C. A moment 's pause . The men hesitate to answer . ) MIDGE . ( Interrupting ) You 've been up to some lark now , ai n't you ? ( Men silent . Laughing ) I declare !

( Laughing , delighted ) Oh , well , I ca n't hit ' em all ! You , Joe . ( All but JOE drop their hats . MIDGE aims at JOE 'S hat and fires . JOE quickly takes it down to look , as the men also crowd around to see it , except WESTON and RANSOM , who are R. with MIDGE . ) JOE . Clean through the blamed middle ! ALL MEN . Hurrah for Midge ! MIDGE . That 's my card ! Now I 'll make myself scarce , so you all can have your run out ! I know  --  somethin ' not keyrect fur gals .

The boss is the fellow what we saw down the road this morning  --  PETE . Not that dude ! JOE . You want to call him that to his face once ! ( The others laugh and say , " Yes , go on ! Do !

Put all the amachure sluggers to sleep outside of Boston fur three years . PETE . Why in hell 's he dress like a fool , then ? WESTON . Ask him that once , too ! ( All the others laugh and say , " Yes , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in jest them same words ! ( With a slugging gesture . ) Dar'st  --  And when you wake your blessed mother wo n't know you !

We 've bring along a new boy , Boss , as wants to join  --  Pete Crane . ( Pushing CRANE forward . ) TEDDY . Glad to see you , Pete . Any friend of Joe 's is welcome !

I ai n't sure as this is exactly the gang for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with this gang ? PETE . Well , I ai n't no Prince of Wales , myself ! TEDDY . You object to my clothes ? Well , a good many of the boys stack up against them  --  or perhaps you do n't like the height of my collar ? Well , I wear that for two reasons : It conceals a monotony of neck and prevents anyone getting a half-nelson on you . ( Takes hold of PETE 'S neck . ) You seem to be in pretty good condition , Pete . I wo n't take any chances with you . ( Takes off coat and hat . ) Now , what 's it to be ? Catch-as-catch-can , on the ground , go as you please , or stand up ? PETE . Why , Boss , I ai n't got no right to take advantage of you . I never got licked in my life . TEDDY . ( Smiling , coaxing ) Well , you 're about due . ( Throwing off his coat and going to R.C. ) PETE . First man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty even  --  TEDDY . You 're on , Pete ! ( All the men push and urge PETE to go on  --  saying , " Go in ! You 're in for it ! " " Go on ! " PETE takes hold of his coat . The men make a semicircle , and there is a short bout , the men applauding , shouting and talking , and at the end of the contest , TEDDY throws PETE . The men applaud . PETE and TEDDY shake hands and put on their coats , etc . ) TEDDY . Nothing to it ! PETE . Well , Boss , I 'd like to wear one of them collars myself . TEDDY . That 's all right , Pete , but you 're a bad match-maker . Say , boys , I 've some news ! What do you think ? ( They all gather around TEDDY , including RANSOM , who re-enters at this moment . ) Midge has come to live with us for good  --  to-day . JOE . Three cheers for Midge ! ALL . Hurrah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing to all the law business so she 'll be just like my own sister . ALL . Hurrah ! Hurrah ! TEDDY . Boys , you 're bricks ! But say , there 's only one trouble ! We 've got to take a reef in our language with a young girl about all the time . ( PETE whistles loud . ) JOE . Right you are ! WESTON . This ranch 'll better adopt young ladies ' boarding-school rules . TEDDY . Do n't be an ass , Weston ! But be careful , boys , about your stories . Nothing strong when she 's around . JOE . ( Laughing ) Ourn ! That 's good ! Ourn are all Sunday-school books compared with yourn ! ( All laugh . ) TEDDY . Well , of course , I 'll set you a good example ! I 'm going to get up an entirely new repertoire ! Then there 's swearing . ( All titter . ) PETE . You ai n't a-going to gag us , are you ? JOE . ( With a wink to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another example there ? TEDDY . Yes , sir . JOE . The limit ! ( A general movement among the men of humorous despair at the idea of TEDDY 'S succeeding , and JOE shouts out , " The limit ! " ) TEDDY . Say , boys , I 'm not so bad as all that ! You see this box . ( Getting a square box about a foot square , made with a slit in the top from inside door R. ) That goes right there  --  ( Holding it to inside of house to R. of door )  --  and every time a fellow swears before Midge , down goes a quarter . Do you understand ? ( All laugh and say , " All right , Boss ! " etc . ) PETE . What do you call a swear , anyway ? TEDDY . Beginning with damn , everything that goes before and after  --  ( There is a nail on the wall and he hangs the box on it. )  --  and say , boys , that reminds me of a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Chuckling with laughter , the men come closer , eager to hear . ) It 's about a young married couple who took the Hudson River night boat on their wedding tour to go to Albany . The girl  --  ( At the words , " young married couple , " MIDGE has entered and comes slowly forward , till the last words , " The girl  --  " JOE sees her . ) JOE . As h  --  ( JOE stops blank , with his mouth wide open , and there 's a moment 's awkward pause . ) TEDDY . Hello , Midge . MIDGE . Hello ! Go on . I like jokes on young married folks . TEDDY . Oh , damn it , Midge  --  ( Interrupted . ) ALL . Aye ! aye ! A quarter , Boss ! A quarter ! TEDDY . Ouch ! ( MIDGE does not understand and TEDDY rises solemnly and feels for a quarter . Finds a dollar . ) Say , Joe , got change for a dollar ? ( JOE feels for his money . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . I 'll be sure to need them . ( Gives JOE the dollar for some change and crosses slowly to box . Bus . of change . ) MIDGE . What 's this ? Missionaries ? TEDDY . ( Laughing ) Well , I 'll be damned if it is n't something like it . ALL BOYS . ( Laughing ) Put in two ! Put in two ! TEDDY . By  --  ( He stops just in time and drops in two quarters . ) Say , I guess I 'll have to keep this box just for myself , and get another one for you boys ! RANSOM . It 's just occurred to me , Teddy . Who keeps the key ? TEDDY . ( Takes a key from his pocket and gives it to MIDGE ) My sister , Midge . MIDGE . Dear old Mr. Teddy ! ( MIDGE on steps . ) TEDDY . Brother Teddy  --  from now on ! MIDGE . But what 's it fur ? The box ? TEDDY . Well , I should judge it was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( All laugh . ) MIDGE . But when it 's full  --  ( Interrupted . ) TEDDY . ( Interrupts ) I 'll fill it in a week ! ( All chuckle . ) MIDGE . ( Continues ) What will I do with all the money ? TEDDY . Whatever you like ! ( Goes down stairs . ) MIDGE . ( Speaking in a queer little fine and high , mincing voice ) Oh , I know . I 'll have a big supper for all the boys , and have the Silverville Band play . Some one race with me to Dead Man 's Well ? A prize if he gets there five minutes ahead of me ! ( All laugh at her voice . She runs like a flash off stage L. with a second glance at JOE . ) TEDDY . Go on , Joe ! That prize is meant for you . RANSOM . Come ! I 'll run you for it ! ( Both men run off L. ) TEDDY . Boys , there 's more than one prize in that running ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) WESTON . ( Coming down C. ) Oh , damn ! What chance can poor Joe have against an educated chap like Ransom ? TEDDY . ( Going up to WESTON and taking him by the ear ) You said damn it !

Get the quarter  --  WESTON . ( Shouting ) Not fair ! ( All the men in a tussle . They get a half-dollar out of his pocket and force it into his hand . ) That 's a half-dollar ! TEDDY . Is it ? ( One holding his arm out , they lead WESTON to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with constant laughter and talking . ) WESTON . ( Half mad ) It 's a cheat  --  TEDDY . We 'll call it two payments in advance . ( DAVE and PETE cross over to U.L. ) PETE . Hello , there 's some-un comin ' over the Niagary Pass by the cannon and it ai n't safe since them boulders fell  --  ( Calls with his hands to his mouth ) Hello , there ! Take care ! Not safe ! DAVE . He ca n't hear you from here ! ( All have turned with curiosity and are looking off L. ) WESTON . ( Down R. ) It 's a woman ! DAVE . Damned fool ! PETE . She 's all right .

Ta , ta , boys ! I 'm off ! ( Jumps off piazza and off quickly R.I. ) PETE . Say , he ai n't very struck on his wife , is he ? JOE . Nor her on him , not as I blame her . ( JOE lays on rocks L. ) PETE . Exactly ! Nor me , neither , if what they say at the camp is true  --  nothing in pants but what 's good enough for her to flirt with . DAVE .

( Off L. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here she is ! MRS . WESTON . Wo n't somebody come and help me dismount ? ( At that same moment everybody except TEDDY makes a leap off the porch and off L.U. The reply to her call is made so quickly and so eagerly , in fact , that it becomes a concerted movement . TEDDY watches them go . MRS . WESTON laughs merrily . ) TEDDY . Will she miss me from among them ? Bah ! She always guys the life out of me ! ( Shouts of " Hurrah ! " from all the men and shouts of " Bravo ! " from MRS . WESTON as they join her . TEDDY shrugs his shoulders and says , sort of hopelessly , and yet half laughing at himself ) Miss me ! It sounds like it ! Damn it ! I do n't even exist for her !

Good morning , Mr. Ransom  --  and greeting to your Royal Highness ! ( With a low curtsey to TEDDY , who is terribly embarrassed . ) TEDDY . Good morning ! MRS . WESTON . I offer my hand to Your Majesty to kiss ! ( Holding out her L. hand , which is bare  --  notices clothes , looks him over from head to foot . ) Dear me , another suit on to-day ! And what a suit !

Why would n't you come to meet me with the others ? ( She looks him over . ) Oh ! I see  --  afraid of spoiling your boots ! ( All men laugh good-naturedly . TEDDY looks at her for moment , grinding his teeth in his rage , so as not to swear or say something he will regret , turns on his heel and goes into the house without a word . ) Is n't he splendid ! No woman could have held her tongue ! RANSOM . But why are you so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I ca n't help it . It 's the old Nick in me that will out ! Go bring him back , Midge .

Perhaps it amuses him as much as it does you ? MRS . WESTON . But what does he do among all you big strong men ? I should think he 'd be afraid of you ! ( Laugh . ) RANSOM . ( Amused ) Oh , would you ? MRS . WESTON . I suppose he 's the ranch " baby " as you all coddle and spoil him ? RANSOM . ( Still amused ) You do n't know him ! MRS . WESTON .

( Holding out his hand . ) MRS . WESTON . ( Takes his hand ) Never again ! TEDDY . ( Dropping her hand quickly ) Oh , I do n't exactly mean that , either ! MRS . WESTON .

She also brings a box of tobacco . ) MIDGE . Here 's the things . ( She places them on chair near C. ) MRS . WESTON . And I hope I 'll have better luck this time ! ( Takes a seat near the chair with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage ; light them during the following scene between TEDDY and MRS . WESTON . ) TEDDY .

I remember perfectly  --  you made eyes at me and embarrassed me so I did n't know what I was doing . TEDDY . You  --  embarrassed by me ! I embarrassed you ? Well , I 'll be  --  ( He stops himself short with a look at the box on the wall . ) MRS . WESTON . You will be , I 'm afraid , some day ! TEDDY . Saved a quarter  --  that time , boys  --  ( All laugh . She begins shaking the cocktails , first pouring in glass of whiskey . ) MRS . WESTON . What I came over for was to ask you all to a dance at the hall in Silverville . ( Sugar . ) MIDGE . Molly Larkins ? ( Whiskey . ) MRS . WESTON . Some time from now , to be sure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving up her place to you-uns alone , be she ? MRS . WESTON . Yes . Weston had some difficulty persuading her . He 's been over every day , and yesterday she consented . PETE . I 'd seed he was there every day . MRS . WESTON . Oh , very likely Miss Larkin herself was some attraction ! You know my Weston ! I shall have some New York friends visiting me , and I want to show them everything  --  including Mr. Teddy ! ( With a mischievous look and smile at TEDDY The shaker is full of whiskey . ) TEDDY . Excuse me , but the cocktails ' r ' all whiskey this time , to counter-balance the vermouth day , I suppose ? MRS . WESTON . ( Holding up the shaker and seeing that it is full ) Oh , dear ! How stupid of me ! ( She looks around helplessly . ) And there 's nothing to pour all this extra whiskey into ! TEDDY . Oh , yes , there is ! There 's Joe ! He can hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Holding out one of the tumblers ) " Never say die ! " MRS . WESTON . ( Pours out half as she talks , and JOE , when she finishes , gulps it down at one gulp . MRS . WESTON fills the shaker with vermouth . ) You must all come to the dance with your ranch things . No man admitted in his " store clothes . " I do n't want any make-believe ranchman around ! There 's a blow for you , Mr. Teddy ! TEDDY . But it wo n't " kill father " ! I have n't said I was coming ! MRS . WESTON . Oh , but you must , and you can borrow some real clothes of Joe  --  ca n't he , Joe ? ( JOE is very much taller and very much bigger than TEDDY . ) JOE . Yes , ma'am  --  suttenly  --  if he 'll promise not to stretch them ! TEDDY . Oh , if I come I 'll wear Joe 's clothes with pleasure . ( All laugh . ) MRS . WESTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise . MRS . WESTON . We women are going to pay you for the compliment by appearing in our very smartest frocks  --  JOE . Hully gee ! TEDDY . ( As MRS . WESTON starts to put on the cover of the shaker ) Excuse me  --  the ice ! We had some here a week ago Thursday . ( He picks up the golf coat and unrolls it , and finds a small piece of ice . ) MRS . WESTON . Shall I put it all in ? TEDDY . Yes , let 's be reckless ! ( They put in the ice and MRS . WESTON shakes the shaker . TEDDY kneels at her side , R. , hat off . ) MRS . WESTON . I expect you to dance the whole evening , while the other men are making love to the girls in the moonlight . TEDDY . A nice warm prospect for me ! ( MRS . WESTON laughs . ) And where will you be ? MRS . WESTON . I ? Oh , of course , out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( She pours out the drinks . TEDDY tries to speak back , but is so angry he ca n't . He glares at her a moment , opens his lips to speak , but no words come . He grits his teeth , then turns and goes straight to the box on the wall with his back to the audience . He raises both hands above his head , with clenched fists and the gesture of a violent oath , and then deliberately drops in a quarter which is heard to fall . Big laugh . The scene is played without a word , and during it MRS . WESTON has poured out all the drinks . ) TEDDY . ( Coming back and noticing MRS . WESTON is pouring out the cocktails ) I beg your pardon , but did you remember the bitters ? MRS . WESTON . Oh , what a shame ! I was getting on so nicely ! ( She begins pouring them all back into the shaker . The men are amused . ) TEDDY . Oh , never mind . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall make it all over . ( She takes up the bitters bottle and begins putting the bitters in . ) But I think it would have been more polite of you not to mention the bitters . ( The men at first do not take any particular notice , but as she keeps on putting the bitters in they show excitement and curiosity and then despair . She finally notices them . Big laugh . ) Now what 's the matter ? Have I put in too much ? TEDDY . Oh , no  --  no  --  MRS . WESTON . Never mind . It 'll do you good . Where 's the lemon ? ( TEDDY exits into the house as MRS . WESTON begins shaking again ; she sees him go and knows he goes for the lemon . ) You see , I have n't forgotten that ! Oh , I shall make famous cocktails in time ! ( Re-enter TEDDY with a tiny round , hard yellow ball , white in spots where peel has been cut off . MRS . WESTON begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer you the ranch lemon ! ( Offering it to her . ) Do you play golf ? MRS . WESTON . ( Taking lemon ) Thank you ! ( Laughing . ) I must send you some if you are so bad off as all this ! ( Gives it back to him . ) Wo n't you ? TEDDY . With pleasure ! ( Takes lemon and a knife which is on the tray , and with difficulty manages to cut off bits of lemon peel and put one in each glass as she fills it . ) MRS . WESTON . Mr. Ransom ! ( Giving him his cocktail . ) RANSOM . Thanks . MRS . WESTON . ( Giving PETE a glass ) Pete ! PETE . Thank you . MRS . WESTON . ( With a mischievous glance at TEDDY as she fills the next glass ) Do n't cut yourself ! ( He looks up at her , angry . ) What nice little hands you have , anyway ! TEDDY . ( Angry ) Mrs. Weston ! MRS . WESTON . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE . Thank you ! MRS . WESTON . ( To TEDDY ) Nice for kid gloves , I mean  --  and lawn tennis or croquette ! Do you play croquette ? ( Giving cocktail . ) Here , Dave ! DAVE . Thank ye ! MRS . WESTON . ( Continuing her speech to TEDDY ) But what in the world do you do with them out here ? ( MIDGE passes drinks to men . ) TEDDY . Mrs. Weston , you are  --  No , I wo n't say it ! I must n't forget there are gentlemen present ( With a movement toward the men . Men laugh . ) MRS . WESTON . ( Who has finished pouring out the cocktails , but has not left any for the last glass ) Oh , what a pity ! Again ! I thought I was measuring so carefully , and here I have n't left a drop for you ! TEDDY . ( Rising ) Excuse me , but that 's the only kindness you 've done me to-day ! MRS . WESTON . What ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ! I 'll share with you ! We 'll drink mine together . TEDDY . ( Delighted ) Out of the same glass ! Bully ! MRS . WESTON . Oh , no ! ( Pouring out half of her cocktail into the other glass . ) That way . ( Gives him glass . ) TEDDY . ( Disgustedly ) Thank you ! JOE . Here 's " How ! " Mis ' Weston ! MRS . WESTON . " How ! " ( They all clink glasses together  --  and all drink but MRS . WESTON . All can not help making a wry face over the bitterness of the drink . All " Ugh ! "  --  shuddering . They surround TEDDY and each head is moved emphatically with a whispered oath . Big laugh . They then go in a body to the swear-box and all drop in nickels at the same time . They come back , shuddering at intervals . ) MRS . WESTON . What 's the matter ? Was n't it good ? ( All make grimaces . ) TEDDY . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am ! Ugh ! ( He makes a face . ) MRS . WESTON . Then I sha n't drink any ! Here ! ( Giving her glass to TEDDY . ) I 'll be generous ! You shall have all mine ! ( Just as she gives the glass she takes it back to kiss the edge and then gives it to TEDDY . ) TEDDY . Thank you ! ( Smiling , drinks it . ) Delicious ! ( Men " Gee whiz ! " etc . ) MRS . WESTON . My dear Mr. North , you 're braver than I thought ! MIDGE . Well , you all hev my sympathies ! I ca n't swallow the best ! Whiskey 's good enough for me ! ( All men laugh . ) RANSOM . Midge ! Mrs. Weston will think you a toper ! MRS . WESTON . ( Rising ) Oh , no ! Midge has confided to me in secret that whiskey gives her the hiccoughs and the brandy " shivers " even before she tastes it ! MIDGE . ( Naively  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiend ! My pop jes ' lives on both of ' em . I 've heard folks say as how pop 's whiskey was the worst this side of the Rockies ! ( All laugh . Bus . of TEDDY giving different men orders up stage . ) MRS . WESTON . You funny little creature ! ( Putting her arm around her , she takes her to one side . ) Tell me , dear  --  are you all right here ? Will you be happy ? MIDGE . ( Aside to MRS . WESTON ) Oh , yes ! Awful happy ! Both of ' em 's so good to me ! MRS . WESTON . If you ever want a woman friend , come to me . I like you ! MIDGE . Yes , m 'm  --  I like you , too ! I 'm always telling the boys you ai n't half so bad as you seem . MRS . WESTON . ( Amused ) Oh , really ! Do you tell the boys that ? MIDGE . Yes , ma'am  --  your real , true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the rest of us . I know what a good time means to a girl . I could n't live without my rifle  --  and  --  Joe  --  ( Looking down . ) MRS . WESTON . Ah-ha ! Somebody 's been taking a shot at you with an arrow ! ( She shakes both hands . ) Remember , dear , I 'm your friend . MIDGE . And I 'm yourn ! ( TEDDY top of steps . ) MRS . WESTON . ( To the men ) Well , boys , will you all come to my dance ? JOE . I 'll answer for them , ma 'm , and the cove that wants to back out 'll hev to settle with me first ! MRS . WESTON . Thank you . That settles you , Mr. Teddy ! You ca n't desert me now ! ( TEDDY merely smiles and bows . ) Who 'll get my horse ready for me ? ( DAVE , PETE , JOE and RANSOM exit quickly . ) MIDGE . ( Going to MRS . WESTON ) Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . WESTON . Do n't be absurd ! Good-bye ! ( MIDGE takes tray into the house and arranges chair C. MRS . WESTON leaves porch . ) TEDDY . ( Following her ) You wo n't take the same road , will you ? It is n't safe ! MRS . WESTON . ( Laughing ) Oh , thank you for your advice , I 'm sure ! TEDDY . ( Earnestly ) But you 'll take it ? The advice , I mean  --  not the road ! MRS . WESTON . ( Smiling ) Oh , that 's quite another thing ! TEDDY . It 's dangerous , terribly dangerous ! MRS . WESTON . I 'm not afraid , Mr. North . TEDDY . But it was a miracle you escaped  --  even we go the other way . ( MRS . WESTON laughs . ) If your horse should stumble just the slightest , over you 'd go ! And it 's three hundred feet to the bottom ! Ask the men , if you wo n't listen to me . MRS . WESTON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they warn me , perhaps I 'll listen . But I like danger . Good-bye , my timid Mr. Teddy . ( She exits gaily . ) ( MIDGE goes to TEDDY . ) MIDGE . Do n't she beat the band ? But  --  do n't be afraid . They ai n't going to let her go back the same way . ( MRS . WESTON and the men are heard talking and laughing as she mounts . ) Why do n't you help her mount ? TEDDY . Humph ! You see how she treats me , Midge ! MIDGE . Yep . There 's times as it jes ' makes me hate her ! ( Coming down . ) TEDDY . ( Smiling ) You need n't do that , Midge  --  because , Midge  --  dear little sister  --  your fool of a brother loves her . MIDGE . I told Mr. Ransom so ! TEDDY . What ? MIDGE . And he would n't believe it . TEDDY . But how  --  MIDGE . Oh , a woman can tell . TEDDY . ( Smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss ? ( L. ) MIDGE . I do n't know exactly , ( R.  --  sits on front of steps . ) TEDDY . And how long have you been a " woman " ? ( Sits on R. ) MIDGE . About eight years . Since the first time as I found Pop drunk . Do you think Pop will miss me ? TEDDY . No  --  MIDGE . Do you think hell come here after me ? TEDDY . No . MIDGE . I do n't want him to , and yet  --  ( Her voice breaking . ) I 'm afraid he 'll be dreadful lonely . You see , even animals wo n't stay by Pop . He do n't know how to treat ' em . He bangs ' em around jes ' like he used to me , and you ca n't do that with animals and keep ' em loving you . I 'm sorter afraid  --  Oh , Mr. Teddy , perhaps I did n't ought to leave him ! TEDDY . ( Getting up from steps ) Do n't worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left you . MIDGE . ( Getting up from bank R.  --  brightening up ) How do you mean ? TEDDY . He 's gone away , far away ! MIDGE . Pop ? Where to ? TEDDY . ( A moment 's hesitation ) Nobody knows  --  but they say he 'll never come back to bang anybody , not even the dogs , any more . ( She looks up at him , half startled  --  half guessing the truth . Her gaze becomes more frightened . Finally she speaks . ) MIDGE . You do n't mean  --  ? TEDDY . ( Speaks very softly and kindly ) Do n't ask any more questions , little sister  --  because I ca n't answer them . ( He kisses her on the forehead . The men are heard shouting , " Good-bye ! Good-bye ! " answered by MRS . WESTON . ) Here come the boys back ! ( MIDGE is half dazed . She goes slowly into the house R. ) RANSOM . ( Entering first , followed by JOE , DAVE and PETE ) Teddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . Did you tell Mrs. Weston not to take the same road back ? JOE . She said you 'd warned her , but her head 's level enough  --  she ai n't a-goin ' to run no risks ! PETE . Say , I heard a good one this morning . I want to tell you all now they 're no woman folks around . What 's the difference between an Indian and a bull pup ? ( A moment 's pause . ) TEDDY . What ? Page 32 PETE . What 's the difference between an Indian and a bull pup ? TEDDY . You got me . ( A moment 's pause . ) PETE . Why , an Indian  --  TEDDY . Ssh ! ( As MIDGE enters . She says , " Boys ! " She comes on to porch a step and looks in surprise at the men , who are silent . ) MIDGE . Oh , my ! Ai n't it funny you boys do n't never seem to have a word to say unless I come and start talk a-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boys ? JOE . Yes . Come on . ( JOE , PETE and DAVE go into the house . RANSOM joins MIDGE . TEDDY has gone to L. and looks off . TEDDY , turning , sees MIDGE and RANSOM together ; he raises his eyebrows and smiles , nodding his head significantly , and starts to tiptoe into the house , too . RANSOM sees him . MIDGE stands with her back toward them . ) RANSOM . Teddy ! ( TEDDY stops and , looking at RANSOM , pantomimes not to say anything , that he understands and he will get out and leave them alone together . ) No , no  --  ( Joins TEDDY and speaks aside to him . They are L. , MIDGE R. ) It wo n't do , old man . She wo n't listen to me . There 's someone else ! TEDDY . Nonsense ! RANSOM . Joe ! TEDDY . Joe instead of you ! Stuff ! Say , leave her alone with me ! RANSOM . Be careful . If she do n't care for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worship the ground her feet touch . ( Going R. ) It would spoil it all here . TEDDY . ( Taking the practical view of it ) Go on , leave her with me ! ( RANSOM goes into the house . ) ( TEDDY steals playfully over behind MIDGE and says " Boo ! " to startle her . ) MIDGE . Oh , Brother ! ( Starts , frightened , with a little cry and turns to TEDDY  --  she throws her arms around his neck and bursts into tears . ) TEDDY . ( Embarrassed and sympathetic ) Hello ! Hello ! What 's up ? MIDGE . ( Crying ) Nothing ! ( Going C. to box . MIDGE sits L. TEDDY sits R. ) TEDDY . ( Holding her two hands ) Oh , come now ! ( He sits . ) Say , is it Billy ? MIDGE . No . ( Stops crying  --  she sits on a box at his feet . ) TEDDY . That 's right , stop crying . I want to have a little talk with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no  --  I mean , not exactly  --  some ! TEDDY . ( Smiling ) Well , that answer is out of sight literally ! MIDGE . ( Shyly , half humorously ) Do n't you think Joe 's a handsomer man ? TEDDY . But Billy 's a gentleman , and  --  ( Interrupted . ) MIDGE . ( Interrupting ) So 's Joe . TEDDY . That 's true . Has Joe spoken ? MIDGE . No , it seems as if he ai n't got the sand . I think he wants to . TEDDY . It takes a lot to tell a woman you love her . Still , Joe 's all right . You ai n't married  --  and to a blackguard ! ( The last word is only a whisper . ) MIDGE . Cheer up , Brother Teddy . Everybody says as how Mr. Weston 's a-drinkin ' himself to death sure ! TEDDY . That would n't surprise me , if she mixes his drinks ! But even if she were n't married , there 'd be another drink needed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MIDGE . ( Smiling ) Oh  --  fairy-tales  --  TEDDY . Yes , but they make a nice life . MIDGE . But you ai n't got no right to think about her . She is married . TEDDY . And does n't love me , anyway . I 'll forget her . I 'll forget her ! ( He speaks the first " I 'll forget her ! " seriously , then , after a moment 's pause , he smiles to himself and repeats , " I 'll forget her ! " in a tone implying the awful responsibility to him of his doing so . There 's a moment 's silence . Then MIDGE steals her hand into his and says encouragingly , sweet and softly  --  ) MIDGE . It ai n't easy , but let 's try ! ( TEDDY her hand for answer , another moment 's silence and then , looking down at her , he speaks  --  ) TEDDY . Sing that little song . MIDGE . Which ? TEDDY . You know , my favorite  --  ( Singing ) " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Smiling ) That ai n't exactly a good beginnin ' for forgettin ' . TEDDY . We wo n't count till after the song . ( MIDGE sings softly , " I love a lovely girl , I do , and I have loved a girl or two . " TEDDY nods his head . MIDGE begins again and sings . At the first line he looks affectionately at her and then turns his eyes and gazes off L. , where MRS . WESTON went . As she sings , " I know how a girl should be loved " he joins her in " You bet I do ! " and sings the rest with her softly , till the note before the last , when he breaks off suddenly . ) TEDDY . ( Rising ) Good God ! There she goes on the land-slide again ! ( MIDGE has also stopped and , rising , stands beside him , watching off L. ) TEDDY . The dare-devil ! ( He gives a loud cry of terror , echoed by MIDGE , as they both start violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ! I can save her alone ! ( Exits , crying out ) Hold on ! Help 's coming ! Hold on ! Hold on ! ( As his voice dies away , music pp. twice through . ) ( MIDGE stands L. , paralyzed . As TEDDY cried out and jumped off the porch , she has started also with a cry of terror , and for an instant has shut her eyes and covered them with her hands . Slowly she takes her hands from her face and opens her eyes . ) MIDGE . She is caught on that ledge ! If she 's only got the grit to hold on ! ( The men re-enter from the house . ) JOE . Well , we 're off ! What 's up ? MIDGE . ( Whispers ) Look ! JOE . What ? Hello ! A woman ! ( All the men look with him . ) PETE . Hanging just over the edge of the cannon ! JOE . ( A whisper ) God ! Come on , boys  --  ( All make a movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blocks their way ) No ! No ! You sha n't go ! JOE . What 's the matter with the girl ? PETE . Out of the way ! ( Moves forward . JOE pushes him back . ) MIDGE . ( Almost beside herself ) No ! Let Mr. Teddy save her alone  --  JOE . ( Jumping off bank ) He 's after her ? ( He crosses C. ) MIDGE . Yes , you 'll see him in in minute . It 's Mrs. Weston ! PETE . Come on anyway ! ( Moves forward again . JOE pushes him back . ) JOE . No ! DAVE . Has she tried to pull herself up ? MIDGE . No , she ai n't moved  --  prob'ly she 's fainted . JOE . A good thing , for if she moved that bit of ledge might crumble too , and she 'd  --  ( He breaks off . ) MIDGE . ( Adds in even a lower whisper ) She 'd follow the horse ! JOE . The horse is  --  ? MIDGE . At the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ledge gives away and both of ' em  --  ( She breaks off . ) JOE . Yes ! ( Turns and calls ) Pete , Dave ! MIDGE . There he is ! He 's in sight now ! Riding sunshine ! JOE . ( Jumps off porch quickly and exits calling ) Come on quick ! ( They turn off quickly L. ) ( Enter RANSOM . ) RANSOM . Where 're they off to ? MIDGE . Come look ! RANSOM . Where ? MIDGE . There ! Do n't you see ? ( RANSOM joins her  --  he does n't see at once , but looks a moment , sees , and takes in what it means . ) RANSOM . Good heavens ! Who is it ? MIDGE . ( Softly ) Mis ' Weston . RANSOM . And the man  --  Teddy ? MIDGE . Yes . He 's going to save her . Do n't I tell you he loves her ? RANSOM . But what can he do ? They 'll both go down together . ( Forgetting himself and speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right ! Be careful ! MIDGE . ( In an agony of fear ) He 'll slip ! ( RANSOM starts to go off L. MIDGE holds him back . ) RANSOM . Teddy has caught hold of her ! MIDGE . But she 's falling ! RANSOM . And he  --  ( MIDGE interrupts with a loud cry . ) No , it 's all right . He 's hangin ' on ! On to that ledge  --  MIDGE . But that 's where she was , and it gave away ! RANSOM . His grip 'll be stronger ! God help you , Teddy ! There 's the men ! MIDGE . Yes  --  Joe ahead ! Oh , I ca n't see ! ( She waves . ) RANSOM . Joe 's thrown his coat ! Teddy has hold of it ! They 're all right ! ( MIDGE drops slowly and softly to the ground with a faint . ) RANSOM . Midge ! Midge dear ! ( Lifting her up . ) They 're safe , both safe ! ( He fans her with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheek  --  goes on fanning her . She revives . ) MIDGE . Teddy 's safe ? RANSOM . Yes . ( As she goes from his arms . ) MIDGE . ( Disgusted with herself ) I suppose I fainted ! For goodness ' sakes , do n't tell the boys , will you ? ( Noise . ) They 're bringing her back . ( Rising . ) I 'm afraid she 's hurt ( Sitting on bank . ) RANSOM . No , probably she 's only fainted , too . MIDGE . ( Half laughing ) That 'll sorter keep me comp'ny ! Well , she ought n't to treat Mr. Teddy so mean , anyhow  --  not after to-day . He almost died for her ! Here 's Dave . RANSOM . ( Calls ) Anybody hurt ? ( DAVE enters . ) DAVE . No . Mrs. Weston 's fainted , but I guess she ai n't hurt . Git a place ready for her inside , Midge . ( MIDGE exits quickly . ) DAVE . ( Coming down C. ) Plucky thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knows why they did n't both go down afore we-uns got there . ( PETE and JOE enter , making a chair with their hands , in which half sits and half lies MRS . WESTON , still in a fainting condition . She is partially held up by TEDDY with his left hand . His right arm hangs limp  --  broken  --  by his side , unnoticed by the other men or by him . DAVE holds door open and RANSOM goes to help with MRS . WESTON . As they appear DAVE calls  --  ) DAVE . Here they are , Midge . MIDGE . ( Inside ) All ready ! RANSOM . ( To TEDDY ) God bless you , Teddy ! Are you hurt ? TEDDY . Not a damn bit ! Here , take my place . She 's riviving , and I do n't want her to see me now . ( They exchange places as they carry MRS . WESTON into the house . TEDDY stands in doorway and calls softly . RANSOM exits house R. ) TEDDY . Midge ! ( MIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kisses and hugs him for a moment . After a minute , a little choky ) There ! That 's all right ! MIDGE . ( Tearful ) I saw ! I saw ! TEDDY . Did you ? Ah ! Listen ! ( He whispers in her ear . Her face expresses surprise and disappointment . ) You understand , do n't you ? Not one word . You need n't fib . You can just refuse to answer if she asks you . ( He pushes her gently into the house . ) Tell the fellows to come right out here and you stay with her . ( MIDGE goes into house . At the same time the men come out in turn . PETE first , JOE , DAVE and men cross to L.C. ) TEDDY . ( Eagerly , anxiously ) Look here , boys ! I want you to give me your word , each one of you , you wo n't tell Mrs. Weston it was I went over the ledge after her . Do you understand ? JOE . No , blamed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I did it for anything . PETE . Yes , but  --  TEDDY . She 'd guy the life out of me . DAVE . For savin ' her life ! JOE . At the risk  --  ( Interrupted . ) TEDDY . ( Interrupting ) No , no ! Listen ! I could not stand her thanking me . I would n't have her feel under any such obligation to me . Why , ca n't you see , boys ? I do n't know as I can explain  --  but it 's sort of taking a mean advantage of her for me to put her in a position like that ! I could n't look her in the face if she knew  --  I 'd feel so  --  I do n't know how I 'd feel  --  but I 'd a good deal rather she went on guying me ! Why do n't some of you help me out ? Joe , do n't you know what I mean ? JOE . Well , I sorter does and I sorter do n't . Of course , we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exactly . It ai n't easy for some o ' us to stand up and take the blame for what you done ! TEDDY . Oh , come ! What difference will it make ? It 'd be so much easier for her to thank one of you . DAVE . It 's damn like lying  --  JOE . I 'd feel a dirty sneak ! TEDDY . Well , as long as you are n't one , you might be willing to feel one , just for my sake . Come on ! Will you promise me ? Do n't give me away ! Eh ! Sh ! Here she is ! . I 'm going to sneak . ( Exits R.U.E. ) ( As MIDGE and MRS . WESTON come on together from the house , MRS . WESTON has MIDGE 'S arm , but though she is pale and her hair disordered , and her riding-habit torn and clay-covered , she is herself again . ) MRS . WESTON . ( Goes C. and then sits on rock above steps ) Well , boys , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alive still in this blessed world , which never seemed so precious to me  --  thanks to one of you . You must tell me who that one is . All I remember was the shock of my poor horse 's stumble as over we rolled and down , down we went ! Poor beast ! In that moment the sky was a sweeter blue than I 'd ever seen it , and the trees the greenest , the earth a Paradise , and I thought to lose it ! Then I saw the arm of a man come over the ledge . It was like the arm of God to me , and then what seemed the man himself followed ; then a haze hid everything and I thought I was falling , falling down after my horse ! The next thing I knew I was here in the dear , strong arms of you fellows ! Thank you , Joe ! ( JOE shakes his head . ) Thank you , Pete ! ( PETE shakes his head . ) Thank you , Dave ! But which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be modest . I must know . Tell me . ( She waits . There is a silence . ) Oh , come  --  please ! Two of you must give the other away . ( Enter TEDDY at back softly . They are all terribly embarrassed and most eager to tell the truth . ) MRS . WESTON . Joe  --  Pete  --  Dave ! Who was it ? JOE . We 've agreed not to tell which one done it , ma'am . MRS . WESTON . But I wo n't have that . I must know ! ( The men look at TEDDY for a softening in him , but he still looks a hard refusal at them and shakes his head . ) PETE . Very sorry , ma'am , but we 've agreed . DAVE . And it wo n't be no good pumping . Very sorry , ma'am . MRS . WESTON . Well , boys , I respect your modesty , but I 'd like to know , and sha n't give up trying to find out ( She adds mischievously ) This very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would if I knew which one he was ! ( TEDDY on run R.U.E . The men are very much embarrassed , and TEDDY , rolling his eyes up , expresses that this is a test almost too great for him to stand . ) TEDDY . You might kiss us all around , on the chance o ' hittin ' the right one . MRS . WESTON . There would n't be any merit in it if it was so general , but that is not a bad idea . ( Bus . of kissing three men . JOE is called up and kissed by MRS . WESTON , then DAVE and then PETE , each showing different types of embarrassment , except PETE , who is willing and anxious . TEDDY goes to get kissed . ) My dear Mr. Teddy , you are not in the ring ! MIDGE . Oh , Mrs. Weston , he was there  --  ( She stops short , warned by TEDDY . ) MRS . WESTON . Yes , as I came to I saw him carrying my hat ! ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving my hat ! Ah ! How rude I am to you , and misjudged you . Popular as you are with these brave boys , there must be something in you which I failed to bring out . My fault ! ( TEDDY bows and goes up and off R. She turns to MIDGE . ) Good-bye , dear . ( Aside to her ) It was your Joe . I 'm almost sure , bless him  --  and you , Joe  --  you will have to lend me a horse , and will you see me home ? After all , I feel a little shaky . Good-bye , all ! And thank you again , with all my heart ! ( Growing emotional again ) I wish I could say more what I feel ! Good-bye !

But there ai n't no doctor for miles ! TEDDY . Oh , never mind ! It is n't so much  --  ( He is getting weaker . ) PETE . Yes , it is ! It ought to be tended to this minute !

It is a large bare room with a bar across L. At back L. of C. a large double door open . Outside a porch with staircase descending toward R. The hall being on the second story , R. of C. is a staircase going up to MOLLY LARKIN 'S bedroom  --  in the roof of R. is a door . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables about , a small old tinkling piano right . Also a small mirror on the wall R. , beside the piano . It is night . Through the big open doorway a mountain is seen in the distance and a beautiful blue sky full of stars . The stage is dark and MOLLY LARKINS appears on the stairs from her room above and comes down into the hall , a small lighted oil lamp in her hand . She is dressed for the dance in a bright silk skirt and a bright pink silk waist . Neither is made in an exactly fashionable way ; in fact , she has made both herself , copying with indifferent success a picture seen in a city Sunday paper . She is about thirty years old , somewhat plump , and decidedly attractive . She places the lamp on a table and goes to light a lamp hanging on the wall between the foot of the staircase and the big doorway . While she is lighting it QUICK FOOT JIM comes slowly and softly in C. door from R. , and , stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp , takes her in his arms and , bending her head back , kisses her . She is not frightened , being used to him . JIM looks haggard , careworn and sloven . MOLLY . So you 're back , Jim . ( Without turning to look at him , she goes on to the next lamp to light it , L.U.E. ) JIM . ( Following her ) Yes . MOLLY . ( Busy with the lamp ) Why was you away for so long ? JIM . Jim went away to find out if he could forget Molly ! MOLLY . ( Crosses to R. ) Well  --  ( JIM grunts. )  --  seeing you 're back , I guess you could n't forget me , eh ? ( With a coquettish smile at him . She has finished lighting this lamp , No. 3 , and goes to another , No. 4 . JIM follows her and speaks when he is beside her again . ) JIM . Me come back now for good ! MOLLY . Well , you need n't be so cross about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MOLLY looks up sharply at JIM from the lamp bus . for a second , then goes on with the business of lighting . ) He come here every day since Jim gone ? MOLLY . ( Shortly ) Yes . JIM . He make love ? MOLLY . Well , he ai n't exactly prejudiced against the idea ! ( JIM gives an angry grunt and MOLLY , with half a laugh , goes to the next lamp . JIM follows her . ) JIM . He come here to-night ? MOLLY . Hum  --  hum  --  ( Goes to lamp R. down stage . ) JIM . You are all dressed fine ! Eh ! Like the morning sky  --  for him . MOLLY . No , Miss Weston 's giving a party here to-night . JIM . You dance with him , Jim kill you . MOLLY . ( Laughs and strikes a match , saying ) Jim ! JIM . Me kill you  --  you understand ? ( She has not yet lighted this lamp . She turns , a little frightened now , the flaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Like that , Jim put out your life ! MOLLY . ( Afraid of him ) Do n't do anything crazy , Jim . It would n't do you no good to kill me . Do n't you know yet that I do n't love nobody else but you ? I 'm only foolin ' Mr. Weston . JIM . Well , we do n't want you to fool him , you see ? Jim , he been in the mountains above the birds , high up there with the clouds , and Jim try if Jim could live without Molly , but Jim ca n't . Molly got to live with Jim  --  you understand ? ( Taking her roughly by the arm . ) MOLLY . ( Getting arm away ) Look out ! I must light this other lamp . ( Beginning to light it . ) JIM . ( Crosses to L. , behind her ) Your hair is Jim 's lamp ! He wo n't kill you , because then he lose you , but Jim kill him if you fool with him some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting the lamp . She looks at JIM with a look in her eyes of fear and hatred . JIM takes her with rough affection by the shoulders . ) Jim give Molly a new name . ( He speaks an Indian name and then translates it . ) Rose-kissed-by-the-sun , so be your name now . ( He takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately . ) ( MISS PRISSIMS heard calling outside . ) MISS PRISSIMS . Molly ! ( MOLLY shudders slightly . Call repeated . ) Molly ! MOLLY . There 's Lulu Prissims ! Go light the lamp outside . ( She gives him a match . ) MISS PRISSIMS . ( Calls again impatiently ) Molly ! MOLLY . ( Calls ) Yes , Lulu . Jim 's coming with a light . ( JIM goes halfway to the door , looks back at MOLLY and grunts  --  he is suspicious of her . JIM exits at back to R. ) MISS PRISSIMS . ( Heard saying ) Hurry up , hurry up ! I ca n't see my way and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a conciliatory voice ) All right ! All right ! ( MOLLY has stood still watching him with hatred in her face . As she hears him say , " All right , " she relaxes and moves with a long , loud sigh . She rearranges her waist and looks about the hall ; goes to one of the lamps which is burning too high and turns it down a little . Meanwhile MISS PRISSIMS is heard coming up the outside stairs , talking a stream of chatter all the time . ) MISS PRISSIMS . Good evening , Jim . I did n't dare come up without a light . I was afraid I might hurt my dress ! I hope I ai n't late ! I 've got on a bran ' new body ! I thought I 'd show them folks they ai n't the only girls who can wear stylish duds . My ! ( Breathing hard . She enters almost breathless from the stairs . She is a stout blonde , pretty-faced woman , no longer young , but with girlish manners . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white slippers . ) Good evening , Molly . ( To C. ) MOLLY . Good evening , Lulu ! You seem out of breath ! Did Jim kiss you ? ( MOLLY crosses to R. Re-enter JIM quietly . He sits in a chair . MOLLY busies herself moving the chairs and tables from the centre of the room to against the wall . ) MISS PRISSIMS . No . I wish he had ! It 's them stairs . ( Taking off her hat . ) My , you 've got your new pink body on , ai n't you ? It looks real sweet . ( Crossing to piano . ) MOLLY . Yes , I got it when I was to Denver . ( Taking hold of the chair in which JIM is sitting . ) Jim , I want to put this chair away . ( JIM slowly rises and sits on the table . MOLLY , after putting the chair against the wall , moves the other table . ) MISS PRISSIMS . I suppose they 're awful stylish folks that 's coming ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her boots . ) MOLLY . Well , you know what the Westons are like . MISS PRISSIMS . I know him . I guess all the girls around Silverville knows him ! MOLLY . ( At the table at which JIM is sitting ) Get up ! JIM . You no let me sit nowhere . MOLLY . Sit on the piano stool . JIM . Miss Lulu she sit on the piano stool . MOLLY . Well , then sit on Miss Lulu ! ( Laughing . ) MISS PRISSIMS . Land sakes , Molly ! ( She has taken off her shoes . ) MOLLY . ( Pointing off R. ) Go straight through the supper room . The ladies ' dressing room is the other side . MISS PRISSIMS . ( To JIM ) Jim , put them in for me . I ca n't go in my stocking feet . ( JIM takes her shoes and hat and exits slowly R. ) MOLLY . ( Going to her ) What in the world  --  ( Interrupted . ) MISS PRISSIMS . ( Interrupting ) The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers . ( Unwrapping them . ) Jes ' look ! MOLLY . ( Doubtfully ) Do they fit you ? MISS PRISSIMS . Almost  --  only a teeney mite small , but you know the pedals of the piano wo n't work , so I really do n't use my feet any ! ( Getting into first slipper with difficulty , as her voice shows . ) MOLLY . ( Laughs ) Lulu Prissims , you ninny ! You ai n't invited to this party ! MISS PRISSIMS . Ouch ! ( As she tries to get on second slipper , finally she manages to do it , but it is evident that they are very tight . She starts playing the " Maiden 's Prayer . " ) I 'm sort of hopin ' some young man 'll get a mash on me and ask me to dance ! MOLLY . What 's that you 're playing ? MISS PRISSIMS . Ai n't it sweet ? My favorite piece  --  " The Maiden 's Prayer . " ( Enter B.L . SHERIFF BRENT . ) SHERIFF . Good evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good gracious ! you 've come to turn me out , I suppose ! ( MISS PRISSIMS turns and sees SHERIFF . ) MISS PRISSIMS . ( Smirking ) Oh , good evening , Sheriff ! SHERIFF . Good evening . MISS PRISSIMS . Good evening  --  MOLLY . Go on playing , Lulu . I 've got business with the Sheriff . ( MISS PRISSIMS begins to play again , but does her best through the scene to overhear what is going on between MOLLY and the SHERIFF . ) SHERIFF . Sorry , but I 'll have to dispossess you . Warned you three times , you know , and you promised to pay this morning or clear out of your own accord . MOLLY . I know , but  --  ( Interrupted . ) SHERIFF . There 's a party crazy to git the hall  --  ready to step right in to-night . MOLLY . Well , he wo n't , for I 'm going to pay up to-night ! SHERIFF . You 've said that before , old girl . ( He crosses to bar  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night with the swells from the Wheatley Ranch . They pay before they go , and I 'll hand the money right over to you . SHERIFF . How much 'll it cover ? MOLLY . All I owe to you up to Saturday . SHERIFF . No extry in advance ? MOLLY . ( Quietly going to him ) Oh , well , perhaps I wo n't want to stay here after Saturday . SHERIFF . ( Surprised  --  whistles ) Do n't say ! Going to leave Silverville ? MOLLY . Never mind  --  I do n't know yet . ( Comes down C. ) SHERIFF . The boys 'd miss you , I kin tell yer ! ( Noise outside . ) MOLLY . ( Listening ) Here comes the folks . Say , hang around and come in again in about an hour and I 'll pay you then . ( Goes up . ) SHERIFF . All right . I actually am sorry to press you , but I 'm forced to do it by the owners . ( He goes up . ) MOLLY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Following him . ) ( The WESTON party are heard arriving outside and coming up the steps . MISS PRISSIMS hears them and stops playing . ) SHERIFF . ( To MOLLY ) Good-bye for the present , Miss . MISS PRISSIMS . Good-bye , Sheriff . SHERIFF . Good-bye . Say , Moll , you might overlook a bet and hold me out a drink or two . Will I come back ? MOLLY . Why , of course ! SHERIFF . Bully for you , old girl ! ( Exits . ) MISS PRISSIMS . Ai n't he handsome ! I 'll be willing to expire just here if I could feel his arm around my waist as I breathed my last ! MOLLY . All the way around ? ( Coming down , pushes her shoulders . Starts bustling off entrance . ) MISS PRISSIMS . Oh , ai n't you mean ! ( She rises and goes to take a step , but stops in agony from her tight slippers and sits on the stool again as enter MRS . WESTON , WESTON , MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive women . The women are dressed in fashionable ball dresses . MOLLY has gone to meet them . ) MRS . WESTON . Here we are , Miss Larkins ! MISS CARTON . Oh , is n't this perfectly charming ? MISS LARRABEE . Charming ! ( MISS PRISSIMS rises as they come . ) MOLLY . ( Introducing ) Miss Lulu Prissims , the ochestry  --  Lulu , Mis ' Weston and lady friends . MISS PRISSIMS . ( Bowing ) Pleased to meet you ! My , but you all do look elegant ! MRS . WESTON . That 's a pretty waist you 're wearing . MISS PRISSIMS . ( R.C. ) Well , I think myself it 's real stylish ! But land sakes  --  ( Apropos of MRS . WESTON 'S decollette )  --  ai n't you afraid of catching cold ? ( Ladies amused . ) MOLLY . ( R. ) I should n't think you 'd feel safe , exactly  --  coming over with all them gems on ! There 's lots of rough people around here , you know . ( Crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know what fear is , and I am armed , anyway . ( Showing an exquisite little pistol which she carries in a special pocket of her dress . MOLLY goes up R. ) MOLLY . Lulu , show the ladies to the dressing room . ( Going over to bar . To MRS . WESTON ) It 's through the supper room on the other side . ( Pointing R. , crosses L. and goes behind bar . ) MISS PRISSIMS . This way , please . ( She turns and looks at the jewels on MRS . WESTON . ) Oh , my ! Them diamonds and pearls ! I suppose they 're real ! ( Exits R. She walks very gingerly on account of her slippers , as if on eggs , and it is evident from her walk that she can hardly stand it . MRS . WESTON leads the way after her and is followed off by her two friends , WESTON being left behind with MOLLY . ) MRS . CARTON . ( At door R. ) Oh , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't it ? ( Exits . ) ( MOLLY removes some bottles on bar . WESTON follows her across . As they cross with their backs turned R. , they do not see JIM , who re-enters R. immediately after the women have exited by that door . JIM enters softly and slowly , and watching MOLLY and WESTON , steals to the staircase which goes to MOLLY 'S room , through the rails . MOLLY back of bar . ) WESTON . ( Leaning across the bar on his folded arms ) Let me help you . MOLLY . ( Laughing ) Oh , yes , that 's the way you men help a woman ! It 's done ! ( Leaning on the bar opposite him . ) WESTON . I wonder if I could kiss you across the bar ? MOLLY . ( Smiling ) I reckon you could if I was willing . ( JIM goes on steps . ) WESTON . Are n't you willing ? MOLLY . Good land ! Why do n't you try and see ? ( JIM 'S head rises stealthily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans over MOLLY , who leans toward him . They kiss . At the same moment MRS . WESTON opens door R. and enters . She goes toward them and then draws back quietly . They do n't see her . ) MOLLY . That 'll do . They 'll be coming in again . ( She leaves the bar and comes outside , close to him . Both keep a lookout on the door R. , but of course are oblivious of the presence of JIM , and so do not look out for him . He watches through the stair rails . ) WESTON . ( In slightly lowered voice ) Meet me same place to-morrow ? ( JIM steals out door C. ) MOLLY . Ca n't say for certain  --  Jim 's back ! WESTON . What of it ? Are n't you going to throw him over ? MOLLY . I 'm afraid of him . WESTON . You 'd better leave this place . ( A laugh outside L. ) MOLLY . How do you mean ? ( Noise of the others behind door R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CARTON , MISS LARRABEE and MISS PRISSIMS . In the bustle of their entrance JIM steals down the stairs and out of door back . He is n't noticed .

( Coolly ) I do n't know what you mean . MRS . WESTON . I came into the room a moment ago when you and she were here ! ( By the bar .

Do n't make an idiot of yourself ! MRS . WESTON . Oh , you need n't be alarmed . It is n't that I do that in public ! ( Noise outside . ) MOLLY . Here comes some other folks !

WETSON , goes close beside MIDGE and tells her what to do during her dancing , going with her once or twice , all to WESTON 'S annoyance . ) MIDGE . Oh , my I ai n't no idea ! ( TEDDY shows her as above . ) TEDDY . Cross over ! Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shasshay , all ! Go it , corners ! ( Bus . When TEDDY comes back this time to turn MRS . WESTON he does so with marked care , and an air of mock triumph as he succeeds in getting her around without falling . ) MISS PRISSIMS . All over again ! ( " Hot Time in the Old Town "  --  two chords . ) TEDDY . Not on your life ! Give us the next tune ! ( She does so . All bow . ) It 's good exercise ! ( All bow elaborately . ) Forward and back ! Ladies ' chain ! ( Enter suddenly at back DICK ROD  --  stands in the doorway . He is dressed in a fine white shirt , black frock coat and black soft hat , narrow black tie . ) DICK . Hello ! Hello , there ! ( All look up  --  a moment 's silence . ) JOE . Hello , Dick Rod . ALL . Dick Rod ! ( The men 's right hands involuntarily go to their pistol pockets , but they try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WESTON . ( Aside to TEDDY ) Who is he ? TEDDY . He 's never been known to miss his man . ( DICK has started to stroll in . ) JOE . Beg pardon , but this is private ! DICK . Oh , private , is it ? Well , suppose I made it more private by spotting out every blamed lamp ? ( Brings out his pistol . The women all move in alarm . The men keep their hands on their pistol pockets , but do not bring out the weapons . ) TEDDY . Hold on ! Say ! I do n't think the gentleman quite understands . The hall has been hired this evening by a lady . MRS . WESTON . ( Coming forward ) Wo n't you present your friend , Mr. Teddy ? TEDDY . Mr. Dick Rod , Mrs. Weston . ( With a gesture of introduction . ) Mrs. Weston , Mr. Rod . DICK . ( Bowing low with great elegance ) Ma'am . MRS . WESTON . I am delighted to meet you . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transfer his pistol to his left hand . ) TEDDY . Mrs. Weston is giving a party to a few personal friends . You see the bar is closed . DICK . Is it ? Well , if the lady would like it otherwise , I 'll guarantee to open it in one shot ! ( All women shocked . ) MRS . WESTON . Oh , no , do n't trouble ! Wo n't you join us in a dance ? DICK . No , thank ye , but I 'll promise to keep any blamed gent dancing as long as you like , unless he wants a couple of balls in his feet ! TEDDY . Say , I think we 'll be satisfied with just plain dancing without fancy lead trimmings ! DICK . Anything to please the ladies  --  especially you , ma'am . ( Bowing to MRS . WESTON . ) You ai n't a widder by any chance ? MRS . WESTON . No . DICK . ( Elaborately ) Sorry ! TEDDY . ( Showing the way out , plainly ) Good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DICK . ( Turns on TEDDY , with a movement of his hand toward his pistol pocket . Similar movement on the part of all the men . ) Oh , I ai n't in such a hurry , and it seems a pity not to have just one set of pigeon-wings out of you , anyway ! TEDDY . Yes , it does seem a pity ! DICK . A little hot lead around your toes every three seconds would keep you stepping pretty lively , eh ? ( Crosses R. ) TEDDY . Oh , very lively  --  a sort of continuous performance ! ( DICK makes a sweeping glance about the room . Each man 's hand on his pitsol tightens . DICK laughs  --  he turns to MRS . WESTON . ) DICK . There ai n't a gent here good enough for you  --  ( Bows again very low to MRS . WESTON and starts to exit . The men 's hands leave their pistols . Stopping , he turns halfway toward the door and men 's hands go quickly back to their pistols . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each one of the men , turns again to go out . The men 's hands come partly away again from their pistols , but at the doorway he turns about , and back go the men 's hands quickly . ) Not one ! ( Bows  --  exits . Great relief among the company . ) TEDDY . Pleasant neighbor to have drop in occasionally ! MRS . WESTON . Very ! Shall we finish the dance ? ( There is a murmur of all the others talking together . ) TEDDY . Say no ! You must let me change my togs . MRS . WESTON . Oh , very well , then . Come into the supper room , girls , for a minute . Mr. Teddy wants to dazzle us . Now come as soon as you are ready . ( Exits R. ) TEDDY . Now  --  presto change ! ( MISS PRISSIMS has slowly got into her slippers during the scene with DICK ROD . She drives the women before her into room R. , turns at door and speaks across stage to TEDDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE , PETE , RANSOM and WESTON ) Say , will you-uns go outside for a spell . I want to remark something private to the boss . ( They all make a movement except PETE . ) PETE . On condition you join outside and let me gab with the boss when you 're through . DAVE . Agreed ! ( JOE , PETE , WESTON and RANSOM exit back and are seen outside there on the porch . ) TEDDY . Perhaps you do n't think it 's warm in these clothes . I feel like twins ! DAVE . Boss ! TEDDY . Well ? DAVE . It 's the little one , Midge ! TEDDY . What about her ? DAVE . I want to hitch on to her ! TEDDY . ( Drops boots ) Say ! Wake up ! You 've only known her three weeks . DAVE .

Dave , those are my sentiments exactly  --  in regard to someone else . But why do n't you tell Midge all this yourself ? DAVE . Sort of ca n't get the grit . Calculated as how mebbe you 'd try to pump her a little and find which way the land lays . ( The women off R. rattle the door and MRS . WESTON calls . ) MRS . WESTON . Hurry ! Hurry ! MISS PRISSIMS .

At the same time DAVE , PETE , RANSOM and WESTON appear in doorway R.N. and shout with one voice , " Time ! " The men enter . ) TEDDY . Come on , now . Line up over there .

Let 's all cakewalk out in the moonlight  --  MRS . WESTON . ( Laughing from the other side of door ) All right ! ( Ladies enter . First MIDGE , who is taken by WESTON ; then the other ladies in turn  --  MRS . CARTON and MISS LARRABEE , her hand to TEDDY  --  JOE exits . After her boys DAVE and PETE . MRS .

WESTON ) Come on and see the stars ? It 's a dandy night . MRS . WESTON . ( Mischievously ignoring TEDDY 'S remark , speaking to MISS PRISSIMS ) I 'm sure Mr. Teddy would be delighted to give you a turn . TEDDY . Oh , delighted ! But there 's no one to play . ( To MRS . WESTON ) Come on ! MISS PRISSIMS . We might hum a tune while we danced . Can he hum ? MRS . WESTON . I 'm sure he 's a hummer ! TEDDY . No  --  always made other things hum . MRS . WESTON . I can play a little  --  though of course I 'm not an artist like Miss Prissims . ( TEDDY is glaring and making all sorts of signs at MRS . WESTON . ) MISS PRISSIMS . Oh , that 'll be elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers , which she has again taken off , to get them so she can put them on without being observed . ) TEDDY . All right . When we come back we 'll have a go at it . ( Making a start away . ) MRS . WESTON . ( Following him , in amused aside to him ) No , you might n't ever come back . TEDDY . ( To MRS . WESTON ) Not on your life ! What have I ever done to you ? I would n't dance with that tub . ( Moving another step . MISS PRISSIMS is getting into her slippers . ) MRS . WESTON . ( Following him ) Yes , you will  --  to please me ! TEDDY . ( Seriously , pathetically ) Why does it always please you to have me make a guy of myself ? MRS . WESTON . ( Smiling ) I do n't know , but it does . Besides , think what a joy it will be for this poor creature to dance once with you . It will last her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Starts to go L. ) MRS . WESTON . I 'll take a walk with you afterwards  --  out there in the moonlight . TEDDY . Will you ? MRS . WESTON . Yes ! TEDDY . Honest ? MRS . WESTON . ( Still smiling ) As Midge says , " Cross my heart " ! TEDDY . You have n't got any to cross ! Mine 's the only heart you cross , but I 'll treat you . ( MRS . WESTON stands to one side to let him pass to MISS PRISSIMS , who now has her slipper on and has been watching them surreptitiously from the corner of her eye , half turned toward him at the piano . She sees the movement of MRS . WESTON and the movement of TEDDY toward her , and quickly swings back , facing the piano , assuming an air of modest expectation . TEDDY makes a movement to go to her , takes a step or two , and weakens , shakes his head and turns around to look at MRS . WESTON as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it . " MRS . WESTON stands straight and unrelenting , and after a look of comic , piteous appeal to her , TEDDY shrugs his shoulders and buckles up to the task . He makes a bee-line for MISS PRISSIMS . MISS PRISSIMS turns quickly and rises , almost taking TEDDY 'S breath away , and before he can ask her , she speaks . ) MISS PRISSIMS . ( Delighted ) I 'm ready ! ( She crosses to L. ) TEDDY . Are you ? ( Almost knocked over . ) Yes , so I see ! ( With a long , loud sigh . ) I wish I was ! ( MRS . WESTON is with difficulty controlling her laughter  --  she goes to piano . ) MRS . WESTON . What is it to be ? ( Sits on the piano stool . ) TEDDY . Life or death ! MRS . WESTON . No , no ! Which do you choose ? TEDDY . Death ! MRS . WESTON . ( Laughing a little in spite of herself ) Stop joking ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at TEDDY 'S joke ) Oh , I think a waltz is nicest . You get so separated in a polka . Do n't you think ? TEDDY . No , I do n't think ! MRS . WESTON . Come , now , it 's a waltz . ( MISS PRISSIMS holds her arm open ready to embrace TEDDY in the dance , and TEDDY goes to her with his open , ready to dance . Just as he reaches her he suddenly turns around and goes back quickly to MRS . WESTON , to MISS PRISSIMS 'S evident disappointment , and a necessary accompanying change in her position . ) MISS PRISSIMS . ( Speaks across to MRS . WESTON ) Oh , dear , ai n't he  --  ( Begins to play. )  --  bashful ? TEDDY . ( To MRS . WESTON ) You 'll keep your promise ? ( MRS . WESTON nods her head violently as she plays without turning to look at TEDDY . He turns abruptly to MISS PRISSIMS and speaks peremptorily and half angrily ) Come on ! ( He grabs her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! Ai n't you strong ! TEDDY . ( With MISS PRISSIMS in his arms , standing still , to MRS . WESTON , over MISS PRISSIMS 'S shoulder ) A good long walk ! Not a chase off the stoop and back ! MRS . WESTON . ( Playing ) Yes , yes . ( They start to dance . MISS PRISSIMS stops him and speaks archly . ) MISS PRISSIMS . Now do n't you tickle me , will you ? TEDDY . I 'm not going to tickle you ! Hurry up ! ( They start to dance again . After a few false starts they get off , but out of step , etc . They stop and try over once again . MRS . WESTON is watching them over her shoulder and laughing so she can hardly play . TEDDY , who has been very mournful , has to laugh himself as they fail a second time . Meanwhile MISS PRISSIMS 'S slippers have begun to hurt her very badly . ) Say , excuse me , but I think I could dance better with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MRS . WESTON can no longer restrain her laughing and runs , laughing hysterically , from the room off R. ) Where are you going ? MRS . WESTON . I 'll be back in a moment . MISS PRISSIMS . ( Offended ) What 's the matter ? TEDDY . I do n't know  --  maybe she 's a little jealous . MISS PRISSIMS . Of me ? Oh , go away ! Ai n't you a flirt ! ( He goes to door R. , which MRS . WESTON has left open , and beckons strongly for her to come back . ) Perhaps you do n't know that since I 've been in Silverville two men have shot themselves for love of me . TEDDY . Before  --  or after ? ( He looks off again and beckons . ) MISS PRISSIMS . I do n't know what you mean . ( Re-enter MRS . WESTON , calming herself evidently with an effort . ) MRS . WESTON . Excuse me ! ( MISS PRISSIMS goes up C. ) TEDDY . I thought perhaps you 'd gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go and make you a cocktail . TEDDY . ( Quickly ) No , no ! ( MIDGE heard calling off L. ) MIDGE . Brother Teddy ! Brother Teddy ! ( She enters running , L. , followed by WESTON more slowly . This entrance surprises those on the stage . ) Brother Teddy ! ( Goes to him , taking his arm . ) TEDDY . What 's the matter ? MIDGE . Do n't leave me alone with him ! He held me in his arms for all I could do ! MRS . WESTON . ( Crosses to WESTON ) You beast ! ( WESTON crosses to L. in front of bar . ) MIDGE . There 's never no cowboy  --  no , nor half-breed  --  on or near Silverville as he s said to me such things as him , nor done as he tried ! TEDDY . ( In a rage at the latter part of her speech , goes threateningly up to WESTON  --  takes him by the throat . ) I 'll kill you for insulting this girl ! MIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WESTON . ( With her hand on TEDDY 'S arm ) Leave him alone , he is n't fit for you to touch ! ( TEDDY very slowly lets go his hold on WESTON and as slowly turning , looks amazed at MRS . WESTON  --  surprised at the tone of her voice , which he has never heard before addressed to him . He looks at her tenderly , gratefully , questionably  --  a short pause . ) WESTON . ( Recovering himself ) Come on ! I 'll fight you out in the open ! MIDGE . No ! ( MRS . WESTON also makes a movement toward TEDDY and shakes her head . ) TEDDY . ( To MRS . WESTON ) No , do n't ask me not to ! ( To WESTON ) I 'm ready ! MIDGE . ( Appealing to MRS . WESTON and clinging tighter to TEDDY 'S arm ) Mrs. Weston ! MRS . WESTON . Not now ! Please , for Midge and for my sake ! Some other time when you are calmer , punish him , if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moment 's pause . ) TEDDY . Very well  --  for your sake  --  and Midge 's . But I am not through with you yet ! MRS . WESTON . Thank you . Wo n't you take Midge to the others , and come back for  --  me ? ( He bows . To PRISSIMS ) Wo n't you go into the dressing room ? I want to ask you not to mention this to the others . TEDDY . ( To WESTON ) You  --  well , I 'll tell you what I think of you later ! Come , Midge ! ( WESTON laughs and goes R. to MIDGE  --  TEDDY starts to exit at R. with MIDGE . She stops him . ) MIDGE . Wait a minute ! ( She goes quickly to MRS . WESTON and takes her a little aside and whispers ) It was him who saved your life that day by the Niagara Canon ! MRS . WESTON . ( In great surprise ) Master Teddy ! MIDGE . Alone , by himself , he done it . ( She goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WESTON . ( Aside ) What a cruel fool I 've been ! ( To WESTON ) Now I want you to listen to what I have to say and understand it , for I mean it ! ( When she is left alone with WESTON , MRS . WESTON recovers . ) This ends even our fictitious life together . From to-night on I do not know you ! ( He laughs . ) Do you understand ? You go your way  --  Heaven help you where it leads you to  --  and I go mine ! ( He lights a cigarette . ) WESTON . Do n't be foolish . ( Throws cigarette away . ) This is n't our first quarrel . MRS . WESTON . More shame to us ! It is the last . WESTON . I 'm not sure I ca n't force you by the law to live with me so long as we remain man and wife . MRS . WESTON . I do n't believe that is the law . WESTON . If it is n't , I shall call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you go your own way . MRS . WESTON . You ca n't prevent me ! Ever since I married you , you 've heaped sorrow and disgrace upon me . Your name which you gave me to bear has been the by-word for scandal in every city we have lived in . I came to you an innocent girl , and you soon made me into a hard and bitter woman , knowing more than any woman should ever know ! ( She turns . ) All this is in the past , and though your shadow must fall over my future , I 've made up my mind it shall be only your shadow that darkens it , and not yourself . WESTON . Very well ! Well see ! MRS . WESTON . We will ! George , I 'm desperate ! God forgive me , but I hate you ! WESTON . Hate is next door to love . ( Goes close to her . ) MRS . WESTON . Be careful ! Crosses L. ) WESTON . Jess , I 'll make you forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand these other women are only past-times , while you I respect and  --  love  --  ( Interrupted . ) MRS . WESTON .

( During this last speech of MRS . WESTON 'S TEDDY has entered and overhears her last words . He starts , amazed and frightened , at her threat . ) TEDDY . ( R. ) Mrs. Weston ! What are you saying ? MRS . WESTON . ( L. ) I meant it  --  I meant it ! ( A moment 's pause , in which the three stand looking at each other . TEDDY comes down R. ) WESTON . ( C. ) This is not your affair , North ! TEDDY . Mrs. Wetson asked me to come back to her . You heard her . ( R. WESTON goes up C. to door . ) ( MRS . WESTON sinks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEDDY stands behind her , at a distance , looking at her with great sympathy , desiring to say something to comfort her  --  not knowing what to say . ) TEDDY . ( Hesitatingly , anxiously ) Mrs. Weston ? ( No answer . ) Mrs. Weston , ca n't I help you ? ( Distrustfully ) As you wish ! ( He starts to go . ) MRS . WESTON . In five minutes I shall be ready . TEDDY . In five minutes I shall be back . ( Exit at back . ) WESTON . ( Laughs ) Jess , see here ! MRS . WESTON . ( At door R. , to WESTON ) You are not to follow me . ( She exits R. , slamming door in his face . ) ( WESTON stands still for a moment then goes softly up the stairs to MOLLY 'S room , taps softly , opens door and speaks .

( READY for Lights Out . ) ( WESTON enters , leaving door half open  --  the light in the room shows through the open door . ) ( LIGHTS Out . ) ( JIM enters stealthily and quickly from back . He first goes to the bar and takes MRS . WESTON 'S pistol which lies there ; next he goes to each lamp quickly and puts it out , till finally the room is left in darkness , save the moonlight which streams in through the open window and the light from MOLLY 'S room . The murmur of MOLLY 'S and WESTON 'S voices is heard . ) WESTON . I 'm going to leave this place for good to-night ! MOLLY . Alone ? WESTON . Not if you 'll go with me . ( Opening the door wide , leans against its side , facing inside the room so that he does n't yet notice the darkness of the hall . ) Did n't you hear the quarrel I just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ) No , you ca n't hear nothing in this place  --  the partitions between the rooms are regular logs , you know . ( When WESTON appears JIM is extreme R. , where he has just put out the last lamp . As the two speak he quickly and stealthily steals across to beside and behind the staircase . ) WESTON . Hurry up ! ( He turns and finds the hall dark . ) Hello , who 's put the lights out ? ( Calls ) Hello , down there ! ( A pause for a reply . There is a moment 's complete silence , then MOLLY speaks . ) MOLLY . What 's the matter ? ( Joins WESTON  --  a little frightened . ) Who put the lights out ? WESTON . That 's what I want to know . MOLLY . ( Very frightened  --  seizes WESTON ) George ! WESTON . What 's the matter ? You are n't afraid of the dark , are you ? ( Trying to lead her down the steps  --  she pulls him back . ) MOLLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He was here to-night . ( Stopping halfway down the stairs . ) WESTON . Well , what did he want ? MOLLY . ( In half a whisper ) If you had n't suggested our getting out together to-night I was going to tell you we 'd have to go or give each other up . Jim is on to us . WESTON . What of it ? I 'm not afraid of the half-breed ! MOLLY . But I am , awful afraid ! And I 'm afraid it 's him turned out the lights . To do us both harm . WESTON . Come on , then , quick . ( Leads her down . ) I 'm here to protect you . MOLLY . I know Jim ! He 's suspicious of you , and he 'd rather see me dead than lost to him . He 'd kill us both as soon as eat !

WESTON has started back in surprise at JIM 'S voice . ) WESTON . You damned scoundrel ! ( JIM grunts and the two men grapple . They silently struggle a moment in and out of the light , and then JIM gets his right arm free . MRS . WESTON 'S pistol is in his hand and flashes in the light , and at the same moment , in the distance outside , TEDDY is heard whistling , " I love a lovely girl , I do , " etc . There is a sharp report . WESTON staggers . JIM catches him just before he falls and lets him down softly . ) WESTON . ( Dying ) You Indian dog ! I 'm done for ! Jess ! Jess ! Jess ! Forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor in the streak of moonlight . ) ( JIM stands over him a moment and grunts . The whistling is heard a little louder . JIM throws his head quickly , listening a second , then he hurriedly but without sound gets to the staircase and up it to MOLLY 'S room . He tries to open the door  --  it is bolted . ) JIM . ( In a threatening whisper ) Lemme in ! ( He waits a second , but there is no response . He shakes the door  --  not too loudly . ) Lemme in ! D' you hear ? ( Again he waits a second . ) What you ' fraid of ? Jim wo n't hurt you ! Him 's all I want to get rid of so Jim can have you for himself , for always !

Yass  --  quick ! ( The bolt is drawn . He opens the door , slinks in and bolts it behind him . ) ( The whistling stops . TEDDY is heard outside coming up the steps . ) TEDDY . ( Outside ) The five minutes are up ! ( He comes into the door , but is stopped short finding the hall in darkness . At the very same moment he enters , but after his speech outside , which she does n't hear , MRS . WESTON enters from R. and also stops in the doorway on account of the darkness . Both give vent to an exclamation at once  --  i.e. , at the same time  --  so that neither hears the other . In surprise ) Hello ! MRS . WESTON . ( In surprise ) Dear me ! ( A moment 's pause as they gaze into the dark room . Each one sees something on the floor in the moonlight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , they come slowly and softly forward , feeling their way as if it were in the dark , with an awful suspicion and dread , as it were , on their faces . WESTON lies obliquely , with his head toward the upper R. corner of the stage , the moonlight on him . TEDDY approaches him from L.B. MRS . WESTON approaches him from R. , the eyes of both are fixed on the body when they reach it  --  the body between them , he above it , she below , both now in the moonlight themselves . Then they recognize it and each start back with a cry of horror . ) TEDDY . Good God ! MRS . WESTON . Weston ! ( They hear each other 's voices and after starting back , they lift their heads , and standing in the streak of moonlight , they look into each other 's faces across WESTON 'S body . There is an awful moment of recognition , followed by a long pause , and each gazes first amazed , then horrified at the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This pause must be held as long as possible , as if they were beyond belief , but still without doubt , as she had apparently found him " red-handed .

Ca n't we ask him in to supper  --  ( As she is speaking she appears in the doorway and finds all darkness . ) Hello , what 's the matter ? TEDDY . ( To MRS . WESTON  --  puts his finger on his lips , whispers ) Sh ! Trust to me ! ( All the others enter after MIDGE  --  JOE , PETE , DAVE , RANSOM , MRS . CARTON , MISS LARRABEE , and MISS PRISSIMS . ) ALL .

Exclamations of the company . ) JOE . Good Gawd ! ( At once . ) RANSOM . Good Heavens ! ( At once . ) MRS . CARTON . Merciful Heavens ! ( At once . ) MISS LARRABEE . Oh ! Horrors ! MISS PRISSIMS . My goodness ! ( Two women scream loudly . DAVE lights a lamp . ) PETE . Weston ! Picked ! SHERIFF . ( Coming through the crowd ) What 's this ? What 's this ? A man killed ? OMNES . Man killed ! JOE . No , not killed  --  dead ! ( DAVE comes down with lighted lamp . ) SHERIFF . I tell you the man 's been shot . And here is the weapon ! ( Holding up MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Surprised ) What  --  My  --  ( Interrupted . TEDDY interrupts by a quiet look . ) SHERIFF . Yours ! Is this your pistol ? MRS . WESTON .

Yes , I  --  I took it off  --  and gave it  --  I gave it to  --  that is , I did n't want  --  I  --  did n't want it  --  SHERIFF .

I am the one you 're looking for ! ( A moment , then movement and exclamation from everyone . ) MRS . WESTON . ( Impulsively ) No ! No ! ( TEDDY looks at her gratefully , but shakes his head slightly and holds out his hands toward the sheriff . ) TEDDY . Mrs. Weston found me beside the body ! ( SHERIFF 'S hands on TEDDY 'S shoulder . ) QUICK CURTAIN ACT III SCENE : The court-room at Silverville . A pleasant , sunny room with warm brown walls . At C. back is the JUDGE 'S desk and seat . On each side of him are two square windows through which the morning sky and some trees are seen . L.C. is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jurors ; at R.C. is the place for the witnesses to give their evidence ; at R. are rows of benches for the public . At R.B. is the room where the witnesses are . DISCOVERED : At the curtain the court room is crowded . The twelve Jurymen are in their places , the seats for the public are crowded . In the front row are MRS . CARTON and MISS LARRABEE , and with them DAVE . Back in the crowd are JIM and MOLLY LARKIN , side by side . TEDDY is in the prisoner 's place , with RANSOM beside him . The DISTRICT ATTORNEY who is conducting the case against TEDDY is in his place . The Jury looks solemn and against TEDDY . Loud noise and confusion , cat-calls , whistling , hissing and booing . ( The JUDGE raps for order in vain . Finally the SHERIFF calls out " Order ! " with a strong , forceful voice and the noise subsides . ) SHERIFF . We must have order here , gentlemen ! OMNES . Pete 's a fool ! etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine this witness further ? TEDDY . ( To JUDGE ) No , Your Honor . ( PETE rises . To PETE ) That 's all right , Pete . I know you meant to help me , but take my word for it , lying never pays . JUDGE . ( To PETE ) You can remain in the court-room if you like . ( PETE nods his head and joins MRS . CARTON , crossing R. The people slightly hiss PETER again as he joins them . ) PETE . I wanted to help him ! I wanted to help him ! ( And he bursts out sobbing as he sits with his head in his hands . ) JUDGE . Ladies and gentlemen . There seems to be a mistaken idea on the part of this public . You are not present as judge . That is my function  --  and I feel capable of doing my duty  --  without assistance from you . I do not intend to have repeated to-day the scenes of yesterday during the examination of Molly Larkin and the Indian . Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man called Joe .

Go there  --  ( Pointing to witness-box . ) ( JOE , with a nod to DAVE and PETE and the ladies , goes to the box . He looks over and smiles at TEDDY encouragingly and shakes his own hand as if shaking TEDDY 'S . TEDDY returns the compliment with the same business . DAVE and PETE watch JOE , eagerly on the alert to give him a hint as to his testimony . ) ATTORNEY . You lived on the ranch with the prisoner ? JOB . Yes , thank God ! ATTORNEY . Weston used to come to the ranch ? JOE . Oftener than he was welcome ! ATTORNEY . Oh , then North did n't like him ? ( TEDDY tries to object . JOE speaks before TEDDY . ) JOE . I ai n't said that . None of us war fur or ag'in ' him . He jes ' were n't one of us ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATTORNEY . Did you ever hear of any sort of misunderstanding between North and Weston ? JOE . No . ATTORNEY . Was North , to your knowledge , particularly fond of Mrs. Weston ? JOE . We all was ! ATTORNEY . Did you notice ever any symptoms of jealousy of North on the part of Weston ? JOE . Do n't know what you 're driving at ! ATTORNEY . I 'm driving at the fact that Weston was jealous of North . TEDDY . ( Rises quickly , saying ) You 're not on the stand . Let the witness do the testifying . ( Sits . ) JOE . Weston were n't jealous of no man what made love to his wife . ATTORNEY . Did North make love to Mrs. Weston ? JOE . Not by a  --  ( Interrupted . ) JUDGE . Answer yes or no . JOE . No . ATTORNEY . But he loved her ? TEDDY . ( To JUDGE , rising ) Your Honor , I object to the question . JUDGE . Objection sustained .

Confine yourself to simpler languages . ATTORNEY . What do you know against the deceased ? JOE . He chased every petticoat in sight . ATTORNEY . Is that unusual in Silverville ? JOE . Yes , we do n't chase petticoats that we ai n't no call to run after . ATTORNEY . You were with North shortly before the murder ? JOE . Yes . ATTORNEY . What was the object of your conversation with him ? ( TEDDY smiles and winks at JOE . ) JOE . I wo n't tell ! ATTORNEY . You refuse to answer ? TEDDY . ( Smiling ) Oh , go on ! Tell him , Joe ! JUDGE . ( To TEDDY ) You will only hurt your case by these interruptions . It would be much better if you had engaged a lawyer to defend you in the usual manner , rather than attempting to conduct your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for the customs of this court . TEDDY . I beg Your Honor 's pardon . ( JUDGE bows to ATTORNEY to go on with the examination . ) ATTORNEY . You agree with the other witnesses that the prisoner is a noted amateur fighter ? JOE . You ai n't doing him justice ! He can lick anything ! He ai n't no amachure ! ATTORNEY . I see  --  he is used to fighting ? He is of an aggressive nature ? JOE . ( Does n't altogether understand ) If you mean as how he ai n't afraid to tackle anyone , right  --  ATTORNEY . You think it physically possible for the accused to kill Weston ? JOE . Of course so  --  but he did n't  --  TEDDY . ( Excitedly ) I have retracted that confession ! I lied to save the woman I loved whom I thought in danger . JUDGE . ( Interrupting quickly ) Go on with your cross-examination . TEDDY . When you heard me say I killed that man , did you believe me ? JOE . Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know 'd as you did n't do it ! TEDDY . What would you call in your own picturesque language , the attacking of an unarmed man in the dark with a pistol ? JOE . What a Gad  --  TEDDY . ( Quickly ) No oaths ! JOE . ( After a moment 's hesitation ) A dirty , onery , low-down trick  --  TEDDY . Did I ever take the slightest unfair advantage in any fight I was ever in ? JOE . Never ! TEDDY . Have I ever to your knowledge injured a living soul ? JOE . No , by  --  ( Interrupted . ) TEDDY . ( Interrupting ) Let it go at no . Have you heard me quarrel time and time again with the boys to keep them from lynching ? JOE . Yes , it 's the only real grudge the boys hez ag'in ' you ! JUDGE . Are these questions material ? TEDDY . I think so . ( Forgetting himself and his examination a moment . ) I want to prove that I have always been on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances may point against me , in spite of my confession of guilt that night  --  which was a lie  --  still I want to persuade these twelve men by giving them a knowledge of my character that it is not possible for me to have done the atrocious deed of which I stand here accused . ( Timid murmur of approval from the audience  --  " Good ! Good ! " ) JUDGE . Continue the cross-examination of your witness . TEDDY . In your conversation with me , about which you were just now questioned , when you refused to answer , what was the subject ? JOE . ( Terribly embarrassed ) It was about  --  lovin ' and gettin ' married ! TEDDY . Love for whom ? JOE . Oh , Boss ! TEDDY . Go on  --  speak out ! You forget what 's at stake , old man  --  my life ! JOE . I wanted Midge  --  TEDDY . ( To JUDGE ) My little adopted sister . JOE . And you said as you ai n't got no objections and advised me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else did we talk about ? JOE . Nothing else . ( He smiles . ) The whole blamed gang wanted her , too ! TEDDY . ( To JOE ) Say , Joe , have you asked her yet ? JUDGE . ( To TEDDY ) That question is not  --  TEDDY . Oh , go on , Judge ! Let me ask ! I 'd feel easier about the little girl in case it goes wrong with me here . JOE . Boss , she took to the idea like a duck to the water ! TEDDY . ( Leans out to JOE , who leans over to him and they shake hands ) Bully , Joe ! JUDGE . Continue the examination . TEDDY . Beg your pardon , Judge . ( Goes back to his place , smiling affectionately at JOE . ) I tell you , Joe , you 've got a great girl ! ( JUDGE raps once , and TEDDY quickly goes on with his questions . ) Did you ever know of my making love to Mrs. Weston ? JOE . No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever marrying Mrs. Weston ? JOE . We 'd all have been red hot for it , but there war n't never nothing said ! TEDDY . Was everyone in Silverville as pleasant to Weston as I was ? JOE . No ! Half the push always gave him the shake ! TEDDY . I 've finished with the witness . ( A loud sigh of relief from TEDDY 'S friends among the public  --  a movement of everyone speaking in low whispers , one to the other . Similar movement among the JURY . Bus . ) JUDGE . ( To JOE ) You may join the public . JOE . Thank you . ( To TEDDY , with real feeling ) Good luck , Boss ! TEDDY . God bless you , Joe ! JUDGE . The next witness ! ATTORNEY . Louisa Prissims . ( SHERIFF opens the door R.E . and beckons off . Enter MISS PRISSIMS . Crowd titter . MISS PRISSIMS rather frightened and very nervous .

I am the pianist of the dance hall . ATTORNEY . You remember the night of the murder ? MISS PRISSIMS . Yep ! ATTORNEY . What is most indelibly stamped upon your mind ? MISS PRISSIMS . ( Looks embarrassed and hesitates ) I  --  I waltzed with Mr. North  --  ( All laugh  --  not too loud . TEDDY buries his face in his arms , laughing . Laughter in the court . MISS PRISSIMS looks surprised and frightened . ) ATTORNEY . I mean as to the murder ? You were with Mr. Weston and the prisoner a short time before ? MISS PRISSIMS . Yes  --  I think so  --  ATTORNEY . Are n't you sure ? MISS PRISSIMS . No , I ai n't exactly sure . ATTORNEY . Did you hear their conversation ? MISS PRISSIMS . I do n't know . I forget . ATTORNEY . Now , what did happen ? MISS PRISSIMS . I  --  I  --  do n't remember  --  ATTORNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Weston went into the dressing room , and she laid down and I ate a sandwich . I ate two , and we stayed about ten minutes  --  and when I went out I saw her husband dead . ATTORNEY . You seem to remember all that very perfectly . MISS PRISSIMS . Yep . ATTORNEY . When you and Mrs. Weston left Weston , he was alone ? MISS PRISSIMS . Yep . ATTORNEY . I am through , Your Honor , but I should like the privilege of calling this witness again . JUDGE . ( To TEDDY ) Do you wish to question the witness ? TEDDY . ( With humor ) I beg to be excused , Your Honor ! JUDGE . The next witness .

Her first look has been at the JUDGE , and then her eyes have quickly traversed the court for TEDDY . She finds him , her eyes dilate , and her breath comes more quickly .

( Gasps ) Yes , sir  --  ( As she speaks she takes her gaze from TEDDY to the ATTORNEY . After she finishes each speech she steals a quick glance at TEDDY and then back again to the JUDGE . ) ATTORNEY . When did you last see North ? How long before the breaking up of the party ? MIDGE . ( Gasps ) I seen him then . ATTORNEY . Yes , I know  --  but when before ? MIDGE . About fifteen minutes . ATTORNEY . Where and how ? MIDGE . I went outside with him . ATTORNEY . Why ? MIDGE .

Did you hear quarreling between Mr. Weston and North ? MIDGE . ( Slowly , fearfully ) Yes , sir  --  ATTORNEY . Really quarreling , almost a fight ? MIDGE . Yes , sir . ATTORNEY . Did you hear what North said to Weston ? ( MIDGE looks at TEDDY . ) TEDDY . Speak the truth , Midge . Do n't be afraid . It 'll come out all right in the end . MIDGE . I do n't know  --  at least , I ca n't remember  --  I mean yes  --  ATTORNEY . Ah ! He said that he would kill him ! MIDGE . But she and me we persuaded him not to , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left you outside , where was he going ? MIDGE . Back to the dance hall  --  ATTORNEY . Where you all found him soon after with the murdered man ? MIDGE . Yes , sir . ATTORNEY . How long after ? MIDGE . I do n't know . ATTORNEY . Were you and North outside together , close by the door ? MIDGE . No , sir ; he was down by the bottom of the steps . ATTORNEY . Did you see anyone else go upstairs and into the room ? MIDGE . No , sir . ATTORNEY . Could anyone have gone up without your seeing them ? MIDGE . I do n't know , sir  --  I mean , no , sir . ( Audience shake their heads at their neighbors  --  JURY bus . ) ATTORNEY . Your witness , Mr. North . ( ATTORNEY motions to TEDDY  --  TEDDY rises . ) TEDDY . Midge , dear  --  MIDGE . Oh , Brother Teddy ! ( Begins to cry softly . ) TEDDY . ( Almost breaks down himself at the sight of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pauses to control himself ) Midge , I 'm awfully sorry to ask you this , but for my sake you 'll have to brace up , little girl , and answer . I think there 's a mistake in the minds of the jury about the cause of my quarrel with Mr. Weston which you overheard . What was the cause ? MIDGE . ( Slowly  --  after a moment ) Me  --  it was me  --  ( JURY bus . All look from one to the other  --  similar movement on the part of the JURY . ) TEDDY . Was Mrs. Weston in any way mentioned ? MIDGE . Why , you know , Brother Teddy  --  TEDDY . Yes , I know , little girl , but they do n't ! MIDGE . No , she had n't nothing whatsoever to do with it . ( JURY bus . The public nod their heads to each other . The JURY shows intense interest . ) TEDDY . And the quarrel was because  --  MIDGE . Because Mr. Weston had said to me what he had n't ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Beginning to cry again )  --  and I told you ! TEDDY . When we were outside , did I hurry back ? MIDGE . No , we walked about for ever so long , till the mad was all cooled down out of you , and then we sat down at the foot of the steps and I sang you your song all through . TEDDY . How many verses ? MIDGE . Three . TEDDY . That would take from five to ten minutes , would n't it ? MIDGE . ( Very affirmatively ) Well I guess ! TEDDY . And when I went back to the hall , how did I appear ? MIDGE . ( Crying , speech broken with sobs ) Why , when you left me you was happy and a-whistling . Oh ! How could anyone think it was you done such a thing ! ( She breaks down entirely . ) TEDDY . ( Tears in his eyes and in a husky voice ) Thank you , Midge ! That 'll do . ( To JUDGE ) Your Honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ( A short pause . Several voices in the audience heard blowing their noses and clearing their throats . The JURY looks solemn and inscrutable . TEDDY sits in his chair , his forehead in his hands . The SHERIFF takes MIDGE to her seat . JOE rises and takes her beside him  --  they sit with JOE 'S arm around her . ) JUDGE . Bring the next witness ! ATTORNEY . Mrs. Jessica Weston . ( SHERIFF opens the door and beckons . Intense curiosity on part of the public , who crane their necks to catch the first glimpse . TEDDY lifts his head with his face tense . RANSOM 'S hand holds it in a tight grasp . Enter MRS . WESTON . Excited whispers among the public of " That 's her ! That 's the wife ! " Led by the SHERIFF , she takes her place at the witness stand . ) ATTORNEY . Your name is ? MRS . WESTON . Jessica Weston . ATTORNEY . The widow of Mr. Weston ? MRS . WESTON . Yes . ATTORNEY . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . ATTORNEY . And during that time what was the nature of your home life ? MRS . WESTON . We never lived happily from the second week of our marriage . ATTORNEY . Was your husband a quarrelsome man ? MRS . WESTON . No , not with men . ATTORNEY . Had he any strong enemy in Silverville beside the prisoner ? ( She looks at TEDDY kindly a moment . ) MRS . WESTON . I do not know that Mr. North was my husband 's enemy . ATTORNEY . A man who wishes to marry another man 's wife is more or less the enemy of the husband  --  MRS . WESTON . I do not admit that Mr. North wanted to marry me . ATTORNEY . Do you deny that he was in love with you ? MRS . WESTON . He never told me so . ATTORNEY . There was not a tacit understanding that , were you a widow  --  of course , we will suppose by natural events  --  there would be a marriage between you and the prisoner ? MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising excitedly ) Your Honor , I object to the examination , which is an insult to this lady ! I can furnish plenty of proof that I was never anything but an object of derision to Mrs. Weston . JUDGE . The objection is not sustained ! ( TEDDY sits . ) ATTORNEY . ( With meaning emphasis ) Since you both find this subject so disagreeable , we will leave it for the present . What took place between your husband and North , shortly before the murder , in your presence ? MRS . WESTON . ( After a slight pause ) A quarrel  --  but my husband was to blame . ATTORNEY . Oh , naturally ! What was the object of the quarrel ? MRS . WESTON . Weston had insulted Mr. North 's ward . JUDGE . You were in no wise connected with the quarrel ? MRS . WESTON . No ! My husband would never have quarrelled over me . He would have been glad of no matter how compromising attentions , if they only kept out of his way . ATTORNEY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your husband over you ? MRS . WESTON . No ! ATTORNEY . Oh ! It was necessary , then , in order to quarrel with your husband on your account to bring upon a disagreement on some other subject ? ( A general alert movement among the public and the JURY as they follow the ATTORNEY 'S train of reasoning . ) That is very simple . It has been done for many centuries . MRS . WESTON . ( Sort of helplessly ) I had nothing to do with the quarrel between the two men . JUDGE . In this quarrel were violent words used ? MRS . WESTON . ( After a short pause of unwillingness to speak ) Yes . JUDGE . On the part of the prisoner ? MRS . WESTON . ( Same pause ) Yes . ( Movement and whispering among the public . Exchange of glances among them . As the JUDGE asks his next question JOE " Shs ! " the crowd into silence , and the silence and the attitude of listening are more intense . ) ATTORNEY . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  ATTORNEY . You begged North to withdraw ? MRS . WESTON . Yes . ATTORNEY . Then you were afraid of the consequences if he remained ? ( MRS . WESTON bows her head in assent . ) I presume , as you must have known North 's reputation for strength , you did not fear any harm he might receive from your husband ? MRS . WESTON . No  --  ATTORNEY . And I take it for granted , under the circumstances , you had not any great solicitude for your husband ? ( A short pause . ) There is only one other fear , then , left open to you , and that is the fear of the consequences for North , should he harm more than was lawful the man at whom he was enraged . Did he , the prisoner , use specific terms in his threat ?  --  I must warn you to remember that you are under oath , and that I have already examined other eyewitnesses of the quarrel . Could you repeat what North said , or even approximate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not at all ? MRS . WESTON . Not at all . ATTORNEY . Did he say , for instance , " I 'll knock you down " ? ( A derisive exclamation , a sort of half-laugh from TEDDY . ) MRS . WESTON . No ! ATTORNEY . He more probably said , " I 'll kill you ! " or words to that effect ? MRS . WESTON . ( Still slightly scornful ) Much more probably ! ATTORNEY . Ah ! ( Short start on part of public . ) MRS . WESTON . ( Quickly ) As a man will do in a great rage without meaning literally what he says ! ATTORNEY . But in this case the man threatened was killed not many minutes after . MRS . WESTON . ( Slightly excited ) I saw Mr. North leaving the room without harming my husband . ATTORNEY . Did he say nothing about coming back ? ( MRS . WESTON does not answer . ) You interrupted the quarrel for a moment , but was nothing said about resuming it later ? ( MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ? ( She hesitates . ) JUDGE . You can scarcely fail to see , Madam , that your refusal to answer will be construed into an affirmative reply . MRS . WESTON . No ! No , he is innocent ! ATTORNEY . But there was something said about returning later to finish the quarrel ? MRS . WESTON . Yes , but  --  ( interrupted . ) ATTORNEY . ( Interrupting ) After North left the room , what happened ? MRS . WESTON . I had some words with my husband . ATTORNEY . About North ? MRS . WESTON . No ! No ! Then I went into the dressing room beyond with Miss Prissims , to ask her not to repeat what she had overheard . ATTORNEY . You left your husband alone in the dance hall ? MRS . WESTON . Yes . ATTORNEY . What called you back , a noise ? MRS . WESTON . No , I heard nothing . I came back to join my guests . ATTORNEY . And during all this time where was your pistol ? MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . I gave it to someone early in the evening to put aside  --  while I was dancing . ATTORNEY . To whom did you give it ? MRS . WESTON . ( Evading ) There were several men near me  --  it made no difference to whom I gave it  --  it was placed one side at once  --  ATTORNEY . Did you give it to North ? MRS . WESTON . ( After a short pause ) Yes . ( A long sigh from the audience . MRS . WESTON begins to grow terrified as she sees to what her replies are leading . ) ATTORNEY . To go to your entering the room again where you had left your husband , what did you first see ? MRS . WESTON . ( Growing more and more terrified ) Nothing  --  It was  --  dark ! All dark ! ATTORNEY . You came slowly forward ? MRS . WESTON . ( Seeing the scene before her as she speaks , and forgetting the courtroom and her audience ) Till I saw something like a shadow lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming what it was , till I reached the dead body of my husband !

Come , come , Madam ! What did you see ? MRS . WESTON . ( As if in a trance ) I do n't know  --  I do n't know ! ATTORNEY . You saw North . MRS . WESTON . ( Still partly dazed ) Yes , I saw North .

If I convict him , let me swear again every word I have spoken is a lie ! ( JURY bus . She sinks into the witness chair , her face buried in her arms , sobbing aloud . ) ( MIDGE goes to MRS .

WESTON ) That night when you found North above the dead body of your husband you did not think he had killed him ? MRS . WESTON . He himself had sworn to his innocence  --  ATTORNEY . But at the scene of the murder and beside the body  --  the supreme test  --  he confessed his guilt . ( To the JUDGE ) Your Honor , I am finished with the witness .

Mrs. Weston , you just now said you believed in my innocence ? MRS . WESTON . Absolutely ! TEDDY . ( Affirmatively ) But your evidence was true , all the same ? ( She nods affirmative . ) Only your belief in my innocence is so great that you thought perjury justifiable if necessary to save my being unjustly condemned ? MRS . WESTON . ( Very low voice ) Yes  --  TEDDY . ( Very embarrassed ) I must now ask you an awful embarrassing question . There is an opinion in the court that it is n't so much absolute belief in my innocence as love for me that has influenced you in my behalf . The only way to properly disabuse their minds is for me to ask you a question outright , and you will speak the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEDDY .

He makes a sudden movement of great surprise and looks at her , dumbfounded , unable to speak or even to breathe for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , forgetful for a moment of her surroundings . The pause should be held as long as possible . Finally TEDDY makes a movement and gesture of not being able to comprehend it or realize it . He turns questioningly to RANSOM . RANSOM smiles very slightly but sympathetically back . TEDDY leans over and whispers to RANSOM . RANSOM nods his head emphatically . ) TEDDY . Pete ! Pete ! Did I hear right ? ( Embracing PETE . Music stops . PETE nods his head again . TEDDY turns to JUDGE . ) Your Honor , will you kindly ask the witness to repeat the answer ? JUDGE . The witness stated that she did love you , which is what the State maintained . TEDDY . I never guessed it ! Never ! JUDGE . The point is that her love for you naturally prejudices her in your favor , and accounts for her belief in your innocence . Do you wish to further examine the witness ? TEDDY . Well , I should say I did ! ( Pulling himself together . He looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . ) Jessica , on that awful night  --  ( Interrupted . ) JUDGE . Address the witness as Mrs. Weston , please  --  this is a trial , not a courtship . TEDDY . Did I ever make love to you ? MRS . WESTON . No . TEDDY . Did you ever give me any idea that you loved me ? MRS . WESTON . I did n't love you until the night of the dance , and I did n't realize I loved you until the day after  --  TEDDY . Really ! What made you ? ( Interrupted . ) JUDGE . That question is not pertinent . TEDDY . Excuse me , Your Honor . ( He turns to MRS . WESTON and throws her a kiss slyly . ) You first saw me after the death , standing over the body ? MRS . WESTON . Yes . TEDDY . Could you say I had not entered the room at the same time as you ? MRS . WESTON . ( Catching the idea ) No , no ! Why not ? That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide my entering ? MRS . WESTON . Of course it was . It was all black except where the moonlight streamed . TEDDY . ( To MRS . WESTON ) Thank you . ( To JUDGE ) I have finished with the witness , Your Honor . ( He sits . ) ( MRS . WESTON goes to a seat which is ready for her by MIDGE , and in front of the rest of the public , led by TEDDY . ) ATTORNEY . That is the case for the prosecution , Your Honor . JUDGE . How much time , gentlemen , would you like to sum up ? TEDDY . I shall not take five minutes , Your Honor . ( Goes back to seat . ) ATTORNEY . Your Honor , I shall not take as much . ( JURY bus . Movement among JURY and among public . TEDDY sits . JUDGE speaks a word to the SHERIFF and then nods to TEDDY to go on . TEDDY makes ready to address the JURY . The public take their settled positions and sit rigid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he begins . ) TEDDY . Your Honor , I shall not attempt to stir your blood with any ornamental rhetoric , nor wet your eyes with any pathetic appeal . I wish to trust my life not to your emotions , but to your common sense . I am innocent , and knowing that , I have been and am not now afraid to trust myself alone and otherwise undefended to your unprejudiced judgment . I could have brought famous lawyers from the East to defend me , but I did n't feel I needed them . Out here in the great West it is truth we are looking for and we know it when we see it . OMNES . You 're right , etc . You bet we do ! ( A slight pause  --  " Good ! Good ! " from crowd . ) TEDDY . It 's the truth that I offer in my defense , and that I can do without help from anyone . My Eastern life is open to you  --  my college record  --  and afterwards in New York . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character ! And out here  --  in Colorado  --  ( Turns ) Is there a man in this room or outside under God 's sky for miles around that can accuse me of ever doing anyone an injury or of having committed any dishonest act ? ( Pause . Loud " No , no ! " from the public . ) JUDGE . Address the Jury , not the public . TEDDY . I beg your pardon . Witnesses have proved to you that I have always been on the side of law and order . The only thing that could rightly tell against me was giving myself up that night . But what I did was only natural . Every man values more highly than his own life the life of the woman he holds most dear . That is the only essence of love , whether it 's for the woman you wish to make your wife or for the woman who brought you into the world ! Your action may be wise or foolish , but at such a moment you do n't weigh your act ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course ! " JIM , unseen among the public , hisses . ) I claim some husband , or brother , or honest lover unlawfully avenged himself on Weston , not I. The pistol was there for anyone to find and use . The circumstances which seem so fatal to me can be made equally fatal to any number of imaginary cases , and they do not and can not prove me guilty , I maintain , standing here with my life spread out before you , and swearing by everything I am , as I believe in an eternal life , that I am innocent  --  innocent  --  innocent ! ( Crowd count three  --  then applaud . ) ATTORNEY . ( Rising quickly and speaking excitedly ) Facts ! Your Honor , facts ! Gentlemen of the Jury , facts ! The accused has not disproved one of the facts that convict him of the murder . He has denied them  --  that is usual ! He has pointed out some other might have committed the crime  --  that is also customary ! I do not claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a depraved character  --  but I do maintain for what is proved , I believe , by the facts , and on these facts I rest my case . ( He sits . ) ( Audience whisper to each other . The public is still , deeply depressed . Only one or two speak to each other in silent whispers . The JURY silently whisper among themselves . The Foreman speaks a word to the man behind him , who nods his head . ) JUDGE . Mr. Foreman , gentlemen  --  ( A look from the FOREMAN toward the other JURYMEN , who each nod in the affirmative to the FOREMAN . ) FOREMAN . ( Rising ) May it please Your Honor , the Jury are ready with their verdict without leaving the room . ( Great commotion and excitement among the public . Those at the back rise to see better . ) CLERK . The prisoner will please rise and face his Jury . ( TEDDY rises and calmly but with a set face looks at the JURY . ) JUDGE . Mr. Foreman , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Slowly , impressive ) May it please Your Honor , we find the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree . CLERK . So say you , Mr. Foreman  --  so say you all ? ( All bow their heads in solemn affirmation . A short silence . TEDDY half sways back and forth , but immediately becomes rigid , keeping his gaze on the JURY . At the giving of the sentence , MRS . WESTON , with a loud breath of horror , has risen from her seat . ) JUDGE . Edward North , have you anything further to say why sentence should not be passed upon you for the crime of which you are convicted ? ( In the public there is a commotion which begins during this speech of the JUDGE . As he finishes the commotion is greater . MOLLY is trying to speak and is making inarticulate sounds . JIM 'S hand is over her mouth and he is saying , " Keep quiet ! " " Stop ! " etc . Another voice says , " Let her alone ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOLLY . Wait ! Wait ! He did n't do it , so help me God ! JIM . Shut your jaw  --  MOLLY . ( Pushing her way out from among the People ) I was in my room that night all the time . I swore false when I said I went down the road ! ( She is out from among the people by now ) I know who did it ! ( Crosses to L. ) JIM . Dat 's a lie ! ( Great commotion among public . ) JUDGE . Order , or I 'll clear the court ! MOLLY . Lemme kiss the book ! I 've been afraid of him , but I ca n't see no innocent man swing for what he done ! I 'll tell you who did it ! ( Crosses up to table  --  takes book . ) JIM . Do n't you speak a word ! MOLLY . Gim me the book ! ( MOLLY seizes the book . ) Gim me the book ! ( Presses it to her lips . At that moment JIM shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor . Tremendous commotion . The public falls on JIM , who tries to make his escape . MRS . WESTON comes forward quickly to MOLLY , also JUDGE goes to her , and TEDDY . ) JOE and CROWD . Shoot him ! Do n't let him get out ! Shoot ! ( There is a great noise  --  all shouting . ) TEDDY . ( Springs to the crowd , climbing upon their backs and breaking through them ) Boys ! Boys , stop ! For God 's sake , do n't kill him ! Do n't you see , the woman 's dead , and only he can save me ! THE CROWD . ( Not hearing TEDDY ) Shoot him down ! Kill him ! ( JIM in extreme corner R. , down stage , thrown down , with JOE holding him down . ) TEDDY . ( With a supreme effort TEDDY breaks through the crowd and reaches JOE , PETE and JIM . The crowd falls back and gradually grow quiet . To JOE ) Give him to me ! He 's mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DAVE and SHERIFF , RANSOM and a doctor from the crowd have carried MOLLY into the room where the witnesses were . ) JUDGE . ( To TEDDY ) Bring the man here ! ( TEDDY brings JIM to JUDGE  --  throws him L. JIM is sullen and dogged . ) JUDGE . ( To JIM ) Why did you shoot your sweetheart ? JIM . She talk too much . JUDGE . You know you will hang for it ? JIM . Naw ! She not dead . Jim only make her tongue quiet . Jim frighten Molly , but Jim not kill her ! JUDGE . Why were you afraid to have her tell who killed Weston ? ( JIM does not answer . ) TEDDY . He 's got to speak ! JIM . Jim wo n't speak . TEDDY . Your Honor , he must ! ( Re-enter MRS . WESTON  --  she goes to the JUDGE . ) MRS . WESTON . The woman is dead . JIM . Molly ! ( He stands as if in a trance . ) JUDGE . ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) TEDDY . ( Interrupts ) Your Honor  --  ( With a motion toward JIM , whose lips are quivering and moving as if to speak . ) JIM . ( To himself , half singing ) Jim did n't mean to do that . Jim 's tried it and he do n't want no life without Molly . The sun would set forever behind her grave and the stars be blind and the moon go mad . ( He pauses a second and then looks up and speaks aloud . ) Do n't hurry , Molly ! Jim he coming after  --  he catch up with you ! ( To those about him ) It was me killed Weston because he try to take away Jim 's girl ! Now you-uns kill Jim ! ( A loud " Ah ! " from the public , some standing , some sitting , in disorder . MRS . WESTON seizes TEDDY 'S arm . He holds her hand . MIDGE comes quickly to the other side of TEDDY and then takes that arm . ) SHERIFF . ( Enters from R.B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She will live ! ( There is a moment 's surprise . Then JIM makes a bolt to escape R. The crowd meet and stop him with cries , laughs and jeers . ) JUDGE . Arrest the half-breed ! ( SHERIFF goes to JIM . ) The court will take a recess until to-morrow morning at nine o'clock . TEDDY . ( C. , going to MRS . WESTON ) You know what you said under oath you 'll have to stick to ! MRS . WESTON . ( C. ) I 'm game ! TEDDY . Bully ! ( Music swells . ) Back matter QUICK CURTAIN
