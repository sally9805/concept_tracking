REAL UTOPIAS IN THE ARID WEST . THE unknown settler who built his cabin on the last free homestead in " the rainbelt " was a character of some historical importance . He closed one act in the continental drama of colonization . He was the prophet of another act to be played in the strange setting of a region of complete aridity . Beyond the place where he had paused lay half a continent , requiring new methods and promising new institutions . Differing widely from the old land in soil and climate , in scenery and resources , the new land presented its deep and fundamental contrast in demanding irrigation as the sole condition on which an enduring civilization might flourish . The character of this civilization is revealed in communities already created by the pioneers . I. THE GREELEY cOLONY . The Greeley Colony of Colorado sprang belated from the seed of Fourierism sown broadcast in the forties . The failure of Brook Farm and of the numerous Phalanx communities - embalmed in the public memory as half pathetic , half ridiculous - had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace Greeley had espoused the French philosophy in the morning of his fame . He had stood stoutly by it in the hour of its humiliation , when actual experience had left it a defeated cause . In the minds of the devoted constituency of his Tribune , the idea of colony-planting as a means of improving the lot of average humanity had taken deep root , so that twenty-five years after Fourier 's dream had ceased to flourish as a social experiment , a colony representing its hopes , if not its methods , could gain supporters . The new venture was initiated by Nathan Cook Meeker , who had succeeded Solon Robinson as agricultural editor of the New York Tribune at the close of the war . In 1844 Mr. Meeker had been an active participant in the Trumbull Phalanx at Warren , Ohio . This had expired of ague , poverty , and dissension , after a fitful career of about three years . " If the place had been healthy , " Mr. Meeker said afterwards , " we should have held out longer , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrious and patient ; but I have no reason to suppose that we should not have finally exploded* either in some fight , or at least in disgust . " From this experience he emerged disappointed and destitute , but with valuable lessons for the future and unshaken faith in the utility of colonization effort . The knowledge thus dearly bought he was destined to apply , many years later , in a useful career as one of the founders of a State . In the fall of 1869 Mr. Meeker had returned from a trip to the Far West , the object of which was to describe the Mormon industrial system in a series of letters to the Tribune . Encountering a snow blockade at Cheyenne , which compelled him to postpone his visit to Utah , he had gone to Colorado instead . It was at the time when the Kansas Pacific Railroad was pushing across the plains to the budding village of Denver , transforming the wagon-trail into a highway of civilization . Everywhere Mr. Meeker beheld the dawn of a new industrial life in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery , and impressed with the material wealth of the country 's undeveloped resources . The old enthusiasm for colony-making filled his imagination . Wearied with a life struggle to remodel old social structures , he longed to avail himself of this opportunity to // build on new foundations . These hopes he communicated to his friend . John Russell Young , who agreed to bring the matter to the attention of Horace Greeley . This he did at a dinner held at Delmonico 5 in December , 1869 . Mr. Greeley was instantly interested , and beckoned Mr. Meeker to join him at the table . " I understand you have a notion to start a colony to go to Colorado , " said the editor . " Well , " lie continued , " I wish you would take hold of it , for I think it will be a great success , and if I could , I would go myself . " Thus assured of powerful backing , Mr. Meeker at once proceeded to form his plans . The prospectus of the new colony was drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Greeley . A quarter of a century had elapsed since these men had been engaged - the one as active participant , the other as the most conspicuous American champion - in the Fourier scheme of association . It is interesting to observe just how much of the old plan survived in the new colony prospectus , when the thought of these leaders had been mellowed and broadened by many more years of life and experience . In the Fourier communities the people had lived together under one roof , in the hope of effecting large household economies . There had been common ownership of land , and an attempt at equal division of labor . The unit of the community was the whole ; the only individual , the public . Fourier had predicted that this plan would " reduce by two thirds the expense of living , " and " quadruple the products of civilization . " But one of the historians of Brook Farm relates that in that case it developed a community with " a surplus of philosophers and a dearth of men who could hoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system permitted the idle and improvident to live at the expense of the industrious and patient . In forming the plan of the new colony the lessons of experience were not forgotten . There was but a single suggestion of the " phalanstery , " or common household of Fourier days , and that was advanced in timid terms . " It seems to me , " Mr. Meeker wrote , " that a laundry and bakery might be established , and the washing and baking done for all the community ; but other household work should be done by the families . " It was provided that the unit of society should be the family , living under its own roof ; that farms and homes should be owned independently ; that individuals should plan their own labor , and rise or fall by their industry and thrift , or lack of them . The new ideal was that of an organized community which should give the people the benefit of association without hampering individual enterprise and ability . It furnished a means of settlement essentially different from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be purchased on a large scale with a common fund . This cheapened its cost , and gave the colonists an important measure of control in its subdivision and development . The settlement was to be made almost wholly in a village , the land being divided into blocks often acres , and the blocks into eight lots for building purposes . It was proposed to apportion each family " from forty to eighty , even one hundred and sixty acres , " adjoining the village . Northampton , in Massachusetts , and several other New England towns and villages , had been settled in this manner . A feature of much interest was the proposal to have the residence and business Lots sold for the benefit of the colony 's treasury , the capital so obtained to be appropriated for public improvements , such as building a church , a town hail , and a schoolhouse , and establishing a public library . This plan marked an important departure in town-making . Town sites , as a rule , especially where the community promises a rapid growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // comes , and everybody prospers ; the boom goes , and a few schemers have managed to acquire nearly all the cash capital . Under the new plan , as the prospectus pointed out , " the increased value of real estate will be for the benefit of all the people . " They would receive these benefits , too , in the best form , as in the shape of permanent improvements essential to their social and intellectual well-being , and of capital available for industrial purposes . Other advantages of settling in a village were presented as follows " Easy access to schools and public places , meetings , lectures , and the like . In planting , in fruit - growing , and improving homes generally , the skill and experience of a few will be common to all , and much greater progress can be made than where each lives isolated . Refined society and all the advantages of an old country will be secured in a few years ; while on the contrary , where settlcments are made by old methods people are obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This prospectus was published in the New York Tribune of December 14 , 1869 , with a hearty editorial indorsement . Spite of radical departures in the matter of private landholding and individual industry , the vital spirit of Fourierism lived and breathed through the cautious lines of the announcement . There was still the high ideal of social and civic life , of industrial independence , of a scheme of labor which should give to the laborer an equitable share of what he produced . There was still the plan of co*iperatiou in achieving things for the common benefit . There was still the craving for a society composed of sober , temperate , industrious people . The common household had been discarded for the family home and hearthstone , but for the barbarism and isolation of life on great farms there had been substituted the association of homes in the village centre , with the best social and intellectual opportunities . Behind the new plan , as behind the old , stood the patient energy and faith of Meeker and the glorious optimism of Greeley . The announcement had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several hundred people , who had organized the Union Colony of Colorado at a meeting held at the Cooper Institute in New York , where Horace Greeley had presided . A committee had selected twelve thousand acres of railroad and government land in the valley of the Cache la Poudre , twenty miles northwest of Denver , on the line of railway then building to Cheyenne . The pioneers of the colony were thus able to begin settlement in the spring of 1870 , and to bring to the test of actual experience the social and industrial plans set forth in the prospectus . A party of Eastern people , most of whom came from cities , they entered cheerfully upon the task of adjusting a high ideal to the untried conditions of a country which had previously known only the Indian , the hunter , and the cowboy . Their experience for the next twenty years has a larger significance than merely local history , since the community is one of the landmarks in Western life . Mr. Meeker having refused the use of his own name , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was popularly applied to the colony also , in spite of its incorporated title . The first severe test of the cooperative principle , which had been relied upon for the larger enterprises , arose in connection with the building of canals . There had been no misconception as to the need of irrigation , but it was supposed that the works could be quickly constructed and the new methods of agriculture readily learned . The original estimate of cost was twenty thousand dollars . The actual outlay before the works were completed reached four hundred and twelve thousand , or more than twenty times the estimate . For resources to meet this unexpected demand , the colony had only receipts from the // sales of property and the subscriptions and labor of its members . The result was not reached without serious dissensions and some desertions , but the works were built , and the community survived with its cooperative principle intact . It is not to be believed that a private enterprise could have lived through a similar experience with the same slender financial resources , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this critical juncture . These increased as difficulties multiplied , and rose with the tide of outside criticism and abuse . The process welded the people together , and made them strong enough to meet successfully the obstacles which yet remained . Having provided water for their lands , the settlers proceeded to create the irrigation industry of Colorado ; for nothing worthy of the name existed on the scattered ranches of the sparsely settled Territory . The new-comers brought their intelligence to bear upon the problem of perfecting skillful methods of irrigation and cultivation , and of discovering the classes of crops best adapted to the soil and climate . This work quickly led them to realize another disappointment of serious import . They had dreamed of orchards and vineyards , and of homes set in the midst of beautiful flowers and delicate shrubbery . Experiment soon taught them that they had been deceived about the character of the country . The hopes which had been built upon the fruit industry failed utterly , and the colonists were compelled to fall back upon general farming . This involved somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their social plans . Very likely it saved them from the evils of the single crop which has marred the prosperity of many agricultural districts . The diversified products of the soil yielded them a comfortable living . Since there was no hope of obtaining cash income from fruit , they sought another surplus crop , and found it in the potato , to which their soil proved to be peculiarly adapted . They made an exhaustive study of this culture , and at last produced in the " Greeley potato " one of the famous crops of the West . Its superiority readily commands the best place in the market , and there have been years when the crop has returned a million dollars to the potato districts of which the colony is the centre . The farmers invented a pool system which frequently enabled them to control the output , and so influence prices in their favor . Events proved that the colonists were gainers by reason of the trials and disappointments which attended the establishment of their industrial life . Though the cost of their canals had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much cheaper than did subsequent conimunities who patronized private companies . At Greeley the cost of a water-right for eighty acres was three hundred and fifty dollars . This made the user a proportionate owner of the works . Where canals were private , settlers paid twelve hundred dollars for precisely the same amount of water , while the works remained the property of a foreign corporation . The difference in the price of water under the two systems represented a very handsome dividend for those who had persisted in their allegiance to the coöperative principle . In the same way , the colonists profited from their struggle to realize the best agricultural methods . They won a reputation for their products which possessed actual commercial value , and they became the teachers of irrigation ; furnishing practical examples to students of the subject , and contributing largely to its literature . These results must be credited to the fact that the community was organized , and that the people acted with a common impulse . Passing now from the industrial to the civic side of the colony life , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conceived left its marks not less indelibly . In the original prospectus // Mv . Meeker had plainly stated , " The persons with whom I would be willing to associate must be temperance men and ambitious to establish good society . " This was no sounding phrase , for the founder and his fellow-colonists wrote their principles into the title deeds which transferred farm and village property from the company to individuals . These provided that if intoxicating liquor were ever manufactured or sold on the land , title should immediately revert to the colony . The provision was enforced with splendid intolerance . Those who were not in accord with its spirit had not been invited to come , nor were they made comfortable while they stayed . Their unbending attitude on this subject gave the men of Greeley the title of " Puritans , " which was a unique distinction in the Far West , in that day of cowboys and border ruffians . The prohibition clause in the deeds was stoutly resisted by a small minority , and went from court to court , until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Greeley local sentiment has always upheld the principle , and insisted that it was responsible for the admittedly high character of the community . Like several of the colony 's plans , it has been extensively imitated . The government of the community was vested in executive officers , but was actually ruled by public opinion . This found expression in numerous town meetings held in Colony Hall , which was one of the earliest buildings erected . Here all the public affairs were discussed with perfect frankness to the last detail , and no public officer ventured to stray far from the conclusions there pronounced . Not even the early hardships and disappointments were permitted to mar the social life of the colony . The people made the most of the opportunities offered by the association of homes in the village , and organized a variety of social and intellectual diversions . At an early period an irreverent newspaper writer remarked , " The town of Greeley is a de lectable arena , for of the entire population three fourths are members of clubs that are eternally in session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fade , and the seasons roll round with the year , but Greeley clubs are unchangeable . " In one of the letters by which Mr. Meeker kept the readers of the New York Tribune informed of the progress of the community , he spoke of these " overflowing meetings , " and said , " In all our experience we have never seen such institutions so well sustained ; and if we wanted to show strangers the best that is to be seen of Greeley we would have them visit the Lyceum . " David Boyd , who was both a prominent actor in these scenes and the historian of the colony , writes of the same subject , and throws a suggestive side-light on a notable trait of Western life when he says , " In coming to a country which offered so many new questions for solution and presented so many new aspects of life , the minds even of those past their prime experienced a sort of rejuvenation . Being nearly all strangers to one another , each was ambitious to begin his new record as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremost . " Here is the explanation of much of the superior energy which marks the life of new communities , and here lies the hope of social progress through colonization . The individuality all but obliterated in the great city springs anew and develops into blossom and fruitage in the fresh soil of colonial life . Institutions which would be quite impracticable in old and crowded centres get a footing in new countries , where men may exert untrammeled energies , and move freely in that atmosphere of social equality which is certain to characterize new communities and likely to endure while they continue small . In considering the net results of Greeley Colony , it is important to note first that it has been thoroughly successful . In this respect it presents a striking contrast to the Fourier experiment from // which it may be said to have descended . Each man prospered according to his merit , and what the community undertook to do by means of coöperation it accomplished . It can not be said that the latter principle was applied extensively . The capital realized from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of canals as to leave little surplus for other industrial and commercial enterprises . If one half of this capital had been available for stores , banks , and small industries , it is likely that much which was necessarily left to private initiative would have been undertaken by the colony . In that case we should find broader lessons in cooperative effort than we do now . It is also important to note that the community owed its prosperity to its high ideal and uncompromising public spirit . There was here no common religious tie as in the early New England colonies ; no shadow of persecution such as that which bound the Mormon pioneers together in an indissoluble brotherhood . The nearest approach to this influence was the prohibition sentiment , and this formed but a small part of the original plan . These colonists were earnest men and women who bad gone forth to make homes where they could combine industrial independence with social equality and intellectual opportunity . They were grimly determined to accomplish what they had undertaken . This spirit , and this alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and laid the foundation for their permanent prosperity . Both Colorado and the arid West owe much to the example of Greeley . It lent an impulse to the development of their civic character , and made a deep and lasting impression upon their agricultural industry . The influence of the community on its immediate surroundings is yet more plainly visible . Its success resulted in large irrigation developments and numerous settlements in Colorado , Wyoming , and western Xebraska . A com community without a pauper or a millionaire , Greeley has yet had a surplus both of men and of capital to contribute to the making of new districts . The colony of to-day is a well-built town of comfortable homes and substantial business blocks , surrounded by well-cultivated farms connected by a comprehensive canal system , which is the property of the landowners . Although it feels the heavy hand of hard times , few communities in the world possess a better assurance of a comfortable living in the future , while none has better educational and social advantages . Horace Greeley followed the colony 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice , and even finding time to pay a hurried visit . His last letter to Mr. Meeker , written six days before his death , was as follows : " FRIEND MEEKER , - I presume you have already drawn on me for the one thousand dollars to buy land . If you have not , please do so at once . I have not much money , and probably never shall have , but I believe in Union Colony and you , and consider this a good investment for my children . " II . THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS . The most valuable lessons in all the romantic history of California may be found in a trivial corner of the great commonwealth . Upon a clear day the eye may readily scan its entire length from the San Timoteo Hills to the shining sea . Between its parallel mountain ranges the width of the district seems but Vwo or three miles , though in reality it is from ten to twenty miles . This is the San Bernardino Valley . It is upon this narrow territory that to a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here institutions have been created in the last thirty years which are destined to exert a powerful // influence upon the future life of the Pacific coast . In the stormy and heroic days of the gold epoch , of the Bear Flag , of the American conquest , and of the Vigilance Committees southern California played a small part . Its past is the dreamy memory of old mission days , of peaceful shepherds , of great haciendas , of a land dominated by Spanish folk and speech . The land was adesert of sage-brush and cactus , in which a few scattered mission gardens made charming oases . Along moist riverbottoms there were sometimes fields and gardens , though not of the highest type . Ga the uplands light crops of wheat and barley were occasionally harvested , if spring rains happened to be fairly generous . But it was , apparently , a country which offered nothing to the stranger save climate and scenery . To this barren place came irrigation and the AngloSaxon , bringing a new era in their train . The evolution of southern California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are Anaheim and Riverside . Both were undertaken by comparatively poor men , and made important contributions to the permanent prosperity of the district in which they settled . The success which they achieved and the methods by which they accomplished it colored and shaped the larger institutions which grew from these pioneer plantings . Anaheim owes its historical importance to the fact that it was the mother colony , but it gains added interest as an example of the way in which a number of petty capitalists may combine their means in large enterprises . It is useful , too , as showing the outcome of the settlement of city workingmen on agricuhural lands . Riverside represents a higher degree of social conditions , and is especially important and interesting as an example of the influence exerted by an entirely new element of population upon a country which had been neither developed nor appreciated by its natives and early settlers . A brief glance at the beginnings of these two communities is essential to any just comprehension of the condition and tendencies of the southern California of today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of Germans in San Francisco . They were all mechanics and small tradesmen , and each was possessed of a modest amount of savings . It was proposed that this capital should be united in a common fund and used for the purchase and improvement of a large tract of land . For this purpose a colony association was formed , the members paying one hundred dollars each , and agreeing to make further contributions in monthly installments . A committee was sent out to discover a good location and contract for its purchase . A body of land near the Santa Ana River , twenty-five miles southeast of Los Angeles , was chosen . A part of the colony was then detailed to build an irrigation canal , divide the laud into twenty-acre farms with a central village , and plant the whole tract in orchards and vineyards . In the mean time , the main body of the association remained in San Francisco , earning money and sustaining the work in the field . When the colony had thus been completely prepared for occupancy , the settlers came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assigning the farms to individuals by drawing lots . In order to make this division equitable , those who obtained the choicest property paid a premium , which was divided among those to whom the poorer places had fallen . Most of the colonists devoted themselves exclusively to agriculture , but enough opened small shops , and worked at their trades as blacksmiths , carpenters , painters , shoemakers , and tailors , to meet the needs of the community . With the division of the land the association settled its accounts , and only the irrigation canal remained public property . Coiiperation had served an excellent purpose , however , in enabling the people to obtain // their land at first cost , and to have it improved skillfully and economically in advance of their coming . Beyond the hope of dwelling beneath their own roofs and working for themselves , the founders of Anaheim had brought no special ideal to the southern valley . They were people of common tastes , well content with simple prosperity and comfort . The community was thoroughly successful . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life for the settlers . While a few became discouraged and sold out to their neighbors , much the greater number remained and became comfortably well off , while a few rose to wealth . They had come to the colony from the employments of city life , yet readily adapted themselves to the work of tilling the soil of their small farms . But the true importance of Anaheim was seen in the impulse which it gave to a new form of development in southern California . It had been a region of great ranches , where livestock and grain held almost complete sway . Anaheim pointed the way to the subdivision of large estates and the intensive cultivation of the soil with the aid of irrigation . This demoiistration was destined to work a revolution in the character of the people and country . The founding of Riverside followed that of Anaheim by a dozen years . The new colony was the conception of Eastern men , who issued their prospectus from Knoxville , Tennessee . They readily obtained a following , and proceeded without delay to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the faith to select a location which the natives and residents regarded as quite worthless , and the genius to create upon it the most ideal development which had been undertaken up to that time . They saw possibilities in the desert which flanked the bottom-lands of the Santa Ana River , and entered boldly upon the task of making them realities . This involved the construction of more elaborate irrigation facilities than had previously been attempted . Even more important was the faith of the new-comers that oranges could be produced in that climate upon a coInmercial scale . They staked the fate of their enterprise largely upon this idea . The fame of the Riverside orange , now known to the markets of the world , is the evidence of their success . The founding of the orange industry was , however , not their only achievement in an industrial way . Equally important were the improvements which they wrought out in the irrigation industry , both in the character of canal systems and in the art of applying water to the soil . The methods which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but scieutific . They not only failed to get the best results of which the soil and climate were capable , but injured the land and dissipated the water supply . The Riverside colonists applied superior intelligence to the study of this subject , just as they had done in the selection of their land and in the development of orange culture . It is no exaggeration to say that this policy has produced , along with scientific horticulture , the best irrigation methods known to the world . It is a fact both interesting and suggestive that these achievements were made by men who had settled in a new environment and boldly defied local traditions and advice . It is the social side of Riverside , however , which makes the strongest appeal to popular interest . The homes and avenues of this colony , which have been evolved from an inferior sheep pasture in less than a generation , are among the most beautiful in the world . In considering their widely celebrated charms , it should never be forgotten that these are the homes and surroundings of average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil . Making due allowance for climatic differences , there are equally beautiful residence districts in the suburbs // of great Eastern cities ; but these belong to people who enjoy a degree of prosperity much above the average , - to the small minority who are rich , or at least unusually well-to-do . They are not farmers , but business or professional men who have risen above the general level of society . At Riverside , on the other hand , at least ninety per cent of the total population live in homes which front on beautiful boulevards , presenting to the passer an almost unbroken view of wellkept lawns , opulent flower - beds , and delicate shrubbery . Newspaper carriers canter through these streets , delivering the local morning and evening dailies . Though this is a farming population , the homes are so close together that the people enjoy the convenience of free postal delivery . They fill their bath-tubs with water piped through the streets . They light their homes with electricity . In the centre of the colony they have fine stores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of the highest standard , and are housed in buildings the beauty and convenience of which bespeak the good public taste . A well-patronized institution is the club-house and its reading room . There is but a single saloon , and it is considered decidedly disreputable to frequent it . The first result of the early colonies was to give a tremendous impetus to the settlement and development of southern California . The fruits of this new impulse are seen in the scores of charming communities which stretch eastward to the margin of the Colorado desert , and southward to the border of Mexico . The impressive city of Los Angeles , which grows alike in good times and in bad , is another product of the movement which traces back to the humble beginnings of these pioneer settlements established by a superior class of Eastern immigrants . High land values and costly irrigation works have naturally resulted . But these are only the superficial evidences of economic forces which lie deeper , and which should be noted as the peculiar product of the colonial life of southern Calif orma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it inaugurated in the San Bernardino Valley , is the small farm made possible by irrigation . This is alone responsible for the character of industrial and social institutions and of the people who sustain them . Where farms are very small - in Riverside they are from five to ten acres in size - they necessarily belong to the many . This means a class of small landed proprietors at the base of society . The condition is one which forbids the existence of a mass of servile labor like that which lives upon the cotton plantations of the South , and , to a greater or less extent , upon large farms everywhere , including the greater part of California itself . On a small farm the proprietary family does most of the work . Hence the main part of the population in such districts as Riverside is independent and self-employing . The people of southern California are plainly moving along the line which leads to public ownership of public utilities and eot*perative management of commercial affairs . But with them the movement is an economic growth rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their environment and necessities . A great body of producers and proprietors of the soil , they formerly stood between private irrigation systems , supplying the life current of their fields , and private commission houses , furnishing the only outlet for their products . The condition was an intolerable one , since it made them utterly dependent upon agencies beyond their control . These instrumentalities the people are rapidly taking into their own hands , and it is inconceivable that they can ever again pass into private control . The principal irrigation canal at Riverside was originally projected as a cot*perative enterprise , but as it demanded a large expenditure it became private and // speculative before it was well advanced . It returned , however , to the ownership of the community . Even more striking is the lesson now in progress in the wonderful fruit district watered by the Bear Valley system . The building of these works furnished the basis for the most extraordinary irrigation speculation in the history of the West . About three millions of Eastern and foreign capital were invested in the enterprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reorganize the company , the bondholders themselves have turned to public ownership as the only practicable solution of the problem . The indications are that the people will get the works for very much less than they cost the builders . The legality of the Wright Irrigation District Law having recently been affirmed by the United States Supreme Court , it is probable that Calif ornia has seen almost the last of the attempts to establish the policy of private ownership of this most vital of all public utilities in arid regions . The system of cooperative fruit exchanges is carried forward by the same impulse . Already it handles more than half the enormous product . The producers have their own packing-houses , make cash advances to their members , and send their agents to represent them in distant markets . It is pleasant to note that beautiful homes and high average prosperity have not spoiled the democratic simplicity of these communities . After the adjournment of the International Irrigation Congress at Los Angeles in 1893 , its members enjoyed the hospitalities of many of the charming colonies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party by the people of Santa Ana , Sefior de Ybarrola , the representative of Mexico , paid a handsome compliment to the ladies who had waited upon the table . Afterward , one of the distinguished representatives of France remarked his surprise at hearing a public compliment to " the servants . " " What , " exclaimed Sefior de Ybarrola , " did you think they were servants ? Why , those were the leading ladies of Santa Ana . " " Do you mean to tell me , " the French delegate demanded in amazement , " that the leading ladies of Santa Ana put on aprons to serve strangers ? " " Certainly , " the Mexican replied ; " for in this country service is a title to respect . " The incident illustrates at once the hospitality and the equality which are characteristic of the social life of southern California . III . A NEW COLONIAL ERA . It is common to think of colonial times as of the past . In reality , growing nations sustain permanent colonial movements , sometimes seeking new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant when the United States need go beyond its own wide borders to make homes for its increasing population . The colonial movement of to-day and of the future will be directed in large measure to the arid region of the Far West . In many respects the new era differs from the past . The first contrast is in the source whence recruits are drawn . It is not a movement of foreign immigration , but preeminently one of domestic or interior immigration . We still receive accessions of foreign population , but they no longer flow to the agricultural lands of the West . They remain in the cities of the seaboard , making New York , Philadelphia , and Boston cosmopolitan communities . They fill the coal-mining districts of Pennsylvania and Ohio with Hungarian and Bohemian laborers . They replace the native artisans of Eastern manufacturing towiis with Canadians , Italians , and Armenians . They swell the population of // the Lake cities , such as Buffalo , Cleveland , Detroit , Chicago , and Milwaukee . This is one of the strong forces behind the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive color of a domestic immigration . The native population has suffered by the new process . Its standard of living has been imperiled , its very ability for existence menaced in a way . Hence it is the new-coiner who stays , the old settler who goes . Another contrast : The former domestic immigrant came mostly from the farms ; the present one comes mostly from the city . In the old days the farms had a surplus which naturallysought new farms in the West . During the wonderful urban growth of the past few decades the farms have been emptied , and many an old proprietor wonders who is to succeed him at his ancient hearthstone when he is gone . In the new tide of settlement , small merchants , small tradesmen , and small manufacturers are conspicuous . This is the natural result of the growth of great stores and factories and the rising power of great combinations of capital . A considerable class of energetic and once prosperous business men find it necessary to change their pursuits . Another important element is that of professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teachers . They are generally well educated , and have learned from experience that there is plenty of room at the top , but that the bottom is much nearer . It is no reflection upon the ability of many professional men to say that they have not succeeded in the cities , since their ranks are constantly swollen by a stream of recruits from numerous colleges . There are many thrifty mechanics among new settlers . They have noted the downward tendency of their trades , and are anxious to rear their children under better influences than those which prevail in large cities .

Such persons are advised by their physicians to seek the pure , dry air of the arid region . A hopeful chapter might be written on the achievements of those who have gone West to save their lives , and , having found their health , have blessed with their industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dangers which made settlement in the past a work of hardy heroism are entirely eliminated from the situation . Even most of the frontier lawlessness of a later period has vanished , and human life is rather more secure in Arizona than in the streets of New York . The time has come when gentle people can accomplish what formerly required the hardiest frames and the stoutest hearts . Of hard work there is quite enough for those who settle in new countries , and there will always be ; but the danger , the hardship , and the uncertainty inseparably associated with colonization in the past are unlikely to fill a single page of the history of the new era . When we comprehend the sources of the new immigration and the methods by which it does its work , it is not difficult to understand why different institutions may be anticipated as a logical result . People who have enjoyed the advantages of city life would naturally desire to develop high social standards in their new home . They would prefer a system which would give them neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of organizing industrial and commercial affairs in a large way , and having been in a sense victims of such organization , nothing is more certain than that they would seek to apply this principle to advantage in their own affairs . These conclusions are not speculative , since they are abundantly borne out by the plain tendencies of communities already founded by the pilgrim fathers of the new West . William B. Smythe . // NANSEN 'S HEROIC JOURNEY . THE ideas of men concerning the form of the earth go far to determine that sense of relation with nature which is so important a part of our intellectual conception . In the earlier stages of culture , the earth was conceived to be indefinitely extended , - lands beyond lands , an ( l seas beyond seas , until past all that the imagination could compass came the boundless ocean which surrounded the whole . It would seem that this ample concept would have opened the imagination , and incited men to range in ships or fancy over the limitless realm ; but it was not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Greeks or the folk of India , had very little regard for the unknown . The infinite was a bar to the imagination ; if you can go on forever , wIly go at all ? Among the adventurous spirits of antiquity there were few who turned towards exploration , and none who were tempted to seek the unknown seas . When the facts concerning the true shape and size of the earth became a part of the general intellectual store , there was a sudden development of interest in the undiscovered parts of the earth . The sphere , vast as it seemed , could be comprehended ; the conception of an antipodes and of realms grading from the tropics to the pole afforded a fair basis for the imagination . Speculations for adventure and of conquest were swiftly formed by all peoples who had the habit of the sea . What we may call the sense of the sphere entered the minds of men . After the motives of religious , commercial , and political conquest which characterized the centuries before our own , we find the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . There were no new lands of value to be won by sending a boat 's crew ashore to hoist a flag . Curiosity which could no longer hope to be gratified by the discovery of new continents turned to the depths of the sea or the life of distant lands : here the advance of knowledge has been so rapid that the matter long ago outran the public attention . There are few indeed who are stimulated by the discoveries concerning magnetic declinations , or the contents of the ooze of an ocean floor . So this curiosity about the globe , well developed by centuries of exercise , has had of late a scanty field of satisfaction . All the great popular mysteries of the tropics and the temperate zones are solved . The real students of nature know that our knowledge of the most familiar parts of the earth is so limited that it is in effect ignorance . But most people demand a tale of things unseen before , the sight of which has been gained by perilous labor . This popular demand for sensational discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until very modern times the public paid little attention to the polar regions : their impenetrable areas excited a certain amount of speculation among the northern peoples who dwelt upon their borders , yet they commanded no general attention ; but as the unknown disappeared from the lower latitudes , the adventurous spirits , lacking opportunity in the accessible parts of the world , were forced to try their powers on the ice-fields . The first voyages into the frozen seas of the north appear to have been made by the whalers of northern Europe , folk who have faced the dangers of that realm with admirable valor and paid their tribute of life for more than two hundred years . Then came the search for the polarward passage which might give a shorter route to China and the Indies . Last of all , beginning , we may say , with the expedition of Parry in 1821 , came the voyages which were in their purpose
