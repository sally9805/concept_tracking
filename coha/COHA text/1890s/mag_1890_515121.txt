A WOMAN ON HORSEBACK . BY ANNA c . BRAcKETT . THERE are books in plenty on riding , but most are concerned chiefly with men , and a woman studies them almost in vain to find any practical hints which will help her . In this country especially- is there a dearth of information . Our climate , so very hot in summer and so very cold in winter , would seem to leave no time but the spring and autumn in which a woman may really enjoy horseback exercise . Partly for this reason it happens that the women of the eastern United States are not celebrated as equestrians , though Hyde Park often exhibits as awkward riders as our own parks , and we can sometimes match the best of England . I am not concerned with riding for show , or to exhibit unusual feats of daring . I propose only to speak in a practical , common-sense way of riding for exercise , fresh air , and rest . Our girls and our women , as a rule , need riding more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of exercise from which a girl is debarred , and it is quite certain that in no other exercise permitted her can she put in play so many muscles and breathe in so much fresh air in a given length of time . As to the muscles , let any one testify after her first good ride as to the locality of the lameness which follows , and say whether it be special or general . This lameness is only the result of the unusual demand made on various muscles which commonly in a woman 's quiet life are almost unemployed . Wherever a lameness is felt , there is a muscle which has been called on for an unusual amount of tensionthat is , of activity . There ' are two cures for this lameness - the first , to stop riding , for thus the muscle which has been so unwontedly contracted and relaxed will soon return to its normal flabby and lifeless condition by not being used ; the second is to keep on as if nothing had happened . By this course the muscle becomes accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the fuller supply of blood , and grows hard and firm . We can take our choice as to which of these ways is preferable . One thing , however , must be assumed  --  to secure good results in the latter case the riding must be undertaken cautiously , and never persisted in till utter weariness supervenes . The rides should be short and gentle at first , and gradually increased in length . Weariness should be the signal for a stop . But this being understood , they should be persisted in day after day , and the lameness will take care of itself . Once gone , it comes not back again , or but slightly , after long absence from the saddle . The muscles all around hips , waist , and shoulders have been perman en tly strengthened and developed . The effect will be seen at once in a free and easy carriage of the whole body in walking* A good walk is the result not of strength alone , and never of effort ; it comes from strength under perfect control and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps in no // other way so pleasantly and surely as by riding . I might pause incidentally to speak of the greater security our girls would thus acquire in case of danger , from their control of more obedient and more flexible muscles ; but this is aside from the immediate subject . A woman should never attempt to ride at first any but a well-trained horse . To say nothing of the fact that she may learn bad habits from the horse , as well as he from her , she is encumbered with the folds of a skirt which , though not so ridiculously long and full as in the olden times , is yet sufficiently in the way to fetter her in case of a fall . It must not be forgotten that a woman has no means of influencing and controlling her horse beyond voice , whip , and bridle , while a man can bring to bear also the pressure of knee and leg . The fact that she has less strength than a man is , however , of the least consequence ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so enormously disproportioned that a little more or less on the part of the rider is not of much importance . I mean , of course , as to stopping or guiding . In the case of a runaway , the greater strength of the man comes into play in the form of endurance , enabling him to keep his seat longer , and not to fall off from sheer exhaustion . In any other way it may be doubted whether , even in a runaway , the man has the advantage . A maddened horse cares nothing for all the mere brute strength that any man can bring to bear . He may be guided , because the force of life-long habit takes precedence even of his present fright , but he can not be forcibly stopped . Besides , in any case , strength is not the force which can be used to advantage with a horse . That is his own weapon . That he understands . But the articulate voice is a mystery to him . It is something which he does not possess , and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he be intelligent and cunning , and able to invent and employ crooked ways to gain his clearly conceived ends , the cunning and the crookedness of the human race are immeasurably superior , and to them he must yield . The miracle of human speech and diplomacy are the winning cards in the game , and these are surely possessed by woman , unless all history and tradition lie . She should not , then , hesitate to ride from distrust of her physical strength , and yet , as has been said , let her not be foolhardy enough to ride an untrained horse , or one thak is known to have any special vice or trick . But , on the other hand , she should as well beware of an over-trained horse . I mean one that has been put through what is known as high - school training , and that has learned to look upon every slightest motion of hand , foot , or rein as a signal for some special performance on his part . With such a one , even the practised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , talking the language of a foreign country with but slight knowledge of its idioms , suddenly finds himself challenged to a duel because some innocent remark has been taken as an insult . One ought never to buy one of these highschooled horses without a written code of signals , which he should commit to memory , or perhaps might carry fastened before his eyes , attached in some way to the head-band . It takes months to learn the lessons which such a horse has to communicate , without such a code , and before " all the lessons are learned , " the rider , unless with a most excellent seat and a very level head , may find himself left behind . A horse for a woman to ride should , then , be well-trained , bridle-wise , with a delicate mouth , and a neck which has been well suppled , so that he will guide easily to right or left by the least pressure of the rein or the lash of the whip on either side of his neck . If a horse will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not really fit for the saddle . Then the rider and horse must be in a sense one . Each must perfectly understand the other . This condition implies power of comprehension , patience , and wisdom on the part of the rider . They are almost always to be depended on in a well-trained horse . But the perfect accord so necessary for perfect enjoyment can never be , unless you own your horse , and allow no one else to ride him for any considerable time . The unfortunate horses in a riding-school are like Pope 's women -- they have " no character at all . " They are ridden , or rather sat on and pulled about , by so many different people that in despair they give up trying to understand the meaning of their riders , if they ever have any , and become a sort of four-legged machines . But in reality every horse worth riding has an individuality of his own-an individuality much more marked than that // of most of our human acquaintances . He has his own particular likes and dislikes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke , which he never wearies of trying to play off , any more than your friend tires of repeating his own particular witticism . One of my horses has two jokes in which he particularly delights . One is , pulling suddenly round a corner where he knows he ought not to go ; and the other , making a supreme effort and cutting directly in front of another horse with whom he has been trying speed , and who he sees is beginning to get an inch ahead of him . To accomplish the first , he invariably selects a time when he is coming in on a full canter . He gives no sign of wanting to turn till he has nearly passed the road , when , feeling sure that he has put me off my guard , he wheel* as swift as a flash and dashes in . Having accomplished this , he knows perfectly that he will be whipped ; and though he winces at the lash , he evidently thinks to himself , " Well , I did it , anyway , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no particular harm in this ; but his other joke , of cutting right across the bows , so to speak , of perhaps two or three other horses at full speed , is too dangerous to be risked , and hence I am obliged to keep him out of the temptation which he is unable to resist . The rider must be mistress , and the horse , servant . So much is certain , but this being granted , there must be also a kind of friendly consideration for the servant on the part of the mistress . The horse should be allowed to have some good times " of his own . This , however , can be permitted only when you know that he is an obedient and respectful servant , as it is only to a well-proved servant of the human race that it is safe to allow liberties . There is no reason why he should not have his own little gallop , his own little trot , or his own little walk , provided that he is sure to obey you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , trot , or gallop . You must be in full sympathy with your horse . You must try patiently to understand him and his way of thinking , and here you have the advantage over him , for while all his processes of reasoning lie in the background of your own consciousness , and are states from which you have emerged , and into which you can go back by the force of your will , he never has been so far as you , and can not possibly comprehend and grasp your superior and farther developed methods . When you have voluntarily and patiently put yourself back into his circle , you will find that his way of reasoning and thinking is just the same as your own , only that his brain works more slowly . If he have time enough , he will reach a reasonable conclusion , but often it happens that before he has had time enough for this , his emotion of fear gets the mastery , and he sees no other refuge from evident or mysteriously threatening danger than flight . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never run away from a noise with no apparent cause , or from so small and harmless a cause as a mouse or a dragon-fly ? And what about a panic in a theatre , or on a steamer , or at a railroad accident ? The wisest among us shies , if in walking something-we may not at first know what-jumps out suddenly in front of us . The horse shies under the same circumstances , but he does it in dignified and well-bred silence , whereas many a man swears and many a woman screams . To the unprejudiced observer the brute may seem the wiser , after all . When you find your horse doing precisely the same thing that you do , instead of being angry with him , you ought , with a profound sense of pleasure , to recognize your close relationship to him . Meanwhile , however , you should remember that your swifter thought should come to his aid . If in his confusion and his momentary doubt he hears your voice or feels your hand upon his neck , he takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite alone in the danger , and you gain time for him , in which he may recover his senses . In dealing with my horses I am continually reminded of Morris 's graphic " tangled wolfish wit . " Their wit is " tangled " in comparison with ours . We must help them to untangle it by our straighter thought . I can not imagine any one becoming acquainted with an intelligent horse in the relation of mistress and servant without feeling a profound sympathy for the " tangled wit " which , through all its tangle , responds instantly to her helping hand or voice , and serves her so patiently and so faithfully . Well does Ruskin say : " There is in every animal 's eye a dim image and gleam of humanity , a flash of strange light , through which their life looks out and up to our great // mystery of command over them , and claims the fellowship of the creature , if not of the soul . " As no one can teach a child successfully who can not come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can train an animal who can not in some sense do the same thing , for otherwise no medium of communication can exist between the two except that of physical pain . A horse who has been trained simply by the whip can no more be depended upon than the child can be depended on for that knowledge and those habits which have been fiog* , ed , not into , but on to him . We certainly can understand something of the nature of those brains which in comparison with ours are undeveloped , and it seems to me that the line separating animals capable of training from those which are not so capable is drawn only by our own natures . In other words , if we could feel our way far enough back in our own consciousness to understand how a clam feels , judges , and acts , there would be nothing to prevent our training clams to perform several feats not now included in their list of accomplishments . The trouble is that we have grown too far away from the clam , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault is ours , not his . We have not , however , lived sufficiently beyond the horse to prevent our going back with a little effort to his stage of consciousness , and understanding how he reasons , and why he does as he does , and therefore there is no such barrier between us and him . We can send him our messages and our ideas when we once get telegraph wires up between us , and the names of the telegraph wires are sympathy , patience , and gentleness . By means of these three , we can teach an intelligent horse almost anything . There is a quaint and very suggestive story which bears on this point : In a rural village a horse had been lost , and no one was able to give any account of him except that he had been seen on the last day known grazing on a certain spot , with his head toward a large rock . After the search had been abandoned , all suggestions as to where he might have gone having proved unavailing , a simple-hearted lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly leading in the animal . When asked where he had found him , and how he could possibly have thought of so unlikely a place as the one where he really was , the lad answered , simply : " Why , they all says the last place he was seen was in Low 's lot looking toward the big rock , so I goes there and looks at the big rock , and I says to myself , Now if I was a horse , what would I do , and where would I go ? ' and I goes there and I finds him . " We have only to follow this example , to ask ourselves the same question , and we shall not often fail to " find " our horse . And when we have found him , we can manage him . First , then , as an essential to thorough enjoyment of riding , the horse and rider must be one , and one in sympathy quite as much as in motion . You can not ride really well till you understand his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you can be said to ride well till you feel as secure in your saddle as in your rocking-chair , and until , no matter what gait he assumes , you and he appear to belong together as one body . The horse is generally believed to have but little activity of the brain . It is stated that four hours ' sleep out of the twentyfour are all that he requires . The fact that he seems to need but little sleep is brought forward to prove that he has little mental activity . He is generally , in point of intelligence , compared unfavorably with the dog . We must not forget , however , that the dog is the companion of man , received into the house , and accustomed from his earliest years to the society of intelligent people . His mind has been by this means developed , his mental activity increased . And the cumulative effect of heredity must not be overlooked . It is an undoubted fact that a certain amount of knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation among what we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calves of the present day are less afraid of a railroad train than the cows were when railroads were first introduced . The dog has been in an atmosphere of education for thousands of years , but the horse has been left to the care of ignorant and brutal men , whose only idea of enforcing obedience is by means of a loud , harsh word , a blow , or a kick . When lie is left in peace , he is fastened generally with his head to a blank wall , where he can see nothing to interest him . Sometimes he must stand for long spaces of time in this way , the interminable , colorless day being broken only by the process // of cleaning and his three feeds . When his nervous nature under this strain invents some way of amusing himself and making time go a little more rapidly , he is roughly bidden to stand still , or is forced to stop his little play by the lash , and earns the title of a vicious brute . If a dog were subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he would require also only four hours ' sleep by reason of a " low mental activity " ? The Arabs make companions of their horses , and they get in return the services of willing and intelligent friends . Most horses have their viciousness thrust upon them , and even a vicious horse may be changed in nature by persistent and intelligent kindness . The horse has always done more reasoning than he has had credit for , and it is usually because he refuses to be a mere machine that he is punished . If we do not understand his continual protest against this degradation , it is only because we ourselves are lacking in intelligent perception . When he does not object to a cow or a whole drove of cows in the country , but shies and almost refuses to pass one in the city , it certainly shows that he has the faculties of memory , conception , comparison , judgment , and reasoning . When he passes a hundred street cars or wagons drawn by horses without notice , but shows unmistakable signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible means of motion , does he not testify to his grasp of the causal relation , and show that he is as ready as man ever has been to suspect the presence of the Prince of Darkness wherever his own intellect was unequal to the problem of explanation ? Has he not a clear idea of the flight of time when he calls you out to the stable to give him his dinner just at noon ? How does he find his mistress 's house among a whole street full of houses precisely alike , and never miss stopping at the right door ? As to intelligence and power of acquiring knowledge , there can be no doubt , and that implies attention , and also an appreciation of the laws of association . The horse certainly can distinguish sowe colors , for he is afraid of a red lantern when he does not mind a white one . I think there is no doubt that he also distinguishes green from red . In color knowledge he is not , then , so far behind the Greeks of Homer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cer tainly great power of invention , and of adaptation of means to non-existent ends . And he does not fail in cunning , nor , I think , in a sense of humor . The same incitements which move us to honorable action stir his nature ; the same discouragements lower his ambition , and precisely the same treatment is necessary with him as with children in educating them . No more valuable normal school exists for a teacher than the saddle if she would be successful with her human pupils , for here , as is true often in schools , the real teacher generally learns quite as much from the pupil as he from her . The horse shows the capacity for a mngnanimous trustfulness over and above all his suspicious nature when he will let his mistress come into his stall while he is lying down , and so at a disadvantage , and sit down upon him while he eats from her hand . And the same animal that will plunge wildly from the stable , buck-jumping and snorting , if the groom be on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under precisely the same circumstances otherwise , if he carries a woman . Such conduct as this , when it is found in human beings , is supposed to denote a royal nature . On the whole , it has always seemed to me that we might be much more humiliated at being forced to acknowledge our kinship with some of our nearer relations . We must never forget that in the case of animals the pupil can not rise higher than the teacher , and that the teacher must be thoughtful and intelligent . He must not only feel a kinship with his pupil , but he must recognize in him an individual character , and must adapt himself to that . No two horses are exactly alike in character any more than two people . With regard to the point of strongly marked individual character , the following stories may serve as illustrations : My " Mac " can not endure to be left alone , and nothing more is necessary to make him perfectly miserable and almost beside himself than to have his companions desert him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable . In the former case he becomes evidently anxious and nervous , and cries in the most pitiful way till he catches sight of them again , when the cry becomes a relieved and joyful whinny , and the unwilling and uncertain gait a glad gallop . In the latter case lie never ceases his restless motion and his cry of // loneliness , his eyes look wild , and he pulls his head impatiently away from any caressing touch . He had been sick for a week , so that one day I did not want him to go far or fast , and sent the other horses out before him , half an hour after they had gone , taking him down the river road . He was very nervous and uneasy , would walk for a while , and then throw up his head and break into a trot or a canter . When he came to the watering-trough he put his head down , but then suddenly concluded that he had no time to stop , wheeled sharply and went on , still as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This continued , I all the time bringing him down to a walk , and he over and over trying to break off , till we reached a fork in the road , and I turned him to the right . He obeyed the rein , and then stopped entirely and gave one of his despairing cries . However , I propose to be mistress and to direct as to the route , and so he had to go on , shortly after turning and going quietly back on the same road by which we had come . At supper I inquired Which road the other horses had taken , and found that they had gone down the river road , but at the fork had turned to the left across the bridge . The conclusion was irresistible : Mac had been anxiously following their trail and trusting to catch up with them till the scent failed and despair succeeded to hope . My Dick has been seen politely passing hay from his own pile to a strange horse that stood face to face with him in the stable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occurred to either of these horses to do what the other did . The average groom has never an idea that the horse is anything in and for himself . This is very forcibly suggested by the fact that we never find a groom to understand us if we speak of a horse 's right and left foot , meaning by these the foot which would be right and left to the horse . He knows nothing of any consciousness in the animal , and to him the feet are only " off " and " nigh , " th esetwo terms being relative to the man who walks by the side of his horse , and who , naturally carrying his only means of en- forcing obedience in his right hand , finds the horse 's right foot the one farthest " off " from him , and the left foot " nigh " him . If I speak of the right foot , thinkVOL . LXXX. - No. 476 : - 21 ing of what would be " right " to the horse 's thinking , the groom takes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right " to him , he being the only conscious being present , and supposes-I mean the " nigh " one , while I , giving my horse credit for consciousness mean the " off " one . This is a little point ? It only proves that the groom , as I said , never thinks of the horse as a somebody in and for himself , but as merely a something to be looked at from the outside . I have never known a groom to fail in confirming this theory . Again , ninety-nine out of one hundred grooms or stable-men will take it for granted that you are speaking to them if you speak to your horse , and will reply , with a little confused air , " What , ma'am ? " And when I say , " I was talking to my horse , " they look still more confused , and probably set me down as " either insane or the most eccentric woman in the city . " They will shout , " Stand still ! " or " Get over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Move over , little man , " or , " Come , my boy , " but they are incapable of comprehending that any person in her senses can actually address any remark to an animal . So long as horses are almost continually in the hands of people who are not able to educate or fact that they need little sleep to prove that they have naturally a small amount of brain activity . I suppose that the same statement . might be as well made with reference to the undeveloped human being , but it would not prove that he had not the capacity for development . What is learned by a horse , if put in daily contact for only three hours with an intelligent and sympathetic mistress , is very astonishing . He likes to be amused and to be played with . He should be kept always , if in a stall where he must be tied , with his head to the interior of the stable , and not to the dead-wall , so that he may see the passersby and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untied , lie will care for this himself . His comfort should be looked after as well as the convenience of the grooms . And when he is ridden , he should , as has been said , be allowed some liberties also . He should not find himself the slave of a despotic and capricious mistress , but her valued and trusted servant . // 242 This , of . course , assumes that the mistress is sure of her seat , which she must acquire for herself by practice . A woman s seat in the saddle is an artificial one , and no man can teach it to her . If she can not hold by her knee and by the combined action of the thigh muscles , she has no seat . She ought to be so sure of her seat that if her horse runs or shies , that is the last thing she will think of , because it has become a matter of instinct with her . She is not sure of her seat unless she can ride in perfect security and with perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins knotted and hanging on the horse 's neck , and her arms folded . ( It may be well to know , though you can not prevent a horse from shying , that a woman is more likely to lose her balance if he shy toward her feet rather than from them . ) Now she can not be sure of her saddle unless she is perfectly even and square in it . If she be so , she can lie down easily upon her horse 's back , touching both shoulders . If she find she can not do this , she is not even , and she should never give up trying till she can . If her knee-hold be good , she can raise herself again without the slightest pull af the rein . Besides acting as a test of an even seat , the ability to ride in this position would be found very useful in case of a runaway nuder low-hanging trees , as has been often shown . The position will also often prove a great rest in a long ride . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse , and when the muscles of the back are tired , five or ten minutes of lying down , while the horse walks quietly , will prove a very refreshing change . It is hardly necessary to say that this experiment ought not to be tried for the first time while the horse is in motion , unless the rider has a companion , or unless the horse is perfectly obedient to her voice . A woman must learn to ride by riding . There is no other way . As a rule , ridingmasters can ride themselves , but they can not teach , because for the teacher are required many intellectual qualifications which the usual riding-master does not possess . And again , a woman can not be taught her seat by a person who has had no experience in riding in that way . I have known hut one riding-master who deserved the name of teacher . There are some advantages in the sidesaddle . A woman is certainly more graceful on horseback than a man , and if she have any seat , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of motion . The disadvantages are obvious . It is generally understood , I think , that in our present way of riding we are following the example set by Queen Anne of England , who is said to have been somewhat deformed , so that she could not , or did not , ride like a man . But there is a higher grace than that of possessing a good seat , and that is the ownership of good hands . By this is meant the power of so holding the reins as to create and preserve perfect and sympathetic communication between horse and rider . The qualifications of a good surgeon are not far out of the way in a good rider- " an eagle 's eye , a lion 's heart , a lady 's hand . " We notice here that it is especially the hand of the woman that is required , and not only that of the woman , but that of the gentle woman ; not only gentle , but steady and firm . Gentle it must be , so that the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more strongly than the angler feels the trout at the end of his line ; steady , that the horse may know what he has to depend on ; firm , that lie may be conscious of control . To a practised rider with such a hand , on a trained horse , it is almost as if the reins were telegraph wires running from mind to mind . It seems only necessary to think the desire , and the horse obeys before the rider is conscious of having stirred a muscle . The good seat must be th' condition of a good hand , for one can never hold the reins lightly if she be insecure as to her position . A series of jerks irritates the nervous animal , and destroys his confidence ; a steady , hard pull numbs the sensibility of his mouth , and eventually spoils it and all pleasure in riding . It is not strength , but steadiness and firmness , that he needs , aud the " give and take " of the hands which allows his head some motion , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gentle , and the firm hand you should have , and be ready to use any one , as the case requires . I translate from an old French book bearing date of 1771 when I add : " It should be a rule with every horseman not to pass at once from one extreme to another , from a firm hand to a slack one , so that in the motions of the hand you must on no account leap over that // degree of sensation which constitutes the easy or gentle hand . Were you at once to go from a firm hand to a slack one , you would then entirely abandon your horse ; you would surprise him , deprive him of the support he trusted to , and precipitate him on his shoulders , supposing that you do this at an improper time . On the contrary , were you to pass from the slack to the tight rein all at once , you would jerk your hand , and give a violent shock to the horse 's mouth , which rough and irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin a good mouth . " As to the ways of holding the reins , they are various ; but it makes no difference , provided that the good hand is behind them . It is of far less importance how large the object-glass of a telescope may be than it is how acute and trained is the eye that looks through it . The general way of giving directions as to holding reins is so confused in most books on horsemanship that it would seem almost impossible for any one to succeed in merely taking them into the hand rightly . I am quite sure that if directions for threading a needle were to be written out in the same detailed way , no woman would ever be able to get the thread into the eye , and hand-sewing would become a lost art . One very good way of holding the reins is with the second finger between the two branches of the snaffle rein , and the little finger between the two branches of the curb ; the ends then being thrown back over the bridle hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the curb lies on top , so that it can easily be reached , should it become necessary to tighten it . This is rather the French than the English method , but it is good , because with a very slight turn of the wrist you can feel the horse 's mouth with the two bits alternately , which is a very good thing for him , especially if he be inclined to have his own way . He never should be felt with both bits at once . It is better to put both hands than one to the reins , even though you make little use of the ri , , ht hand . It is better , first , because you are more likely to sit square and even . It is a dangerous habit even for a man to use only the left hand , as is shown by many of the one-sided riders we see , and a woman is more apt to sit crooked in her saddle than a man . It is better , secondly , because you may need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is very easy , if the right hand be in place , to separate and hold them so . To ride correctly and securely , the heel of the stirrup foot should be held always well down , and the toe of the other . This will be found difficult to accomplish all at once . It is best to give your whole attention to the stirrup foot till you are sure you have that educated so that the heel will stay down , and then you can train the other . Both feet should be kept close to the horse . The steady holding down of the stirrup heel will be found to keep the whole leg from ankle to knee close pressed against the saddle , which should always be the case . If the heel be taken care of , the leg may be left to take care of itself . We come to the point of dress , both of horse and rider . It is an axiom that a horse should not be ridden without a martingale until it has been proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , the less a horse has on , the better . If he has the bad and dangerous habit of tossing up his head , the martingale should , however , be kept . Two bits and two reins are better than one , and more than double your means of conveying ideas to the horse . You may want to set his head properly with the curb , and for the " single-foot " and some fancy gaits you will want to take him on that bit . Further , there is double safety in the double bridle in case of breaking bit or rein . There may come a time when you will really need the additional force of the curb , and it is easy to carry it loosely in the hand when not needed . For the reason that " beauty unadorned is adorned the most , " not only the martingale , if possible , but the noseband and any rosettes should be dispensed with . You will not be able to find any leather strap or any colored ribbon which will compare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . You can not improve upon those lines , or that coloring or lustre . Show just as much of the head as is consistent with safety . The saddle should also be as small and light as possible , and should fit the horse perfectly . The least want of fit will prove a source of pain , and perhaps of serious trouble , to the animal . It should have a perfectly level seat , and not be hollowed . It may perhaps be well to have it covered with buckskin for the first lessons , as the un // 244 practised rider is less apt to slip on that ; but after she has once attained any feeling of security , let her saddle be covered only with pig-skin . It is a good plan to have two rings set on the pocket side of the flap , from which , by straps , a waterproof cloak can be carried if the clouds threaten , for it is by no means necessary to give up a ride on account of rain . With a loose water-proof cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar and cuffs , it is possible to have all the pleasure of riding , and to come in at the close perfectly dry as to under-garments . A leather lining , known as a " preventive leather , " just fitting the under surface of the saddle , is an admirable arrangement . It is made of calf-skin , and should be washed clean with soap and a damp sponge , and wiped dry as soon as it is taken off . If a saddle fits and has this lining underneath , the horse 's back will never become sore , though the ride be long , and even in the hottest of our summer weather ; no other saddle-cloth should be used . The habit skirt can be protected for summer on the habit side of the saddle by a cloth safe permanently fastened to that side , like a half saddlecloth , There should , of course , always be open space under the saddle over the backbone . The horse should be well up to the weight of the rider , yet a good rider of heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding , when a poor or inexperienced one , though light , and in the same saddle , will brin , , him in sore after one ride . The secret of not hurting the horse is often more in the even and steady seat , the perfect balance , and the light spring than in the saddle . And yet , however evenly a woman may ride , there must be more weight on one side than on the other , and there will be more pressure of the saddle on the side where her feet are not . For the relief of the animal , then , if for nothing else , it is well to be able to ride both a right and a left handed saddle ; that is , to ride indifferently on either side of the horse . A growing girl , indeed , who rides a great deal , ought always to be taught riding on both sides , or she will almost inevitably acquire a twist . Even for a fully grown woman the accomplishment is not only desirable and often convenient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to find a more delicious sense of muscular pleasure than can be found in riding for an hour on one side , and then coming in to change saddles and skirts to ride immediately on the other . The pleasure results , I suppose , from the relaxing of the muscles which have been tense , and the corresponding tension of those which have been relaxed ; but it is a positive muscular delight incomparable to any other . To ride regularly alternate days on alternate sides is a great relief both to horse and rider , and the poise and balance , and hence the security of seat thus gained , are beautiful and enjoyable things . That the left is the bridle hand is a legacy from the days when one hand must be kept free to wield the sword , and that the right . In enforcing the general lesson , " Practise thyself even in the thing which thou despairest of accomplishing , " Marcus Aurelius goes on to say , " for even the left hand , which is ineffectual in all other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the right hand ; for it has been practised in this . " In riding on the off side it is not necessary to change the bridle hand , if , as suggested above , you are in the habit of keeping the two hands at the rein , though if you have a well-trained horse you may find pleasure in educating the right hand into some intelligence and guiding power . A marvellous proof of the quick communication existing between you and your servant will be at once given by this experiment , for you will find that the horse will not obey as quickly as is his wont when the reins are in the right hand , and will fancy that he can have a little of his own way , while as soon as they are transferred , though he does not see the change , he feels it , and at once perceives that there is to be no more fooling , " but that you mean business , and he might as well behave himself . In some parts of the country the usual way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is presumable that it was the thorough-going revolutionary spirit in our ancestoi 's that induced them in contradiction of the English law to turn to the right instead of to the left when they met on the road . They forgot , probably because there was so little riding on the part of the women , that at the same time they should have ordained that women must now ride on the " off " instead of // the " nigh " side of the horse . It was a serious oversight . If we are to turn to the left , we should ride on the usual side , so that as we pass a carriage there will be no danger of touching with feet or habit ; but as soon as we are to be forced to turn to the right , this is all wrong , and every facility is offered for touching and catching . You will realize this when you ride on the off side and have to pass even a horseman going in a contrary direction in a narrow road . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have nothing but the smooth flap of the saddle on the collision side . However the women in England may ride , the women in America ought to ride on the off side as long as they have to " turn to the right . " If you ride on both sides from the beginning , you will know no difference , for one knee will learn as well as the other to grasp the pommel ; but if you have learned in the common way , and then attempt the off-side saddle , you will be interested in finding that you can not for some time make the left knee take hold , even with all the will - force you may put into play , and that the thigh muscles on your left side have no grip . You will have patiently to practise for several days before you can get any of your brain force down into those muscles , before you do not feel us if a support that you had had on your left side round your waist had been ruthlessly taken away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle education will not , however , be very long , and then you will feel as if you had gained a new sense . The game is well worth the candle . The practice will , of course , involve two skirts for every habit , or else a skirt so made that it can be worn with either side out . The woman 's dress on horseback should be absolutely plain . Any attempt at trimmin* or lightness is , in the words of a real artist tailor , simply " degrading the habit to the level of a dress . " The length of the skirt is a matter of taste , not of fashion , sud to allow the tailor to cut it so short that it does not at all cover the stirrup foot , is to exhibit a woman 's foot in a very unfavorable position . No real woman will ever resign her dress , whether on horseback or off , unconditionally to the demands of passing fashion , for every woman should be a creator , and her dress as well as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in herself . Of course if she be nothing in and for herself , that fact will also make itself manifest by an entire lack of creative power and of expression . If the habit be long enough well to cover the forward foot , riding against a stiff breeze will curve the edge of it under the toe and help to keep it covered . If a skirt be properly cut and fitted , there is no need of the loops on the underside , which are intended to have the foot slipped through to hold it down . These loops are a miserable subterfuge of a tailor who does not understand his business , and they might easily prove a source of great danger in case of a fall . It seems as if no sensitive woman ever could wear flowers as she would a ribbon or a scarf , simply and solely for the sake of her own adornment . She must , as Heine so beautifully suggests in his poem , always recognize a sort of loving kinship for a flower . It is painful and significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of a rider to be ruthlessly tossed about and destroyed with the violent motion . But leaving sentiment out of the way , all ornament of whatever description is out of place on horseback . Good taste dictates that everything , from collar to boot , should be absolutely and severely plain . The woman who is riding is not to exhibit herself alone . If she is to be a thing of beauty , it must be then as one with her horse , and the beauty must come from the perfect poise of the erect and lithe figure , the sway with the motion above the waist , the firm cling from waist down . The charm is in the harmony , and the sense of perfect freedom which comes from the perfect ease and evident security of the rider . It is like the beauty of Greek sculpture . It abides in the lines , and deeper still in the complete freedom expressed by them . One might as well try to adorn the Venus Victrix with ribbons and flowers as the figure of a good woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our American cities , it be necessary to show to the world how much money one has to throw away , a few tendollar greenbacks carelessly pinned to the breast of the habit would answer the purpose quite as well as a bunch of Jacqueminot roses in the winter . It may be suggested that for any practical purpose a genuine whip is to be pre // ferred to the useless short stiff cane with a loop of leather at the end , which is so utterly ridiculous for common riders . There is a whip made in the Bermudas of twisted sea-weed which is very good , and will be found convenient in wet weather , so ruinous to ordinary whips , or when the temperature is so low as to make their whalebone dangerously brittle . I have never seen but one , which was brought me from the islands , but it might be worth while for the saddlers in this country to import them , both for novelty and for usefulness . As to the spur , a woman is at a great disadvantage in that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to quicken the motion of fore quarters when applied close behind the girths , and of hind quarters if farther back ; and on the heels of a perfectly competent man , who uses his legs with the same certainty that he does his arms , it is of great value ; but it is undoubtedly true that there are more people who use a spur when they ought not to , than there are who do not use it when they should . And here lies the danger , for a sudden movement of the horse may carry his body against the spur , and he then starts , supposing that you desire him so to do ; you , not knowing this , check him , and perhaps strike him again . Many a fatal accident is due only to this unintentional use of the spur , and considering that only one is available to a woman , and the other extra risks which she must take , it is perhaps better to dispense with it . At any rate , it never should be worn with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely sure that you will never strike him with it involuntarily . Horseback exercise is often dangerous in its after-results because a woman neglects to change damp under-clothing . For the perfect enjoyment of the exercise , all clothing should be at once changed for fresh and dry , and the same vigorous currying which the groom thinks it not too much trouble to give the heated animal in the stable as soon as he comes in will be found to be of great use to the rider . You would severely blame the groom who should turn your horse into his stall , saddle and bridle on , and leave him to stand there and grow dry . Is not your health of as much importance as that of the horse , or is he more delicate and sensitive than you ? The gaits generally desirable for a horse are the walk , the trot , canter , singlefoot , and pace . The walk should always be brisk . If the horse be allowed to shuffle along , he is apt to become lost in his own reflections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stumbler . If he have a good shoulder , he will recover himself at once with a grunt , which , with an intelligent horse , sounds very much like a half-suppressed oath . But if he have a bad shoulder , he will probably go down , at any rate on his knees , which process will not improve them . Even in a walk his mind should always be kept on the alert , if you would have either pleasure or safety . The order of the feet in a walk is diagonal , only that the hind feet follow the forefeet at a perceptible distance of time . In passing from the walk to the trot , this space of time becomes less and less , till the diagonal feet touch the ground at the same instant , making the cadence " one , two , " instead of " one , two , three , fou r , " as in the walk . When water grows colder and colder it contracts like other substances till it reaches the freezing - point , and just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and become a solid , it expands . The production of the " single-foot , " though not like , always reminds me of this . The trainer secures it by checking the horse with the curb just at the supreme moment when the diagonal feet are on the point of touching the ground together , and while he by no means slackens the gait - for the horse often single-foots faster than lie trotsarrests it just at that point , so that while the horse increases his speed as he would if he had gone into a rapid trot , he still keeps with his feet the exact order of the walk , giving distinctly to the ear the same quadruple measure . The rapid play of the feet makes this a hard gait for the horse , and he generally seems relieved when he is permitted to fall from it into a trot ; into a canter he should never be allowed to fall . It is , however , a delightfully easy one for the rider , provided the animal do not step too high . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trots well . But this is not true . The trouble is generally that the rider does not keep her horse to his gaits , either from want of kn.o*vledge or from carelessness , and consequently his trot gets , as it is called , " mixed , " and is 7 // spoiled . Each gait should be kept clearly distinct from every other , and the horse never be allowed to pass from one to the other except by direction of his rider , and he should have practice in all the gaits that he possesses , every time that he goes out . If this be the case , the more gaits he has , the better ; and as to the fact of inability to trot , my best single-footer is my fastest trotter , and can well keep up on that gait with many a horse doing his best at a canter , and he never changes from one gait to the other except at the signal . In the " pace** the two feet of the same side touch the ground at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the rider , I think , is not generally found pleasant . In the canter the beat becomes triple time , two feet striking separately and two together . The fore foot which is thrown out ahead is known as the leading foot , and is always kept toward the centre of a curve in a rapid turn . It receives the main shock of the weight , though it does not touch the ground first . The horse will often , even in a straight gallop , change the foot which leads , presumably to rest it . He will always do this in going round a sharp curve if it be needful to do so to have it on the inside . He does this instinctively , as a measure of precaution against falling . Every horse has his own individual preference as to the leading foot in a canter , and is easiest when using that . It was formei4y said that a woman 's horse should always lead with the off leg , but I am inclined to think that the change in pommels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have somewhat altered the woman 's bearing in the saddle , and that it makes practically no difference in comfort to the rider with which leg horses lead , provided only that each one leads with his own favorite leg . By all means let your horse have as many gaits as possible , both for your own comfort and your own amusement , but do not lend him to any one who will allow him to " mix them up . " It makes no difference what signals you may use for them , so long as you and he understand them , but a motion is better than a word , and he should obey it instantly , and change from one gait to the other . His trot is always at its best at the instant when he wants most to get over the ground faster by plunging into a canter . There is a little difference doubtless in the two shoulders of every horse , he being able to move one more freely than the other . And this gives rise to a leading foot , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trot with the leading foot of the horse , rising when this is lifted , falling when it is put down , and to rise on the other gives a curious sort of rotary motion . Why it should be generally easier to rise on one particular foot than on the other of the horse can be accounted for only by the fact that every horse has a favorite fore leg of his own , one to which he trusts himself more confidently than to the other , As to fancy gaits , the Spanish march and the Spanish trot are very pretty and very amusing , especially if one perceives how wholly the animal holds his attention fixed on his fore feet , and leaves the hind feet to take care of themselves as best they may , and if one catches the almost pained look of anxious attention in the eye . It is pleasant to be able to make him walk sideways in either direction as you may tell him , and it must never be forgotten that every additional accomplishment renders him more amenable to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sphere of obedience ; but , after all , that is the main use of them . What you want is a horse that can walk well , trot square and even , and canter , either slowly or rapidly , as you may direct . If he will single- foot too , so much the better . If you can make your horse do all these things well and thoroughly , and do them at once when you give the signal , you may consider that you have taken one step toward being an equestrian , even if you have never jumped him over a five-foot fence , or wildly galloped in pursuit of the aniseseed bag . A woman should always , when possible , mount from the ground , with the assistance of a groom , and not allow herself to sit down on the saddle from a high platform . There is no trouble in mounting without assistance , if she have only any vantage-ground which will allow her to get her foot in the stirrup and her hands to the pommel and saddle seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sufficient , unless the horse be above the height generally used by a woman . And she should be able at the end of her ride to spring from her saddle to the ground without any help . She can hardly be called a rider if she can not easily do these things . // I have said before that there is no need of losing a ride because of rain , and there are pleasures given by a ride in the rain which the " fair-weather rider " never can know-pleasures of sight and of smell , new aspects of otherwise perfectly familiar scenes , which are almost like a new creation . Nor need our coldest winter weather deter any one . A woman has decidedly the advantage over a man in winter , for her skirt acts the part of a muff , and she need never fear cold feet . In fact , she need fear no suffering from cold except in her hands . There are no gloves which will keep them warm while they hold the bridle , but a vigorous beating on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the warm blood tingling through the fingers to their very tips , and after that they will give no trouble for a long time . As to ears , they will never resist a rub and a quick trot , and once warm they always stay so , as indeed would the hands , were it not for the enforced cramped position of the fingers . It is of great advantage here to be mistress of two bridle hands instead of one . A warm double-breasted overcoat should be worn , and then I know of no more exhilarating thing than a fast trot or a rapid gallop over the crunching white carpet , while the loose dry snow , flung up by the hoofs , or dashed from the trees by the wind , flies in the face like the white foam of the sea , and every muscle of the horse responds to the tingle of the nerves in the sharp , stinging air . The whole atmosphere is cleft through and through by the shafts of light ; the bare trunks and boughs of the trees are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tip of each branch , as it were , a great white blossom , while the hemlocks sway heavily under their snowy burden , and we ride through all the glory . There is another variety of pleasure in riding through a fast-falling snow-storm , when the whole air is muffled and the horse 's feet can not be heard . There is absolute safety from slipping in the " neverslip " shoes , even on glare ice . The horse knows this as soon as he touches his feet to the ground , and as the points in these shoes can be replaced by sharp ones as soon as they are dulled , there is no necessity of having the horse 's shoes ruthlessly pulled off every week or fortnight to be sharpened . As also the points can be changed for blunt ones when not on the road , there is no danger of his cutting himself with them in the stable . There is absolutely no trouble with them if the groom be careful not to let them get rusted in , and a little pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your groom be careless , you will be more unfortunate than Francis I. at Pavia , for all will be lost . The reason why riding is of more value than almost any other exercise to the tired brain-worker is that it furnishes a view channel to the current of the thoughts . We may walk and walk briskly in fresh , bracing air , but the action of walking is so automatic that the anxieties and cares which are our hourly companions still hold possession of us , and will not away . But on horseback we have another will to deal with , and other dangers to guard against ; we are forced to think of our horse and of the road ; and to secure escape from our habitual train of thought for even two hours out of the day is to lay up new store of strength for future labor . The same advantage of change of thought is secured as by theatre or book , and secured under the added conditions of rapidly circulating life currents , smoothly playing muscles , and the contact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , the greatest relief comes doubtless from the enforced change of thought-direction . To be fond of a horse , and to be personally interested in whatever pertains to his comfort or education , are held by many to savor of unwomanliness . But wherever a Lady Gay Spanker is found , she existed as such potentially and in other ways before she ever mounted a horse . Sympathy , pity , and a feeling of kinship for one of the noblest animals placed in our power by the Creator are surely not unwomanly attributes . To educate and train is the special province of the womanly nature . Control by diplomacy rather than by physical force has always been credited to woman , even by the most justly hardened misogynists . Firmness , steadiness , and intelligent clear purpose are not now considered exclusive prerogatives of our brothers , and to feel gratitude and affection for a servant who has faithfully served us to the full measure of his ability , and comes trustfully toward us if free , or welcomes us with a loud , joyful cry if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse , but of a delicate and refined nature .
