txt The correspondent of The Chronicle in Athens telegraphed at midnight last night that there is reason to believe that the situation is improving , adding that more than one power has intimated in an unofficial way that if Greece is willing to meet the powers half way , it is still possible for her to escape from a difficult situation in an amicable way . The correspondent further says it ie believed that Greece Is willing to consent to a temporary Turkish suzerainty over Crete on condition that the powers will permit the Cretans after the restoration of order to decide their status by plebiscite and permit Greece to appoint a Greek Governor over the island for the present . Under such an arrangement , it is thought , Greece might consent to withdraw her army and fleet from Crete upon the assurance that there would ba no general massacre there . Further , the dispatch to The Chronicle says , Germany has stood in the way of a settlement of the trouble by rejecting proposals which were virtually made to Greece by three European powers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the European concert is substituted for that of Germany , " the correspondent concludes , " a peaceful issue is impossible . " A dispatch from Athens to The Times says that from the fact that the Greeks have landed large supplies of provisions in Crete , thus revictualing the army for three months , it would appear that no attempt to effectually blockade the southern coast of the island has been made by the combined fleet . A detachment or the Greek army of occupation has reached Kandamos , and will try to induce the besieged Moslems to surrender to the Greeks , and not to the insurgents , the object being to secure to Greece the credit of having gone into Crete upon a peaceful mission .
