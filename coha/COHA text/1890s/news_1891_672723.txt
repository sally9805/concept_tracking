txt That old and hardy party organ of the Republicans of Ohio . the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette , is disturbed in its mind by some aspects of the situation in that State . It declares that it " hopes and believes that the Republican Party of Ohio will not have to shoulder the burden of a factional fight to subserve the personal interest of a few men who are anxious to secure a seat in the United States Senate , hi a contest upon the result of which largely depends the supremacy of the Republican Party in the Nation . Yet some one is intriguing to force just such a factional fight upon the party . " Considering that it is generally believed in Ohio that the control of the Commercial Gazette is in the hands of the Democratic politician MeLnaee , that he intends to use it to kill off Mr. Same:max in case of a Republican victory and to secure the Senatorship for himself if the Democrats carry the Legislature , this pathetic note of warning is significant . It might have been made much stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one is intriguing to force upon the party broke out before the State Convention , raged furiously in the lobby of that body , and is now going on in the most lively and interesting fashion all over the State . The immediate object of this struggle is , of course , the United States Senatorship , for which there are at least three " uncommonly anxious " aspirants besides ' Mr. SHERMAN , namely , Fonareun , FosTea , and MCKINLEY . But , though any one of these gentlemen would gladly succeed Mr. Sr minx , the strongest- sentiment among them and their followers is a desire to oust the senior Senator . Mr. Saelaraie has in his day been a very strong man in his own State and in the Nation , and might have been much stronger if he had not been more solicitous of getting than of deserving support . He is suffering to-day not , as he semis to think , from his pronounced views on the financial question , but from his lack of courage and fidelity in sustaining those views . Doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . He has too often used it selfishly not to have made enemies . But he could get along with these if he had had the firmness and foresight to compel support by his unwavering loyalty to the highest convictions that he has really entertained and avowed . He is a melancholy and yet instructive example of what men of ability in public life lose by seeking rather than by deserving popularity . Unquestionably Mr. Sautteeeer would make for Ohio for another six years a far bettor Senator than any one of the rivals who in his own party are plotting his downfall . With all his weaknesses and tendency to concession , he knows what sound finance is , and he is determined to do all that he can do to secure it without dividing his party or inviting too much opposition to himself . But equally beyond question , he does not possess the confidence , the unhesitating and constant confidence , of the friends of sound money , because they never can tell how far he . will think concession necessary to his partisan or personal aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession that he has made has led to another and worse one . Even at this moment , when he is under the ban of the Alliance on account of his opposition to free coinage , and when his only hope of securing the support of the con- 1 servative men of his party lies in inspiring trust in his own firmness , he is giving out the most temporizing and compromising utterances regarding silver , and has written a curious letter in defense of the amazing legislation of last year . He does not seem to see ? as he has not seen all the long , and . weary time since 1878 ? that such concessions constantly weaken the cause he really believes in and as constently strengthen its opponents . Every argument that he can make ' for the monthly purchase of four ' and one-half millions of silver bullion. and the issue of Treasury notes , is easily turned into an argument for free coinage , while the arguments for stopping where we are are rendered feeble as against the statesman who consents to go so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ohio to have Mr. SHERMAN 'S seat given over to Forepien or Fong% but for the risk of that Mr. Soma/ma:le himself is responsible .
