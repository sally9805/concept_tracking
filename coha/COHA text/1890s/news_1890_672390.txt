It was not like the snow-coated hail , but was plain hard ice , frozen through and through , clear as crystal , and solid as a rock . It went through thick panes of glass as if they were tissue paper , and the amount of damage done by it can only be figured up when all the broken panes are counted and the glass setters ' bills are paid . The loss will run up into the thousands . The hailstones were like rooks , some of them ragged and sharp on the edges as a steel blade . pens ' eggs were nothing to them in size .

In the annex the rain , wind , and hail did even more severe damage than in the city . Walls were swept down , houses unroofed , glass smashed , and other damage done .
