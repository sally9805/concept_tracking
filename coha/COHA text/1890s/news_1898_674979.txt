txt Miss Julia Conrad and Miss Mary Wellnitz , prominent members of St. Mary 's Roman Catholic parish , fast friends for a long time and both good looking and popular , no longer speak . Miss Conrad has a handsome diamond bracelet and Miss Wellnitz a diamond ring . The bracelet is the cause of the trouble . Ten days ago Father Lambert , the rector of the church , decided to hold a fair , in order to raise money for the church . Among the features of the fair was a contest for a diamond bracelet , to be voted to the handsomest and most popular member of the church . The interest in this contest Was very great , and soon from a great number the contest narrowed down to Miss Conrad and Miss Wellnitz . First one of the fair contestants would lead , and then the other , depending nn the financial condition of the interested friends and supporters . Saturday night was the last night , and , inasmuch as that was pay day , money was circulating in the contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by the dozens or scores , but by the hundreds . And still , so evenly were the friends and admirers of the respective contestants divided , neither seemed to have any certain advantage . Finally almost at the last minute , a brother-in-law of Miss Wellnitz handed in a sealed envelope filled with votes . The Conrad facti3n objected to this , inasmuch as heretofore the voting had been conducted openly , and a free fight was narrowly averted Finally , amid great excitement , the contest was declared closed , and Father Lambert said he would announce the result later . To-day he presented to Miss Conrad the bracelet and to Miss Wellnitz a diamond ring of equal value , which he had purchased hoping thereby to smooth over the difficulty . Instead , however , it has aggravated the situation , inasmuch as both sides now claim they won  --  Miss Conrad because she has the bracelet , Miss Wellnitz because if she had n't won she should n't have had anything at all . Tlach side purposes to hold a public cele- bration in honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civil war in Hackensack.
