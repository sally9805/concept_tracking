txt Can Spain have peace with honor ? That is a question more discussed , perhaps , than considered . Some of the critics of the United States insist that we have made it impossible . Assuming , as is quite justifiable , that the United States has represented to Spain that her ultimate withdrawal from Cuba is an indispensable condition to lasting peace , they say that to yield such a condition would be inconsistent with the honor of a proud and sensitive nation . But would it ? That depends on what honor demands . It does not demand hopeless resistance to the inevitable . Experience has shown that Spain can not maintain in Cuba a Government such as will give security to the interests and rights of its inhabitants and to those of the United States . For more than a generation now her efforts in that direction have been futile . We can not say that they have been earnest or energetic , but they have been very costly . During all that time the island has been a burden on the taxpayers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the last three years it is a safe estimate that 100,000 Spanish soldiers have died or been permanently disabled , not by war , but by disease . Three hundred millions of dollars have been expended with no result . The island ? which was steadily sinking into poverty before the insurrection  --  has been devastated and the greater part of its productive industry destroyed . Surely this demonstration of the utter impossibility . that Spain can govern Cuba in time of peace or pacify it in time of revolt is proof that she must give up the task . It is plain that if Spain consents to withdraw from Cuba on the advice of the United States she can make certain terms which she could not hope to make if she retired as the consequence of defeat in war . She could properly hope to be relieved of some portion of the immense debt which she has incurred in her efforts to administer the island . She could be sure of guarantees of personal safety and security of property rights for her citizens in Cuba or for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her fair share in the industries and trade of Cuba would be prosecuted under far more stable and profitable conditions than those that have prevailed in the past . She could have a reasonable voice in the establishment of the future Government in Cuba , not , of course , controlling it , but safeguarding all her real interests . These are distinct , substantial , and lasting advantages in every sense . On the other hand , if she insisted on retiring from Cuba only after defeat in war , what would be the results ? Instead of reducing her present Cuban debt she would increase it many times over . Her sacrifice of life and property would be very great . The burden imposed upon her people , already overloaded , would be made crushing and could not be lifted for many years . Her rank among European powers would be still further lowered . She would be exposed to the schemes of grasping neighbors , and receive less respect or sympathy than she can now command . And in the end she would lose Cuba as absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her citizens there , instead of having the protection of a friendly power , would be subject to hostile treatment . Her share in the future development of the island would be denied her . She would be unconditionally driven out . Since these are two sets of contrasted facts which can not be disputed , does not Spanish honor really require that they shall be considered , and not that they shall be blindly ignored er stupidly denied ? There is another phase of the question . In modern times war is not merely or chiefly a question of valor , but of money , and the money of Spain is grossly inadequate to war . She is already heavily in debt . War would add greatly to that debt . She could not after defeat pay what she now owes . She would be driven to partial repudiation . Is that a peculiarly honorable thing ? She is not risking merely her own resources ; she is risking the capital of her creditors . What has honor to say to such a course ? Looking over all the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her capacity to hold and govern Cuba , and counting the cost of war in a vain effort to retain it , the true honor of Spain requires the recognition of the inevitable . It is indeed the only course that honor permits .
