BY JAMES BRYCE , M. P. , AUTHOR OF ( ( THE AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH , ) ) ( ( THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE , ) ) ETC . THIRD PAPER . N the first of the two arti des which have already appeared in this maga zine regarding South Af C rica , the physical char acter and aspects of the K country were described , these being the perma nent and the most potent factors in its economic condition and its industrial future . In the second a brief sketch of its history was given , explaining what have been the relations in the past of the three native and the four European races which originally inhabited , or have subsequently settled in , it . It is now time to pass on to consider the country as it now stands , and to attempt to convey to the reader some general impressions of the nature and value of the resources of the country , of the character of the population , and of the problems , social and political , which confront and occupy them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with in eight or ten pages . It becomes necessary to select from among them those which are most likely to have interest for readers in the United States . I must therefore pass very lightly over the economical resources and industrial prospects of South Africa , in order to find space for discussing a little more fully the relations of the natives to the white race ; the relations of the two European races to each other in the two British colonies and the two Dutch republics ; and the political questions the urgency of which has fixed the eyes of Europe and America upon South Africa . There are three sources of wealth and three kinds of employment for labor in South Africa - agriculture , stock-raising , and mining . Timber is so scarce and so poor as to be hardly worth mention , and manufactures , for reasons to be presently stated , have as yet hardly come into existence . Agriculture is pursued on a scale very small in proportion to the immense area of the country . Much of it is a desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is 442 mountainous . Of the comparatively level districts , a great part , probably four fifths of the whole , is too arid to be cultivable without irrigation ; that is to say , the rainfall is either too small in total volume , or too ill distributed through the year , to permit good crops to be raised without artificial aid . That large tracts , both in Cape Colony and in Natal , which might be brought under the plow still lie untilled is due partly to the tendency of the European settlers to prefer cattlefarming to agriculture ; partly to the inferiority of native labor ; partly also to the fact that plenty of arable land is still occupied by Kafir tribes , who make but little use of it . The introduction of irrigation would make a vast difference , for some of the regions which are now untilled for want of rain , such as the Karroo desert , have a soil of surprising fertility , which produces luxuriant crops when water is led on to it . The price of cereals has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is seldom worth while to go to the expense of irrigation , nor will irrigation become profitable until a larger population has created a better market in South Africa ifself . At present Cape Colony and the Transvaal import not only wheat , but maize also , although a protective tariff has been imposed on all food-stuffs . The chief agricultural development of late years has been in the direction of fruit , large quantities of which now go to the English market in the months of January , February , and March , the midsummer and autumn of the southern hemisphere . The main industry of South Africa , for the last two centuries , has been the rearing of cattle and sheep . All the country , except the very barest parts of the deserts , is fit for some kind of live stock . Even the Karroo , which looks like a desert as one crosses it in the train , produces small , succulent shrubs much relished by sheep , while great stretches of wild-bush country , covered with a dense scrub , are turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers are sent to Europe and America . Owing , however , to // the thinness of the pasture in the drier regions , and to the occasional droughts even in those which are better watered , as well as to the destruction of the herbage by locusts in the years when those pests appear , the stockfarms are of great size , and the number of cattle small when compared with the area over which they range . Still , the country , and especially the newly opened regions of Bechuanaland and Matabeleland , will carry many more live stock than have yet been placed upon it . South Africa will doubtless become in time one of the great ranching countries of the world . Till within the last thirty years nobody thought of these regions as possessed of mineral wealth ; for , though iron had been found in some places and copper in others , neither was largely worked , and the belief in the existence of the precious metals rested on nothing more than a Portuguese tradition . In 1867 the first diamond ever found in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap of shining river-pebbles . This was near the banks of the Orange River , a little above its confluence with the Vaal River . Then a diligent search for diamonds began in all the surrounding districts . In 1870 diamonds were discovered in considerable quantities near where the town of Kimberley now stands . A rush of miners soon filled the neighborhood , and from that time onward Kimberley has been the center of the diamond-getting industry , though there are other mines scattered here and there to the west and south of it . The total value of the diamonds exported from South Africa up to the present year has been roughly estimated at nearly one hundred millions sterling , and the value of the present annual output , which is kept down in order to prevent the price from falling , since the demand is of course a limited one , at between four millions and four and a quarter millions . One result of the diamond finds has been to create a considerable population in what was formerly an arid wilderness , so little prized that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free State was entitled to its ownership . Another has been to accelerate the development of the gold-mines which were discovered some fifteen years later in the Transvaal Republic ; for the men who had made fortunes out of the diamond diggings were near the spot , and eager to turn their capital to account in fresh enterprises . To describe the gold-fields of South Africa would need more pages than I have lines to give . One fact , however , must be mentioned and emphasized . These goldfields are of three kinds . One kind consists of alluvial deposits , from which the gold is extracted by washing . Such alluvial deposits are found in many parts of the world , notably on a great scale in California ; and those of South Africa present no peculiar features , and are neither of great extent nor of conspicuous wealth . The second kind is the quartz reefs . These also occur in other parts of the world , as , for instance , in California , in several parts of Australia , in the Ural Mountains , in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such reefs have been found in Natal and Zululand , in the mountains along the eastern border of the Transvaal Republic , and in many parts of Matabeleland and Mashonalaiid . Their value has been still very imperfectly ascertained , but it seems probable that in the three lastmentioned districts some of the workings will turn out to be rich . The third kind , however , is peculiar not only to South Africa , but to one particular region ( called the Witwatersrand , or ( ( Rand Basin ) ) ) in the Transvaal Republic . Here the metal is found pretty equally distributed through beds of hard , conglomerate rock , which come to the surface over an area about 130 miles long by 30 miles wide . The gold occurs in very small flakes seldom visible to the eye , and is often so entangled with other minerals , especially iron pyrites , as to require elaborate and costly chemical processes for its extraction . But the remarkable feature , and the one which makes mining in the Rand so much less uncertain and speculative an undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the conglomerate beds ( called by the Dutch banket ) contain through great part of their length , and , so far as has yet been ascertained , through their depth also , down toward the center of the earth , a proportion of gold to rock which varies but little , and which enables the yield of metal to the ton to be pretty accurately estimated beforehand . This yield is greater in some mines , less in others ; but its aggregate is so large that South Africa has now become the third gold-producing country of the world , and may probably become before long the second . The total value of the gold extracted annually is now about eight millions sterling . The richest workings are near the center of the northern edge of the Rand Basin , about the town of Johannesburg , which , first laid out in 1886 , has now a population of about // be less than 120,000 , and this is the only part of South Africa where the density of the population and the stress and strain of life remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district , which twelve years ago was a solitary waste , high and bare , where a farm of three thousand acres could be bought for fifty pounds , has now become the focus of South African industry and finance , and the seat of a new community , whose struggles with the government of the republic have made Johannesburg ( as we shall presently observe ) the center of gravity in South African politics . Though both coal and iron are abundant in the two British colonies and in the Transvaal , manufactures have not yet sprung up , even in the older parts of Cape Colony , nor is there any present sign of their development . It is cheaper to import from Europe such articles as the country needs ; for white labor is dear , black labor is unskilled , and the poorer classes have not begun to demand a tariff to protect their local industries against the competition of other countries . The mention of labor brings us to a question of the greatest interest , which touches the central problems of economics and politics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboring class in the future  --  the whites or the blacks ? And how will the difference of color affect the relations of one part of the laboring class to the other , or of the laboring class generally to the other classes of the community ? The question of labor is largely a question of climate . Now the climate of South Africa is peculiar . It is hot-much hotter than the climate of southern Europe ( except a few spots along the Mediterranean coast ) or than that of Virginia , Kentucky , or Missouri ; but it is not an exhausting climate , because the nights are nearly everywhere cool , and the air is dry . European races can thrive and multiply both in the British colonies and in the two republics . It is only on the flats of the east coast and in the valley of the Zambesi that the conditions of health become really unfavorable . Elsewhere the heat , even of a summer day , is not greater than the peoples of southern Europe-Portuguese , for instance , or Sicilians-could well support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dutch and the English , could , in most parts of the country , do out-of-door work without injury . Had South Africa , like California or New South Wales , been colonized solely by white men , South Africa , like those countries , would probably have had a white laboring population . But unluckily South Africa was colonized in much earlier days , when the importation of negro slaves was deemed the easiest means of securing cheap and abundant labor . Slaves were first brought in 1658 . Thereafter , until slavery was abolished by the British Parliament in 1834 , all the hardest and humblest kinds of work were done by slaves . The white people lost the habit of performing manual labor , and acquired the habit of despising it . No one would do for himself what he could get a black man to do for him . New settlers from Europe fell into the ways of the country , which suited their disinclination to exert themselves under a burning sun . Thus , when at last the abolition of slavery arrived , the custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored people , who formed the majority of the population , continued . It is as strong as ever to-day . Both on farms and in towns it is by the ( ( Cape boys ) ) or by the Kafirs that all unskilled labor is performed . The only considerable exception was afforded by the German colonists who were planted in the eastern part of Cape Colony after the Crimean War of 1854 , in which they had served among the British forces . These colonists cultivated the land themselves , and cultivated it far more efficiently than did the surrounding Kafirs . But to-day one is told that their children are now disinclined to do so , and that they have either sold or let their allotments to the natives , or else are working the land by hired native labor . All other immigrants from Europe adopt the habits of the country in a few weeks or months . The English carpenter has a ( ( boy ) ) to carry his tools for him ; the English bricklayer has a native hodman to hand the bricks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill is very often done by whites , because they do it much better ; but white labor leans on and uses black labor . So on the railways the stationmasters and guards are white , but the heavy jobs which need little skill fall to the blacks ; so field-hands and those who actually herd the cattle are natives , though there are usually whites over them in a position of authority . In all new countries skilled labor is dear , but in South Africa it is exceptionally dear , because the skilled white man insists on having blacks beneath him , and black labor , though it is cheap if measured by the price paid for it , is really dear if measured by what it accomplishes ; for it is unskilled and uncertain , the native , except in a few of the older parts of the country , not yet haying // acquired that habit of steady and patient industry which makes labor effective . It is of course in the newest districts , where the natives are still raw and scarcely removed from a savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold-fields of the Transvaal and Mashonaland the supply of native workpeople often falls short , although at Johannesburg a native can earn three pounds ( fifteen dollars ) a month besides his food and such lodging as he needs . The development of the mines is of course to some extent retarded by this difficulty of obtaining a permanent supply of labor . The facts we have been considering have a bearing upon still wider questions . They indicate that , as the bulk of the population is now black , so it will remain . The substratum of society , which is larger than the strata that it supports , seems likely to be , probably forever , composed of colored people . What , then , will be the relation of these colored people to the whites ? This is a question of so much interest to American readers , who have in the Southern States of their own country a similar problem to solve , that it deserves a comparatively full discussion . The colored population of South Africa consists of far more diverse elements than does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race which was formed by the mixture of the imported negro slaves with the indigenous Hottentots , there are a good many Malays in Cape Colony , and a still larger number of East Indians in Natal and the Transvaal . Over and above these , there is a great host of Kafirs , some civilized and established as servants or agriculturists among the Europeans , many more living under their own tribal system and following their savage customs . The grades of advancement among these natives from pure barbarism to civilization are almost infinite . Scarcely less varied are the intellectual capacities of the different elements in this mixed multitude of colored people . All , however ,  --  the educated and the savage , the Christian and the heathen , the African and the Indian , - are alike treated by the whites as divided from themselves by a wide and impassable gulf . No one can imagine a social separation more complete than this is ; nor is there any feature of South African life which strikes the visitor with a more painful surprise than the sentiment , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he finds so generally entertained by the higher toward the less advanced races . This sentiment is not chiefly due to the long and fierce wars waged with the Kafirs , for the respect felt for their bravery has tended to efface the recollection of their frequent cruelties . Neither is it caused ( except as respects the Indian traders ) by the dislike of the poorer whites to the competition with them in industry of a class living in a much rougher way and willing to accept much lower wages . It seems to spring partly from the old feeling of contempt for the slaves ( a feeling which has descended to a generation that has never known slavery as an actual system ) , p*irtly to physical aversion , andpartly to an incompatibility of character and temper which makes the faults of the colored man more offensive to the white than the ( perhaps morally as grave ) faults of members of his own white race . Even between civilized peoples , such as Germans and Russians , Frenchmen and Englishmen , there is a disposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much culpable in themselves as distasteful to men constructed on somewhat different lines . This sense of annoyance is of course more intense toward a race so widely removed from the modern European as the Kafirs are . The attitude of contempt I am describing pervades all classes , though it is strongest in those rude and uncultivated whites who plume themselves all the more upon their color because they have little else to plume themselves upon ; while among the most refined and thoughtful it is restrained by self-respect , and by the sense that allowances must be made for the defects of a backward race . There are always men of weight in the Cape legislature who hold it their duty to protect native interests , and who try to inculcate a friendly policy . The general tendency , however , is that which I have described . It rarely if ever happens that a native , whatever his rank , is received on any social occasion inside a white house ; indeed , he would seldom be permitted , except as a domestic servant , to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous chief of the Ba-Mangwato , a Christian , and a man of admittedly high character , who has ruled his people with singular wisdom and ability , was in England last autumn , and was there entertained at lunch by the Duke of Westminster and other persons of social eminence , the news *excited general annoyance and disgust among the whites in South Africa . A story was told me of a garden party given by the wife of a leading white ecclesiastic , the appearance at which of a native clergyman led many of the white guests to withdraw in dudgeon . Once , when I was a guest at a mission station in Basutoland , I was // asked by my host whether I had any objection to his bringing in to the family meal the native pastor , who had been preaching to the native congregation . When I expressed some surprise that he should think it necessary to ask , he explained that race feeling was so strong among the colonists that it would have been deemed improper and , indeed , insulting to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black man , unless special permission had first been given . Thus one may say that there is no social intercourse whatever between the races ; their relations are purely those of business . Now and then the black man gets ahead of the white , but the latter 's pride of race remains . I was told of a white who condescended to be hired to work by a Kafir , but stipulated that the Kafir should address him as *Boss . ) ) Of intermarriage there is , of course , no question . It is not forbidden by law in the two British colonies , as it is in most , if not all , of the Southern States of America , but it is excessively rare ; nor does it appear that there are now other irregular unions outside marriage , as there constantly were in the old days while slavery existed . In this respect the case of South Africa remarkably resembles that of the Southern States , where also there is now very little mixture of blood , though there was a great deal fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the races should notmingT&amp;Their blood ; for the white race would be likely to lose more than the black race would gain . It must- not77however , be supposed that this social severance is accompanied , at least in the British parts of South Africa , by unjust laws or harsh treatment . Since the famous ordinance of equal civil rights , published in 1828 , colored people ( in Cape Colony ) have been , in the eye of the law , on a level with whites . When the electoral franchise was conferred on the colonists in 1853 , no color-line was drawn . Some years ago the whites , and the Dutch party in particular , which is the specially anti-native party , became uneasy at the strength of the colored vote , though it was not a solid vote , and a statute was accordingly passed introducing a combined property and educational qualification , which will tend to reduce the number of colored voters . The same restrictions are , however , applied to whites also , so there has been no inequality of treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complain of this act , which may be defended by observing that while , on the one hand , it admits those colored people whose intelligence qualifies them for the exercise of the suffrage , it excludes a large mass whose ignorance and indifference to political issues would put them at the mercy of rich and unscrupulous candidates . It appears less open to objection than some of the attempts recently made in one or two of the Southern States to evade the provisions of the latest amendments to the Constitution of the United States . In Natal the Kafirs are nearly all in a tribal condition , and hardly any natives enjoy the suffrage , though they are not expressly excluded . There has grown up , however , a strong antagonism to the Indian immigrants , who are numerous and intelligent enough to cause disquiet to the small white population , and legislation has been proposed for excluding them from the electoral suffrage . Probably , however , this legislation will not take color per se as the disqualifying element , but will be based upon the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been granted to the inhabitants . The two Dutch republics are much less indulgent than the two British colonies . Neither in the Orange Free State nor in the Transvaal is any person of color permitted to vote ; indeed , he can not even hold land . Democratic republics are not necessarily respectful of what used to be called ( ( human rights . ) ) Indeed , the Transvaal Dutch are accustomed to taunt the Cape colonists at being , to use their phrase , ( ( ruled by black men , ) ) though the colored vote is an appreciable factor only in a few constituencies of the colony , while it seldom or never happens that a colored man is either elected to the Assembly or appointed to any public office . There is in the British colonies a certain amount of special legislation regarding the blacks , designed partly to protect them , partly to impose restrictions on them in what is supposed to be the general interest of the community . Cape Colony , for instance , has a so-called ( ( curfew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark to be provided with a pass , a law which acts oppressively in the case of the best class of natives , though defended as necessary for public order and security , having regard to the large population of the lower class and their propensity to petty thefts . The colony has also passed certain ( ( labor laws ) ) intended to check the disposition of the Kafirs living on the native reserves to become idle or take to vagrancy . There is , no doubt , a danger that people who have never acquired habits of steady industry ( for the tribal Kafir leaves to his wives // the cultivation of his plot of maize or sorghum ) may relapse into a laziness prejudicial to their own advancement , seeing that a few weeks ' labor is enough to provide all the food which the ordinary Kafir needs to support him through the year . But as such laws are prompted not merely by a regard for the welfare of the Kafir , but also by the desire of the white colonist to get plenty of labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abuse , and require great care in administration . In the Dutch republics the laws which control the natives are far more stringent . The Transvaal Boers have sometimes worked their system of apprenticeship , and the scheme of treating natives resident on a farm as being attached to it for the purposes of labor , in a way which can with difficulty be distinguished from predial serfdom . And even in the more liberal Orange Free State a **pass law ) ) is in force , which requires every native moving from place to place to be provided with a passport , in default of which he may be detained . On the other hand , the laws which , in Natal and in the Free State , and in the territories of the British South Africa Company , forbid the supply of intoxicating liquor to natives are clearly in the interest of the natives themselves , and it is much to be regretted that the influence of the wine-growers and distillers in Cape Colony has hitherto prevented a similar protection from being enacted there . A survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey an impression of the actual treatment of the weaker , though more numerous , native element by the stronger whites . That treatment is , in the two British colonies and in the Orange Free State , as well as in the territory of the Company , seldom harsh or unjust . Sometimes a farmer punishes his servants with excessive severity , and escapes punishment because a local jury refuses to convict him . A shocking case of this kind occurred a few years ago . Sometimes an unscrupulous trader defrauds the natives he has been dealing with on the outskirts of civilization , and enjoys immunity because it is hard to secure legal evidence of his misdeeds . Sometimes an employer tricks his native workmen out of part of their wages , relying on their ignorance of the modes of obtaining redress . But , on the whole , the natives have not much to complain of in the way of positive injury ; and public sentiment , if less strict than that of England , is more strict than it used to be , and more strict than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern States of America . The lynching of natives is unknown . This is partly due to the presence of missionaries , who are always quick at reporting offenses committed against natives in the outlying districts ; partly also to the high sense of duty shown by the magistrates and other officials , especially those of the imperial government . It is , however , largely due also to the general good conduct of the Kafirs themselves . There is much petty pilfering , and a disposition to acts of violence against other natives , but much more rarely against whites . Native morality is of course lax in many of the points which whites deem important ; but outrages on women , such as are , unhappily , common in parts of the Southern States of America , are extremely rare . Indeed , it is only in Natal , where the native population is very large , and the white population small and scattered , that one hears of them at all . Thus the cause to which most of the American lynchings are due is absent , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa , where people do not carry arms ( except for the purposes of hunting ) , and murderous affrays scarcely ever occur , has prevented the habit of taking the law into one 's own hands from growing up among the whites . Similar in many respects as is the position of the natives in South Africa to that of the colored people in the Southern States , there are also some remarkable differences . Though in point of natural capacity and strength of character the Bantu races are equal , possibly even superior , to the negroes brought from Africa to America ( most of whom seem to have come from the Guinea coasts ) , the former are , in point of education and in habits of industry , far behind the latter . They have not been subjected to the industrial training of nearly two centuries of plantation life or domestic service , while comparatively few have had that stimulation which the grant of the franchise after the war of secession has exercised upon a large section of the American negroes , even in places where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practical account . On the other hand , the South African natives are far more numerous , relatively to the whites , than the negroes are in the Southern States . In the two British colonies and the two Dutch republics the total number of Europeans is about 650,000 , that of colored people about 2,450,000 , or nearly four to one , whereas in the old slave States of America there were ( in 1890 ) 13,000,000 of whites against 6,740 ,  - -  000 colored , or just half . Moreover , in Amer // ica there are more than forty millions of whites in the other parts of the republic , and the strength of the white element is therefore overwhelmingly in excess . This numerical preponderance of the blacks in South Africa does not , indeed , constitute any present political danger . The Kafirs and other colored people are not only very backward , but have no cohesion whatever . Most of them live under their tribal chiefs , and the tribes are divided from one another not only by differences of language , but by ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Xosa tribes will sometimes fight when employed side by side as railway plate-layers . The time is still far distant when all the natives will have learned to use one speech , and when they will have so far advanced in knowledge and character as to be capable of combining and of producing from among themselves leaders who can direct their collective action . So far , therefore , as politics go , there is really no more reason for alarm in South Africa for a century to come than there is in the United States . It is not so much the political as the social situation that here , as in the United States , may excite some apprehension . And this situation is likely to grow rather worse than better as time goes on ; because the more educated and capable the natives become , the more will their industrial competition press upon the whites , and the less inclined will the natives be to acquiesce , as they now do , in the social disparagement and inferiority to which the contempt and aversion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two clouds which hang over the future of South Africa . The other is the jealousy and rivalry of the Dutch and English . This latter seems for the moment to cover the sky . Yet it is really less menacing , for the difficulties it springs from are difficulties which can be measured , and which do not go so deep down into the roots of human feeling and character . Although the antagonism of the two European races has been a great misfortune for the country , and may give a good deal more trouble in the next few years or decades , it need not be permanent ; for a fusion is not merely possible , but even probable , if judicious means are followed , whereas in the case of blacks and whites fusion is evidently out of the question . In the second of these three articles , the relations of the Dutch colonists to the British government during the first years of British rule were mentioned , and the circum stances which led to the establishment of the two Dutch republics briefly sketched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races , a topic full of interest , but not easy to discuss , because at the moment of writing this article ( March , 1896 ) the political position is a critical one , and events may happen which will have transformed that position before these lines can be read in the United States . Common prudence requires that one should avoid prophecies which a few weeks may falsify , and be content with setting forth those broad features of the situation , a knowledge of which will at least help the reader to comprehend any and every event as it may supervene . The South African Dutch , or Boers ( farmers ) , as we commonly call them , are a very peculiar people , who , in isolation and backwardness , if in little else , resemble the Spaniards of such a country as Ecuador more than they do any French or British colony . They have little tie to Holland , little knowledge of , or interest in , anything that passes in Europe . Their attachment is wholly given to Africa , so much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pointed out to them that if not of European they must be of Kafir stock . The love they bear to Africa is all the more intense because the mother-country has no share in it , and their detachment from the stream of modern life is increased by the fact that they speak a tongue which is so unlike modern cultivated Dutch that they have to learn that language as they would learn Latin or English . Many can not even understand the Dutch version of the Bible , or comprehend the talk of a Hollander when he comes among them . Their speech  --  the taal , as they call it-is very rude , with a small vocabulary , corrupted to some extent by native words , and incapable of expressing abstract ideas . It has helped to keep them ignorant and curiously conservative in their social and religious ideas . Not a few look upon the scab that afflicts their sheep as a direct visitation from the Almighty , against which it is impious to take human means . Some opposed railways because God had made the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the former Transvaal presidents lost his hold upon the people because he became suspected of free opinions.1 1 The story is sometimes told that they distrusted him because he was reported to have declared in a sermon - having been formerly a Predikant ( preacher ) - that the devil had no tail , that personage being always represented with one in the old picture Bible which no Boer family is without . // They have no taste for agriculture , much less for commerce or mining or manufactures ; but love to live alone in the midst of a huge farm , where they can see no smoke but that of their own hearth , hunting the wild creatures , and driving their cattle hither and thither where the pasture is best , ruling their black herdsmen in their own grim way . No people has shown less taste for politics , and it is probably from this distaste for association and town life , which has spread from the Dutch to their English neighbors , that Cape Colony is , of all the greater British colonies , that one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact the more remarkable because there is no new country which has crowded more history into its short career than South Africa has done . The I3oers are strong , active fellows , good marksmen at short range , full of courage and capable of enduring great fatigue , unpolished as well as ignorant , but kindly and given to hospitality . The women lead sedentary lives , and are , by common consent , seldom attractive , and still more seldom intellectually cultivated ; but they too showed wonderful spirit and constancy in the dangers and hardships of the terrible Zulu wars . These characteristics belong to the Boers generally all over South Africa , in the British colonies of the Cape and Natal as well as in the republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal . But they vary in intensity according to the degree in which the Boer has been affected by English institutions , and by the ideas and habits of the English settlers . In Cape Colony there have been ninety years of British rule , with a steady , though not large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 380,000 whites , rather more than half are of Dutch origin , or habitually speak Dutch , though of course it is as hard to say who is practically to be treated as a Dutchman as it would be to say who is to be deemed a German in Iowa or a Swede in Minnesota ; for language and origin do not necessarily govern a man 's habits and sympathies . That the process of Anglicization should have proceeded so slowly in these ninety years may be ascribed , not only to the singular conservatism of the Boers , but also to the thinness of population , the Boers living in small villages , or scattered over a vast area , with few occasions for contact with the British part of the population . To-day the country districts , especially near Cape Town and in the Western Province generally , are almost wholly Dutch , while the townsfolk , even if they bear Dutch names , are practiVOL .

Nor was there any sharp political distinction till , in 1880 , the Boers of the Transvaal revolted against the British government that had been established there three years previously . The sturdy resistance which the Boers then made to the British troops evoked so warm and general a sympathy from the colonial Dutch that some fears were entertained of a civil war within the Colony itself . An outbreak of race hostility there would have been a grave misfortune , and the desire to avert such an outbreak was the strongest among the motives that induced the British government to restore to the Transvaal ( in 1881 ) its independence . Since 1881 the Dutch have formed in the colony a political party , which at present commands a majority in the Assembly . They are not , however , an antiEnglish party . They are an agricultural party , to some extent an anti-native party , in some slight degree a protectionist party ; but they have never shown any disaffection to the British crown , and their desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shared by the English members of the legislature . That the danger of race enmity , and of hostility to the connection with the mother-country , has been so far avoided is mainly due to the efforts of two statesmen . One of these persons is Mr. Hofmeyr , himself of Dutch stock , a shrewd , cool , and somewhat taciturn man , who was one of the chief founders of the so-called " Afrikander ) ) party  --  the party which is , first of all , African , and therefore primarily , though not exclusively , Dutch in sentiment . The other statesman is Mr. Cecil Rhodes , an Englishman born , the son of a country clergyman , and himself a graduate of Oxford University . No man in South Africa has been more steadily attached to the British connection , or has done half so much to secure for Britain those vast territories to the west and to the north of the Transvaal , which were coveted by both the Transvaal Republic and by the German Empire . But in his political career in Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1890 , till January , 1896 , Mr. Rhodes succeeded in obtaining the support of the Dutch party , and labored assiduously to bring about a unity of sentiment and aim between the Dutch and the British elements in the population . The energy and firmness of his character , and the grasp of // political and economic questions which he has evinced , make him the most striking figure among the colonial statesmen of Britain in this generation . He has been deemed by some a less adroit parliamentarian than was the late Sir John Macdonald in Canada , but he is possessed of a wider outlook and far more conspicuous executive capacity . The ascendancy which these gifts secured for him enabled him , while extending British influence up to and beyond the Zambesi , at the same time to retain , down till the recent Transvaal troubles , which have gravely affected the situation , the confidence of that Dutch , orAfrikander , population which had least national sympathy with what is called an ( ( imperial British policy . ) ) So much for Cape Colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the smaller of these , the Orange Free State , the Boer element largely preponderates over the British . English is spoken in the towns , and by many farmers ; but South African Dutch is the official language , and the speech of three fourths of the whites . They are , on the whole , less Anglicized than the colonial Boers , but they have little or no anti-English sentiment ; for the British government has never , since the renunciation of its sovereignty in 1854 , interfered with their independence , and the citizens of English stock are just as much attached to that independence as are the purest-blooded Boers . The commercial ties that unite them to Cape Colony have been drawn closer by the construction of a railway through the state by the Cape government , and by the conclusion of a customs union with the Cape . Nevertheless , the sentiment of kinship with the Boers in other parts of Africa remains strong . In 1881 many of the Orange Free State men were arming to help their Transvaal brethren , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more than once mooted . It is in the Transvaal that the Dutch African stock has remained least intermingled with any foreign strain , preserving in their crudest form all the peculiarities of its very peculiar character . The Boers live dispersed on their huge farms over this huge territory . There are only some sixty or seventy thousand of them in an area as big as Great Britain , seeing few strangers , and hearing little of what goes on in the rest of the world . Many are illiterate , and the rest read nothing but the Bible . These conditions , coupled with natural force of character , might seem to be favorable conditions for the production of a simple and imaginative literature . But the Boers have never produced any literature whatever , and the limited resources of their taal would , indeed , hardly permit them to do so . They are very prejudiced , and the strongest of their prejudices , next to that against Roman Catholics , or persons theologically suspect , is against the English , whom they call ( ( red-necks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . So dearly do they love their roaming pastoral and hunting life that the discovery of gold-fields in their territory caused them littie pleasure . They were content to sell the land to the speculators who flocked in , and never attempted to work the mines themselves , or even to tak6 shares in the mining companies . There are among them so few persons fitted by education or taste for any kind of administrative work that when the need was felt for such persons to fill the largely increased number of official posts , President Krueger , being unwilling to take them from the Dutchspeaking people of a British colony , resolved to import his officials from Holland . These newly arrived Hollanders , whose number has become considerable , -I have heard it estimated at fifteen hundred ,  --  are now an important factor . They are disliked and suspected by the old Boers , partly as strangers , partly , one is told , because their orthodoxy is doubted ; but they exercise much influence on the policy of the Boer government , and they are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-English in sentiment as the most old-fashioned Boer can be . Besides the old Boers and the new Hollanders , there has grown up in the Transvaal during the last ten years a large population of strangers , the so-called Uitlanders , who have come in for the sake of working the mines or of supplying goods to those who work them . Probably one half of the strangers come from Cape Colony and Natal , some being of British , a smaller number of Dutch origin . Of the rest the large majority are British , but there are also many Australians , several thousand Germans , some Italians , and a few French and Scandinavians , as well as Russian Jews . There are also Americans , important not so much from their numbers as from their position ; for most of the mining engineers , with a good many of the foremen and skilled workmen , have brought their special knowledge and experience hither from California or other parts of the Western States . It is impossible to estimate either the total strength of this host of newcomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the influx has been rapid , and the component elements vary // from month to month . You might as well try to measure the volume of a South African river , which rises and sinks according to the rain-storms that in the wet season burst along the courses of its various affluents . Last November the Cape railway was bringing into the Witwatersrand gold-fields a thousand European immigrants every week . This mixed multitude , however , falls into two broad divisions , those who speak English , coming from Britain , from Cape Colony , from Australia , and from the United States , and those who speak some other European language . The former are , of course , far more numerous-probably four fifths of the total , which at the end of last year must have reached or exceeded one hundred thousand , being therefore much larger than the whole number of native Boers . The singular contrast of two populations which the Transvaal presents is probably without precedent . On the one hand , a multitude of strangers , brought together from every corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a small space , from which they have squeezed out the former inhabitants ; on the other hand , a simple , pastoral people , untouched by modern commercial civilization and modern ideas , scattered over a vast area , where they seek to live in the primitive fashion of their forefathers , but unable to avoid the impact of these strangers , and driven to think how they can best avoid being absorbed or overmastered by them . In the struggle which circumstances have made inevitable , the chances might seem to lie in favor of the newcomers , who have wealth , numbers , and intelligence on their side . The Boers , however , are made of tough and xvell-tempered metal . As in Montenegro , every man between sixteen and sixty is a soldier  --  a soldier who , like the Montenegrin , makes up for the want of discipline by his hardy frame , his courage , and his religious devotion to the cause of his people . They have also the advantage of a seasoned and skilful chief . President Krueger , who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great trek of 1886 , has , since he reached manhood , been conspicuous in the military adventures and civil troubles of the country . To the natural shrewdness and tenacity of his character , these years of active and changeful life have added a great experience of men and a perfect coolness in emergencies . He is keen , vigilant , astute , and , above all , resolute , and he represents so faithfully the dominant feelings and the inbred habits of the Boer people that he has been able to acquire a surprising influence over them , and to exert over the Assembly a practical authority far in excess of the very limited powers which the constitution of the republic permits to the President . The struggle between the Boers and the strangers , which has practically become a struggle between the English and the Dutch elements , now centers in the demand of the strangers to be admitted to the electoral franchise . Formerly electoral rights were readily acquirable by an immigrant in the Transvaal , as they are to-day in the Orange Free State . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when President Krueger perceived that the influx of strangers would alter the character of the electorate , and ultimately transfer the balance of power to English-speaking citizens , he persuaded the Assembly to extend the period of residence required for citizenship , first to five , and then to fifteen years , and thus practically to exclude the whole of the new population which has come in since 1885 . Thus electoral rights are now confined to less than twenty-five thousand citizens , while probably double that number of person , of voting age and sex , are living within the republic debarred from those rights . It is easy to understand Mr. Krueger 's position . ( ( These newcomers , ) ) he argues , **are in all essentials strangers to our polity . They do not belong to our Dutch Reformed churches ; they do not like our customs ; they do not speak our tongue . They would use their votes , if votes were given them , to turn out the present officials and legislators , and would end by making the country English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a fate that we quitted the homes of our fathers to go out into the wilderness and overcome the Zulus sixty years ago ; and against such a fate we will struggle to the end . ) ) On the other hand , the strangers complain that , though they form a large majority of the population , own half the land in the republic , and pay more than ninety per cent . of the taxes , they are denied a share in the government of the country and in the application of its revenues , and are obliged to submit to excessive and unfair imposts , voted by a legislature some of whose members are gravely suspected of corruption , and administered by officials many of whom are far from trustworthy . These were the motives which prompted the creation three years ago of an organization to obtain political reforms , and which led to the rising of the stranger population , or rather of a part of the English-speaking portion of it , // at Johannesburg in December last  --  a rising the declared aim of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compel the Boer Assembly to extend the suffrage to the newcomers . Of that abortive rising , and of the expedition of the British South Africa Company 's men , which came to help it , but was surrounded and forced to surrender to the Boer troops , this is not the place to speak , for those events have led to judicial proceedings now pending in England . The result has so far been unfavorable to the demands of the strangers . President Krueger 's hold on his citizens had been previously shaken by their dislike to the officials he had brought from Holland . The invasion , however , evoked all the patriotism of the Boers , and made the President , who successfully withstood it , more popular than ever . At the same time it stirred the feelings of the Dutch in the Orange Free State and even in Cape Colony . Seeing theirown kinsfolk threatened by an expedition which had started from British soil , they forgot for the moment their own commercial grievances against the Transvaal government ( which had built up a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy to the threatened republic . As the British home government had not only disavowed , but had even tried to stop , the expedition on its way , no resentment has been felt by the Cape Dutch against Britain . But the movement toward a political fusion of Dutch and English in the Colony has received a check , and the tendency of the Orange Free State toward a closer union with its sister republic has been strengthened . Meanwhile , the grievances of the new population in the Transvaal have not been removed , and as the influx of strangers to the Witwatersrand mines will doubtless continue , it is clear that something must be done to give a more or less complete satisfaction to their claims , and to prevent a recurrence of the troubles of last December and January . It is impossible , in our times , for a minority to continue to rule over a large and increasing unenfranchised majority of people superior in intelligence and wealth , however strong the original position of the minority may have been , and whatever sympathy their attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have dwelt somewhat fully on the relations of the Boers to the English-speaking strangers in the Transvaal , because the questions now at issue there involve the wider issue between the English and Dutch races in South Africa . The Witwatersrand mining district is at this moment the political center of the southern half of the continent ; for it is by far the wealthiest district , and it is the spot where population is becoming dense , and in which finance has established its seat . For the next fifty years at least it will apparently be the focus of industry and commerce for the surrounding counties from Cape Town to the Zambesi . It is the magnitude of the prize that makes the present contest exciting , and draws the eyes of Europe to these few square miles of barren upland , of which no one had heard fifteen years ago . Whatever be the political outcome of the contest , whether the strangers obtain votes or not , and whether or not the present form of government is maintained , there can not be much doubt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boers are not inferior to the English settlers either physically or in force of character . Probably they are not less capable of developing , with proper education and under stimulative conditions , a vigorous intellectual life . There is no better stock in the world than that Low German stock to which they belong . But not only are they less numerous and less wealthy than the English-speaking strangers ( many of the cleverest of whom are not English at all , but of Semitic origin ) , but they are unsuited by their ideas and habits for the task of developing the material resources of their country , and dealing with the financial and commercial problems which its rapid growth has brought to the front . Without in the least comparing them to the Mormons , who were far inferior to them in many respects , their civilization resembles that of the Mormons in being one which could maintain itself only in isolation . Now that the strenuous industrial current of the modern world has reached it and begun to wash against it , its foundations can not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all South Africa with the Transvaal , seems destined in the future to belong to the English type of civilization , and to speak the English tongue . But the Dutch tongue also will hold its ground for many years to come , and Boer traits will no doubt powerfully affect the South African character as it acquires , after a generation or two , a settled and distinctive quality . The wish and hope of every one who knows the country must be that the fusion , which will ( almost certainly ) come at last , may come peaceably , and come not by a victory of the one element which could leave resentment in the breasts of the other , but by a process of gradual assimilation similar to that which turned Englishmen and Scotchmen from ene // mies into friends , and is welding Flemings and Walloons into one Belgian people . The reader may expect , before this article comes to an end , some brief expression of opinion as to the more distant future of South Africa , and particularly as to whether its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dominant powers of the southern hemisphere  --  a nation such as the Australians are becoming in the East , and as the Argentine Republic might become in South America , were it in the hands of an orderly and progressive race . That South Africa will ultimately be united into one political body , probably in a federative form , seems highly probable . Federative union would not only increase its political strength , but would also accelerate its material development . Its growth in wealth and population will , however , depend chiefly on its natural resources . Agricultural progress can hardly be rapid while other countries produce , without artificial aid , foodstuffs which in this dry climate must , over wide areas , be grown by means of irrigation . The capabilities of South Africa for stockraising are unquestionable ; but stock-raising , even on a vast scale , does not imply any great increase of population , or any great advance in the arts and refinements of life . It is therefore chiefly in respect of its mineral treasures that wealth will grow , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of settlers to the mines creates markets and stimulates every branch of trade . The value of the mines of Matabeleland and Mashona land is still imperfectly ascertained , but that of the Witwatersrand gold-field admits of no doubt , and even if , as some experts hold , that gold-field will be worked out within a century from now , it seems certain that for fifty years at least it will continue to provide occupation for a large mass of people , skilled as well as unskilled workers . In that region , therefore , a considerable growth of population may be looked for , and it will be accompanied by a less rapid rise in the number of those who pursue agriculture , or otherwise supply the wants of a mining class . Probably , therefore , a steady growth , as well of population as of wealth , can be counted on for a century to come , which is as far forward as any one can venture to look . But the growth may not be very swift , and the white population , which is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all South Africa , may , twenty-five or thirty years hence , scarcely exceed two millions . For it must be remembered that the laboring population is colored and will remain colored . Speaking broadly , the country will be a black man 's , and not a white man 's , country , and this is why the question of the future social and industrial relations of blacks and whites becomes of such paramount importance . There is no reason to apprehend in South Africa , any more than in the Southern States of America , a predominance of the inferior race ; but the future peace and prosper / ity of the country will largely depend upon I the wisdom and temper with which the higher / race treats the backward one , and leads it on-I ward and upward .
