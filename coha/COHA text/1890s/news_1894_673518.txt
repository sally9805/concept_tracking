It is a rule of the Pension Office that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , unless there is some good reason why this can not be done , and in these cases the pension money may be delivered to a Commissioner , who acts for the pensioner . Agnes was a worthy woman . She was blind and could not go to the Post Office for her mail . She could not , hecause of her blindness , sign her name to the pension voucher . She made her mark instead . While in Ogdensburg The New-York Times 's reporter could not find Agnes , or any one who knew her . At length it was learned that she was dead . At the Ogdensburg Post Office her name was still on the directory which the letter carriers had made out , and there it was known that she was the mother of James B. , who also draws a pension , and who is a painter well known in town . He was visited by the reporter . He was painting a barn , a short distance back from Catharine Street . below Ford , at the time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a year . He had forgotten the precise date of her death , he said . ' " Did you know that her name still stands on the pension roll ? " he was asked . " I did not , " he said , with evident anxiety . " I do n't think any pension money has come to her since her death . " " When she died did you notify the Pension Office ? " he was asked . " I told Frank Johnson , who looks after pension matters , " he said . " I supposed the pension had stopped . My mother . died a year ago last April , I think . I do not remember precisely the date . " A letter was sent to the Pension Office in Buffalo asking when the last money had been paid to Agnes ; also if she had been in the habit of receiving the money herself . It was several days before any answer was received . Meantime , Pension Agent Orr , or one of his subordinates , wrote to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive . He asked also for the date of her death , if she were dead . The postal officials took pains to secure the desired information for the Pension Agent at Buffalo . Meantime the reporter called on James B. again . " I did not tell Mr. Johnson that my mother was dead , as I said I did , " he said , " but I told another attorney , a man named Wells . My mother died in May , 1892 , just after having drawn her allowance for the preceding three months . " " You are sure about this , are you ? " the reporter asked . " Yes , I 'm sure of it , " he said . On the records of the city Health Department , kept within a stone 's throw of where Mr. was when he gave this information , the reporter found the record of the death of Agnes This record showed that she had died April 24 , 1S92 , of consumption . Her registry number is 2,0E5 . A few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word came from the Buffalo agency that Agnes ? had not been drawing a pension since April 4 , 1892 . Was the name of Agnes on the books at Buffalo when the copy was made by officials there , in Tilly , 1893 ? If a mistake in copying was made , why did the Pension Office find it necessary to ask at the Ogdensburg Post Office if Agnes were dead , after the reporter raised the question and before any answer was made ? If the name was on the books , what became of the $12 a month to which Agnes was entitled ?
