txt There was a very significant passage in the interesting London dispatch in our Financial Review yesterday . After referring to the large amount of our securi-. ties taken by us in exchange for the exports of our food products , estimated by one of the bank Presidents of London as involving , for the past year alone , a rev-. enue of $25,000,000 , or a capital of at least $500,000,000 , our correspondent re-marked : " We feel here that you are taking too little account of the possible upheaval in Europe both to credits and in a political way that may follow your present financial I and market operations . You have an immense realized wealth and still more immense resources , but you can not yet do without us . Should you overbuy , even temporarily , and have to lean on Europe 's available credit resources to any large extent , you might find our money markets fail you at the pinch . Some of these markets hang on to solvency , as it were , by their eyelashes even now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial change in the easy condition of the money market that has prevailed for some time . Neither the situation of the New York banks nor the reports from other parts of the country can be regarded as showing signs of that change . The deposits in New York have grown in the past.year from $734,000,000 to $880,000,000 , while the loans have in the same time advanced from $634,000 , - 000 to $742,000,000 , which shows certain13 ' a normal and even a conservative ratio . And though there has of course been a good deal of speculation in the recent rising market , there is no indication , that it has been very extreme , or that it has as yet embraced any considerable amount ' of risky purchases . We can at least say with confidence that there are not on our market many " simpletons " capable of the kind of ? folly reported in London by our correspondent , " selling Americans to buy South African shares . " All the same , the change will come in time , for It is in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in times of prosperity , letting their hopes and not their reason guide them , and straining their credit to the ' breaking point to secure the profits that seem certain , and that are in reality less and less so the longer the prosperity continues . We shall not always have big crops and a big demand for them in the markets of the world . In our manufactures we shall overproduce , despite our greatly extending population and the steady ' spread of the area of our exports . There is not the slightest ground to expect that the alternating periods of expansion and contraction , prosperity and depression , the fat years and the lean , will fail to follow each other in the future as in the past , though undoubtedly the general course of the fortunes of our active and resourceful people will be forward . For the changes inherent in the nature of trade we need feel no fear . We can meet them as well as any people in the world . But we should not forget that we have of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase our risks and our difficulties and our losses when the inevitable turn in the tide comes . One of the absolutely sure features of that change will be a demand for gold . Under our present system of currency that demand will fall promptly on the Government stock which can be drawn on by the presentation of Government notes over and over again , as our laws duly provide and as our experience shows , with bitter certainty , is done . The stock thus open to an indefinite and continuous drain can not be renewed by any means except loans of a most difficult sort , which must be undertaken at a time of unusual distress . On this stock , nevertheless , depends absolutely the maintenance at par of our vast volume of paper , amounting to some $800,000,000 . Any doubt as to this paper necessarily increases alarm and aggravates all the difficulties of a period of reaction . This is not the lesson of reflection , it is the lesson of experience recent and terrible . Will we heed it ? That is the question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should ask themselves at this time , when a solution is perfectly easy
