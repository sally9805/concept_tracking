By Albert Bushnell Hart . THE question which we shall try to answer in this paper is apparently a very simple one . Ask an officer of the Union army , and he will tell you that the North won because of our great generals , - that Thomas , Sheridab , Sherman , and Grant broke the Confederacy to pieces . Ask a soldier how the victory was won , and he will tell you that the Sixth Corps " smashed Ewell at Sailor 's Creek , " or that Sherman 's veterans cut the Confederacy in two . Ask a public man , and he will tell you , perhaps in ten volumes , that it was Abraham Lincoln to whom we owe the success of the Union . Ask Abraham Lincoln himself , and he would reply in the spirit of those words which no repetition can make trite , and which prove him a master of English as he was a master of men , that the war was carried on by " a government of the people , by the people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true so far as it goes . Without commanders of genius guiding magnificent armies , supported by those statesmen of whom Abraham Lincoln was the chief ; without the devotion and self1sacrifice of a great nation , - the Confederacy never could have been put down . Military men have a saying that there comes a time in a campaign when , if victory is to be obtained , it is necessary to put into service the last officer , the last man , the last camp follower , and the last army mule ; and the triumphant and complete success of the northern arms in the Civil War is due to the fact that when the final test of strength , came in 1865 , the North had at every point more officers , more men , more camp followers , and more army mules . Yet even an observer who could have foreseen the eventual combination of military , material , and moral forces of the northern people , might still have predicted , in i86i , that the Southern Confederacy would obtain its independence . An address of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory and independence with an unparalleled career of glory , prosperity , and progress await us in the future . " At the beginning of the struggle the Southern leaders , even those who best understood the fighting spirit of the North , were as confident of success as they were of the rising of the sun . Thus Jefferson Davis , in his message of July 20 , i86i , declared that " to speak of subjugating such a people , so united and determined , is to speak in a language incomprehensible to them . " Toward the close of 1862 , Mr. Gladstone made his famous declaration which he has lived to repent - that " Mr. Jefferson Davis has made an army , he has made a navy , and , more than that , he has made a nation . " At the very beginning of the struggle , old General Wool gave it as his military opinion that two hundred thousand troops should be placed in the field against Richmond , and Sherman asked for a like number in Kentucky , if the movement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and few foreigners believed that the North possessed a military superiority over the South . To be sure , John Bright , who might with William Lloyd Garrison have said , " The world is my country , " not only asserted the rightfulness of the principles of the North , but predicted its success ; and Cairnes , in his book upon the slave-power , showed reason why we must succeed ; but most other observers saw only that Virginia was older than Plymouth , that the South h8d had as long and as eventful a history as the North , that in toe Revolution and after it southern statesmen had stood on moie than equal terms with northern , and that for seventy years the influence of the South had been predominant in internal parties and in foreign policy . XVhat reason was there to suppose that when the two sections were separated , the South would prove inferior ? It was known that the population of the South was smaller , but the experience of the world up to this time seemed to show that a people determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times their force , unless a policy of extermination were adopted . Holland , with its two millions , had sustained itself during a war of seventy years against the greatest and proudest empire of the world ; Spain , from 1809 to 1812 , had by a popular uprising successfully resisted the armies of Napoleon ; Ireland , after a domination of seven centuries , is not yet perfectly subdued ; the American colonies , with a population of three millions , had successfully resisted the mother country with a population of twelve millions ; the feeble Spanish American colonies , with the exception of Cuba , had all won their independence against the overpowering force of Spain . The secession of the Southern states and their acceptance of the issue of the war was , therefore , not a foolhardy enterprise the experience of mankind made it probable that it would succeed . Nor did the Confederacy expect to depend wholly upon its own resources . One of the first acts of the Confederate government was to send envoys to foreign powers . The South believed that its cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must interfere , if necessary , to assist the infant nation ; and great was the jubilation when , on the 3d of December , 1863 , Pope Pius IX . addressed a letter to that il/us/ris et /iouoraloYis vir , Jefferson Davis , which was construed by the Confederacy into a recognition by a foreign potentate , - the only recognition which it ever received . The first years of the war were not such as to destroy the hopes of the South . The first battle of Bull Run , in i86r ; the second battle of Bull Run , and Pittsburg Landing , in 1862 ; Chickamauga , Chancellorsville , and even Gettysburg , in 1863 , proved that the South might still hope to maintain itself in the field , until dissensions in the North , or foreign complications , or the intervention of foreign powers , should put an end to the war . To the last , the Northern armies were fully employed . In the great campaign of 1864 , Grant lost more than the entire army of Lee ; and at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse of the Confederacy was not the result of happy accident , nor of overpowering generalship ; it was caused by the steady , unremitting pressure of an adversary superior in forces , in resources , and in morale . After the war was over , Lee was once asked by a Confederate officer why , during the campaign of 1864 , he never made a diversion or a sudden attack upon Grant 's lines ; and Lee replied that Grant had but once throughout the campaign given him an opportunity , and that that opportunity had been lost by the error of a subordinate . Nowhere in history is there an example of more undiscouraged attack or more stubborn resistance , than in the Civil War . Some deeper causes must , therefore , be sought if we will account for the fact that not only was the South beaten , but that the defeat was overwhelming , absolute , and permanent . There must have been essential differences in the character and the equipment of the two sides ; and it is the purpose of this paper to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South and the strength of the North . We shall not concern ourselves with the causes of secession , with the question whether it was constitutional or unconstitutional , right or wrong . We shall simply take the two sections as they existed on April 12 , i86i , when the war began with the firing upon Fort Sumter , and as they were developed down to the surrender of the southern army in r86* . Some of these reasons are to be found in the geographical situation of the two parts of the country , some in the economic differences of the two sections , some in the social differences of civilization , and some in the different moral quality of the people and the institutions for which they were fighting . At the beginning of the struggle , the advantage of geographical situation seemed to be decidedly with the South . Leaving out of account the territories and the two states of the Pacific Slope , which entered very little into the military contest , the seventeen free states had , in i86o , 768,255 square miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 875,743 square miles . This larger // territory , however , was not in itself a source of military strength . Its frontiers were vast and difficult to defend , and a very considerable part of that territory never came under the control of the Confederate States of America . In the resources of the soil , in variety of natural production , the South was in every way equal to the North . The great staple of the South had for many years been cotton . It was easily raised , easily handled , had considerable value in small bulk , and commanded a good price in cash in the markets of the world . The cotton crop of i86o was 4,700,000 bales , valued at $230,000,000 . Vith cotton and the proceeds of cotton , the South was able to buy clothing , supplies , and food ; for it is a notable fact that for many years the South had been accustomed to supply itself in part with bacon and corn from the northwestern statcs . One of the early acts of the Confederacy was to prohibit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoped thereby to bring foreign powers to interfere . The result was that a considerable part of the cotton crop of i86o and almost toe whole of the crops of 1862-3-4 were shut in by the blockade . A great pressure was brought to bear by the Confederate government upon the planters , to induce them to sow corn , and this pressure had especial effect in the year 864 . The industry of the people , particularly in Georgia , prepared a bountiful crop , which ripened just in time to furnish subsistence for Sherman 's army on its march to the Sea . Toward the end of the war the people of Richmond sometimes suffered for food . George Cary Eggleston , in his " Rebel 's Recollections , ** tells pathetic stories of the wretchedness to which the troops were reduced in 1865 ; and it is well-known that at the surrender of Appomattox , General Lee was obliged to ask for rations for his troops from the commander of the conquering forces . The northern staples throughout the war , especially of breadstuffs , were freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Inferior as the South was in its products , it was strong in natural defences . The Atlantic and Gulf coasts abounded in shallow harbors not easily penetrable by a hostile force . It was a coast difficult to invade , yet furnishing many havens from which cruisers and privateers might sally forth . Throughout the war no progress was made by northern armies moving inward from the sea . From the valley of the Shenandoah to northern Alabama the South was flanked by a natural and impregnable defence , the Appalachian chain of mountains . In the condition of military transportation at that time it was impossible for a large army to carry with it the supplies for men and animals necessary for a march of a hundred miles through a mountain region . At the beginning of the war Lincoln , with the supreme common-sense which , when applied to military matters , made him often a better general than the generals , suggested that a railroad should be built southeast from some point on the Ohio River , to penetrate the mountain system . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have shortened the war , by a year ; for the only country between Harper 's Ferry and northern Mississippi which at that time was penetrated by a railroad leading from North to South was the rugged region lying between Chattanooga and Atlanta . Down that line of railroad , Sherman fought his way in 1864 ; and from Atlanta he proceeded on the march which cut the Confederacy in twain . Except upon that line of railroad the South proved impregnable to land assault from the northwest . Another vast geographical advantage which the South possessed at the beginning of the war disappeared in 1863 . By its control of the mouth of the Mississippi , the Southern Confederacy expected to compel the friendship , if not the adhesion , of the upper Mississippi states . The South believed that it held in its hand the key to the commerce of the interior of the Union , and an early act of the Confederate Congress declared the Mississippi open to the friends of the Confederacy . But the Erie Canal and the four lines of trans-Alleghany railways , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore &amp; Ohio , united the West still more strongly to the East . // The northwestern states saw , aside from all moral questions connected with slavery , that the success of the Union meant that both the eastern and the southern highways would be opened ; while the success of the Confederacy meant that one or the other must be in the hands of a hostile power . Whatever the expectations of the South , the capture of New Orleans in 1862 , and of Vicksburg , July 4 , 1863 , not only dismembered the Confederacy , but quieted the fears of the northern interior states . Thenceforward , as Lincoln wrote , " the Father of Waters rolled unvexed to the sea . " Another military advantage in the South was the sparseness of its population , and the fact that a great part of the theatre of war was untilled . Except in the Shenandoah Valley , to a less degree in Mississippi , the Federal armies could noxvhere support themselves from the country until Sherman 's march to the sea in 1864 . They advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy 's country . The South had not only the advantages of situation , but of fighting in the midst of a friendly population and fighting on the inside lines . However unpractical the transportation system of the South , it was vastly easier to move troops from Richmond to Atlanta than from Washington to the Mississippi . In a word , the theatre of the war was finally narrowed to the strip of territory between the western edge of the mountains and the sea . Within that strip a smaller number of troops could make head against a larger number ; and in the later st*ges of the war two hundred thousand Confederate troops kept a million northern soldiers employed . All comparisons of area and even of geographical advantages are subordinate to the question of the economic resources of the two sections , - in men , in wealth , in courage , in military resources , and in means of communication . And here we reach that disadvantage of the South , to which its conquest must be chiefly attributed . XVe have , in the census of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two sections at the outbreak of the war . The i * slaveholding states had a population of 12,315,373 ; the 17 northern free states from Kansas to Maine , had a population of 18,441,017 ; that is , the population of the slave-holding region to the free region was about as two to three . The superiority of northern numbers was plainly entirely insufficient for carrying on a war of offence and of conquest . The proportion between the population of the free and of the slaveholding sections had greatly changed since 1790 . In that year the South had a population equal to the combined population of the Middle and New England states . In 1830 , the North had gained a million more than the South ; in i 86o , it had gained six millions more . The rapid growth of the North had been due in great part to immigration : of the 4,136,1 75 foreign-born persons within the limits of the United States in i86o , only about three hundred thousand could be found in the slaveholding states outside the cities of St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cities connected as much with the West as with the South . In the North , the proportion of foreigners was twenty per cent . In the Confederacy , it was three per cent . The changed importance of the two sections is shown in the census maps which illustrate the distribution of the population by degrees of density in 1790 and in i86o . It will be seen at once that almost all the areas of dense population are found north of the Ohio River , and of Maryland and Virginia . The loss of southern predominance is shown by the fact that , in I 790 , of the seven states of the Union first in population , four were slave states ; in i86o , of the seven first states , but one was a slave state , and that was Missouri , which , in 1790 , had been a wilderness and not within the limits of the United States . In fact , nothing can be more certain than that the Civil War was precipitated by the conviction of southern leaders that the North had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay made the ' South weaker in proportion . So far we have compared merely the population of the slave-holding and the free states . But the Southern Confederacy , at the very beginning , encountered // a fatal disappointment : it failed to carry with it four of the slave-holding states , Missouri , Maryland , Delaware , Kentucky , and a part of a fifth , West Virginia . These states , having a combined population of 3,600,000 people , never seceded , never furnished money for the Confederate cause , and the men who entered the Confederate army from those states were nearly offset by the mountaineers from Tennessee and North Carolina , who entered the Union Army . The action of a few patriotic men like Holt of Kentucky , Fletcher of Missouri , and Brown of Maryland , and the l ) rompt action of Butler and Frdmont and Buell and Grant , in securing a military occupation of those states , prevented them from throwing in their lot with the Confederacy . The population of the eleven seceding states was 8,700,000 : the population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 21 ,  - -  950,000 . Instead of the odds of population being three to two in favor of the North , they were thus made five to two . With proper military management , aided by a spirited support from the n.orthern people , the defeat of the South was therefore physically possible ; indeed , defeat was likely . Nor was this the only advantage gained by the North , in its relations with the border states in i86i . The theatre of war was thrust further south . The possession of Kentucky and Missouri enabled the northern troops to block the entrance of the Tennessee and of the Missouri rivers ; and the military occupation of the border states , which were justly assumed to be lukewarm in their support of the Union , made it possible to return members of Congress from those states , who did not represent their people ; thus was insured that compact majority in Congress which supported the President , pressed forward the war , urged through the constitutional amendments , and completed the process of reconstruction . When Virginia , on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops with defiance , she did it because she understood , as Von Holst has well said , that she belonged either to hammer or anvil , and she preferred to strike rather than to receive a blow . When the secession of Maryland , Kentucky , and Missouri was prevented , they did not remove the war from their borders ; but their strength was lost to the weaker party , if not wholly transferred to the stronger . If the South were to win , then a numerical inferiority must be made up by a superiority of resources ; but in wealth still more than in numbers the South had lagged behind . In the seceding states , 56,000,000 acres of land were improved , and the total value of farm lands was $I , 85o , ooo , ooo . In the North and the border states the improved land was less than twice as great in area but its value was $4,800,000,000 , or more than two and a half times as much . Throughout the South , the tillage was primitive and rude and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North , machinery and improved processes made it possible to raise a larger crop in proportion to the laborers employed . Manufactures of every kind were wofully deficient in the South . In a region including the enormous coal and iron beds of Alabama , and Georgia , one of the richest deposits on the face of the earth , there was but one large blast furnace and ten rail mills . To manufacture its great staple , cotton , the South had but i*o factories , against more than 900 in the North , and the value of the manufactured fabric of the South was but $8 , ooo , ooo , in the total of $rr5*ooo , ooo . Of the 12 6o woollen factories of the country , 78 were in the South . The manufacture of clothing , an essential industry when war is going on , employed , in i 86o , less than 2,000 persons in the Southern states , and nearly ioo , ooo in the North . Of boots and shoes , the South furnished but three per cent of the product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and the North for almost every yard of cloth , and every coat and boot and hat that we wear , for our axes , scythes , tubs , and buckets , in short , for everything except our bread and meat , it must occur to the South that if our relations with the North are ever severed , - and how soon they may be none can know ; may God forbid it long ! - we should , in all the South , not be able to clothe ourselves ; we could not fill our firesides , plough our fields , nor mow our meadows ; in fact , we should be reduced to a state more abject than we are willing to look at even prospectively . And yet , all of these things // staring us in the face , we shut our eyes and go in blindfold . " The accumulated wealth of the two sections is hard to estimate . The real estate of the South was , in i86o , valued at under $2,000,000,000 ; that of the North at over $5,000,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,500,000,000 ; but in the South that personalty consisted in great part of slaves , a form of riches which proved to have a singular aptitude for taking to itself wings and flying away . Perhaps a better comparison of wealth is that of imports . In i86o the South imported 31,000,000 worth of goods , and the North , *33I,000,000 worth . In modern warfare , however , credit is often as valuable as property . Here again the South was from the first in the position of inferiority . At the beginning of the war , the South had a banking capital of $47,000,000 ; the North , of about $330,000,000 . The accumulation of specie and of stocks of goods in the South were probably not one-seventh of those in the North . The very first attempts to raise money on any considerable scale showed the weakness of the South . The taxes were rigorous and steadily increased , but the money with which to pay them did not exist ; and provision for payment in kind was made at the very beginning . Cotton and food products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of the South were called upon to subscribe their hair to be sold for the support of the government , and they responded in that spirit of heroic self-devotion which marked the southern women throughout the struggle . It is impossible to give the figures of the revenue or expenditure of the Confederate government after the first year of the war . It is probable that in no year did the government receive in taxes and loans the equivalent of $ioo , ooo , ooo in greenback currency ; while the North in the year 1865 raised in taxes , $322,000 , 000 , and borrowed $1,472,000,000 a considerable part abroad . Of the debt of the Confederacy it is equally impossible to speak with accuracy . On one occasion the Secretary of the Confederate Treasury sent into Congress a report in which he stated the outstanding debt . The next day the report was withdrawn because a trifling error in the total had been discovered . The error was $400 ,  - -  000,000 ; what the total must have been may be left to the imagination , it is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the support of the government , that paper money was floated until it would float no longer , until it was signed in baskets full by young ladies of good family in Richmond , until post-office clerks resigned because they could no longer live on nine thousand dollars a year . The popular state of mind in regard to southern finances is well stated in a story related by a Confederate officer . A raw-boned countryman was seen riding through the camp upon a fine horse . An officer stopped him and offered him five hundred dollars for the horse . " What , " said the man , " " five hundred dollars for that horse ? Five hundred dollars ! " he repeated . " XVhy , I paid a thousand dollars this morning for currying of him . " Mr. Eggleston related that the highest price he ever saw paid was five hundred dollars for a pair of boots . After Lee 's surrender , when no amount of Confederate currency was of any value , and greenbacks were hard to obtain , a Virginia gentleman travelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of molasses for entertainment or ferriage , he simply opened the spigot and let a sufficient quantity flow to pay his bill . The poverty of the South , a poverty made more unendurable by the rigorous blockade , bore especially hard in the matter of military supplies . The one large iron works in the country , the Tredegar , was run night and day to supply materials . Arms , cannon , munitions could be imported in limited quantities by the blockade runners ; clothing came in the same way ; but medical supplies , hospital comforts , even food , were often lacking . According to a Confederate officer , great was the joy expressed in the army when , by a convenient obliquity of vision on the part of General Butler , who commanded the Union lines at that point , a cargo of Bermuda onions was brought through the Union lines and issued to Lee 's army . The North , on the other hand , was // supplied with all that a rich country could furnish , or that money could buy in foreign countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever so well fed , probably no army was ever so well clothed , as that of the United States . No army has ever had such a wellorganized and devoted corps of men and women to care for wounded and sick . And when we consider , as we must with a shudder , the sufferings of northern soldiers in the southern prison pens , we must remember that , while the worst horrors of their confinement were caused by the deliberate neglect and brutality of those in charge of their camps , their coarse food and wretched clothing were often no worse than those of the southern troops in the front . Yet there were still , after the surrender of Lee and Johnston , many thouT sands of men under arms , and a guerilla warfare would have been possible . The Mississippi was ploughed from its source to the sea by northern steamers , yet the troops of Arkansas , Texas , and Louisiana had still managed to reach the main Confederate armies . Sherman made his magnificent march from Atlanta to the sea , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very magnitude of the efforts put forth by the South had convinced it that longer resistance was useless . The true military reason for the collapse of the Confederacy is to be found , not so much in the fearful hammer-like bloxvs of Thomas , Sherman , and Grant , as in the efforts of an unseen enemy , the ships of the blockading squadrons . Never in the history of the world has a navy been called upon to perform such a difficult and almost impossible task as fell to the American navy . A coast-line of two thousand five hundred miles with more than thirty ports practicable for blockade runners , was so sealed up that the South was thrown upon its own resources . The struggle could not be prolonged , because the army could be neither fed nor supplied from the cotton bales . The wealth of the country went to waste because it could not be exchanged for the foreign products essential for the prosecution of the war . The limited military resources of the South were made less available because of the lack of sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the eastward , were early occupied or blockaded by the North . Union troops could be shipped from New York to Hampton Roads , or to Florida , or to Mobile , or to New Orleans ; after the first months of the war no Confederate troops could be forwarded by sea . The country therefore was thrown upon its railroads . These roads were few , improperly built , as had been the case also in the North , and they steadily deteriorated . When the rails wore out new ones could at last no longer be l ) rOvided ; when locomotives broke down , unless a northern prisoner consented to repair them , there were no mechanics at hand . Important links , necessary to complete the connection between the Southwest and the Coast were never built . The raids and the long marches at the end of the war so completed the ruin of the railroads that there was practically nothing left of them but the road beds . And thus the Confederates , who in the first battle of Bull Run were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were at the end often reduced to the southern " dirt roads , " than which no highway can be worse ; and at the same time they saw their old railroads repaired and mended by northern mechanics under the protection of northern troops , and bringing northern armies down to complete their conquest . A venerable though scarcely reverent proverb assures us that God is on the side of the strongest battalions . The battalions of the North , as we have seen , were stronger than those of the South in numbers , in resources , in military supplies , and in means of communication . The northern people excelled in organization , were little , if at all , inferior in military aptitude , and they were free from the weakening influence of slavery . If the forces of the two sections were all drawn out and employed , and if they were left to fight their battles alone , the North must therefore in the end be victorious . Moreover , the North had such a large surplus of strength and resources that it might do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The North never put forth quite its full strength . The border states were throughout the war occupied as advanced posts ; troops were raised in them , but the people were never completely trusted ; when after 1864 , it was seen that slavery was to be destroyed everywhere , and that the compensation to their slaves once refused by the border states , would not again be offered , those states continued a source of weakness rather than of strength . Throughout the Union , indeed , there was opposition to the war or to the manner in which it was carried on . As wise and self-sustained a President as Lincoln felt unable to withstand the pressure to appoint officers for political rather than for military reasons . The war period was a time of great commercial and economic development . Farms were being taken up in the West . From i86i to r865 , 4,700,000 acres of the public domain passed from the ownership of the government to that of settlers . The railroads increased from 31,286 miles to 35,085 miles , or one-eighth , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the United States , including the seceding states , had been in i86o , 362 millions , in 1864 were 329 millions for the loyal states alone . The country presented the striking spectacle of a nation advancing from year to year in wealth and population , while fighting an expensive and bloody war . The total number of enlistments and re-enlistments in the North and border states during the four years of the war , is stated at 2,859,132 , out of a total population of 22,000,000 , and a population of men between eighteen and fortyfive of 4,470,000 . The greatest number under arms at one time was 1,000,516 , May i , i865 . The enlistments in the South during the same period , were possibly 1,200,000 of the total population . Both sections put forth all the effort and sent forward all the men that the country could be induced to furnish ; but the power which stood upon the defensive , was able to call forth , to repel invaders , and to secure independence , a degree of sacrifice which no offensive war could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern troops were constantly pressing upon the South , and occupying one belt of territory after another . The result was a loss of a considerable portion of the troops who might have been raised out of the conquered regions . As the necessity for raising men grew , the circle out of which those men could be raised , narrowed ; and as hope died . out , men deserted by thousands , until in the last despairing days of the Confederacy , President Davis and General Lee agreed that the last possibility of success was in arming the negroes , and a company of black convicts from the Richmond jails was actually organized . In the struggle between two powers , in which one had such a superiority of numbers and of resources , there was but one thing which could give the South any hope . If the people were superior in organization , in intelligence , in military aptitude , in moral qualities , they might still stand out against the overwhelming odds , and might secure their independence . Many things in the political and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place the South had , or supposed it had , able leaders , both civil and military . Jefferson Davis , who was almost without opposition to be president of the Confederacy , was a man of both civil and military experience . As Secretary of War , under President Pierce , he had been an excellent official ; as a graduate of West Point and an officer , he had seen active service in the Mexican War . He believed with some reason , that he had distinct military genius . In fact , it is related on confederate authority that Mrs. Davis once remarke&amp; of him that " Jeff had but two faults ; he preferred West Point graduates and his first wife 's relations . " General Braxton Bragg , who was defeated by Sherman at Mission Ridge , was one of the first wife 's relations . Davis was believed in the South and abroad to be a statesman of ability and of force . This reputation he was unable to justify , because he was continually called upon to strain the powers of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When disasters came showering upon the Confederacy , // there was a natural tendency to hold some one person responsible , and there was an organized opposition against Davis , - represented by Pollard , who has done so much through his " Lost Cause " to tincture the popular impression of the Confederacy during the Civil War . Stephens , as vice-president , and thus as removed from the active control of affairs , represented what would have been called before the war a State Rights tendency . The other civil leaders , with a few exceptions , showed a singular incompetency . It was remarked that the Confederate Congress was a place for men to lose the reputation which they had previously acquired in Washington . President Davis 's cabinet was made up in great part of feeble or incapable men . One Secretary of XVar , Mr. Sedden , excited great dissatisfaction because it was found that he had fixed an official price of forty dollars per bushel for wheat , and then had sold his own wheat to the government at that enhanced price . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . The commercial training of the North had raised up a race of capable young men accustomed to business affairs . In every regiment there could be found among the private soldiers men who wrote good hands and could keep books , and who were drawn into the adjutant 's and commissariat 's departments . In the South it was difficult to find men capable of understanding or of keeping accounts , and throughout the war the commissariat was the most hopelessly deficient of all the military departments . The result was a waste of resource and effort . In the book called the " Rebel War Clerk 's Diary " and in George Cary Eggleston 's " Rebel 's Recollections , " are recorded many entertaining and pathetic incidents . Here is an example of the lack of organization and business system . There was established in Richmond a vexatious system of passports , applying as well to civilians as to soldiers . It was so administered as to cause delay and expense to persons passing through the city on business for the government , but to afford no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made as to the authority under which this system came to be established , and when run to earth it appeared that a secretary no longer in office had given an order , which he had not ventured to commit to writing . " From the beginning to the end of the war , " says an officer , " the commissariat was just sufficiently well-managed to keep the troops in a state of semi-starvation . On one occasion the company of artillery to which I was attached , lived for thirteen days in winter quarters on a daily dole of half a pint of cornmeal per man , while food in abundance was stored within five miles of its camp - a railroad uniting the two places , and the wagons of the battery being idle all the time . " Nevertheless , with all the defects of organization , the leaders understood their people , and they were able to call to their assistance all the military and intellectual strength of the country . On the other hand , the political system of the South had accustomed the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The distinction of classes was such that a rough but efficient military discipline was possible . Between the civil and military leaders there existed a far greater degree of harmony than in the North . It was notorious that President Davis disliked General Joe Johnston ; but , on the other hand , from 1862 to 1865 , while the Army of the Potomac fought under eight different commanders , the Southern Army of Virginia never was removed from the command of Robert E. Lee . It is a remarkable fact that the Southern Confederacy , formed as a protest against the alleged centralizing tendencies of the United States government , suffered a greater degree of cetitralization than its rival in Washington . The conscription of troops was carried to such a degree that Governor Brown of Georgia refused in set terms to permit the Confederate recruiting officers to exercise their functions within his state . In December , 1862 , was made a levi en masse of the able-bodied male population between the ages of eighteen and forty-five . The familiar fact that since the Civil War , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections in // the South is due not so much to a wish to show them honor , as to the fact that almost every man of any force of character was compelled by public sentiment to enter the army . One reason for the concentration of power in the Confederacy was that the supreme court , which was to have formed a department of the government , was never organized . There was , therefore , no legal check upon the Congress or the President . Whatever the Confederacy contained in money , in men , in supplies , in food , could be brought into the service of the government nt . The internal workings of the Confederate government were by no means smooth . Almost from the beginning there was in Congress an organized opposition to President Davis . As that body sat usually in secret session , the details of the attacks upon the President and his policy have not been made public . But the following extract from Pollard 's " Lost Cause , " the work of an editor of the Richmond Examiner , shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war : " The influence of President Davis was almost entirely gone , and . . . . the party which supported him was scarcely anything more than that train of followers which always fawns on power and lives on patronage . . . . all the public measures of Mr. Davis 's a ( lministration had come to he wrecks . . . . it was no longer possible to dispute the question of maladministration . " A recent examination of the journals , however , shows that President Davis in his four years of service vetoed thirtyeight bills , of which but one , an unimportant measure for the forwarding of newspapers to the soldiers without payment of postage , was passed over the veto . During the same period of four years , President Lincoln vetoed but three bills . The relations between the Confederate government and the states were closer than between the United States and its members . Almost the only case of conflict between the Confederate and the state authorities is the refusal of Governor Brown to permit conscription in Georgia . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Confederate authorities . Resolutions were adopted in November , i86i , by the people of Winston County , Alabama , setting forth the fact that 5 i5 Union men were still to be found in that county against 128 " secessionists and legal voters , " of whom 70 were in the Confederate army . The Unionists still refused to assist the Confederacy , and were organized in military companies . A much more amusing case is that of Jones County , Mississippi . The 3,300 people of this county became tired of the burdens of the Civil War , and by a convention held in 1862 formally seceded from the state and Con-federacy : " Whereas the State of Mississippi , for reasons which appear justiflahle , has seen fit to withdraw from the Federal Union , and whereas we , the citizens of Jones County , claim the same right , thinking our grievances are sufficient hy reason of an unjust law passed hy the Confederate States of America , forcing us to go to ( listant parts , etc. , etc . Therefore , he it resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County and the State of 1Iississippi , and proclaim our In ( lependence of the said State , and of the Confederate States of America - and we solemnly calf upon Almighty God to witness and hless the act . " A resolution offering their alliance to the United States was not adopted . The sovereign nation of Jones County with its president , cabinet , Congress , code of laws , and conscription and confiscation acts - nailed to trees , since there was no newspaper in the commonwealth - was able for some time to maintain itself in the midst of the swamps against the troops sent to subdue it . Finally , by the aid of field guns the infant commonwealth was overcome and the authority of the Confederacy was restored . The swift and ruthless exercise of military powers , xvherever the Confederacy had authority , is in striking contrast with the halting military relations between the United States of America and the states composing it . Among the northern states there were always unsettled questions of the supply of troops and of the apportionment of quotas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederacy was decidedly superior to the Union ; and this superiority was due in part to a habit of deference and obedience to command uncommon to the North , in part to the fact that the President himself // was a military man , in part to the arbitrary character of the government , *n part to the personal character and the permanence of the military commanders . This advantage was to a large degree offset by an inferior intelligence of the rank and file of the Confederate armies . Professor Hosmer , in the title of one of his books , " The Thinking Bayonet , " suggests the essential of good military service . In the ruder warfare of ancient and medieval times , the strength of an army was the sum of the physical strength of its members ; since the introduction of longrange weapons , the efficiency of the soldier depends not upon his ability to wield a two-handed sword , but upon his ability to march , to bear hardship , and to keep cool . Intelligent troops have , therefore , a fundamental advantage over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from the beginning handicapped . Here , ag In , we have in the secession of iSfia , ground for interesting comparisons . The highest classes in the ) i ) uth , and particularly the military officers , were well educated . Jefferson in 1820 had complained that " Harvard will still prime it over us with her twenty professors ; " while Princeton was half Virginian , and five hundred young men were " at college in the North imbibing principles contrary to those of their own country . " The sending of southern young men of wealth to northern colleges continued ; but the population from which the rank and file of the Confederate army was taken was ignorant , and a large number were illiterate . Of the 2,500,000 white persons above the age of twenty in the South in i86o , 412,256 could neither read nor write . Of 3,100 newspapers and periodicals published in i86r , the South had but 703 . Nor was the deficiency in book education atoned for by a larger experience of life . The southern soldiers had most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . They were unaccustomed to variety , unable to endure violent changes . It is a striking fact , attested upon the most trustworthy statistics , that the percentage of southern prisoners who died in the well-conducted northern prison of Elmira , was greater thanthe percentage of northem prisoners who died in Andersonvilie . The reason for this difference , as stated by surgeons who saw northern and southern men in the same hospital xvards , is simply that the southern men lacked the endurance possessed by men more accustomed to change . One such surgeon is accustomed to say that no men habitually fed on corn bread could compete with men habitually fed on wheat . Differences of diet , of habit , of climate , had tended to make out of the South a race easily incited to the fiercest of rapid effort , but which was less able to bear continuous fighting and hardship . The southern leaders were of course aware of the fact that their followers lacked education , but they believed that they possessed a superior military aptitude . At the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to discipline troops , because the number of men accustomed to handle the gun was larger . The troops for the Mexican War had been raised in considerable part in the South , and the discipline and experience of that contest were therefore gained chiefly by the Confederacy . In officers the South was as rich as the North , because the West Point cadetships had been held almost in equal number from the two sections , and the southerners who held them had been more likely to continue in military service , and to gain promotion . When the Civil War broke out , a large number of those officers surrendered the posts which they commanded to the authorities of the Southern Confederacy . Albert Sidney Johnston , in command of the post of San Francisco , sternly put aside all suggestions that he should follow their example , placed the post in the hands of an officer appointed to succeed him , and then resigned his command and entered the Confederate service . The confidence of the officers in their material was on the whole justified . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible , because their conditions were never equalized . Clothe the northern soldier in the ragged butternut uniform , feed him on irregular and insufficient rations , scantily provide him with tents and // cooking utensils , and then call upon him to face the southern soldier , well clothed , well housed , well fed , and followed by a beneficent sanitary commission , - and though the northern soldier under such conditions would have fought well , he could not have fought better than his southern rivals . All military authorities unite in their praise of that ill-uniformed and motley army cheerfully following " Uncle Robert " through the year 1864 , in a campaign which they themselves believed to be hopeless . More active troops than Stonewall Jackson 's foot cavalry never surprised an enemy by their capacity to be in two distant places on the same day . Braver and more determined hearts never beat beneath a uniform than those in Pickett 's division in the awful charge upon the Union lines at Gettysburg . What men could do with insufficient food and material of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service the Confederates were , until well into the war , decidedly superior . Accustomed as the men of the South were to the saddle , their cavalry was much more efficient until northern commanders like Wilson and Sheridan learned the southern tactics from their opponents . The light cavalry , the eyes of the army , which made bold dashes into the Federal territory , cut the communications of the Federal armies , and threatened cities far removed from the front , - that light cavalry was at last successfully imitated and repelled by Sheridan . In considering the population of the Confederate states as compared with that of the northern states , we saw that it was as about 9,000,000 to about 22,000 ,  - -  000 . In that estimate we took no account of the fact that of the able-bodied southerners more than one-third could not be accepted as soldiers . In the seceding states there were , in i86o , 3,5 ii ,  - -  iio slaves , and 432,586 free colored persons , making a total of 3,943,696 negroes . This leaves 5,447,219 white persons of whom 1,064,193 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18,825,275 white persons in the North to whom it is fair to add 2,650,243 in the border states - thus including a military popula tion of about 4,500,000 . The men of the South now know , as the men of the North came to understand late in the war , and as foreign observers like Cairnes had shown almost before the war began , that the real contest of the strife was for the perpetuation or the destruction of slavery ; yet from the moment the first shot was fired from Fort Sumter , to the surrender of the last command in i865 , that slavery for which the South was half unconsciously fighting was itself undermining and destroying the Confederacy . There were many points of difference between the North and South , there were many mutual accusations of aggression and of bad faith . They all , however , came down to the simple undeniable truth that the North was opposed to slavery and meant to put an end to it , wherever it could be reached ; that the South accepted slavery as an inevitable institution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for slavery , the question of secession and the right of secession could not have come up ; but for slavery there could have been no disposition to fire on Fort Sumter and no necessity to defend it ; but for slavery the two sections might have lived on with reasonable peace and good feeling . When the war was once begun , the northern people realized , not that slavery could be destroyed by war , but that the war could be ended by destroying slavery . From the time of the President 's preliminary proclamation in September , 1862 , it was evident that slavery could be retained only by the success of the South . For slavery as well as independence , the South was fighting ; and slavery weakened every blow that was struck and every arm that struck a blow . To be sure , the South was able to enlist almost the whole able-bodied white population , because there was a population of slaves to till the fields and perform necessary service . The slaves assisted to construct fortifications and were useful as body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands meant practically that they must be freed . The contingency of slave insurrections the southern leaders did not fear , and the event proved the justice of their confidence in the African race . As // a southern speaker has said , " A single brand flung into our houses would have caused our armies to be dissolved , - and not one was flung . " There appears to have been no case of a serious slave rising in any part of the South from the beginning to the end of the Civil War . But the slaves proved in other ways a distinct source of weakness . XVherever it was possible , and sometimes in circumstances of great difficulty , they gave information to the Union troops . They were our friends , and almost our only friends , in a region of the enemy . And although the slaves refused to rise , they had no conscientious scruples against running away . From the very beginning of the Civil War , therefore , our commanders suffered the embarrassing presence in camp of refugees , not only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal residents of the border states . To return them meant to give additional means to our enemies ; to retain them was an offence to our southern friends . Jt was the service of an American gener H , whom nature has endowed with more wit than consistency , to dub this unfortunate class " contraband of war . " After a very few months , fugitives were no longer returned either to enemies or friends and almost every black throughout the South knew that should he once reach the Union lines he was practically free . Out of the embarrassment of the presence of these people , who had to be employed and often to be fed at government expense , there sprang a measure which enabled the North in 1863-65 to preserve that superiority of force which was necessary in order to fight the war to the end . Of these black refugees there were enlisted as soldiers no less than 186,097 troops . They replaced northern troops in garrison duty , they fought beside them in the field , and when the United States government hesitated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for the reinforcement of its armies , those men were found among the slaves of the Southern planters . In still another sense slavery was the cause of the military defeat of the South . We have already seen that the population of the North had received large acces sions through immigration . Those accessions were denied to the South chiefly because of slavery . The total number of foreigners found in the eleven seceding states in i86o was about 233,000 , of whom one-fourth were in New Orleans . The man who crossed the ocean to find more favorable conditions of life was not likely to choose a settlement in a part of the country in which labor was considered the mark of an inferior . Still more were the material wealth and military resources of the South diminished by slavery . The land was not less fertile , hut as we have seen , xvhile the population of the slave states in 1869 was two-thirds that of the other states , their land was worth but one-third as much as that of the free states ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) revented their development grew out of slavery . The staple cotton crop was not cultivated merely because it was easily sold . It was cultivated because it was profitable to raise it by large gangs of ignorant men . Manufactures were ignored , not because southerners did not appreciate their importance , but because is was impossible to carry them on efficiently or profitably with slave labor . The imports of the country were small , not merely because it was poor , but because so large a portion of the population was legally disqualified from buying anything for itself . The accumulations of capital were small because the systcm of slave labor failed to encourage the savings and the investments which made the wealth of the North . The inefficient management of the financial affairs of the Confederacy was due in great part to the want of training in business habits , a result of the primitive methods of agriculture and of transit . The inability to keep up the railroads and to deal with sudden emergencies in time of war , the inferiority in bridge-building and in shipbuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that the South had for more than three-quarters of a century deliberately chosen a system of slavery , while the neighboring states had deliberately chosen a system of freedom . It is the favorite theory of political // writers that there was in i86o a distinct difference between northern and southern character , arising out of the fact that the dominant element in the North was descended from the Puritan , and in the South was descended from the Cavalier . It is now established that no such difference of origin can be proven . The Virginian and the Maryland planters , the New Jersey Quakers , and the Connecticut and iIassachusetts settlers sprang from the same class in England . The elements chiefly represented in all the colonies at the time of their foundation were the intelligent yeomanry and small landowners . The aristocracy of which the South boasted so much was not descended from the younger or the older sons of English men of rank ; it was made up of the sons and grandsons and great-grandsons of those l ) lanters who were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The climate had brought about some changes , and in the South there had been developed a class of small landowners , the so-called l ) OO* whites , who had but little improved during the century previous to the Civil XVar . The original bases of the white popuation were , however , the same . The great and fundamental difference between the sections was that in one of them the presence of a dependent race , and still more the existence of human slavery , had affected the social and the economic life of the people ; that the productive energies of the North were employed , xvhile those of the South were dormant . The iron , the coal , the lumber , and the grain of the North were drawn out by the intelligent combination of the labor of the whole people ; while in the South they remained undeveloped , because it seemed to the commercial interest of the larger landowners to perpetuate a system of agriculture founded on African slavery . For this mistake , for this preference for a system which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South paid a fearful penalty in the Civil War . Slavery had enfeebled the defenders of slavery , and they and the institution which they strove to protect fell together
