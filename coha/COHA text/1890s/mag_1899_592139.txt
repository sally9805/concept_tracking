THE END OF AN ERA . II . THE SURRENDER OF JOHNSTON . EIGHT miles of brisk riding carried me beyond the flotsam and jetsam of the army of northern Virginia . I was alone in the meadows on the north of the Appomattox River . The sun shone brightly , and under the wooded bluffs upon the opposite bank of the narrow stream the little valley up which my route led was warm and still . The dogwood was beginning to bloom ; the grass near the river banks was showing the first verdure of spring ; the willows overhanging the stream were purpling and swelling with buds . A cock grouse among the laurels was drumming to his mate , and more than once I heard the gobble of the wild turkey . Behind me , in the distance , were sounds of artillery ; from time to time our guns opened to hold the enemy in check , or he , pursuing , availed himself of some eminence to shell our retreating masses . In due season the designated ford was reached . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with exercise , waded into the stream up to her knees , and , plunging her nose into the water , quenched her thirst . A gray squirrel , startled from a hickory near the ford , ran out upon a limb , swung himself to anoth*r tree , and scampered away through the sunlight and the shadows to gain his castle in the hollow oak upon the hillside . In a neighboring cedar , a redbird ( cardinal grosbeak ) , warmed by the sunlight , uttered the soft call with which he wooes his mate in springtime . How peaceful , how secluded , how inviting to repose , seemed this sheltered nook ! It was hard to realize what a seething caldron of human life and human passion was boiling so near at hand . I needed rest . It was Friday , and since I left Clover Station , Wednesday night , I had slept but three hours . Oh , the heartache of those last eight miles of travel , with time to reflect in solitude upon what I had seen ! The hopeless , quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , were present like a nightmare . The shattered idols of boyish dreams lay strewn about me on the road along which I had been traveling . I had seen commands scattered and blasted which , until now , had represented victory or unbroken defiance . I had beheld officers , who , until yesterday , had impersonated to my youthful ardor nothing but gallantry , demoralized , separated from their commands , and with all stomach gone for further fighting . Ever and again my thoughts went back to the brave troops through whose ranks I had ridden the night previous , in search of General Lee ; and then my pride rose afresh . Yet in my heart I knew that they were but a handful to resist the armies of Grant ; that the army of northern Virginia was a thing of the past ; that its surrender was only a question of a few days at furthest ; and that the war was virtually ended . Then would come the sickening thought , so eloquently expressed by my father , that every man thenceforth killed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father as I did , I felt that it was more than likely he would be one of those to fall ; for his counsel was not the counsel of a coward . His courage and spirit of defiance were still unbroken . His proudest testimonial is that recorded concerning his conduct on the retreat by Fitzhugh Lee , who , in describing it , declared that , until the order of surrender went forth at Appomattox , he fought with the fervor of youth , and exposed himself as unhesitatingly as when // he was full of hope at the opening of the war . Alone , torn by these bitter thoughts , patriotic and personal , exhausted by two days and nights of excitement and fatigue , and contemplating with no pleasant anticipations seventy miles of hard riding before me , I gathered my reins , touched the flank of my horse , and resumed my journey . The country south of the Appomattox was wooded and somewhat broken . The roads led between " hogback " hills , as they are called . I drew out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among my other military accomplishments I had acquired the habit of smoking . I was taking it easily , and was riding woman fashion , " to rest myself in the saddle . The mare moved quietly forward at a fox trot . I felt sure I was well ahead of the flanking column of the enemy . Of a sudden my ear caught the sound of a human voice . It was distant , - a singsong note , resembling the woodland " halloo " we often hear . For a moment I thought it might be the voice of a darky , singing as he drove his team along . But it ceased , and in its place I heard , in a direction which I could not determine , sounds like falling rain , with heavy drops distinctly audible in the downpour . I recognized the sound . When we were studying Virgil , our tutor delighted to take up those lines of the IEneid wherein the poet describes the footfall of many horses as the cavalry approaches - " It clamor , et agmine facto Quadrupedante putrem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look around and ask , " Eh ? do n't you hear the very sound of the horses ' feet in the words ? " Well , of course we did not , and Parson Dudley thought we were trifling young cubs not to see the beauty of Virgil 's verbal horseplay . Still , the words stuck , and I often repeated them afterward . Now , who would have imagined that the VOL . LXXXIII. - NO. 499. 38 little Latin I had acquired , partly a priori and partly a posteriori , would one day serve to aid in escaping capture ? I listened . I repeated : " Quadrape - dantepu - tremsoni - tuquatit - ungula - campum . " I said to myself : " That sound is the sound of cavalry . That voice was the voice of command . Which way shall I go ? " " Plague take you , be quiet ! " I said to the mare , slapping her impatiently on the neck ; for at that moment she lifted her head , pointed her ears , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By good luck , almost at the same instant the sound of clashing cymbals and the music of a mounted band came through the forest . The hostile forces were but a few hundred yards away . As I soon learned , they were moving on a road leading to the ford , but entering the road that I was traveling just beyond the spot where I first heard them . The hill on my left ran down to a point where the advancing column was coming into the road on which I was . The summit of the hill was covered by a thick growth of laurel and pine . I sprang from the saddle , led the mare up the hillside , tied her , and , reflecting that she might whinny again , left her , ran along the hillcrest as near to the enemy as I dared go , lay down behind an old log , covered myself with leaves and bushes , and was within a hundred yards of the spot which the enemy passed . I could see them from behind the end of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the band played Johnny Comes Marching Home . They were elated and full of enthusiasm , for the Johnnies were on the run , and the pursuit was now little more than a foot race . The band struck up Captain Jenks of the Horse Marines , as they swept on to the ford , walking , trotting , ambling , pacing , their guidons fluttering in the spring breeze . " Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " How different was the cheering from the wild yell to which I was accustomed ! I lay there , with my // pistol in my hand , watching them , really interested in contrasting their good equipment and their ardor with the wretched scenes that I had left behind . A wild turkey lien , startled from her nest near the roadside , came flying directly up the hill , alighted on the further side of the log behind which I was lying , and , squatting low , ran within three feet of my nose . Peering into my face with frightened eyes , she gave a " put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutched my pistol to shoot her . No , I did not shoot . I had reasons for not shooting . But I am sure that this was the only wild turkey that ever came within range of my weapon without receiving a salute . The cavalcade swept by , and did not suspect my presence . When all was still again , hurrying back to the filly , I mounted , rode down to the forks of the road , took the one that led westward , and galloped away . I felt sure , from the rapidity with which I had traveled , that this must be the advance of the enemy , and I resolved to take no further risks . I was right , for I saw no more Union troops . Late that afternoon , in Charlott* County , I passed the plantation of Roanoke , once the home of John Randolph . It looked desolate and overgrown . " Oh , John Randolph , John , John ! " thought I , as I rode by , " you have gotten some other Johns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peck of trouble by the governmental notions which you left to them as a legacy . By the way , John , " changing into a merrier vein , " I wish some of those thoroughbreds you once owned were still in your stables ; my gallant animal is nearly done for by the murderous pace of the last six hours . " Neither the spirit nor the horses of John Randolph responded , either to maintain his principles or to supply me a fresh mount from the skeleton stables , and I rode on . I reached the Episcopal rectory at Halifax Court House after midnight . My brother Henry was the minister . He was a glorious fellow , who , if lie had not been a preacher , would have made a dashing soldier . I hammered upon the door , and lie came down . I was now only twenty miles west of my post at Clover Station . I had visited him several times while I was quartered there , but since the evacuation of Richmond lie had heard nothing from any of us , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I told him of my last three adventures , he looked me over , and , seeing how red my eyes were , said that he was afraid I was drunk . " Not much , " I replied ; " but if you have anything to eat and to drink , get it out quickly , fpr I am nearly famished . You may think I am drunk , Henry , but come out and look at the mare . Probably you will think she has the delirium tremens . " He was soon dressed , and we went out to minister to the faithful brute . She stood with head hung low , her red nostrils distending and contracting , her sides heaving , her knees trembling , her flanks roweled and red , the sweat dripping from her wet body . Poor little Tulip ( that was her name ) , I had not done it wantonly . I was performing a duty of life and death . " You can not ride her to Danville , " said Henry , who was a good horseman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bay horse . " Henry loved his mare , and under other circumstances he would not have listened to such a proposition ; bLit patriotism overcame him , and lie simply answered , with a sigh , " Very well . " I count it a creditable episode in my life that I took off my coat , tired as I was , and gave Tulip a good rubbing down , and fed her and bedded her , bless her game heart ! " You can not go forward at once , " Henry urged , when we returned to the house . He started a fire in the dining // room and placed an abundance of cold victuals and drink upon the table , and his pretty young wife entered to hear the war news . " Well , I thought I might , but blamed if I do n't believe I m forced to take a rest , " I replied . " Will you have your mare saddled and me waked at day-break ? " It was so arranged , and after I had eaten like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake to answer Henry 's eager questions ; but I fell asleep in the chair , and the next I knew he was leading me by the arm up to a large bedroom , the like of which I had not seen for many a day . Tumbling into bed , I knew no more until he roused me at daybreak , fed me , put me on his mare , and said a " God bless you ! " I went off sore and reluctant , but soon limbered up and grew willing , as his horse , fiesh and almost as good as Tulip , strode gallantly on to Danville . " Man never is , but always to be blest . " I was envying preachers , and thinking what a good time Henry was having ; and he , poor fellow , had spent the night striding up and down the floor , bemoaning the hard fate which had made him a non-combatant . It was about eight o'clock in the evening of Saturday , April 8 , 1865 , when the hoofs of my horse resounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not recall the exact distance traversed that day , but it was enough for man and beast . I had a good comfortable ride . Henry had filled my saddlepockets with excellent food , and two flasks of coffee made by him , ' while I slept , from a precious remnant that he had preserved for the sick of his congregation . He was a prince of hospitality and common sense . He had liquor , and was no blue-nose ; but he said that he would give me none , for the double reason that I seemed to like it too well , and that , in case of protracted effort , it was not so reliable a stimulant as coffee . The lights of Danville were a welcome sight . The town was crowded with people , the result of the recent influx from Richmond . Riding up Main Street to the principal hotel , I learned that Mr. Davis was domiciled at the home of Major Sutherlin , and thither I directed my course . The house stands upon Main Street , near the crest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw that it was brilliantly illuminated . A sentry at the yard gate challenged me . I announced my name , rank , and mission , and was admitted . At the door , a colored man , whom I recognized as the body servant of the President , received me . In a few moments Burton Harrison appeared , giving me a kindly greeting , and saying that the President and his Cabinet were then holding a session in the dining room , and desired me to enter and make my report . I laughed , drew forth the short note of General Lee to Mr. Davis , and remarked that my dispatches were for the most part oral . I felt rather embarrassed by such a distinguished audience , but Mr. Davis soon put me at ease . In his book he mentions my coming , but , after the long interval between 1865 and the time at which it was written , he had forgotten , if indeed he ever knew , that I had been sent by him to General Lee . Probably he never learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Davis sent , when he requested the former to detail an officer to communicate with General Lee . At any rate , I was the first person who had brought him any direct news from General Lee since his departure from Richmond . Those present , as I remember them , were , besides the President and Burton Harrison , Mr. Benjamin , General Breckinridge , Secretary Mallory , Secretary Reagan , perhaps General Bragg , and several others whom I did not know or do not recall . They sat around a large dining table , and I stood at the end op .. posite Mr. Davis . He was exceedingly // considerate , requested me to make my report , which I did as briefly as possible , and then asked me a number of questions . When he had done examining me , several others of the party made inquiries . One timing I remember vividly . Somebody inquired how many efficient troops I thought General Lee had left . I was prepared for this question to the extent of having tried to conjecture . In doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started from Petersburg he had nearly one hundred thousand men . That was the popular impression . With this in my mind as a basic figure , I believed that his army had dwindled to one third of its number when it left Petersburg , and so I ventured the opinion that he might still have thirty thousand effective men , although I was cautious enough to add that Mahone 's and Field 's divisions were the only two that I had seen which seemed to be intact and to have preserved their organization . When I said thirty thousand , I thought I detected a smile of sad incredulity on several faces ; and I have often wondered since how much that statement detracted from the weight attached to my report in other respects . One question I answered as I felt . " Do you think General Lee will be able to reach a point of safety with his army ? " " I regret to say , no . From what I saw and heard , I am satisfied that General Lee must surrender . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion , Mr. President , it is only a question of a few days at furthest , and if I may be permitted to add a word , I think the sooner , the better ; for , after seeing what I have seen of the two armies , I believe the result is inevitable , and postponing the day means only the useless effusion of noble , gallant blood . " I am sure none of them had heard such a plain statement of this unwelcome truth before . I remember the expression of face - almost a shudder - with which what I said was received . I saw that , however convinced they might be of the truth of it , it was not a popular speech to make . Mr. Davis asked me to remain . He said that he wished to talk with me further . While I was waiting for him in the hallway , Major Sutherlin , who had known me from childhood , beckoned to me and asked , " Are n't you hungry after your ride ? " I grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoth the major , " see if you ca n't get something for the lieutenant to eat . " Jim went out , but in a few minutes returned , and , bowing , invited me into a butler 's pantry . He apologized for the place , and explained that the house was so crowded he had nowhere else to spread the repast . He had provided milk , corn coffee , butter and rolls , and cold turkey . I said , " Jim , shut up . You know I am not used to as good as this . " With that I tossed off a glass of milk , swallowed a cup of coffee , and , opening my haversack , tumbled the butter and rolls and turkey legs into it , and buttoned it up . Jim stood there , highly amused at the short shrift I made of his feast , and remarked , " You s a fustclass forager , ai n't you , lieutenant ? " " Yes , " I responded . " You must keep fire in the box , Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I m ready for the President . " I slipped back into the hallway , and sat down to wait until the President should call me . In a little while the conference broke up , and he came to the door . " Now , lieutenant , I 11 see you , " and he led the way into the drawing room ; there we had a long talk , I going more into details . At the close of our conversation , he sat for some time peering into the gloom outside , and finally broke the silence by saying : " You seem to know the roads . Do you feel equal to another trip ? " // " Assuredly , " I answered . " I now have a relay of horses , and am more than glad to serve in any way I can . " " Very well , " said he . " Leave your horse in Major Sutherlin 's stable , so that it will be well fed , and report for orders to-morrow morning at eight o'clock . " I took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I clambered up a ladder to the loft , opened my haversack , enjoyed Major Sutherlin 's food , placed some hay under me and drew some over me , and had a glorious night 's rest . When I reported next morning , the President did not ask at what hotel I was stopping . I received my return dispatches , and I set forth to rejoin General Lee . Apprehending the probability of my capture , Mr. Davis gave me a brief letter of credentials , and said that I would explain his wishes . Upon the same day that General Lee surrendered at Appomattox ( April 9 ) I reached Halifax Court House on the return trip . My brother Richard was there , with his own horse and the horse that my father had lent the wounded man . They had been cut off at Sailors ' Creek and forced southward . The enemy , flanking General Lee , had advanced by moving at least ten miles beyond Sailors ' Creek , thus rendering it impossible for them to rejoin General Lee except by going through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he should pursue , and after we had discussed the matter , he resolved to leave one of the horses and to go back with me . Monday morning we resumed the journey ; and that afternoon we met the first of our men , who , paroled at Appomattox the day before , were mournfully wending their way homeward . Upon hearing of the surrender , we turned back toward Danville to report to President Davis the failure of my mission . On arriving there , we learned that he had left the place , and gone to Greensboro , North Carolina . From the paroled men we met we ascertained that our father was safe . We resolved to join Johnston 's army . After leaving Danville , two days ' ride brought us to Greensboro , and there we found Johnston 's forces . We reported to Major-General Carter Stevenson , commanding a division of infantry . General Stevenson was a Virginian , one of the few in that army . A cousin of ours was on his staff . The army was bivouacked in and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its surrender . Men and officers alike understood this , and there was a general relaxation of discipline . We were among the first to arrive from Lee 's army . General Stevenson gave us a cordial welcome . We told him we had not been captured , and had come to serve under him . He asked us what we wished to do . We replied that we were ready to serve in any capacity in which we could be useful ; I added facetiously that I was not much of a lieutenant , anyhow , and none too good for a private . On our way we had seriously discussed the formation of a command composed of officers of Lee 's army who had escaped from the surrender . Inviting us to make his headquarters our home until something definite was concluded , General Stevenson said , with a smile , that he feared we had jumped out of the frying pan into the fire , and that Sherman and Johnston were already conferring about a cessation of hostilities . I must describe one of the conferences as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One cold winter night about 1880 , Captain Edward Harvie , of General Johnston 's staff , invited me to join him in a call upon the general , who was then living in Richmond . Harvie was one of his pets , and we were promptly admitted to his presence . He sat in an armchair in his library , dressed in a flannel wrapper , and was suffering from an // influenza . By his side , upon a low stool , stood a tray with whiskey , glasses , spoons , sugar , lemon , spice , and eggs . At the grate a footman held a brass teakettle of boiling water . Mrs. Johnston was preparing hot Tom-and-Jerry for the old gentleman , and he took it from time to time with no sign of objection or resistance . It was snowing outBide , and the scene within was very cosy . As I had seen him in public , General Johnston was a stiff , uncommunicative man , punctilious and peppery , as little fellows like him are apt to be . He reminded me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying a peck at his neighbor . That night he was as warm , comfortable , and communicative as the kettle singing on the hob . He had been lonesome , and he greatly enjoyed both the Tom-and-Jerry and the visitors . Harvie knew how to draw him out on reminiscences , and we spent a most delightful evening . Among other things he told us an episode of the surrender , under promise that we should not publish it until after his death . Johnston had known Sherman well in the United States army . Their first interview near Greensboro resulted in an engagement to meet for further discussion the following day . As they were parting , Johnston remarked : " By the way , Cumps , Breckinridge , our Secretary of War , is with me . He is a very able fellow , and a better lawyer than any of us . If there is no objection , I will fetch him along to-morrow . " Bristling up , General Sherman exclaimed : " Secretary of War ! No , no ; we do n't recognize any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want any Secretary of War . " " Well , " said General Johnston , " he is also a major-general in the Confederate army . Is there any objection to his presence in the capacity of major-general ? " " Oh ! " quoth Sherman , in his characteristic way , " major-general ! Well , any major-general you may bring I shall be glad to meet . But recollect , Johnston , no Secretary of War . Do you un-derstand ? " The next day , General Johnston , accompanied by Major-General Breckinridge and others , was at the rendezvous before Sherman . " You know how fond of his liquor Breckinridge was ? " added General Johnston , as he went on with his story . " Well , nearly everything to drink had been absorbed . For several days Breckinridge had found it difficult , if not impossible , to procure liquor . He showed the effect of his enforced abstinence . He was rather dull and heavy that morning . Somebody in Danville had given him a plug of very fine chewing tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming . After a while the latter arrived . He bustled in with a pair of saddlebags over his arm , and apologized for being late . He placed the saddlebags carefully upon a chair . Introductions followed , and for a while General Sherman made himself exceedingly agreeable . Finally some one suggested that we had better take up the matter in hand . " Yes , ' said Sherman ; but , gentlemen , it occurred to me that perhaps you were not overstocked with liquor , and I procured some medical stores on my way over . Will you join me before we begin work ? ' " General Johnston said he watched the expression of Breckinridge at this announcement , and it was beatific . Tossing his quid into the fire , he rinsed his mouth , and when the bottle and the glass were passed to hini he poured out a tremendous drink , which he swallowed with great satisfaction . With an air of content , he stroked his mustaclme and took a fresh chew of the tobacco . Then they settled down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in the discussions // which followed . He seemed to have at his tongue 's end every rule and maxim of international and constitutional law , and of the laws of war , - international wars , civil wars , and wars of rebellion . Jn fact , he was so resourceful , cogent , persuasive , learned , that , at one stage of the proceedings , General Sherman , when confronted by the authority , but not convinced by the eloquence or learning of Breckinridge , pushed back his chair and exclaimed : " See here , gentlemen , who is doing this surrendering , anyhow ? If this thing goes on , you 11 have me sending a letter of apology to Jeff Davis . " Afterward , when they were nearing the close of the conference , Sherman sat for some time absorbed in deep thought . Then he arose , went to the saddlebags , and fumbled for the bottle . Breckinridge saw the movement . Again he took his quid from his mouth and tossed it into the fireplace . His eye brightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman seemed about to do . The latter , preoccupied , perhaps unconscious of his action , poured out some liquor , shoved the bottle back into the saddlepocket , walked to the window , and stood there , looking out abstractedly , while he sipped his grog . From pleasant hope and expectation the expression on Breckinridge 's face changed successively to uncertainty , disgust , and deep depression . At last his hand sought the plug of tobacco , and , with an injured , sorrowful look , he cut off another chew . Upon this he ruminated during the remainder of the interview , taking little part in what was said . After silent reflections at the window , General Sherman bustled back , gathered up his papers , and said : " These terms are too generous , but I must hurry away before you make me sign a capitulation . I will submit them to the authorities at Washington , and let you hear how they are received . " With that he bade the assembled officers adieu , took his saddle-599 bags upon his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston took occasion , as they left the house and were drawing on their gloves , to ask General Breckinridge how he had been impressed by Sherman . " Sherman is a bright man , and a man of great force , " replied Breckinridge , speaking with deliberation , " but , " raising his voice and with a look of great intensity , " General Johnston , General Sherman is a hog . Yes , sir , a hog . Did you see him take that drink by himself ? " General Johnston tried to assure General Breckinridge that General Sherman was a royal good fellow , but the most absent-minded man in the world . He told him that the failure to offer him a drink was the highest compliment that could have been paid to the masterly arguments with which he had pressed the Union commander to that state of abstraction . " protested the big Kentuckian , half sighing , half grieving , " no Kentucky gentleman would ever have taken away that bottle . He knew we needed it , and needed it badly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make it public until after General Johnston 's death . On one occasion , being intimate with General Sherman , I repeated it to him . Laughing heartily , he said : " I do n't remember it . But if Joe Johnston told it , it s so . Those fellows hustled me so that day , I was sorry for the drink I did give them , " and with that sally he broke out into fresh laughter . While these scenes were being enacted Johnston 's army lay about Greensboro , and I saw a great deal of the men and the officers . I will not attempt a coml ) arison between its personnel and that of Lee 's army . I was a prejudiced observer , and such comparisons can pi*o duce no good results . But I am free to say , from what I saw , then and thereafter , of Sherman 's army , that I believe it was a better army than that of Gen // eral Grant . If Lee 's army and Sherman 's had come together when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some very memorable fighting . The spirit of General Johnston 's men was much finer than , under the circumstances , anybody would have expected . They were defiant , and more than ready to try conclusions with Sherman in a pitched battle . Many expressed disgust and indignation when the surrender of the army was announced . An epidemic of drunkenness , gambling , and fighting prevailed while we were waiting for our final orders . Whatever difficulty General Breckinridge may have experienced in procuring liquor , the soldiers seemed to have an abundance of colorless corn whiskey and applejack , and the roadsides were lined with " chuck-a-luck " games . The amount of Confederate money displayed was marvelous . Men had it by the haversackful , and bet it recklessly upon anything . The ill temper begotten by drinking and gambling manifested itself almost hourly in free fights . During this period of waiting came the news of the assassination of Mr. Lincoln . Perhaps I ought to chronicle that the announcement was received with demonstrations of sorrow . If I did , I should be lying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most intelligent and conservative men the assassination caused a shudder of horror , at the heinousness of the act and at the thought of its possible consequences ; but among the thoughtless , the desperate , and the ignorant it was hailed as a sort of retributive justice . In maturer years I have been ashamed of what I felt and said when I heard of that awful calamity . However , men ought to be judged for their feelings and their speech by the circumstances of their surroundings . For four years we had been fighting . In that struggle all we loved had been lost . Lincoln incarnated to us the idea of oppression and conquest . We had seen his face over the coffins of our brothers and relatives and friends , in the flames of Richmond , in the disaster at Appomattox . In blood and flame and torture the temples of our lives were tumbling about our heads . We were desperate and vindictive , and whosoever denies it forgets or is false . We greeted his death in a spirit of reckless hate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the cause of our own agony and bitterness . To us , Lincoln was an inhuman monster , Grant a butcher , and Sherman a fiend . Time taught us that Lincoln was a man of marvelous humanity , Appomattox and what followed revealed Grant in his matchless magnanimity , and the bitterness toward Sherman was softened in subsequent years . But , with our feelings then , if the news had come that all three of these had been engulfed in a common disaster with ourselves , we should have felt satisfaction in the fact , and should not have questioned too closely how it had been brought about . We were poor , starved , conquered , despairing ; and to expect men to have no malice and no vindictiveness at such a time is to look for angels in human form . Thank God , such feelings do not last long , at least in their fiercest intensity . The army moved westward to a place named Jimtown , since dignified as Jamestown . There we were all paroled . We received one dollar and fifteen cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin . I cut my initials upon my dollar , but it was stolen from my pocket the next day . We were ready to disperse to our homes . Our headquarters were in a tent . A notorious character was Michael Dugan , commonly called " Mike . " He was the man of all work for General Stevenson and his staff . Picketed near our tent were a pair of mules which belonged to our headquarters wagon . Michael Dugan , indulging a taste for spirituous liquors not uncommon with gentlemen of his nationality and station in life , // and impelled thereto by depressed feelings resulting from the inglorious ending of his military career , had not drawn a sober breath for a week . He had , in fact , a horse bucket full of colorless North Carolina corn whiskey , from which he regaled himself with a tin cup at all hours of the day and night . He sometimes became entangled in the tent cords , sometimes fell headlong into or out of the tent . In an animated discussion with a teamster , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pair of mule hames whirled like a flail . Mike was a plucky fellow , and , fearing his wrath , his adversary , Rogers , had fled the camp . For several days Mike had rambled about , muttering to himself : " Gi 11 kill Rogers . Bedad , and Gi 11 kill him . Oi 11 kill him if 1 have to follow him to Tennessee . " We were constantly anticipating that something would happen to Mike . The day before our departure something did happen . A party of us , seated in the tent , around a blanket spread upon the ground , were playing draw-poker . Of a sudden a heavy body struck the tent , and nearly carried away its fastenings . Rushing out , we found Mike lying there , unconscious , and bleeding profusely . A mule , tethered to a tree hard by , stood patient , passive , with head hung low and drooping ears . We did not for a moment suspect the mule . We lifted Mike gently , placed his head on a McClellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite beverage , and about the time we were despairing of resuscitating him his eyes opened slowly . " Byes , am I dead ? " he asked . " No , no , indeed , old boy ; you re all right , " said we ; for Mike , in spite of his failures , was a brave soldier , and much beloved . In a plaintive , tremulous voice he began : " Oh , byes , do-a n't let me die . Ye know Oi m not afeard to die . I was wid Floyd at Fort Donelson . I was wid Abbert Seedney Johnson at Shiloh , and Pimberton at Vicksburg . I was wid Pat Cleburne at Franklin , and Joe Johnston at Atlanta , and Hood at Nashville . Go ask them , byes , if Mike was afeard . But save me now , byes ! Oh , it is too ha-a-a-a-rd to be kicked to death by a - mule , the day after the surrinder ! " No amount of sympathy for Mike could repress the hilarity which this remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army within twenty-four hours . It was repeated as showing the saddest possible fate which could befall a Confederate soldier . That night we had our last army fright . By some means a rumor had become prevalent that certain officers had distributed among themselves bolts of valuable cloth far beyond their own needs , leaving the soldiers ragged . The men formed bands , declaring they would ransack the officers ' wagons and have this cloth . A friendly fellow brought us the news that one of these parties was approaching to search General Stevenson 's headquarters wagon . Major Reeve , of the staff , indignant at such an accusation , but more indignant at the proposed insult to his commanding officer , swore he would die rather than submit to such ignominy . He called upon us to defend our manhood . Of course we were ready . Armed only with our swords and revolvers , we were deployed by him behind trees . It was moonlight . We could see the raiders coming through the woods . When within thirty yards they halted . Major Reeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged , and asked what they wanted . A leader replied . " Are you men soldiers of Stevenson 's division ? " inquired Reeve . On learning that they were , he proceeded to deliver an address which , for eloquence , pathos , and defiance , was as fine as anything I ever heard . He reproached them for thinking for an instant that such a base rumor could be true . He reminded them of the days when he had led them , and they were // touched by his references to their common struggles and common sufferings . He asked them what General Stevenson or any of his staff had ever done to de-. serve this distrust or justify this degrading search . Finally , he told them that if they still persisted , but one course was left to us , and that was to die at the hands of our own men rather than submit tamely to such dishonor . We who were deployed behind the trees felt that we were in a ticklish place . Reeve was exalted by his own oratory . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment after he finished speaking there was dead silence , a very awkward silence . Then a voice shouted , " Three cheers for Major Reeve ! They were given with a hearty good will , followed by cheers for everybody . The marauders broke , crowded around Reeve , and hugged and wept over him , and we sneaked back to the tent , much relieved that this particular phase of the war was over . The next day the army of the Tennessee dissolved . To every point of the compass its officers and men dispersed . Our course was directed to Danville . We did not encounter any Union forces until we approached that place . Then we saw mounted Union pickets outlined against the sky , at the top of the hill . They looked just as we had often seen them before . It was hard to realize that they would not fire upon us , and gallop away to give the alarm . It was equally hard to realize that we should soon pass them and be within the Union lines . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time we were in the midst of a body of Union soldiers . What we felt then is not important . A week later , having been to Halifax to return to her owner the finest mare I ever bestrode , I boarded a train for Richmond , the brass buttons on my uniform covered with black , a fit badge of monruing for the dead Confederacy . The cars were crowded with Union soldiers and negroes flocking to the towns . The bearing of the Union officers and soldiers toward Confederates was , with few exceptions , extremely civil and conciliatory . One fellow was so kind that after he had offered me money , which I refused , he slipped it into my pocket with a card , saying , " This is not a gift , but a loan , and when you are able you can return it to me . " I did subsequently return it , but never forgot his delicate at .. tention . The bridges across the James at Richmond had all been destroyed . Our train stopped at Manchester , opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city by way of a pontoon bridge thrown across the river at the lower end of Mayor 's Island . At the Manchester teimninus we found a number of improvised vehicles , - wagons , ambulances , etc. , - with improvised drivers , too , seeking passengers to carry over the bridge . These drivers were in many instances my old army comrades . One of them was Colonel George - , a former schoolmate , not five years older than myself , a man of the highest social standing , a young soldier of distinguished gallantry , who a month before had commanded one of the best regiments in Lee 's army . It was pathetic , the sight of those army boys , with their war horses converted into tennis , trying to earn an honest penny to feed the folks at home . I saw George stand at the rear of the ambulance that he drove , open the door , collect the fares frcim the sleek Union commissaries and quartermasters who patronized him , mount his box , and drive away as humbly as if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifelong occupation . It was fortunate for our boys that the negroes , who until now had done this class of work , were so elated by their freedom that they had performed no sort of labor since the evacuation . they had thronged to the city , but not for work . The weather was warm , and they were // living in all kinds of makeshift habitations , ofttimes in the ruins of burned buildings , procuring food from the Freedmen 's Bureau , and spending their time in the Capitol Square , where the older ones shouted and sang for hours , and the children played at games . I was too poor to indulge in the luxury of a ride , and young and strong enough to walk to town . Slinging our knapsacks , a party of us walked across the pontoon , lifting our eyes from time to time to the grinning ruins before us . It was past noon ; the day was warm , and the sun was bright . It revealed , without concealing anything from us , the complete destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wended our way . The hand of reconstruction was already stretched forth . Men were engaged in pulling down walls and cleaning bricks . Already mortar beds had been built in the streets , puddlers were at work , and , where work had progressed far enough , foundations were being laid anew . The streets were already burdened with lumber for joists and woodwork , and every evidence was given of a rebuilding of the town . Nearly all the laborers were white men . Many of them I knew well : men of as good social position as my own ; soldiers come home and resolved not to be idle , but to work for an honest living in any way in which they could make it . Sitting in the sun with their trowels , jabbing away in awkward fashion at their new and unaccustomed tasks , covered with dust and plaster , they were the same bright , cheerful fellows who had learned to labor in that state of life to which it had pleased God to call them , just as they had been willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved Lee . At night , with their day 's wages in their pockets , they would go home , change their clothing , take a bath , and associate with their families , - not at all ashamed of their labors , but making a joke of their newly discovered 603 method of earning a sustenance . With all the hardship of such unaccustomed work , it was the best and most comfortable and least dangerous employment that they had been engaged in for years . Richmond rose from her ashes , and soon became , in great part by their efforts , a more beautiful city than ever before . Passing through the business portion of the town , we reached the residential section , which was still intact . The trees were in full leaf . They cast their deep shadows everywhere , and a Sabbath stillness pervaded the streets , strangely in contrast with the air of busy life always presented when Richmond was the crowded and beleaguered capital . Few men and no women were upon the streets . Business had not been resumed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made women cautious about venturing forth unattended . I had no home . The nearest approach to one was that of my brotherin-law , Dr. Garnett . There my mother and an unmarried sister were , and thither I repaired . My father , as I learned , had not returned to Richmond . Eliza , our faithful servant , whose kinspeople resided in Philadelphia , had made a short visit to that place , and among other things had brought back civilian clothes for me . They had been bought by Philadelphia relatives , who knew me only as an eighteen-year-old boy , and the clothes were of the style worn by Philadelphia cousins of my own age . In my room I found a civilian 's attire laid out for me , and I proceeded to divest m , of my uniform . For the first time in two years and eight months I appeared in citizen 's dress . The sensation was peculiar . The lightness and softmiss of the cloth was delightful , but the sack coat and the straw hat made me feel bobtailed and bareheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confronting a striking young officer , I beheld a mere insignificant chit of an // eighteen-year-old boy . Nothing brought home to me more vividly the fact that the stunning events of the last month had ended the career on which I had started , and that I had received a great setback in manhood . This feeling was emphasized when some one startled me by asking where I was going to school . The house had a broad veranda . That evening we sat upon it , after tea , quiet and sad , but enjoying the refreshing air and sense of peace . On the opposite side of the street lived a family consisting of a mother and several handsome daughters . They had been such ardent Confederates that they had been sent out of Alexandria into the Confederate lines by the Union commander . That they were still loyal Confederates we never had reason to doubt until we saw a party of young Union officers ride up , followed by their orderlies . We felt sure they had come to arrest the occupants of that house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments , we saw the lights go up in the drawing rooms , and discovered that this was a social call . One of the girls was soon banging away on the piano and singing to her admirers . The voices of hilarity , the sounds of mirth and music , horrified us . We looked upon the conduct of those girls , in making merry , singing , playing , and receiving the attentions of Union officers , as grossly indelicate , heartless to our dead and to us , and treason to their Confederate comrades . It was years before they regained social recognition in the community . Their faithlessness to the lost cause chilled my heart , and was a fresh reminder that the cause was dead . That night I tossed upon my bed , reflecting on the past , contemplating the present , speculating as to the future . The next morning I arose , and before breakfast I wrote my will as follows - I , J. Reb. , being of unsound mind and bitter memory , and aware that I The End of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and declare the following to be my political last will and testament . 1 . I give , devise , and bequeath all my slaves to Harriet Beecher Stowe . 2 . My rights in the territories I direct shall be assigned and set over , together with the bricabrac known as State Sovereignty , to the Hon. JR T --  , to play with for the remainder of his life , and remainder to his son after his death . 3 . I direct that all my shares in the venture of secession shall be canceled , provided I am released from my unpaid subscription to the stock of said enterprise . 4 . My interest in the civil government of the Confederacy I bequeath to any freak museum that may hereafter be established . 5 . My sword , my veneration for General Robert E. Lee , his subordinate commanders and his peerless soldiers , and my undying love for my old comrades , living and dead , I set apart as the best I have , or shall ever have , to bequeath to my heirs forever . 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death to Confederate ideas and a new birth unto allegiance to the Union , I depart , with a vague but not definite hope of a joyful resurrection , and of a new life , upon lines somewhat different from those of the last eighteen years . I see what has been pulled down very clearly . What is to be built up in its place I know not . It is a mystery ; but death is always mysterious . AMEN . I read this will at the breakfast table . It amused the family , but with me it was no joke . I was dead . Everything that I had ever believed in politically was dead . Everybody that I had ever trusted or relied upon politically was dead . My beloved state of Virginia was dismembered , and a new state had been erected out of a part of her , against // her will . Every hope that I had ever indulged was dead . Even the manhood I had attained was dead . I was a boy again , a mere child , - precocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set my heart and soul upon the career of a soldier . What hope was left for that ? The night 's reflections had made all these things clear as never before . Boy as I was , I felt it as keenly as did the embittered Moor when , in his agony , he exclaimed : - " Farewell the plumed troop , and the big wars , That make ambition virtue ! 0 , farewell ! Farewell the neighiug steed , and the shrill trump , The spirit - stirring drum , the ear - piercing fife , The royal banner , and all quality , Pride , pomp and circumstance of glorious war ! And , 0 you mortal engines , whose rude throats The immortal Jove 's dread clamours coun-terfeit , Farewell ! Othello 's occupation s gone ! " In hopelessness I scanned the wreck , and then - I went back to schooL In June , 1865 , a boy named John Sargent Wise , a visitor at the home of his uncle , General Meade , in Philadelphia , was a witness of the triumphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as such a mere child that he was not invited to the table when company came , but dined with the other children in the nursery . A little later , he sat in overalls and a straw hat fishing near the shores of the blue Chesapeake . In September he was sent to school . In October he was playing furiously on the scrub nine of his college baseball team . It is incredible that this stripling was the same person as the young officer whose observations and career have been chronicled in these pages . Nor is it more difficult now for the reader than for the writer to realize that this narrative is aught but a dream .
