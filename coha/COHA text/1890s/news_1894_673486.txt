txt The election forSupervisor in the Eighth Ward of Brooklyn yesterday resulted in the election of Mr. Fischer , the candidate of the anti-machine Democrats , by a small but sufficient plurality . It was a most important victory , because in the struggle was practically involved the last stronghold of the ring in Kings County politics  --  the Board of Supervisors , which would have fallen into its hands had its candidate been successful . It will be remembered that after the defeat of the ring in November the Board of Aldermen elected a Supervisor to fill a vacancy from the Eighth Ward , and the Board of Supervisors thereupon chose for its President . This election by the old board was declared illegal , an election by the ward was ordered , and the ring made every effort to carry it . A candidate personally popular was named , and when the Committee of One Hundred having the reorganization of the Democratic Party in charge put Mr. Fischer in nomination and he was indorsed by the Republicans , the ring immediately secured the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of the combination . At the election last Fall the ward gave Mr. Schieren 2,924 and Mr. Doody 2,558 , with 93 scattering , a plurality of 366 only for Schieren . If the ring could draw off 400 votes from Fischer by the " independent " Republican device , it could fairly hope to elect its man , as the ward gave a Democratic majority of 1,600 in 1892 , even gave the Democratic State ticket 225 majority last year , and was about even on the Court of Appeals . The Committee of One Hundred understood the importance of the election and made a vigorous , straightforward canvass of the ward . Frequent meetings were held , and the leaders of the reorganization movement argued the issues involved before the voters . The election of Mr. Fischer is , in these circumstances , of great promise . It secures the Board of Supervisors against the ring , and it is an immediate and striking triumph for the cardinal principle of the reform Democracy , that it is the duty of good Democrats to defeat the political schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will make good government in Brooklyn much easier and more certain .
