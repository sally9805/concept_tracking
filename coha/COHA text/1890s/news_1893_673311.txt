txt The officials of the savings banks in this city declare positively that there has been no agreement among them to dispose of Government bonds in order to replenish their cash reserves . At most of the banks it is stated that there is an abundance of cash on hand to meet all prospective demands . At the German Savings Bank . Fourth Avenue and Fourteenth Street , and the Bleecker Street Bank , there were crowds yesterday that suggested Monday 's rush at all of the savings banks . Yet the majority of the persons at those two banks were not there to ask for money , bat merely to make inquiries . There was an anxious feeling among them , but nothing like the general fright of the two previous days . At the other banks business was being conducted in a very ordinary way . Deposits were , as a rule , about as heavy as is usual at this season of the year . The panicky feeling had entirely disappeared . One of the best evidences of this was that at all the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday yesterday returned to deposit it again . They all had the sorry satisfaction of knowing that by drawing their money out they had lost the interest upon it which the banks would have paid them for the present interest-bearing period . Asked by a reporter for THE NEW-YORK Tniks as to the report that a syndicate of the Presidents of the local national banks had made a proposition to the savings banks to buy Government bonds-of them for the purpose of increasing the currency , and that this proposition had been received favorably , President James of the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank , in Chambers Street , said : " If the savings banks find it nenessiary to increase their cash reserves they will certainly sell United States bonds . Otherwise they will not , and at present there is no indication that they will have to resorts to this measure . " There is no syndicate that I know anything about . The matter has gone no further than an informal talk among a few bankers as individuals about the expediency of taking steps to relieve the currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , and his proposition was that it might be a wise move for both the savings and the national banke to use a part of the savings banks ' bond holdings and deposit them against a banknote issue . In that light we are giving is consideration , but each savings bank acts for and by itself , and will decide upon its course purely on the basis of its own needs and conditions . ? ? I do not believe that at present any savings bank in this city feels the need of currency . Therefore they will not sacrifice securities with such a market as now rules . It all depends upon the volume of withdrawals from the savings banks and upon the number of notices of withdrawal tiled . The volume of drafts which characterized Monday and Tuesday has now decreased almost to a normal point , and the notices given are few . At this bank we have received only 220 notices since Saturday . " President Bissinger of the German Say . jugs Bank . speaking on this matter , said : " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet by more than $1,000,000 . " At nearly all the banks visited it was announced that many of the notices of withdrawal which had been filed during the rush of Monday and Tuesday were being withdrawn . At all the savings banks in Brooklyn yesterday a feeling of hopefulness prevailed . The little flurry of Monday seemed to have entirely died out . Depositors did not clamor for their money . A few drew as much as the officers would allow , but they seemed satisfied that there was no danger of losing their savings . The Brooklyn Dime Savings Bank reduced the amount that could be drawn without notice from $20 to $15 . President Huntington said this was necessary because the bank could not get currency enough to meet all demands for the larger amount that might be made . On Tuesday the bank paid out $9,000 , or $21,000 less than on Monday . Only a few persons called at the Williamsburg Savings Bank yesterday . and they were almost equally divided between those who wished to draw and those who wanted to deposit . Advices from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pat the ninety-day notice of withdrawal into effect . The banks of Concord , N. H. , have done the same . The Albany Savings Bank . which on Monday declared that it would pay its depositors in full , has put the time notice into effect .
