txt THE fortunes of war have placed the Philippine Islands at the disposal of this country . In doing so , they have prepared for America a problem perhaps the most difficult of all which the war will be responsible for , and probably the one which is the least understood . It is not too much to say that very few persons in the United States know anything of the Philippines , their present condition , or their inhabitants . Most of us know , indeed , where the islands lie , and that the group contains many islands , certainly numbering more than a thousand , of which ten are of considerable size ; that the islands are rich in soil , and highly tropical in climate ; that their area is considerably greater than that of the British islands ; and finally that they contain six or seven millions of native inhabitants . But the present position of this co*tntry in its relations to these islands and to Spain imperatively demands that both the Government and the people of the United States should know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Manila was not // merely a brilliant naval action . It was one of those events that mould history . For the time at least Spain 's empire in the Pacific was destroyed along with her fleet , and , unless by the action of this country , it can not possibly be restored . Nor is this all . The victory served the purpose of encouraging , consolidating , and rendering successful the native revolt against Spanish authority in the island of Luzon , which was otherwise hardly possible . Both these results-neither of which was or could have been foreseen-have rendered the victory of Manila a turning point in the history of this country also . Nations , like .. individuals , never escape the consequences of their own actions , and in the present case the working of this universal law is likely to be more than ordinarily self-evident . The islands , practically at our disposal to-day , have been possessed-it would be a perversion of language to say that they had been either occupied or governed-for nearly three centuries by Spain , and our victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been claimed as subjects of the Spanish crown ; many of them-though almost entirely in one island of the group-have been the victims of Spanish oppression and misgovernment during most of the period ; to a very limited extent they have learned the Spanish language , and a considerable number of them have been , nominally at least , converted to Christianity by Spanish missionaries ; and , finally , it may be said that with very few exceptions they have conceived a very hearty dislike for their Spanish taskmasteis . This dislike , rendered effective by the defeat at Manila , has enabled the insurgents of the island of Luzon to defy Spain and set up at least a nominal government of their own . It represents only a part of the people of Luzon , and can hardly be said to control even those whom it represents , but undoubtedly it stands for the fact that the sympathies of the inhabitants of Luzon  --  the only island intimately acquainted with Spanish methods of government-are with anybody who opposes Spain . The problem of the Philippines is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , but consists of two very distinct parts which may demand somewhat different solutions before any justice can be done to either . To make this clear , it becomes necessary to state more fully the actual situation as it is to-day , and also as it has been under the so-called Spanish dominion of the islands . // For nearly three centuries past Spain has professed not only to own but also to occupy the Philippine islands , and in a certain very limited sense she has done so , with the exception of a short time early in this century , when they were taken from her by Great Britain , as this country has taken them now . This is only correct , however , so far as the outside world is concerned . Spain has never in fact either owned or occupied the islands as a whole . What she has really owned , and to some extent occupied , is the island of Luzon , the largest of the group , where she founded the city of Manila and several smaller towns . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just nor enlightened , was largely operative , and here she made serious efforts to Christianize and civilize the natives . Luzon , however , is only one of ten large islands in the group , the united areas of the others greatly exceeding its own , and it is believed to be far from the richest of the group in natural resources . Like the others , it is mountain6us , but , unlike some of them , it has not been proved to contain any minerals of value for purposes of trade or commerce . Parts of the island are unquestionably productive , and , in better hands than either the natives or their Spanish masters , it might long before this time have been nearly as rich a possession for Spain as Java has long been for Holland . But there is no reason to believe that it is nearly so rich , or could be made nearly so productive , in any hands , as some of the more southerly islands of the group , which contain richer soil and are situated nearer to the equator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . By far the larger part of the island lies to the north of Manila , between the fifteenth and nineteenth parallels of latitude , and that section of the island contains the only districts likely to prove very largely productive , even if they are made the most of by the application of energy and capital . It is not to be forgotten that a great difference exists between islands lying within the tropics near a continent like our own or Asia , and those that lie in the midst of the ocean , like the Philippine group . In their case ten or fifteen degrees of latitude make a very appreciable difference in climate , especially in the matter of rainfall , which is in tropical climates the great factor in production . For this reason , the southern Philippines will be found to be the richest j*l*nds for the production of nearly every kind of crop which // has the special value attaching to tropical vegetation in the markets of the world . It is these southern islands of the group over which Spain has at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a - matter of fact , they are almost unexplored , and unknown even to Spanish travellers ; their inhabitants have never dreamed of acknowledging any practical authority over them on the part of Spanish officials , except at a few points on the sea coast ; they do not speak the language , obey the laws , or profess the religion of the Europeans who have nominally ruled the country for two centuries and a half . The chief of the islands are Mindanao , the most southerly and , next to Luzon , the largest and most populous of the group ; Leyte and Samar , lying directly to the north and continuing the chain of more recent and active volcanic forces which begin with the lofty volcanic mountain at the very southernmost point of the group ; and the islands of Bohol , Sebu , Negros and Panay , which lie to the west out of the main line of volcanic disturbance , and are the only parts of the group that are known to contain minerals of extent and value . In these islands and their future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem which is involved in our new acquisition . It can not be too emphatically insisted upon that the Philippines are , for all practical purposes , a country of possibilities rather than of any considerable present value . The soil is for the most part of that rich volcanic character which seems , in conjunction with tropical heat and rains , to produce the richest vegetation of the most valued kinds ; the natives , while entirely uncivilized , and practically independent , which really means without government of any kind , are not as a rule hard to deal with , nor are they usually unfriendly to strangers , or averse to Europeans ; and the influence of Christianity , so far as it has gone , has prepared the way for that intercourse with superior races which lays the foundation of civilization . On the other hand , it must not be forgotten that the native races of these islands have all the vices of their condition . Less even than those of Luzon are they at all inclined to exert themselves to do any useful work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of permitting anyone else to govern them . Accustomed to the domestic tyranny of their chiefs as their normal condition , and to small tribal wars as their common employment , they present by no means a // very hopeful field for the operations which are to develop their resources . or to elevate their condition . The people of Luzon , it must always be remembered , are not only not in the same condition as those of the southern islandsthey are not the same people at all . The race is different ; the language  --  or rather the languages , for there are many , more distinct than French and English-is in no way similar ; the manners , customs and habits of the tribes differ widely from those of the northern island , and also from one another . It might be possible , though it is probable that the experiment would be attended with much risk and trouble , to proclaim a protectorate over Luzon and to allow the natives to try for themselves the experience of self-government . Possibly , it might not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own Central American IR*publics . It could not , and would not in any case , extend to the southern islands . By no possible stretch of imagination could it be supposed that the Presidency or Dictatorship of Aguinaldo or any other leader of Luzon extended to the independent , and more than equally warlike and populous , islands lying nearer the equator , and it would be impossible to expect European nations to respect the transparent fiction to the disregard of their own interests , as soon as the troops of this country were withdrawn from the islands . It does not rest with America to say whether or not the islands of the southern Philippines shall be self-governing , for in their present condition nothing can make them so . If the islands were returned to Spain , indeed , they might remain in something like the condition they have been in so long , which is one of nongovernment , but certainly not of anything which can by any stretch of courtesy be called self-government . Spain , in her exhausted condition , would be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives ; less likely , if possible , than ever to do anything toward developing the resources of the group . In such a case it would only be a question of time until it dawned on Spanish statesmen , and even on the Spanish people , that they had nothing to gain by keeping this feeble ghost of their departed foreign empire , but much to gain by selling it to some other European power . The new departure might well be for the better - indeed , it could hardly be for the worse , whether France , Germany , or even Russia , became the buyer  --  but it could not in that // 272 case be said that this country had faced the problem which her own actions had produced . It might on the contrary be said with truth that , having entered upon a war in the great cause of humanity and advancing civilization , she had used its favorable results as far as they served her own purposes , and fell in with her own most direct interests , by freeing Cuba and taking charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future of considerably more than double as larg&amp;a population , when she found that the problem of their civilization was not an easy one , and might not , at any rate for many years , be a directly profitable one . To return the island of Luzon to Spain is , indeed , hardly possible for America . A restoration which would be possible of acceptance by a proud nation like the Spaniards must be an untrammelled restoration . Such a restoration was made by Great Britain after the Napoleonic wars more than eighty years ago , with the result that the lapse of nearly a century has seen no real improvement in the condition of the islands or their people . In that case , however , there was practically no choice . Britain could have done little or nothing with or for the country , and Spain had not really been the enemy of England except upon Napoleon 's compulsion . The position to-day is , in all respects , a different one . Spain has had her opportunity for three-quarters of a century or more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to govern and civilize the Philippines , and her failure is complete . She has applied the methods of two centuries ago to the country and people , with the result that her government is less beneficial and more impossible now than it was then . Should Spain now be restored to what she unquestionably regards as her rights of sovereignty in the Philippines , her first step must be a renewal of the atrocities of her war in Cuba . The soldiers deported from Cuba and Porto Rico at the expense of this country , would be employed-nay , they must be employed-in reducing to subjection the rebels of Luzon , who have acted in concert with ourselves , and have gone far to render our operations successful  --  to such a subjection as was proposed for Cuba . Such a position only needs to be faced to be recognized for what it is-impossible . And to return the southern Philippines to Spain is to return them to the condition of hopeless stagnation and barbarism in which two centuries and a half of nominal occupation and control by that country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // better condition to civilize her distant dependency when war had exhausted her treasury and demoralized her government . She would be no more likely to engage with energy and enterprise in the task of developing the resources and elevating the inhabitants of the Philippines than during all the years of comparative prosperity at home . If there was a change at all , it would inevitably be a change for the worse-though indeed , to those who know by personal observation what she has done , or rather what she has left undone , in her dominions of the southern Philippines , such a change seems hardly possible . But , it may be said , there is still the expedient of a protectorate , jointly with Spain herself , if she will , but in any case an American protectorate , under which the people of these neglected islands may learn to govern themselves and develop their own resources . It may be said with confidence that the idea of a joint protectorate is an impossible dream . Spain could gain nothing by such an arrangement , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her colonial empire than to submit to the constant control of this country in dealing with her emancipated subjects . If it were possible , moreover , it would prove a hopeless failure . Of all protectorates , a joint one is under any circumstances the very worst , as experience has shown conclusively in the case of Samoa ; and where the powers which it gave were to be exercised by a victorious and a defeated nation jointly , it would either be a farce , or it would shortly develop into a tragedy . Nor would America 's sole protectorate in any degree meet the difficulties of the case . A protectorate supposes a government which is to be protected and maintained , and no such government either does or can exist , at any rate in the greater part of the Philippine group . A republic of Luzon would probably prove a failure so complete as to make Spanish domination appear beneficent by comparison , but a republic of Mindanao , Sebu , or Negros would at present b6 a simple impossibility . The natives could neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , and no one tribe out of the eight or ten , now totally distinct , could hope to work in concert with another . If indeed it were conceivable that a small body of American or European adventurers should settle in these islands , they might in the course of time repeat-though under circumstances of far greater diffi // culty and danger  --  the process which has , perhaps happily , ended in the annexation of Hawaii by this country . The one condition which renders this impossible , even if it were in any sense desirable , is that no time would be allowed for the development of the project . Whatever America proposes to do in the Philippines she must do quickly , and she must do it decisively . It is something worse than idle to suppose that she could by any possibility extend a Monroe doctrine to the islands of the Oriental Archipelago , and , having authorized the institution of a native anarchy under the name of self-government , call upon the nations of E'urope to respect its excesses on the ground that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such an assumption of power would inevitably defeat its own purpose , and its only logical result would be to ' launch this nation upon a long and disastrous career of warfare , if not of conquest . As matters stand , our choice is a limited one . We may , if we are prepared to do so , abandon the Philippine islands to Spain at the end of the war . We may , if a feeling df shame does not prevent , declare in effect that , having secured the freedom of Cuba , which we regarded as essential to our own comfort , and the well-being of our own people who had invested money there , and having taken possession of Porto Rico , which we regarded as of special value to us for strategic and other reasons , we are satisfied . In that case we have only to abandon all claims upon the Philippines which the war nay have given us , and to hand over the Philippine insurgents in Luzon to their inevitable fate at the hands of Spain . By this course it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we shall also wash our hands of not a few embarrassing questions and anxious responsibilities . It may be as well to remind ourselves , however , as a nation , that the process of hand-washing does not always serve as a satisfactory solution of a difficult problem . The Nemesis of national responsibilities declined is as real and as relentless in its vengeance as that of national wrongs committed , and no easy-going assumption of indifference can save any nation from its retribution . It is true that nothing was farther from the mind of the Government and people of America , when they entered upon a war with Spain , than burdening themselves with distant dependencies , but it is no new experience that nations , like individuals , are to a large extent at the mercy of the events unexpectedly following on their own // actions . The question which will demand an answer is not what we intended when we began the war with Spain ; it is not even altogether what we professed at that time as our intentions and wishes ; it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ; it is rather what we must do if we would meet the obligations we have incurred to the cause of humanity and civilization . To do this will involve dealing in some way with the problem of the Philippines . In dealing with this problem*it is necessary to remember that it is not one but two-fold . There is the problem of that part of the group which has been to some extent occupied , in a certain limited sense governed , and in a very small degree civilized , by Spain ; and there is the larger problem of the*.disposal of the greater part of the islands , of which none of these things can be said . With regard to Luzon , with its partial civilization , and its largely successful body of insurgents , it is impossible that we should simply abandon our position , for such a course would mean treachery to men whom we have treated as practically our allies , and equal treachery to the cause of humanity , for which we have underMken the war . Whatever happens , it is evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for , at least to the extent of rescuing them from the vengeance of the Spanish government and people . It may well be argued that if we consider ourselves bound by the dictates of ordinary humanity to assure liberty to the insurgents and people of Cuba , we are not less bound to do as much for those of Luzon , where the power is even more completely in our hands . This might be done by recognizing a Republic of Luzon , and handing over the island , freed from Spanish control , to its own people , under a treaty by which Spain would agree not to attempt its reconquest . Unless we did more than this , indeed , the experiment would almost certainly prove a failure , and after a short period of anarchy and bloodshed our republican offspring would merge into the dominions of Japan , Germany , or France . If we went further and declared a protectorate , we should to all intents and purposes have to annex the island ourselves , or at least to submit to being saddled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal less Ian its advantages and profits . And even this would Rot be a possible solution of the difficulty // respecting two-thirds of the group . There can not even be a nominal republic of the southern Philippines . Divided as they are among tribes , wholly uncivilized and wholly independent of one another , any possible bond of union must be a bond imposed from the outside for generations yet to come . The Spaniards have not , and never have had , more than small trading stations on these islands , and they have never even attempted to govern or to civilize them . The position is almost identical with that of the islands of New Zealand at the time when Britain annexed them to her empire nearly sixty years ago . The wonderful success which has attended that experiment affords the highest encouragement to any nation that will apply the methods which in that country have preserved and civilized the native race , but it proclaims emphatically that it can only be attained by a firm hand and a consistent policy . If this country should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from native barbarism , and on the other from absorption by some foreign nation , whose policy would almost cerfainly be unfriendly to our commercial expansion , it can be done by treating them as an outlying territory of the United States , and practically in no other way . If left in Spanish hands , with one or more coaling and trading ports secured , they would be little better than a useless anxiety ; if made the subject of another make-believe popular government , as was the case with Hawaii , they would eventually become territories after a period of comparative stagnation and anxiety . It is , of course , for the Government and people of this country to say whether they will deal with the Philippines at all or not . It is for them to decide whether they desire that commercial expansion on the other side of the Pacific which can only be effectively secured by the possession of some territory nearer than our own Pacific coast ; nearer , too , than our little rocky outpost of Hawaii . If we do not , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure pardon for her Philippine rebels may possibly serve our turn . Should that not appear to us sufficient , we may demand that Luzon shall be set free to govern itself as best it can . In either case the result will almost certainly be the same ; we shall have taken possession of the islands only to hand them back to a period of bloodshed and anarchy , to be followed by their annexation by some European or Asiatic pewer , which will give them something at least of peace and security , and in // return will probably receive wealth from their developed resources . If , on the other hand , this country should decide that she will accept the responsibility cast upon her by events , it is hardly too much to say that there is but one way in which she can do it effectively . She can discard the illusion of a selfgoverning republic , which could only mean the tyranny of a few half-castes over a large population , confessedly incapable of selfgovernment , and treat the whole of the islands as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . The undertaking will be a serious one , but its success is more than a possibility , and its rewards would be substantial.
