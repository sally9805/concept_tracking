He describes how Mau-sers , fired either by the Spanish or by the 1 Filipinos , before the United States forces became engaged in he conflict with the natiVeg , pierced blockhouses and all kinds of buildings . He says that the natives are very Ignorant , and adds : We can not explain to them , and , to make matters worse . the Spanish papers contain articles solely calculated to incite the natives to rebellion .
