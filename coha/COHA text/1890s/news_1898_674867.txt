txt A great French liner has succumbed to the one peril of the sea which it seems that the progress of science can do nothing to avert . That is , the peril of collision in a fog . ? That is the form of disaster which has been most frequent and most fatal to the populous floating towns by which the transatlantic commerce is now carried on . Scarcely any other form of disaster can happen without of itself indicting a commander for negligence . No care can do away with the danger of this . The obvious precaution of proceeding at low speed during a fog is perhaps not so real as it is obvious . The shorter the voyage the smaller the risk . And again , a collision between two of these leviathans , even at half speed , would be a frightful matter , while at full speed there is the chance that the momentum of the sea monster may save her at the cost of whatever crosses her path . But if there is no way of insuring against this form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . The system of water-tight compartments should insure that a ship will sink so slowly that her passengers may be saved , if it can not keep her afloat entirely . There have been steamers that by keeping their compartments separated have come into port after one end had been completely knocked away . The burden of proof is always on the commander , in an accident like this to La Bourgogne , to show that his bulkheads were all closed . It is to be hoped that there will be in this case such a rigid and impartial inquiry as , in the case of British steamers , is undertaken by the Board of Trade .
