txt There are numerous indications that Gov Elm , is in a quandary . While it is likely that ho might compass his own election to the united States Senate if he were disposed to go there , it grows more and more doubtful whether he can dispose of the seat of Mr. Evekrs to whomsoever he will if ho conpludes that he does not want it himself . The friends of the Governor do not seem to think it would be wise for him to allow ' himself to be shelved " by going to the Senate , and his friends always derive their views upon such questions from the Governor himself . This Is a virtual admission that Mr. HILL ; e1 not a big enough man to figure to advantage before the country as a United States Senator . The utmost extent of his greatness would be exhibited in such wirepulliiag and working of the liquor interest as might secure control of a State Convention and capture the delegation chosen thereby to a National Convention . But those friends who reflect his own notions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public office at the end of the year 1891 , and they are beginning to talk about his renomination for Governor . This suggestion does not relieve the quandary . because at the end of his present term HILL will have been Governor seven years , having served out one year of Mr. CLEITEL , tND 'S term and been twice elected to the office , and the third-term idea is not popular , especially with the Democrats . No Governor since DANIEL D. To MPEINS , near the beginning of the century , has held office seven years , and , though MAIZCY was elected for a third term , the term was then only two years , and six years was the extent of his service . If DAVID B. HILL should aspire to a re-election , which would make the full extent of his occupancy of the Executive Chair ten years , he might encounter opposition that would not be any better for him than voluntary retirement to private life .                  @ @ @
