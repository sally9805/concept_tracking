Probably the most important theoretical work published this year . The celebrated ' author . of Space , Time and Architectli , re and Mechanization , Takes COmmand , heretofore known primarily as an architectural historian , undertakes an ambitious re-definitioh of prehistoric ( or , what the author usually calls ? primeval ) art , the art of the paleolithic epoch . The book ' is this an inquiry into the origins of art , ? but an inquiry written out of the aesthetic and historical consciousness of modern culture and which Seeks above all to establish some fundamental relation between constancy and change in man 's creative impulse . The roles of abstraction and symbolishi , the concepts of space and materiality , the use of line and color and mass , and their direct relation to the rituals and material conditions of prehistoric culture are explored in exacting detail . The book may be seen as an elaborate continuation of Worringer 's Abstraction and Empathy ( 1908 ) , written in the light of . a- half-century of abstract art , cultural anthropology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art are those of a connoisseur whose eye has been trained by Cubism and Expressionism , and his speculations are those of a mind trained in German philosophy and saturated in the symbology of Jungian archetypes . Noting that Worringer ? was of the same generation as Picasso and Braque , Giedion remarks : " The historian who ? in his own field  --  is nourished and tormented by the same forces as the artist fulfills a special function : he can give many searching minds direction and confidence " ; and he obviously takes this role for himself . The book contains more than 500 illustrations , ranging from line cuts to color plates to special photographs supervised by the author himself in the caves of France and Spain . Volume ' II will deal with Sumer and Egypt . PERSIAN ART : The Parthian and Sassanian Dynasties , 249 B.C. ? A.D. 651 . By Roman Ghirshman . Translated from the French by Stuart Gilbert and James Emmons . Golden Press . 344 pp. $25 : Though an independent and beautiful volume'On its own , this book constitutes December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Arts of Mankind , " edited by Andre Malraux and Georges Salles . It is said to be the first full-scale survey of the 900-year period , from the death of Alexander the Great to the Moslem conquest , during which the Parthians and Sassanians extended Persian rule from the Danube to the Chinese frontier . The art of this civilization ? mostly sculpture , but also including a wide variety of reliefs , wall paintings and decorative objects ? is an amazing and monumental synthesis of Greek and Asian elements . The author is an archaeologist and historian who also has a keen eye for aesthetic detail ; his style is factual and clear , and happily not given to Malrauxesque flights of metaphysical speculation . The plates ? 538 , with 142 in color  --  are magnificent , and follow the clear graphic style , with the emphasis ' on mat black-andwhite contrasts , of The Voices of Silence . Some of the bronze objects , printed in metallic inks , are particularly well done . Aficionados of sculpture will find the book of special value , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Jean Charbonneaux . Translated from the French by Katherine Watson . Viking . 164 pp. $5 . A useful handbook on the history and techniques of Greek bronzes by a curator of the Louvre . The book includes information on reproductions and fakes as well as a guide to the principal collections . The plates are small and indifferently printed , but are a necessary adjunct to the text . Anyone who  --  has peered into those crowded museum cases of bronze figurines and felt some curiosity about their relation to the monumental works of Greek art will find all the obvious ( if not the ultimate ) questions answered by a scholar . - PRIMITIVE - ART : Its Traditions and Styles . By Paul S. Wingert . Oxford . 421 pp. $7.50. - Writings on primitive art tend to suffer from a schizophrenic division of loyalties between pure and unfettered aesthetic response and a flattening , highly unaesthetic fidelity to anthropological fact . ProfessorWingert 's study succeeds - in ' bridging the gap between these approaches by establiShing for the reader exactly . what it meant to be an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oceania and Indian America . form the main , focus , and the qnphagis through out , is on the motives and morphology of style within the functions of each individual culture . It is a book written for the layman by a specialist ; the style is not always felicitous , but a great deal of information is conveyed in a relatively short space . The 126 black-and-white plates are not well printed , but they serve well enough and are usefully integrated with the text . Likely th become a basic book on the subject . PRIMITIVE ART . By Douglas Fraser . Doubleday . 320 pp. $7.50 . A shorter . book covering much the ' same ' material as Professor Wingert 's , written by a former student Of ' Wingert , now a colleague , at Columbia . It ' includes fifty-nine color plates , rather brassy and artificial-looking , in addition to mediocre black and whites. - Fraser extends his study to include the pre-Columbian art of Mexico , Central and South America , omitted from Wingert 's book . The volume as a whole is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text which is serious but constantly strains ' to encompass more material than can be flitted into its modest scale . AFRICAN , SCULPTURE . By Denise ' Paulme . Translated from the French by Michael Ross . Viking . 160 pp. $5 . The author , is director of the African section of the " Paris Musee de- l'Homme . The book , like its companion volume above , is primarily a factual guide to the technical ; regional and stylistic aspects of the subject . It will be useful to readers who already have an aesthetic interest in African sculpture but wish-to gain a more scientific understanding of its physical and tribal o'rigihs . Studies of the Masters HOGARTH AND HIS PLACE IN EUROPEAN , ART . By Frederick ' Antal . Basic. 270 pp. 301 plates . $15 . It is unlikely that any other English artist , major or minor , - has been subjected to such a painstaking effort to in- ? tegrate his work into the mainstream of European art . The late Frederick Antal was a sociological art historian , more or less Marxist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of his sub-jects , locating the specifically visual components of art history within the  --  context of all the political , economic , social and ? literary ' forces most likely to have affected their destiny . Hogarth , as an artist of pre-eminently social subjects , lends himself to this approach more readily than most artists , and this study , left unfinished at the time of Antal 's ' death 453 a few years ago , places Hogarth 's art in the world of eighteenth-century art and ideas with a clarity no other writer has attained . But Hogarth 's artistic achievement is assumed from the start , and not really argued ; the materials on which to base an aesthetic valuation are assembled , but it has been left to others to make the case for Hogarth as an artist who not only represents his era in a particularly crucial way but transcends it as well . My own opinion is that Antal exaggerated Hogarth 's achievement out of all proportion to its actual effect on the development of European art . Yet the book is immensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it of great interest . CARPACCIO , PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS . By Jan Lauts . Translated from the German by Erica Millman and Marguerite Kay . New York Graphic Society . 309 pp. $18 . The latest addition to the Phaidon series of definitive catalogues of the old masters . The short text is a concise study of the Venetian painter , and there are detailed comments , with bibliographical references , to each of the . plates . The 260 illustrations ( eighteen in color ) are very good . American Art THAT WILDER IMAGE : The Painting of America 's Native School from Tho1nas Cole to Winslow Homer . By James ThOrnas Flexner . Little , Brown . 407 pp. $15 . The series of books on American art , including First Flowers of Our Wilderness and The Light of Distant Shies as well as studies of Copley and Stuart , which Flexner has produced over the years constitutes the only thing we have in art history comparable to Van Wyck Brooks 's " Makers and Finders " series on American literature . This latest addi tion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering as it does so many central figures : Cole , Durand , Church , Bierstadt , Hunt , Inness , , Homer and , in fact , all the major painters of the Hudson River school , of the Indians , and of the other principal themes of the period . An enormous amount of material is encompassed , and the emphasis is always on the relation of the art to its social milieu . Considering the poor state of writing on American nineteenth-cen -- tury art , we should perhaps be grateful for this ambitious study . Yet it embodies so many of the traits that make , most ; writing on this period an irrelevant bore ? above all , the refusal to look at the 454 paintings themselves , with the heightened vision of our tithe , or indeed , with anything approaching modern sophistication ? that even its virtues , leave one exasperated . The writing is gentlemanly and unemotional ; , full of interesting facts and all observations , and in the end not really equal to the excitement of the material .. Yet , what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We sha undoubtedly go on reading Flexner until some more enterprising writer , who feels more at home . in the twentieth century but no less interested in the art of the nineteenth , turns his attention to this crucial native traditiOn . The illustrations , in black and White , are mediocre but follow the text in a useful way , and the text is handsomely printed . THE ARTIST 'S VOICE . By Katharine Kuh . Harper &; Row . 248 pp. $7.50 . What should have been a valuable record of talks with seventeen artists living in America turns out to be very disappointing . It will interest only those who - have not- yet , studied very deeply , the art of the participants , who include Albers , Calder , Stuart Davis , Duchamp , Gabo , Hofmann , Hopper , Lipchitz and Tobey among the more celebrated . Miss Kuh is herself a sophisticated observer , of the contemporary scene and currently art critic for the Saturday Review , but-for some reason she has adopted a posture of cultural innocence in these ' talks Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been more willing to be herself in these exchanges , perhaps the artists would have felt more of an obligation to ? probe something , deeper than the tops of their heads . As it is , we are given a pleasant , chatty book ' which tells us nothing we did not already know . Drawings MASTER DRAWINGS : In Private Collections . By Eric Van Schack. 90 pp .

World . 150 pp. , 64 plates . $7.50 . Anyone with an interest in Epstein 's sculpture will naturally want to look at these drawings , yet the book itself is a curiously insubstantial affair . The short introduction says nothing the educated reader is not already likely to know , and Lady Epitein 's notes are scattered and incomplete . The drawings are of great interest , but expensive at this price , and one surely wants to see them in much greater numbers . Picture Books LONDON PERCEIVED . ' Text by V. S : Pritchett. - Photographs by Evelyn Hofer . Harcourt , Brace &; World . 116 PP. $15 : - Pritchett 's text is so very much alive with the past history and present life of London that it quite reverses the usual order of interest in books of this type . He is , of course , an accomplished travel writer as well as a critic and short story writer , and in turning to his native capital he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though mag'ilificebtlY pririted , are not really in the same class . She does well with parks and trees , or wherever the human element can be by-passed , ? but she has a lamentable tendency to photograph people as if they were a species of decaying sculpture . Miss Hofer will be remembered for her photographs in Mary McCarthy 's book , The Stones of Florence , which made that lovely Italian city look as if nobody lived there . London yields very little to her photographic style , and Pritchett 's rich ' evocation of London life makes a mockery of it . ' LES PAVILLO1VS : ' French Pavilions of the Eighteenth Century .

Preposterous ! A photographic confection which sums up gyerything that is most pretentious and effete in the current fads of touring Greece and producing picture books for Christmas . The juxtaposition of selections from Chap-man 's Homer with Beny 's slick shots is sickening where it is not just hilarious .
