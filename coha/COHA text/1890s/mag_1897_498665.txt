HUGH WYNINE , FREE QUAKER : SOMETIME BREVET LIEUTENANT-COLONEL ON THE STAFF OF HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON . BY DR . S. WEIR MITCHELL , Author of ( ( Far in the Forest , * ( ( Roland Blake , ) ) etc . WITH PICTURES BY HOWARD PYLE . XVII . ON this night of the 2d of October , Jack told me we should move next morning or the day after . He had seen General Wayne on an errand for our colonel . e A strong talker , the general ; but as ready to fight as to talk.e In fact , ammunition was issued , and before dawn on the 4th the myriad noises of an army breaking camp aroused me . It was a gray morning overhead , and cool . When we fell into line to march , Jack called me out of the ranks . ( ( There will be a fight , Hugh . Mr. Howe has sent troops into Jersey , and weakened his hold on the village , or so it is thought . In fact , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . If-I should get killedyou will tell . your aunt-not to forget me  --  and Darthea too . And my father-my father , Hugh-I have written to him and to Miss Wynne-in case of accident . ) ) The day before a fight Jack was always going to be killed . I do not think I ever thought I should be hit . I had , later in the war , a constant impression that , if I were , it would be in the stomach , and this idea I much disliked . I fell to thinking of Darthea and Jack , wondering a little , until the drum and fife struck up , and at the word we stepped out . I have no intention to describe more of the fight at Germantown than I saw , and that was but little . It seemed to me confusion worse confounded , and I did not wonder that Graydon had once written me from the North that we were in a ( ( scuffle for liberty . ) ) The old village was then a long , broken line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each side of the highway , with here and there a larger mansion , like the Chew house , Clieveden , and that of the Wisters . The ascent from the city is gradual . At Mount Airy it is more abrupt , and yet more steep at Chestnut Hill , where my aunt 's house , on the right , looks down on broken forests , through which the center marched by the Perkiomen road . As to the fight on our right wing , I knew nothing of that for many a day . As we tramped on our march of at least a dozen miles , the fog which the east wind brought us grew thicker , but there was less dust . About dusk of morning we came out of the woods , and moved up the ascent of Chestnut Hill , where I wondered to find no defences . There were scarce any houses hereabouts , and between the hill and the descent to Mount Airy our own regiment diverged to the left , off the road . There were hardly any fences to trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hedges , we went by and remade the line , which was extended more to left as we moved away from the highway . At last we were halted . I was thinking of the glad days I had spent hereabouts when we heard to right the rattle of muskets . McLane had driven in the advanced picket of the enemy . Then the right of our own force fell on some British light infantry , and , swinging the left on the right as a pivot , our own flanking regiment faced their guns , so that we were in part back on the main road . The sun came out for a little , but the fog thickened , and it was lost . I saw Jack look at me , and noticed how flushed he was , and that his face was twitching . So heavy was the fog that , as we saw the guns , we were almost on them . To see fifty feet ahead was impossible . I saw two red flashes as the muskets rang out . There were wild cries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And with a great shout we ran forward , I hearing Jack cry , ( ( The bayonet ! the bayonet ! ) ) I saw in the smoke and fog men fall to right and left , and in a moment was after Jack , who stood between the guns , fencing with two big grenadiers . I clubbed one of them with my butt , and Jack disposed of the second . Meanwhile the Buglish line had broken , and men who had fallen hurt or were stand. - ing were crying for quarter . I saw none given . It was horrible . Our men were paying a sad debt , contracted on the 20th of September , when Gray surprised Wayne at 18 // Paoli , and there were no wounded left and few prisoners . It was a frightful scene , and when the officers succeeded to stop the slaughter , the account had been mercilessly settled , and there was scarce a living enemy in sight . Hastily reforming , we went on again , more to left of the main road , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red splotches where the scarlet uniforms lay thick on the wet grass . As we pushed on , the fog broke a little , and a confused mass of redcoats was seen , some running , and some following tumultuously their colonel , Musgrave , into the solid stone house of Clieveden , while the larger number fled down the road and over the fields . Meanwhile Sullivan 's people came up . Two cannon set across the road-they were but four-pounders-opened with small effect on the stone house . The fire from the windows was fierce and fatal . Men dropped here and there , until Jack called to us to lie down . We were at this time behind the mansion . As we lay , I saw Jack walking to and fro , and at last cooll*r lighting a pipe . Our company lay to the left a little , and away from the rest of the regiment . I called to Jack : ( ( Let us rush it , Jack , and batter down the back door . ) ) Jack , as I rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep still and obey orders . I dropped , and as I did so saw an officer with a white flag shot down as he went forward to ask a surrender . Then we were ordered to march , leaving a regiment to continue the siege ; a half-hour had been lost . We went at a run quite two miles down the slope , now on , now off the main street , with red gleams now and then seen through this strangeness of fog . The British were flying , broken and scattered , over the fields . I heard ( ( Halt ! ) ) as we swung parallel with the road at the market-place , where the Grenadiers made a gallant stand , as was known by the more orderly platoon firing . Then we too broke out in great blaze , and after , what with fog and smoke , a fight in a cellar were as good . The next minute our people came down the highway , and , between the two fires , the English again gave way . I heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some near me hesitated , and I saw Jack run by me crying , ( ( The bayonet , men ! After me ! ) ) I saw no more of Jack for many a day . We were in the wide marketplace-a mob of furious men , blind with fog and smoke , stabbing , clubbing , striking , as chance served . My great personal strength helped me well . Twice I cleared a space , until my musket broke . I fell twice , once with a hard crack on the head from the butt of a musket . As some English went over me , I stabbed at them madly , and got a bayonet thrust in my left arm . Jwasupinamoment* and for a little while , quite unarmed , was in the middle of a confused mass of men raging and swearing like maniacs . Suddenly there was no one to be seen near me ; the noise of muskets , the roar of cannonry , red flashes in the fog in front-that was all , as I stood panting and dazed . Next I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of musketry . Stephens 's division , coming up behind us , began to fire , mistaking us , in the infernal darkness , for an enemy . Our people broke under it , and , passing me , ran , beaten ; for the panic spread in the very moment of victory . I turned , not understanding , stumbled over a dead man , and suddenly felt as if a stone had struck my left leg above the knee . I fell instantly , and for a time-I do not know how long-lost consciousness . It could have been but a few moments . When I came to myself , I got up , confused and giddy , and began to walk , but with painful difficulty , stumbling over dead or wounded men . Our people were gone , and I saw no one for a little , till I heard the quick tramp of feet and saw through the fog the red line of a marching regiment almost upon me . I made an effort to fall to one side of the street , but dropped again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over me . When evening came , I found myself lying with others on the sidewalk in front of the Wister house . How I was taken thither I know as little as any . I was stiff , sore , and bloody , but soon able to look about me . I found a bandage around my leg , and felt in no great pain unless I tried to move . Men in red coats came and went , but none heeded my cry for water , until an old servant-woman , who during the fight had refused to leave the house , brought me a drink . I knew her well . I tried to tell her who I was , but my parched tongue failed me , and a rough corporal bade her begone . My watch , a good silver one , was stolen , but my money-belt was safe . Beside me were many other wounded , one man hideous with his jaw broken ; he seemed to me dying . By and by soldiers fetched others . Then a detachment of Virginians went past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with smoke , dirty and sullen . Surgeons ' aids came and went in and out , and // soon the sidewalk was crowded with the wounded . At last they carried a dying general into the house . I asked his name , but no one answered me . It was the brigadier Agnew , now lying at rest in the lower burialground by Fisher 's Lane . An officer came and counted us like sheep . About nine a row of carts stopped ,  --  country waggons seized for the purpose ,  --  and , with small tenderness , we were told to get in , or at need lifted in . I was put , with eight others , in a great Conestoga wain without a cover . Soon a detachment of horse arrived , and thus guarded , we were carted away like logs . The road was never good , but now it was full of holes and cut up by the wheels of artillery . I shall never forget the misery of that ride . I set my teeth and resolved to utter no groan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded men , chiefly such as seemed fit to travel . There were nine of us . One was dead before we reached town . As we jolted on , and the great wain rocked , , I heard the crack of the drivers ' whips , and far and near , in the darkness or near beside me , curses , prayers , mad screams of pain , or men imploring water . When near to Nicetown came on a cold , heavy rain , which chilled us to shivering . I let my handkerchief get soaked , and sucked it . Then I wet it again  --  the rain a torrent  --  and gave it into the hand of him who was next me . He could not use his arm , nor could I turn to aid him , nor did he answer me . At times we waited on the way , so that it was one in the morning when we found ourselves in Chestnut street in front of the State House . It was still dismally raining . We were told to get out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers standing on each side , but no one else near , and it was too dark to see if any whom I knew were to be seen . When they pulled out the man next to me , his head fell , and it was clear that he was dead . He was laid on the sidewalk , and we were helped or made to crawl up-stairs to the long room in the second story . Here some surgeons ' mates came and saw to us quite patiently . Soldiers fetched bread and water . I asked a pleasant kind of youth , a surgeon 's aid , to let my aunt know of my condition . He said he would , and , without the least doubt that he would keep his word , I managed to get into a position of partial ease , and , sure of early relief , lay awaiting the sleep which came at last when I was weary with listening to the groans of less patient men . The young surgeon never troubled himself with the delivery of my message . May the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams of a man in an agony of pain awoke me on this Sunday , October 5 , at daybreak . The room was a sorry sight . Some had died , and reflected on the swift succession of events of the past week . I had had bad luck , but soon , of course , my aunt or father would know of my misfortune . As I waited for what might come , I tried to recall the events of the battle . I found it almost impossible to gather them into consecutive clearness , and often since I have wondered to hear men profess to deliver a lucid history of what went on in some desperate struggle of war . I do not believe it to be possible . Being always of a sanguine turn of mind , I waited to see what next would happen . About five , after some scant diet , we were told to get up and go down-stairs . It was still dark because of the continuous rain and overcast skies . I refused to walk , and was lifted by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idlers were about the door to see us come out . I looked eagerly for a face I knew , but saw none . Our ride was short . We went down Sixth street , and drew up at the Walnut-street front of the prison , called , while the British held the town , the Provost . It was unfinished , a part being temporarily roofed over with boards . At the back was a large yard with high walls . Some , but not all , of the windows in the upper story had transverse slats to keep those within from seeing out . On the Sixth-street side were none of these guards , and here the windows overlooked the potter 's field , which now we call Washington Square . As I managed , with some rough help , to get up the steps , a few early-risen people paused to look on . Others came from the tumbledown houses on the north side of Walnut street , but again I was unfortunate , and saw none I knew . My heart fell within me as I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door soon closed behind a hundred of us , not a few being of the less severely wounded . Often in passing I had thought , with a boy 's horror , of this gloomy place , and tried to imagine how I shouki feel in such a cage . I was to learn full well . With fifteen others I was shut up in a room about twenty-two feet square , on the // Sixth-street side and in the second story . I was , but for a Virginia captain , the only wounded man among these , the rest being stout country fellows , ruddy and strong , except one lean little man , a clerk , as I learned later , and of the commissary department . As I had again refused to walk up-stairs , I was carried , and not rudely laid down by two soldiers in a corner of the bare room , now to be for many a day our prison . The rest sat down here and there in dull silence , now and then looking at the door as if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Virginia captain , after an hour had gone by , and asked him to lift and ease my hurt leg . He was quick to help , and tender . In a few minutes we came to know each other , and thus began a friendly relation which has endured to this present time . For a day or two soldiers were employed as turnkeys , but then a lot of rough fellows took their places , and we began to feel the change . I may say the like of our diet . For a week it was better than our pot-luck in camp . We had rye bread , coffee without sugar , and florribly tough beef ; but within two weeks the diet fell to bread and water , with now and then salt or fresh beef , and potatoes or beans , but neither rum nor coffee . A surgeon dressed my wounds for a month , and then I saw him no more . He was a surly fellow , and would do for me nothing else , and was usually half intoxicated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of maggots when it was no longer cared for , and only when , in January , I pulled out a bit of bone did it heal . Once a day , sometimes in the morning , more often in the afternoon , we were let out in the yard for an hour , watched by sentries , and these also we heard outside under our windows . Observing how quickly the big country louts lost flesh and colour , I set myself to seeing howl could keep my health . I talked with my unlucky fellow-prisoners , ate the food even when it was as vile as it soon became , and when in the yard walked up and down making acquaintances as soon as I was able , while most of the rest sat about moping . I felt sure that before long some one would hear of me and bring relief . None came . The scoundrel in charge was a Captain Cunningham . He had risen from the ranksa great , florid , burly , drunken brute , not less than sixty years old . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we once passed three days on rye bread and water , and of the former not much ; one day we had no food . He kicked and beat his victims at times when drunk , and when I proposed to him to make ten pounds by letting my aunt know where I was , he struck me with a heavy iron key he carried , and cut open my head , as a great scar testifies to this day . In late December the cold became intense , and we were given a blanket apiece to cover us as we lay on the straw . We suffered the more from weather because it chanced that , in October , the frigate Augusta blew up in the harbour , and broke half the panes of glass . In December the snow came in on us , and was at times thick on the floor . Once or twice a week we had a little fire-wood , and contrived then to cook the beans , which were rarely brought us more than half boiled . We did our best , the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , I think , felt more than we the horrors of this prisoned life . We told stories , got up games , and I induced the men to go a-fishing , as we called it ; that is , to let down their ragged hats through the broken window-panes by cords torn from the edges of our blankets . Now and then the poor folks near by filled these nets with stale bread or potatoes ; but one day , after long ill luck , a hat was of a sudden felt to be heavy , and was declared a mighty catch , and hauled up with care . When it was found to be full of stones , a strange misery appeared on the faces of these eager , half-starved wretches . The little clerk said , ( ( We asked bread , and they gave us a stone , * and of a sudden broke out into hideous exuberance of blasphemy , like one in a minute distraught . It was believed Cunningham had been he who was guilty of this cruel jest ; but as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience , and even gay endurance , by degrees gave way , as we became feeble in body , and the men too hungry to be comforted by a joke . At last the men ceased to laugh or smile , or even talk , and sat in corners close to one another for the saving of body warmth , silent and inert . A stout butcher , of the Maryland line , went mad , and swore roundly that he was George the king . It was hard , indeed , to resist the sense of despair which seemed at last to possess all alike ; for to starvation and cold were added such filth and vileness as men of decent habits felt more than those accustomed to be careless as to cleanliness . The Virginian , one Richard Delaney , soon got over a slight hurt he had , and but for him I should not be alive to-day . The place swarmed with rats , and he and I set to work capturing them , filling their holes as they // came out at evening , and chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intense cold , and when we were given fire-wood we cooked and ate them greedily . Meanwhile death was busy among the starving hundreds thus huddled together . We saw every day hasty burials in the potter 's field . I wrote twice , with charred wood , on the half of a handkerchief , and threw it out of the window , but no good came of this ; I suppose the sentries were too vigilant . A turnkey took one of my guineas , promising to let my aunt hear of me . I saw him no more . As to Cunningham , he was either too drunk to care , or expected to make more out of our rations than by a bribe , and probably did not credit the wild promises of a ragged prisoner . At all events , no good came of our many efforts and devices , which were more numerous than I have patience to relate . From the beginning my mind was full of schemes for escaping , and these I confided to Delaney . They served , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in December I began to have dysentery , and could eat no more , or rarely ; but for Delaney I should have died . He told me , about this time , that the men meant to kill Cunningham and make a mad effort to overcome the guard and escape . It seemed to me the wildest folly , but they were grown quite desperate and resolute for something-all but the butcher , who sang obscene songs or doleful hymns , and sat dejected in a corner . The day after I saw the little commissary clerk talking in the yard to Cunningham , and that evening this rascal appeared with two soldiers and carried off four of the dozen left in our room ; for within a week several had died of the typhus , which now raged among us . The next morning the clerk was found dead , strangled in the night , as I believe , but by whom we never knew . I got over the dysentery more speedily than was common , but it was quickly followed by a burning fever . For how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straw , miserably rolling from side to side . The last impression I recall was of my swearing wildly at Delaney because he would insist on putting under me his own blanket . Then I lost consciousness of my pain and unrest , and knew no more for many days . I came to a knowledge of myself to find Delaney again caring for me , and was of a sudden aware how delicious was the milk he was pouring down my throat . What else Delaney did for me I know not , except that he found and cared for my money , and bribed the turnkey with part of it to bring me milk daily for some two weeks . But that we had hid the guineas for a while in the ashes of the fireplace , I should have lost this chance and have died ; for one day Cunningham made us all strip , and searched us thoroughly . About the end of January , Delaney , seeing me bettered and able to sit up a little , told me this strange story . While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspect the prison . Cunningham was very obsequious to this gentleman , and on Delaney 's seizing the chance to complain , said it was a pack of lies , and how could he help the dysentery and typhus ? All jails had them , even in England , which was too true . ( ( I went on , ) ) said Delaney , ( ( to say that it was an outrage to confine officers and men together , and that Mr. Wynne and myself should be put on parole . The inspector seemed startled at this , and said , ( Who ? ) I had no mind to let a lie stand in your way , and I repeated , ( CaptainWynne , ) pointing to you , who were raving and wild enough . He came over and stood just here , looking down on you for so long that I thought he must be sorry for us . Then he said , in a queer way , and very deliberately : ( Will he get well ? He ought to be better looked aft*r . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you would be over yonder pointing to the potter 's field in a day or two . ) ) Which , in fact , was his cheerful prediction . It was safe to say it of any who fell ill in the jail . ( ( This officer appeared puzzled or undecided . He went out and came back alone , and leaned over you , asking me to pull the blanket from your face . I did so , as he seemed afraid to touch it . As for you , my dear Wynne , you were saying , ( Dorothea , ) over and over ; but who is Dorothea the Lord knows , or you . The officer at last , after standing awhile , said it was a pity , but it was of no use ; you would die . As for me , I told him that we were officers starving , and were entitled to better treatment . He said he would see to it ; and that is all . He went away , and we are still here ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , ( ( Who was the man ? ) ) ( ( Cunningham consigned me to a more comfortable climate than this when I asked him , and the turnkey did not know . ) ) ( ( What did he look like ? ) ) said I. ( ( He was tall , very dark , and had a scar over the left eye . ) ) ( ( Indeed ? Did he have a way of standing with half-shut eyes , and his mouth a little open ? ) ) // ( ( Certainly . Why , Wynne , you must know the man . ) ) " I do-I do . He is my cousin. * " I congratulate you. * And so saying , he went away to the door to receive our rations , of which now every one except ourselves stole whatever he could lay hands on . It did seem to me , as I lay still , in much distress of body , and thought over that which I now heard for the first time , that no man could be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , and he had done nothing . If , as appeared likely , he was sure I was almost in the act of death , it seemed yet worse ; for how could I , a dying man , hurt any one ? If for any cause he feared me , here was an end of it . It seemed to me both stupid and villainous . He had warned me that I had everything to dread from his enmity if I persisted in writing to Darthea . Assuredly he had been as good as his word . He was unwilling to risk any worldly advantages by giving me a gentleman 's satisfaction , and could coldly let me die far from the love of those dear to me in not much better state than a pig perishing in a sty . Nay ; the pig were better off , having known no better things . I thought much as I lay there , having been near to death , and therefore seriously inclined , how impossible it must ever be for me to hate a man enough to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hope which each week brought but hatched a new despair ; and still I mended day by day , and for this there was a singular cause . I kept thinking of the hour when my cousin and I should meet ; and as I fed this animal appetite I won fresh desire to live , the motive serving as a means toward health of body . As to what had caused Arthur to lift no finger of help , I tried to think no more . If it were because of Darthea , why should he so fear me ? I wished he had more reason . He must have learned later that I was still alive , and that I was , when he saw me , in no state to recognise him . It looked worse and worse as I thought about it , until at last Delaney , hearing me talk of nothing else , told me I would go mad like the butcher if I let myself dwell longer upon it . Thus wisely counselled , I set it aside . It was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fast gaining strength , but had lost , as I guessed , nearly three stone . There were but six of us left , the butcher dying last on his rotten straw in awful anguish of terror and despair . Delaney and I consoled each other all this dreary winter , and we did all men could do for the more unfortunate ones , whose sicknesses and deaths made this hell of distress almost unbearable . The diet was at times better , and then again , as a drunkard 's caprice willed , there might be no food for a day . If we were ourselves wretched and starved , we were at least a source of comfort and food to those minor beings to whom we furnished both board and bed . I do not mean to tell over the often-heard story of a prison-what we did to while away the hours ; how we taxed our memories until the reading , long forgotten , came back in morsels , and could be put together for new pleasure of it . There was one little man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His chief trouble was that he could get no rum , and of this he talked whenever we would listen . He had , like several sots I have known , a remarkable memory , and was thus a great resource to us , as he could repeat whole plays , and a wonderful amount of the Bible . As it was hard to arouse him , and get him to use his power to recall what he had read , in an evil hour we bribed him with some choice bits of our noble diet . After this the price would rise at times , and he became greedy . His mind gave way by degrees , but he still kept his memory , being also more and more eager to be paid for his power to interest or amuse us . When at last he grew melancholy and sleepless , and walked about all night , it was a real addition to our many evils . He declared that he must soon die , and I heard him one night earnestly beseeching God , in language of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning he was dead , having strangled himself resolutely with a strip of blanket and a broken rung of a stool , with which he had twisted the cord . It must have taken such obstinate courage as no one could have believed him to possess . He had no capacity to attach men , and I do not think we grieved for him as much as for the loss of what was truly a library , and not to be replaced . On the 3d of February I awakened with a fresh and happy thought in my mind . My good friend the late lamented Dr. Franklin used to say that in sleep the mind creates thoughts for the day to hatch . I am rather of opinion that sleep so feeds and rests the brain that when first we awaken our power to think is at its best . At all events , on that day I suddenly saw a way to let the sweet outside world know I was alive . // At first I used to think of a chaplain as a resource , but I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew better . Being now able to move about a little , I had noticed in the yard at times , but only of late , a fat Romanist priest , who was allowed to bring soup or other diet to certain prisoners . I soon learned that , because Cunningham was of the Church of Rome , those who were of his own faith were favoured . Indeed , now and then a part of my lessening guineas obtained from these men a share of the supplies which the priest , and , I may add , certain gray-clad sisters , also brought ; but this was rare . That day in the yard I drew near to the priest , but saw Cunningham looking on , and so I waited with the patience of a prisoned man . It was quite two weeks before my chance came . The yard , being small , was literally full of half-clad , whole-starved men , who shivered and huddled together where the sunlight fell . Many reeled with weakness ; most were thin past belief , their drawn skin the colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange odour , like to cheese , and yet not like that . Even to remember it is most horrible . Passing near to a stout old Sister of Charity , I said quietly : ( ( I have friends who would help me . For God 's love , see Miss Wynne in Arch street , across from the Meeting . ) ) ( ( I will do your errand , ) ) she said . ( ( Others have said so , sister , and have lied to me . ) ) ( ( I will do it , * she said . ( ( And if she is away ? ) ) I thought of my father . He seemed my natural resource , but my cousin would be there . A final hope there was . I was foolish enough to say , *If she is not in town , then Miss Darthea Peniston , near by . If you fail me , I shall curse you while I live . ) ) ( ( I will not fail you . Why should you poor prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away satisfied , remembering that when I left Darthea was about to return , if she came to know , that would be enough . I had faith in her friendship and in her ; and , if ever I saw her again , should I tell her what now I knew of Arthur Wynne ? I learned many lessons in this awful place , and among them caution . I would wait and see . Both Delaney and I strongly desired an exchange , and not merely a parole . We imagined exchanges to be frequent . My own dilemma , Delaney pointed out , was that I was not in the aTmy , although I had been of it . And so we speculated of things not yet come about , and what we would do when they did come . The next day went by , and the morning after , it being now February 19 , we were all in the yard . A turnkey came and bade me follow him . I went , as you may imagine , with an eager heart , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in life . As I questioned the man , he said there was an order for a lady to see me . Now at this time my hair was a foot long , and no way to shear it . We had taken the blankets of the dead , and made us coats by tearing holes through which to thrust our arms . Then , as we lacked for buttons , or string for points , we could do no more than wrap these strange gowns about us so as to cover our rags . My costume troubled me little . I went to the foul-smelling room , now empty , and waited until the man came back . As he opened the door , I saw the good Sister of Charity in the hall , and then-who but Darthea ? She was in a long cloak and great muff , and held in her hand a winter mask . Seeing me in this blue blanket , all unshorn , and with what beard I had covering my face , when all men but Hessians shaved clean , I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarecrow , she fell back , saying there waa some mistake . I cried out , ( ( Darthea ! Darthea ! Do not leave me . It is I ! It is I , Hugh Wynne. * ( ( My God ! ) ) she cried , " it is Hugh ! It is it is ! ) ) At this she caught my lean , yellow hand , and went on to say : ( ( Why were we never told ? Your Aunt Wynne is away* Since we thought you dead , she has ordered mourning , and is gone to her farm , and leavea the servants to feed those quartered on her . But you are not dead , thank God ! thank God I was but a day come from New York , and was at home when the dear old sister came and told me . I made her sit down while I called my aunt . Then Arthur came , and I told him . He w&amp;ts greatly shocked to hear it . He reminded me that some while before he had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the jail , and was about to die ; and now could it-could it have been you ? He is for duty at the forts to-day , but to-morrow he will get you a parole . He supposed a day made no matter ; at all events , he must delay that long . I neVer saw him so troubled . ) ) ( ( Well he might be , ) ) thought I. I merely said , *Indeed ? * But I must have looked my doubt , for she added quickly : ( ( Who could know you , Mr. Wynne ? ) ) I stood all this while clutching at my blanket to cover my filth and rags , and she , // young and tender , now all tears , now flashing a smile in between , like the pretty lightning of this storm of gentle pity . ( ( And what fetched you here to this awful place ? ) ) I said . ( ( God knows how welcome you are , but- ) ) ( ( Oh , ) ) she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wait , but I could not . My aunt was in a rage , bTut I would go with the dear sister ; and then I found Sir William , and Mr. Montresor was there ; and you will be helped , and an end put to this wickedness . But the parole Arthur will ask for-that is better . ) ) ( ( Darthea , ) ) I said hoarsely , my voice breaking , ( ( I have been here since early in October . I have been starved , frozen , maltreated a hundred ways , but I can never take a parole . My friend Delaney and I are agreed on this . As to exchanges , I have no rank , and I may be a year inactive . I will take my chance here . ) ) I think death had been preferable to a parole obtained for me by Arthur Wynne . No ; I was not made of my father-rock to do this and then to want to kill the man . I could not do that . I put it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this I stood firm . She implored me to change my mind . ( ( How obstinate you are ! ) ) she cried . ( ( Do you never change ? Oh , you are dreadfully changed ! Do not die ; you must not . ) ) She was strange in her excitement . As for me , I thought to ask to have Delaney in , and to bid him tell that vile and wicked story ; but it seemed no place nor time to hurt her who had so helped me , daring to do what few young women had ever dared even to think of . As I hesitated , I was struck with a thought which was like a physical pain . It put myself and the other wretched business quite out of my head . " *Oh , Darthea ! ) ) I cried , **you should never have come here . Go at once . Do not stay a minute . This is a house poisoned . Seven died of fever in this room . Write me what else is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes from home , and linen and a razor and scissors , and , above all , ) ) and I smiled , ( ( soap . But go ! go ! Why were you let to come ? ) ) ( ( I will go when I have done . Why did I come ? Because I am your friend , and this is the way I read friendship . Oh , I shall hear of it too . But let him take care ; I would do it again . And as to the parole , he shall get it for you to-morrow , if you like it or not . I will write to you , and the rest you shall have ; and now good-by . I am to be at home for Mr. Montresor in a half-hour . This is but a bit of payment for the ugly little girl , who is very honest , sir , I do assure you. * ( ( Do go , ) ) I cried . ( ( And oh , Darthea , if this is your friendship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fie ! fie ! Hush ! ) ) she said , and was gone . In two hours came a note , and I learned , for I had asked to hear of the war , that Washington was not dead . We had been told that he was . I heard , too , of Burgoyne 's surrender , news now near to five months old , of Count Donop 's defeat and death , of the fall of our forts on the Delaware , of Lord Cornwallis gone to England , of failures to effect exchanges . Then she went on to write : ( ( Your father was , strange to say , roused out of a sort of lethargy by the news of your death . Jack managed to get a letter to your aunt to say you were missing , and Arthur had search made for you ; but many nameless ones were buried in haste , and he could not find your name on the lists of prisoners . ) ) None had been made to my knowledge . ( ( We all thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late , thinking it could not be that you were lost to her . It is well , as you do not like your cousin , that you should know how kind he has been , and what a comfort to your father . Indeed ,  --  and now it will amuse you , - he told Arthur , you being dead , he had still a son , and would consider Arthur as his heir . All this ought to make you think better of Arthur , whom , I do believe , you have no reason to dislike . I beg of you to think otherwise of him ; my friends must be his . And have I not proved I am a friend ? I fear I can not at once get news of you to Mistress Wynne , who has gone to live at the Hill Farm . ) ) And so , with other kind words , she ended , and I , putting the note in a safe place , sat on my straw , and laughed to think of Arthur 's filial care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnkey , quite captured by Darthea , and no doubt the richer for a good fee . He fetched a portmantle just come , and an order to put me in a room alone . I left Delaney with sorrow , but hoped for some way to help him . In an hour I was clean for the first time in five months , neatly shaven , my hair somehow cut , and I in sweet linen and a good , plain gray suit , and a beaver to match . Then I sat down to think , the mere hope of escape making me weak , and what came of it you shall hear . The next day I was ordered forth with a few others , and , luckily , late in the afternoon . I covered my fine clothes with the blanket , and went out . In the yard , just before our time was up , I saw the sister , to my delight , and perceived too , with joy , that the prisoners // did not recognise me , decently shaven as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that I was now close to liberty : I was so feeble that at times I staggered in walking . I knew , however , that when my new clothes became familiar in the jail my chance of escape would be over . I must take the present opportunity , and trust to luck . My scheme I had clearly thought out . I meant , when in the yard , to drop the blanket cover , and coolly follow the sister , trusting to my being taken , in my new garments , for a visitor . It was simple , and like enough to succeed if my strength held out . It was now dusk , and a dark , overclouded day . A bell was rung , this being the signal for the gang of prisoners to go to their rooms . Falling back a little , I cast aside the blanket , and then following the rest , was at once in the hall , dimly lighted with lanterns . It was some eighty feet long . Here I kept behind the group , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspect the welldressed gentleman in gray . I went by the turnkey , keeping my face the other way . I was now some fifteen feet from the great barred outer door . The two sentries stepped back to let the sister go by . Meanwhile , the gate-keeper , with his back to me , was busy with his keys . He unlocked the door and pulled it open . A greater lantern hung over it . I was aghast to see the wretch Cunningham just about to enter . He was sure to detect me . I hesitated , but the lookout into space and liberty was enough for me . The beast fell back to let the sister pass out . I dashed by the guards , upset the good woman , and , just outside of the doorway , struck Cunningham in the face  --  a blow that had in it all the gathered hate of five months of brutal treatment . He fell back , stumbling on the broad upper step . I caught him a second full in the neck , as I followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high steps , as I , leaping over him , ran across Walnut street . One of the outside guards fired wildly , but might as well have killed some passer-by as me . Opposite were the low houses afterward removed to enlarge Independence Square . I darted through the open door of a cobbler 's shop , and out at the back into a small yard , and over palings into the open space . It was quite dark , as the day was overcast . I ran behind the houses to Fifth street . Here I jumped down the raised bank and turned northward . Beside me was a mechanic going home with his lantern , which , by military law , all had to carry after fall of night . He looked at me as if in doubt , and I took my chance , saying : ( ( Take no notice . I am a prisoner run away from the jail. ) ) *I m your man , ) ) he said . ( ( Take the lantern , and walk with me . I hear those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise on Walnut street and in the square . Men were dimly seen running to and fro , and seizing any who had no lanterns . We went on to Chestnut street , and down to Second . I asked him here to go to Dock Creek with me . At my own home I offered him my last guinea , but he said no . I then told him my name , and desired he would some day , in better times , seek me out . And so the honest fellow left me . Many a year after he did come to me in debt and trouble , and , you may be sure , was set at ease for the rest of his life . Looking up , I saw light in the window , and within I could see Arthur and three other officers . The liquors and decanters were on a table , with bread and cheese , plain to be seen by hungry eyes . My father 's bulky form was in his big Penn arm-chair , his head fallen forward . He was sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool my mother used for her basket of sewing-material and the stockings she was so constantly darning . Harcourt and Colonel O'Hara were matching pennies , and my cousin was standing by the fire , speaking now and then , a glass in his hand . The dog asleep in the stable was no more considered than was my poor father by these insolent guests . An almost overmastering rage possessed me as I gazed through the panes ; for no one had closed the shutters as was usually done at nightfall . I was hungry , cold , and weak , and these- ! I turned away , and went down the bank of Dock Creek to the boat-house . It was locked , and this made it likely my boat had escaped the strict search made by the British . No one being in sight , I went around the house to the stable at the farther end of the garden . As I came near I smelt the smoke of our old Tom 's pipe , and then seeing him , I called softly , ( ( Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( ( Save us , Master Hugh ! ) ) and started to run . In a moment I had him by the arm , and quickly made him understand that I was alive , and needed food and help . As soon as he was recovered from his fright , he fetched me milk , bread , and a bottle of Hollands . After a greedy meal , he carried to the boat , at my order , . the rest of the pint of spirits , oars , paddle , and boatkey . On the way it occurred to me to ask for // Lucy . She had been seized by the Hessian Von Heiser , and was in my aunt 's stable . I had not asked about the mare without a purpose ; I was in a state of intense mental clearness , with all my wits in order . In the few minutes that followed I told Tom not to let any one know of my coming , and then , pushing off , I dropped quietly down the creek . It was cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small masses , amidst which my boat , turning with no guidance , moved on the full of the ebb tide toward the great river . For about two hundred yards I drifted , lying flat on my back . At the outlet of the creek was a sudden turn where the current almost fetched me ashore on the south bank . There from the slip nearly overhead , as the boat whirled around , I heard a sentinel call out , ( ( Stop there , or I fire ! ) ) I remained motionless , feeling sure that he would not risk an alarm by reason of a skiff gone adrift . As he called again the boat slewed around , and shot , stern first , far . out into the great flood of the Delaware . Never had it seemed to me a dearer friehd . I was free . Cautiously using the paddle without rising , I was soon in mid-river . Then I sat up , and , taking a great drink of the gin , I rowed up-stream in the darkness , finding less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to pull up to Burlington or Bristol ; but I soon found the ice in greater masses , and I began to be puzzled . I turned toward Jei*ey , and hither and thither , and in a few minutes came upon fields of moving ice . It was clear that I must land in the city , and take my chance of getting past the ' line of sentries . I pulled cautiously in at Arch street , and saw a sloop lying at a slip . Lying down , I used the paddle until at her side . Hearing no sound , I climbed up over her low rail , and made fast the boat . I could see that no one was on deck . A lighted lantern hung from a rope near the bow . I took it down , and boldly stepped on the slip . A sentry , seeing me come , said , ( ( A cold night , captain . ) ) ( ( Very , ) ) I rejoined , and went on up the slope . Chance had favoured me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , shut up , but with a light over the transom of the hall door . I passed on , went up to Third street , around to the back of the premises , and over the palings into the long garden behind the dwelling . As I stood reflecting I heard Lucy neigh , and no voice of friend could have been sweeter . I smiled to think that I was a man in the position of a thief , but with a right to take whatsoever I might need . I began to suspect , too , that no one was in the house . Moving toward it with care , I found all the back doors open , or at least not fastened . A fire burned on the kitchen hearth , and , first making sure of the absence of the servants , I shot the bolt of the hall door , fastened the pin-bolts of the windows which looked on the front street , and went back to the kitchen with one overruling desire to be well warmed . I had been cold for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for half an hour , turning like a duck on a spit . Heat and good bread and coffee I craved most . I found here enough of all , but no liquors ; the gin I had finished , a good pint , and never felt it . Still feeling my weakness , and aware that I needed all my strength , I stayed yet a minute , deep in thought , and reluctant to leave the comfort of the hearth . At last I took a lantern and went up-stairs . The china gods and beasts were all put away , the silver tankards and plate removed , the rugs gone . My good Whig aunt had done her best to make her despotic boarders no more comfortable than she could help . All was neglect , dust , and dirt ; pipes and empty bottles lay about , and a smell of stale tobacco smoke was in the air . Poor Aunt Gainor ! Up-stairs the general had moved into the room sacred to her spinster slumbers . The servants had taken holiday , it seemed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day ; for this room was in a vile condition , with even the bed not yet made up , and the curtains torn . In this and the front chamber , used commonly as my aunt 's own sitting-room , was a strange litter of maps , papers , and equipments , two swords , a brace of inlaid pistols , brass-plated , two Hessian hats , the trappings of a Brunswick chasseur , and a long military cloak with a gold-braided regimental number under a large crown on each shoulder . A sense of amusement stole over me , although I was so tired I could have fallen with fatigue . I was feeling my weakness , and suffering from what even to a man in health would have been great exertion . A full flask of rum lay on the table ; I put it in my pocket , leaving the silver cover . Next I put on the long cloak , a tall Anhalter helmet , and a straight , gold-mounted sword . The pistols I took also , loading and priming them , and leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now almost ten , and I could not hope to be long left in easy possession . Then I turned to the table . Much of the confused mass of papers was in German . I put in my pocket a beautifully drawn map of our own lines at Valley Forge . It may now be in Mr. // Alexander Hamilton 's house , as I gave it to that gentleman . A small pipe-I think the Germans call meerschaum-I could not despise , nor a great bundle of tobacco , which I thrust into the inside pouch of the cloak . Last I saw a sealed letter to LieutenantColonel Ernst Ludwig Wilhelm von Specht , also one to Colonel Montresor . These were much to my purpose . Finally , as I heard the great clock on the stairway strike ten , I scribbled on a sheet of paper under Von Knyphausen 's arms , ( ( Captain Allan McLane presents his compliments to General von Knyphausen , and hopes he will do Captain McLane the honour to return his visit. - February 20 , 1778 , 10 P. M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mood of merriment which was my one sign of excitement at the near approach of peril . A pause at the grateful fire , and a moment later I was saddling Lucy , looking well to girth and bit , and last buckling on the spurs of a Hessian officer . In a few minutes I was trotting up Fifth street . P knew only that the two extended lines had been drawn in close to the city , after the sharp lesson at Germantown ; but I did not know how complete were the forts and abatis erossing from the Delaware to the Schuylkill , to the north of Callowhill street . I meant to pass the lines somewhere , trusting to the legs of Lucy , who well understood the change of riders , and seemed in excellent condition . I turned off into the fields to the westward at Vine street , riding carefully ; and soon , as I moved to north , saw that fences , fruit-trees , and the scattered remnant of the wood were gone . Stumbling through mud and over stumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockhouses , and presently , for now the night was far too clear , the forms of sentries on top . Dismounting , I moved aside a hundred yards , so that I passed unseen between two of these forts . But a good piece to the north of them I came on a strong stockade , and saw beyond it a hazy mass of what I took to be a monstef tangle of dead trees , well fitted to delay a storming-party . Then I remembered my ride with Montresor . I was caught . I stood still in the night , wondering what to do ; behind me the hum and glow of the city , before me freedom and darkness . A man thinks quickly in an hour like that . I mounted , feeling the lift of my weak body an exertion , and rode back into Vine , and so to Front street . A hundred yards before me was a great camp-fire , to left of where the road to Germantown diverges . I saw figures about it passing to and fro . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cocked the one on my right , loosened the long , straight Hessian blade , and took the two letters in my bridle-hand . As I rode up I saw , for the fire was brightly blazing , that there were tents , pickets to left and right , men afoot , and horses not saddled . A sergeant came out into the road . ( ( Halt ! ) ) he cried . In broken English I said I had a letter for Colonel Montresor , to be given in the morning when he would be out to inspect the lines , and one for Lieutenant-Colonel von Specht . The man took the letters . I meant to turn back , wheel , and go by at speed ; but by evil luck a wind from the north blew open my cloak , and in the brilliant firelight he saw my gray clothes . ( ( Holloa ! ) ) he cried . ( ( What S the word ? You are not in uniform . Get off ! ) ) So saying , he caught the rein he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he spoke . If I could , I would have spared the man : but it was his life or mine ; I knew that . I fired square at his chest , the mare reared , the man fell with a cry . I let Lucy have both spurs . She leaped as a deer leaps , catching a fellOw in the chest with her shoulder , and was off like a crazy thing . I looked ahead ; the way was clear . A glance back showed me the road full of men . I heard shouts , orders , shot after shot . I was soon far beyond danger , and going at racing speed through the night ; but I had scared up a pleasant hornets ' nest . The last picket was a quarter of a mile ahead , perhaps . I pulled up , and with difficulty made the mare walk . There were fires on both sides , and a lot of alert soldiers out in the road . I turned off into the fields behind a farm-house , glad of the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather herself with the half-pause every horseman knows so well . She had taken a ditch , and prettily too . Keeping off the highway , but in line with it , I went on slowly , leaning over in the saddle . After a mile , and much stumbling about , I ceased to hear noises back of me , and turned , approaching the road I had left . No one was in sight . Why I was not followed by the horse I know not . I wrapped my cloak about me , and rode on up the deserted highway . I was free , and on neutral ground . All I had to fear was an encounter with one of the foraging parties which kept the country around in constant terror . I met no one . The sole unpleasant thought which haunted // my cold nightride was the face of the poor devil I had shot . I put it aside . Prison life had at least taught me the habit of dismissing the torment of vain reflection on an irreparable past . I went by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going slowly on account of the road , which was full of deep holes , and so through the market-place where we made our last charge . At last I breasted the slippery rise of Chestnut Hill , and throwing my cloak over the mare , that I had taught to stand , went up to the door of my Aunt Gainor 's house . I knocked long before I was heard . A window was opened above me , and a voice I loved called out to know what I wanted . I replied , " It is I , Hugh . Be quick ! ) ) A moment later I was in her dear old arms , the servants were called up , and my faithful Lucy was cared for . Then I fell on a settle , at the limit of my strength . I was put to bed , and glad I was to stay there for two days , and not even talk . Indeed , what with good diet and milk and spirits and clean sheets , I slept as I had not d*ne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and fit to converse , I was made to tell my story over and over . Meanwhile my aunt was desperately afraid lest we should be visited , as was not rare , by foragers or Tory partisans . I must go , and at once . Even war was to be preferred to this anxiety . But before I went she must tell me what she thought of this strange business of my cousin . I had been wise not to tell Darthea . A rascal like Arthur would trip himself up soon or late . Then she fell to thinking , and , bidding me cease for a little , sat ' with her head in her large hands , having her elbows on the table . ( ( Hugh , ) ) she said at last , ( ( he must have more , cause to be jealous than we know . He has still more now . Is it only the woman ? Can it be anything about the estate in Wales ? It must be ; you remember how he lied to us about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret the loss of Wyncote , and that I would like to have it . I am afraid I found it pleasant to say so , seeing that it annoyed him . ) ) ( ( I wish he may have some such cause to hate you , and no other . But why ? Your grandfather made a legal conveyance of an unentailed property , got some ready money , - how much I never knew ,  --  and came away . How can you interfere with Arthur ? The Wynnes , I have heard , have Welsh memories for an insult . You struck him once . ) ) ( ( The blow ! ) ) and I smiled . ( ( Yes ; the woman ! Pray God it be that . The estatehe is welcome to it . I hardly think a Welsh home would bribe me to leave my own country . But I do not see , aunt , why you so often talk as if Wyncote were ours , and stolen from us . I do not want it , and why should I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ) she returned , with more quietness in the way of reply than was usual when she was arguing . ( ( You are young now . The anger between England and ourselves makes all things in Great Britain seem hateful to you , to me , to all honest colonials ; but this will not last . Peace will come one day or another , and when it does , to be Wynne of Wyncote- ) ) ( ( Good gracious , Aunt Gainor ! let us set this aside . Arthur Wynne 's lies have stirred us all to think there must be some reason for such a keen desire to mislead me , you , and my father-above all , my father . But it is my father 's business , not mine ; nor , if I may be excused , is it yours . ) ) ( ( That is true , or would be if your father were well or interested . He is neitherneither ; and there is something in the matter . I shall ask my brother . ) ) ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I got nothing . Now he is in such a state that he may be more free of speech . I think he could be got to tell me what neither he nor my own father liked to speak of . ) ) Upon this , I told my aunt that I did trust she would not take advantage of my father 's weak mind to get that which , when of wholesome wits , he had seen fit to conceal . I did not like it . ( ( Nonsense ! ) ) she cried , **nonsense ! If you could have the old home- ) ) ( ( But how can I ? It is like promising fairy gold , and I do n't want it . I should like to go there once and see it and my cousins , and come home to this country . ) ) I was , in fact , weary of the thing , and my aunt would have talked it over all day . She could not see why I was so set in my mind . She kept urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have to act ; then I would change my mind . I hardly knew why that which once had been a delightful and mysterious bait now lured me not at all . What with the great war , and my own maturity , and Darthea , Wyncote had shrunken out of the world of my desires . It was too dreamy a bribe for one of my turn of mind . I would have given half Wales for an hour alone with Arthur Wynne . Then through my meditations I heard , ( Well , mark my word , Master Absolute ; // there is some flaw in their title , and-and soon or late- ) ) ( ( Oh , please , aunt- ) ) ( ( Well , do not make up your mind . I am afraid of you when you make up your mind . You are*as set in your ways as your father . Do you remember what Nicholas Waln said of him : ( When John Wynne puts down his foot , thou hast got to dig it up to move him ) ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I laughed , but was sad too , thinking of my poor old father , whom I could not see , and of how far he was now from being what his friend had described . I said as much . My aunt replied , ( ( Yes , it is too true ; but I think he is less unhappy , and so thinks Dr. Rush . ) ) After this our talk drifted away , and my aunt would once more hear of my note in McLane 's name left for the Hessian general . ( I hope yet to ask him of it , ) ) she cried , ( ( and that dear Mr. Andre-I can see his face . It is the French blood makes him so gentle . Catch him for me in the war . I should like to have him on parole for a six-month . ) ) And at this she laughed , and heartily , as she did most things . When this talk occurred we were in a great front room in the second story . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to be at set of sun , and to look over what seemed to be a boundless forest ; for the many scattered farms were hid away in their woodland shelters , so that from this vantage of height it looked as though the country beyond might be one great solitude . Nearer were well-tilled farms , on which the snow still lay in melting drifts . As we sat , I was smoking the first tobacco I had had since I left the jail . This habit I learned hng before , and after once falling a captive to that consoler and counsellor , the pipe , I never gave it up . It is like others of the good gifts of God : when abused it loses its use , which seems a silly phrase , but does really mean more than it says . Jack hath somewhere writ that words have souls , and are always more than they look or say . I could wish mine to be so taken . And as to tobacco and good rum , Jack said  --  but I forget what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good grip of you . The tricks an old fellow 's memory plays him are queer enough . I often recall the time and place of something clever a friend hath said long ago , but when I try to get it back , I have but a sense of its pleasantness , as of a flavour left in the mouth , while all the wise words of his saying are quite forgot . 1*r . Rush thinks that we are often happy or morose without apparent cause , when the mind is but recalling the influence of some former joy or grief , but not that which created either . The great doctor had many hard sayings , and this was one . As I sat reflecting , I felt a sudden consciousness of the pleasure my tobacco gave , and then of how delightful it was to be , as it were , growing younger day by day , and of how , with return of strength , came a certain keenness of the senses as to odours , and as to what I ate or drank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured with patience . My Aunt Gainor sat watching me with the pleasure good women have over one too weak to resist being coddled . When I had come to this happy condition of wanting a pipe , as I had jolted out of my pouch the tobacco I stole , she went off and brought the good weed out of the barn , where she had saved her last crop under what scant hay the Hessian foragers left her . I must smoke in her own library , a thing unheard of before ; she loved to smell a good tobacco . ( ( Oh , Aunt Gainor ! ) ) ( ( But Jack ! ) ) she said . She did not like to see Jack with a pipe . He looked too like a nice girl , with his fair skin and his yellow hair . I smoked on in mighty peace of mind , and soon she began again , being rarely long silent , *I hope you and your cousin will never meet , Hugh . ) ) The suddenness of this overcame me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ) she said , *I knew it . There is little love lost between you . ) ) ( ( There are things a man can not forgive . ) ) ( ( Then may the good God keep you apart , my son . ) ) ( ( I trust not , ) ) said I. " I can forgive an insult , even if I am Welsh and a Wynne ; but oh , Aunt Gainor , those added weeks of misery , foulness , filth , and pain I owe to this man ! I will kill him as I would kill any other vermin . ) ) Then I was ashamed , for to say such things before women was not my way . " I could kill him myself , ) ) said my aunt , savagely . ( ( And now do have some more of this nice , good gruel , ) ) which set me to laughing . ( ( Let him go , ) ) said I , ( ( and the gruel too . ) ) ( ( And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . I am all day in terror . ) ) And still I stayed on , pretty easy in mind ; for my aunt had set a fellow on watch at // Mount Airy , to let us know if any parties appeared , and we kept Lucy saddled . I sorely needed this rest and to be fed ; for I was a mere shadow of my big self when I alighted at her door on that memorable 20th of February . The day before I left this delightful haven between jail and camp , came one of my aunt 's women slaves with a letter she had brought from the city , and this was what it said : ( ( DEAR MIsTREss WYNNE : At last I am honoured with the permission to write and tell you that Mr. Hugh Wynne is alive . It was cruel that the general would not earlier grant me so small a favour as to pass an open letter ; but Arthur found much difficulty , by reason , I fear , of your well-known opinions . He was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wynne 's having escaped , after dreadfully injuring the poor man who took such good care of him all winter . How it came that he lay five months in this vile abode neither Arthur nor I can imagine , nor yet how he got out of the town . ( ( Arthur tells me that insolent rebel Allan McLane broke into your house and stole the beautiful sword the Elector of Hesse gave to General von Knyphausen , and what more he took the Lord knows . Also he left an impudent letter . The general will hang him whenever he catches him ; but there is a proverb : perhaps it is sometimes the fish that is the better fisherman . el have a queer suspicion as to this matter , and as to the mare Lucy being stolen . I am so glad it is I that have the joy to tell you of Mr. Hugh Wynne 's safety ; and until he returns my visit , and forever after , I am , madam , ( ( Your devoted , humble servant , ( ( To Madtm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill Farm , ( ( Chestnut Hill . ) ) My aunt said it was sweet and thoughtful of Darthea , and we had a fine laugh over the burglary of that bad man McLane . The woman went back with two notes stitched into the lining of her gown ; one was from my aunt , and one I wrote ; and to this day Darthea alone knows what it said . God bless her ! It was March 20 of 78 before I felt myself fully able to set out for camp . I had run no great risk . The country had been ravaged till it was hard to find a pig or a cow . Farmers were on small rations , and the foragers had quit looking for what did not exist . One dull morning I had the mare saddled , and got ready to leave . It was of a Friday I went away ; my aunt as unwilling to have me set out as she had been eager to have me go the day before . My Quaker training left me clear of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left her in tears by the roadside . XIX . IT is a good eighteen-mile ride to Valley Forge over the crooked Perkiomen road , which was none the better for the breaking up of the frost . I rode along with a light heart , but I was watchful , being so used to disastrous adventures . Happily , I met with no difficulties . A few miles from the bridge General Washington had built , I fell in with a party of horse . The officer in command seemed at first suspicious , but at last sent me on with two troopers . On the last Sunday of the month Friends were persistently in the habit of flocking into the city to General Meeting . They were not unwelcome , for they were apt to carry news of us , and neither we nor the enemy regarded them as neutrals . Our commander-in-chief , in an order of this day , declared ( ( that the plans settled at these meetings are of the most pernicious tendency , ) ) and on this account directed General Lacy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to fall in with these people . ) ) It was one of these parties of horse I had encountered . The officer sent me on with a guard* , and thus , in the company of two troopers , I rode through a fairly wooded country to the much-worn road leading down to the river . Here my guards left me with the picket at the bridge . It was a half-hour before the officer here stationed was satisfied , and meanwhile I stared across the Schuylkill at the precipitous bluffs , and wondered where lay the army which had passed the winter back of them . A few men along the far shore , and on the hill beyond a little redoubt , were all the signs of life or of war and its precautions . The bridge , over which presently I rode , was of army waggons weighted with stone , and on top rails with rude scantling . On the high posts driven into the riverbed for stay of the bridge were burned the names of the favourite generals . Once over , I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out on the huts of General Varnum 's brigade . The little world of an army came in view . I was on the first rise from the stream , a mile and a half to the south of the Valley Creek . To westward the land fell // 32 a little , and then rose to the higher slope of Mount Hope . To north the land again dropped , and rose beyond to the deep gulch of the Valley Creek . On its farther side the fires of a picket on Mount Misery were seen . Everywhere were regular rows of log huts , and on the first decline of every hill slope intrenchments , ditches , redoubts , and artillery . Far beyond , this group of hills fell gradually to the rolling plain . A mile away were the long outlying lines of Wayne , and the good fellows with whom I had charged at Germantown . Everywhere the forests were gone . Innumerable camp-fires and a city of log huts told for what uses they had fallen . On the uplands about me ragged men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A certain sense of elation and gaiety came over me . It lasted no long time , as I rode Lucy over the limestone hillocks and down to the lesser valley , which far away fell into the greater vale of Chester . The worst of the winter 's trials were over , and yet I was horror-struck at the misery and rags of these poor fellows . No wonder men dest*rted , and officers were resigning in scores , desperate under the appeals of helpless wife and family in far-away homes . It was no better on the upland beyond . Everywhere were rude huts in rows , woeful-looking men at drill , dejected sentries , gaunt , hungry , ill clothed , with here and there a betterdressed officer to make the rest look all the worse . I thought of the grenadier British troops , fat and strong , in the city I had fled from , and marvelled to think of what kept them from sweeping this squalid mob away , as a housewife switches out the summer flies . Full of thought , I rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on Wayne 's brigade , which held the lines looking in this direction . I was long about it ; but at last a man pointed out a hut , and I went in . " Holloa , Jack ! * I cried . ( Hugh ! Hugh ! Where on earth are you from ? ) ) And he flushed as he used to do , and gave me a great bear-hug , saying , " And you are not dead ! not dead ! Thank God ! thank God ! ) ) Thus again we met , to my unspeakable joy . He was about as lean as I had been , but on the whole , thanks to his florid skin , looked well , or better than the best of that half-fed army . How we talked , how we poured out our news that cold March afternoon , I shall not take space to tell ; nor his great wonder at seeing me after all had believed me dead . After supper came a half-dozen officers , and I heard all the camp gossip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mend , they said . Steuben was drilling the men ; Greene was the new and efficient quartermaster-general . Supplies were pouring in . Mrs. Washington and Lady Stirling had come . The French were sure to make a treaty with us . As to food , there had been bad days ; and I learned then , for the first time , of the full horrors of the winter camp at the forge in the valley . There was still enough wretchedness to show how far worse must have been the pitiable condition of the army during that winter of 77- ' 78 . I passed the next day at rest with Jack . I had had enough of the volunteer business , and determined , to Jack 's regret , to take service with the horse . I was still unfit to march , and it seemed to me wise for this reason to stick to Lucy 's good legs , at least until my own were in better order . I think Jack felt that he was under some necessity to take care of me , or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near him . He only hoped I would not incline to join McLane 's troop , and when I asked why , declaring that to be my utmost desire , he said it was a service of needless peril . Upon this I laughed so that the hut shook , and poor Jack became quite disconcerted , and fell to making a variety of excuses . It is of this he says : ( ( Hugh is come from death , and there is more to live for . For me , that am often unready and weak , there is again his ever just helpfulness . He is but a shadow of himself , and I can not wonder that he is so bitter against the enemy , or that he desires , less on account of his bodily feebleness than from a wish to revenge his cruel treatment , to serve with the horse . They are never more quiet than gadflies . It is dangerous duty , and should it cost this dear life , how shall I ever face Mistress Wynne ? ) ) I myself had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , as I rode through the east wind . It is my way , and always was , to have but a single idea in mind , and to go straight to my object the nearest way . He* was right in his belief that it was my burning wish to pay the debts of my poor abused body . I knew not when we should move , and the dislike of tiresome drills under Steuben , with a restless , perhaps a wholesome , instinct to lead a more active life , conspired to make my hatred seem reasonable . I could see , as I rode along through the cantonment and the long lines of huts , how // IN THE PRISON . ( SEE PAGE 22. ) // qwq ligious ? I do not know . Men say so .
