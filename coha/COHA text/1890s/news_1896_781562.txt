txt The Paris Figaro , in an article in part suggested by a recent paper of Mr. BRANDER Mier:Hums in Harper 's Magazine , has some interesting remarks upon the assumed misfortune to a public man Of being witty . Especially the writer holds that this is the case in the " tristes " Anglo-Saxon nations . He begins his essay by recalling that FRANKLIN , although he was distinctly the best and bestknown writer in the Continental Congress , was not appointed to draw up the Declaration of Independence for the reason that he was known to be a man of wit and consequently believed to be dangerous . As FRANKLIN was a member of the committee of five appointed to draw up the Declaration , it seems that he was not distrusted , on this or any other ground by Congress at large , Although he in fact contributed only a few verbal emendations to JEFFERSON 'S draft , It does not at all follow that he was distrusted by his colleagues or that he had any special desire to undertake the work .

" This , of course , is WASHINGTON , the other two being FRANICLIN and LINCOLN . Of the last the French writer says that , although the basis of his character was melancholy , he was so incorrigible a joker that it was necessary for him to die in order to be taken seriously . Of course , this is a great exaggeration , and indeed the case against wits in public life is very much overstated throughout . The only two witty Englishmen , affirms the critic , wile have , attained to be Prime Ministers were DisnAma and CANNING , and they succeeded in spite of their wit . On the other hand , Mr. QLADSTONE , in a Parliamentary career of sixty-five years , has never once raised a laugh . " Two things the illustrious ore- , tor has not known , conciseness and gayety . " There is some truth in all this , but really not very much . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord PALMERSTON and Lord ROSEBERY . Lord PALMERWON was doubtless a shrewd politician , but the fact that he said amusing things did not lose him either popularity or solid confidence . As for Lord Rosninmy , his faculty for making amusing speeches is really the only claim upon high office that he this ever possessed . Without it he would never have been heard of at all . It remains true that one must In genera ; take himself seriously in order to be taken seriously by other people , and that some men have gone very far whose oely equipment was the faculty of taking themselves with portentous seriousness . It was the political success of sonic of these in his time , no doubt , that made the famous " TOM " CORWIN declare that If he were to begin public life over again he would never make a joke . If he were alive now and in his own Ohio , he would be more convinced than ever at finding the most popular candidate of the Republican Party in a man in whom no quality whatever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
