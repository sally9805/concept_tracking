Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : WHO PLANTS A TREE . from Who plants a tree ( 1897 ) He who plants a tree Plants a hope . Rootlets up through fibers blindly grope ; Leaves unfold into horizons free . So man 's life must climb From the clods of time Unto heavens sublime . Canst thou prophesy , thou little tree , What the glory of thy boughs shall be ? He who plants a tree Plants a joy ; Plants a comfort that will never cloy . Every day a fresh reality , Beautiful and strong , To whose shelter throng Creatures blithe with song . If thou cloudst but know , thou happy tree , Of the bliss that shall inhabit thee ! He who plants a tree , He plants peace ; Under its green curtains jargons cease , Leaf and zephyr murmur soothingly ; Shadows soft with sleep Down tired eyelids creep , Balm of slumber deep . Never hast thou dreamed , thou blessed tree , Of the benediction thou shalt be . He who plants a tree , He plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not live to see . Gifts that grow are best ; Hands that bless are blest . Plant-life does the rest . Heaven and earth help him who plants a tree , And his work its own reward shall be .
