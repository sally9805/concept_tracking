txt IT is one of the curiosities of history that Bismarok should , in some parts of Germany , be regarded as the champion of Constitutional Government as opposed to Absolute Monarchy . The Iron Chancellor is well named in that he has made himself and his country great by means of war and its iron methods . Down in the bottom of his heart he has a profound contempt for popular government of every kind , and he has never shrunk from expressing his feelings on this subject , at least when he was in power . To the representatives of the people assembled in the Imperial Parliament , he more than once hinted that if they refused to vote according to his wishes he would find means of asserting the power of the crown in spite of their opposition . And while on the one hand he is praised as the author of German Constitutional Government , on the other hand he , more than any other German , has exerted himself to make parliamentary government in the Fatherland a worthless institution . As Bismarck endeavored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much more did he attempt to weaken the force of public opinion as voiced by the newspapers . He was wont to refer to them as merely so much ink and paper , and in this spirit his government treated editors as though they could be but of two classes-either slaves or enemies . The constitution of the empire guaranteed a free press along with free speech , and the judges in Prussia are as a class high-minded and able officers . But in spite of all this constitutional machinery the history of journalism in Germany since 1871 is one calculated to depress rather than cheer the student of politics . In iSGO the King of Hanover was driven from his throne and his estate was sequestered by the Prussian government on the // ground that it was necessary to have at the command of the Prime Minister a large amount of money with which to counteract the treasonable machinations of the anti-Prussian Germans . This great fund was a species of secret service money devoted to a variety of objects connected with the political police . As Socialism became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring spies to give information regarding the doings of the disaffected ; and much of this money went for the purpose of supporting newspapers devoted to the principles of Bismarck . It would be grossly unfair to say that the press of Germany is corrupt , unless we refer to a corruption represented in the Engglish and American press as well . Every newspaper is primarily a money-making business and no great daily could long exist if it disregarded the interests of its advertisers or ceased to pay dividends to the shareholders . The editor of a newspaper with us is nominally a free man , but practically he has no more freedom than a member of Congress or a clergyman . He represents a certain line of thought on certain subjects , and woe to the editor who hopes to keep in his place without the sympathy of his proprietor ! The newspapers of Germany stand on a far higher level than those of France , for a variety of reasons . In Paris I once heard the ambassador of a great power state deliberately that he could print any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid their regular rates . The statement was so astounding that I asked him seriously whether he meant what he said , whereupon he repeated this damning proposition ; in other words he accused Parisian journalists of treating their editorial columns as we treat those reserved for advertisements , and at the same time practicing a deception upon their readers . The German , as a rule , is a reading and thinking man ; curious in matters of general information and so intelligent that he is not readily imposed upon by his newspaper . If the German government gave perfect freedom to the press and exercised no favoritism toward the papers supporting different parties , it is possible that the Germans would furnish us with the best newspapers of the world ; for even to-day a first-class Berlin paper gives its readers as good articles upon literature , art , science , travel , and human progress generally , as any paper of London or New York , but they stop short of perfection because of the political helplessness to which they are condemned by their own government . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must have two things besides capital ; we must get news and get advertising . In a free country the state knows no distinction of parties , and news of public interest is accessible to all papers in proportion as their editors are enterprising and intelligent . Jn Germany it is otherwise . I do not know the exact number of Ge*'mans directly or indirectly supported by the state , for the statistics on this subject have never yet been published ; but a very able politician told me once that I might regard every other voter in Germany as a dependent upon government . In Germany it is the duty of officials to vote in favor of government measures , and in every other respect they are expected to loyally sustain the powers that support them . The editor therefore who wishes to establish a newspaper must be bold indeed if he attempt to make a fortune out of his enterprise while advocating a cause distasteful to the government . Every official will , of course , boycott him and he will be unable to secure advertisements from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall that all the railways of the state ; all the eatinghouses and drinking-places connected with this system , are indirectly government institutions ; that the telegraph and express service are managed by the state ; and that the contracts for the army make up a large part of the country 's industry , we can readily appreciate the fact that the state has a means of influencing the advertising columns , if not the editorial columns , of many newspapers . But in the matter of securing news , the position of a German editor is more delicate still . Should he apply to the Foreign Office , or to*any other department of the government for an interview with any official , the first question raised is as to the political views encouraged by his paper . Should these views be opposed to those of the officials , our editor will be shown the door with the remark that disloyal papers need not expect assistance from the government which they are seeking to overturn . That editor , should he be so innocent as to have made these two efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project of making an independent newspaper , or else limit himself to the discussion of literary and musical compositions . It is easy to see that a government with a large fund of money notoriously reserved for press purposes , and reserving to itself // the power of furnishing news only to subservient papers-* -- that such a government is in a position to create in its service a servUe , if not a corrupt , body of newspaper men . This is putting the case very strongly , and standing alone this proposition might strike the German reader as a gross misrepresentation of facts , yet no one more than myself appreciates the excellent work dose in journalism by many German newspapers even today . I need only point to the Nation and the Vossische as examples of independent journals fighting persistently for constitutional freedom , and at the same time representing a very respectable minority of their countrymen ; but examples of this kind are too rare and brilliant to affect our general proposition , and the melancholy fact remains that in Germany it is far from complimentary to describe one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press there must be attached to every newspaper some editor engaged with the distinct understanding that he may be called upon at short notice for the purpose of being imprisoned for alleged treasonable utterances in the paper . We do not know what treason is in American law , and no Englishman regards the word as anything but a dead letter in his own . We punish a man , not for his thoughts or for his language , but simply because of an overt act leading directly to a breach of the peace ; for instance , Guiteau was hung , not because he imperilled the head of the state , but because he murdered a private citizen ; but Bismarck has more than once , during his official career , arrested eminent members of Parliament for addressing their constituents in language out of harmony with government propositions . To be sure , Bismarck has been six years out of office , but it is his machinery which still moves the great engine of the German State . I have said this much about the nature of the German press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a government to use it as part of its own machinery ; and I have said quite enough , I am sure , to show that this press must attract to itself men ready to sell their opinions on any side of a question . Now as to the attitude of the German press towards the United States , it is , after all , little more than asking what is the attitude of German military , official and aristocratic classes towards our Republic . The governing class of Germany lives principally by two sources of income ; the one a government // salary ; the other the rent which they draw as landlords . As dependents upon government and as an important part of an absolute monarchy thby must look with profound distrust ; upon a community of *O , OOO , OOO of English-speaking people governing themselves without the intervention of a divinely-anointed War Lord . The American experiment in self-government is a monstrous anomaly and impious scandal to the average German squire . That it will succeed he does not for a moment believe and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreditable items which abound in the local German papers on the subject of our divorce cases , our lynchings , our strikes , and above all our political dishonesty . The German newspapers make no distinction between citizens of the United States and those of any other part of the Great Western Continent . The American in Germany seeking for news of his country looks under the head-line " America , " and there finds items from Brazil , Costa Rica , Chicago , Montreal or Mexico , all put together as though they were near neighbors under the same political head . And , indeed , the German squire or Yunker firmly believes that the United States persists as a Republic , not in spite of corruption , but because of it . He thinks that the President and his cabinet are a species of oligarchy holding power through bribery or intimidation , or both , much after the manner of some little South American republics we might name . He believes that Americans are chronically shrewd and dishonest ; that ; American women are hopelessly emancipated ; that society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a proletariate of adventurers . Jt rec*uires but a casual reading of German papers , notably the provincial ones , to justify all that I have said , but it requires some knowledge of German official machinery to see why it is that these papers take so much paine to paint America and Americans in such unlovely colors . It is bad enough that we should in German eyes represent principles of government hostile to those of an empire , but in the eyes of a Prussian landlord we commit daily sins more grievous still . We are shipping to Germany bread stuffs , and even meat , to an enormous extent , all of which compete with the wheat and meat grown by loyal Germans . It is bad enough in their eyes that Russia and Hungary , both of them monarchical countries , should compete with the monarchical pigs and cereals of // the Fatherland , but it is nothing less than sacrilege that the profits of Prussian landlords should be diminished by importation from such a republic as ours . The German squire would gladly enforce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that the people might be forced to pay higher prices for bread , but , fortunately for other countries , there is in Germany a large and intelligent industrial class , who see good reason why they should have cheap food , even if the landlord must receive smaller rents . Then again Germany can not forgive our country for attracting every year a large number of young men who are fit for military service . She says , and with some show of justice : " We have given these young men their education at the expense of the state , and now , when they are in position to pay back to the Fatherland the debt they owe , they sail away to a new country and become Americans . " The German is unwilling to believe that his fellow-countrymen emigrate to America because they prefer American institutions to those of their own country ; on the contrary he is firmly persuaded that we , in some underhand manner , entice good Germans away by means of heavy bounties or fraudulent representations made by government agents . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American that they are ready to believe anything about our country , so long as it is not complimentary . For instance , I have not only seen it taken for granted in print , but even heard it stated in conversation by educated Germans , who certainly meant no disrespect to me , that our War of Independence , as well as the Civil War , were won because we had in our ranks so large a number of Germans , or because our men were drilled and commanded by Germans . These absurd propositions are made in such good faith that it is impossible to dispute the matter with a German for fear of wounding his national pride . To him there was but one hero in the war ot 1*76 , namely Steuben ; and as for the war of 1860 , of course the hero was Franz Siegel . In January of this year the State of New York sent me to Berlin for the purpose of presenting its ultimatum to the Prussian Government in the matter of its behavior toward our principal life insurance companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were derived not merely from the Governor of New York , but his authority was further fortified // by the endorsemen of the State Department at Washington , and through it by the American Embassy in Berlin , The case was very simple and my little diplomatic mission still more so . Prussia had felt the competition of our life insurance cornpauies for the reason that we , in America , being able to invest our funds at a higher rate of interest than Prussians , were consequently able to offer those who assured in Germany a higher advantage than could be offered by their own companies who had not the same advantages in the way of investments . But Prussia did not wish to put herself on record as violently excluding American companies , so instead of that she framed a series of police regulations , so artfully drawn that the most important of the American companies found it wiser to withdraw than to attempt to obey an edict which was obviously intended to ruin their Prussian business . I had no other care iu this matter than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisted in treating our insurance companies in this ungenerous manner , the State of New York would be compelled to retaliate . As it had been my good fortune to meet personally in previous years nearly every member of the German or Prussian government , I withheld the retaliatory document until I had had an informal personal talk o* the subject with each of them , for I had left New York in the firm belief that the ungenerous Prussian edict would be revoked upon a clearer understanding of the case . Nearly every minister of the government gave me fair words , but in one notable case I discovered that the official opinion in regard to our two or three leading life insuvance companies was that they were little better than swindling concerns , and no protestations that I could make was capable of shaking this opinion . But the answer to my proposition came through the German press before the officials had made known their answer . There appeared in one German paper after another a series of paragraphs and articles evidently inspired by government , all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance department of the State of New York in particular . The hue and cry was taken up by all the official , semi-official , and otherwise dependent press , and the statement was boldly made throughout the country that the government was only protecting Germans from the swindling efforts of insecure American insurance companies . The attack // upon America , of course , harmonized with the Bismarckian idea of state protection to native industries , and the press paid no attention to the few journalistic efforts made by one or two independent papers to stem this torrent of abuse let loose by government . Perhaps this dislike of the government for things American finds nourishment in the fact that a large number of German subjects , who have gone to America and made some money , return to their native land with a great deal of swagger , and pretend to be American citizens , though they can barely speak English , and obviously use the American name for the sake of evading taxation . These white-washed citizens are usually not very creditable to either country , and unfortunately give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But let us not think that we are alone the target of German press malevolence . That we are now singled out for particular attention proves only that we have to-day , in the eyes of the German government , more importance than we had when her attacks were only occasional and sporadic . About six years ago Russia was the object of Germany 's particular press attacks , because the Czar had built many fortifications on his western frontier , and had placed nearly the whole of his standing army in positions that meant nothing if not a menace towards the West . But Prince Hohenlohe , the present Chancellor of the Empire , has many reasons for desiring to retain the *favor of the Czar 's government , and consequently the German press has ceased to find much occupation in that quarter . It is England that latterly has received the greatest amount of German abuse , for reasons very vague , indeed , about as vague as those influencing the abuse of America . The German government to-day , not satisfied with having the strongest army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She possesses already one million square miles of feverish soil , situated mostly where no white man cares to live ; indeed , on this one million of square miles there are not to-day so many Germans as would fit into one battalion of their army . Mr. Chamberlain has placed this number as low as TOO , although in their own White Book on the subject I added up over 900 . Now , here again Germans find reason for abusing England , because she draws away from Germany hundreds and thousands of German subjects who might have gone // to a German colony , they think , had they not preferred to go to an English one . In this respect England resembles the United States , in that she offers to settlers cheap land and the sweets of constitutional liberty . Germany , however , governs her colonies as she would a barrack yard , or a Polish province , with the result , that in South Africa at least , not even the Boers can be induced to settle under the German flag , much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Returning recently from a trip through the rPrar*svaal and the Cape Colony , I could not but he struck wherever I went in South Africa by meeting most excellent German settlers , growing rich under a foreign flag , enjoying at least under British a*ule all the liberty they could possibly desire , but at the same time finding nothing but abusive epithets to apply to England and Englishmen . Naturally I had frequent occasion to ask them why hey did not move into German West Africa or German East Africa , where they would be free from the presence of Englishmen ; but that idea , to them , was so preposterous that they always treated it as a joke . To Germans at home it is most irritating that England should offer better inducementsto colonists than does their own government , for , in parenthesis , let us note that the German colonies are a heavy tax upon Germany , while English colonies are self-supporting , to say the least . Were it not for this artificially stimulated zeal for German colonies , it would be impossible to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad over tropical possessions which they have held now for twelve years , which are a perpetual drain on the mother country , and which afford occupation to a mere handful of Germans who would probably be materially more prosperous if the English flag were substituted for the German . The United States , without being a colonial power , has of late emphasized the Monroe doctrine in a manner irritating to the German government . That government is seeking to enlarge its navy , and a navy , as we know , must have coaling stations . That the United States should spread out its hand over the whole of Central America , the West Indies , and South America is well enough , in so far as it protects France and England in their West Indian and South American possessions , but is cold comfort to Germany , which would very much like to have something to say in those waters . It should not surprise us if we // 21 read some morning the news that the German flag had been hoisted on St. Thomas or Cura9oa as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas to us some thirty years ago , but our Congress declined to ratify the bargain . Why should not Germany make the purchase ? and what if she came to an understanding with Holland in regard to some of her West udian harbors ? We must not suppose that the German government is seeking to spend more money upon its fleet merely for the pleasure of seeing a large number of warships together in Kiel . Her navy can be of little use in an European war as compared with her excellent army , but Germany can do nothing outside of her borders without ships-of-war , and that she is building up her navy can only mean that she intends to participate actively in events beyond the seas . In this last summer she sent her blue-jackets ashore at Zanzibar , and took away under her protection the rebellious Sultan of that country , in spite of English protest . By that act she gave notice to all Mohammedans that Englishmen in that part of the world were of less consequence than Germans . In January of 1896 a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march them into the Transvaal to protect the Boers against an alleged act of war on the part of England . The German Emperor , at the same time , let loose a dispatch which was by the Boers interpreted to mean that , in case of need , they might count upon German assistance against England . The Boers are illiterate ranchmen for the most part , and know of the outside world no more than the Mohammedans of Zanzibar . At Pretoria , therefore , the harm done by the Emperor 's dispatch consisted in making the Transvaal government to feel that with their handful of cattledrivers they could cheerfully face all the troops that England might bring against them ; and with this confidence , based upon German action , they have gone to great extremes in expressing officially their contempt for English sovereignty . Of course in regard to both these episodes , the German press almost entirely kept up a steady fire of abusive articles against English selfishness and tyranny quite as violent as any attack ever made upon the United States . We have to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown a disposition to treat England in a manner creditable to civilized people . We have both officially and in popular // resolutions endorsed the principle that war between England and the United States would be worse than a crime-it would be a monumental blunder . Europe , with its standing armies , chuckled with delight when it seemed possible that England and our country would go to war over Venezuela , for the happiest dream of a Frenchman or a German is the breaking up of the British Empire and a division of spoils amongst the other great Powers , much as Poland was divided a hundred years ago . But that England and America should come out of this quarrel , not only without threats of war , but with an apparent understanding that each regarded such a proceeding as stupid , is a source of deep regret , particularly in the German Cabinet . For there is a converse to the above proposition , namely , that in case America or England be engaged in war with some third Power , not only will neither attack the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of benevolent neutrality . It is a well-known principle of diplomacy that the art of weakening your opponent is to isolate him first , and then crush him . The jubilation of France springs from the feeling that she has now emerged from this lonesome state , and that , together with Russia , she is more powerful than the members of the Triple Alliance . With an understanding between England and the United States , no possible combination of European powers can hope with any success to give more than a momentary check to the great onward sweep of the English-speaking , self-governing race . The German press is only the faithful exponent of the German government in looking malevolently upon the United States while such combinations as these are possible or even mooted on either side of the Atlantic . So long as we were merely an agglomeration of industrial communities without any apparent desire to take an interest in the affairs of the rest of our race , Germany could afford to regard us with no more contempt than she expended upon the Boers of South Africa prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new navy and have insisted upon being heard , not merely in regard to South America but even at the gates of Constantinople , we have placed ourselves in a position to invite jealousy as well as dislike . Our last election made a more profound impression upon Europeans than any event in our history since the separation from England . For the first time German newspapers even treated American politics as a matter // 23 directly affecting their pockets . So eminent an economist and statesman as Dr. Theodore Barth travelled the United States during the whole of the Presidential canvass and wrote home to his paper , Die Nation , a series of discriminating articles on the situation . It was felt in Europe generally , and in England particularly , that government by the people was on trial and that if dishonest coinage should triumph the meaning was clear that the United States , as a popular government , was a failure . Often before has popular government in America been on trial in particular cities , and in individual States , but never has a great national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world at large as whether the national credit and the integrity of the Snpreme Court should be maintained . Once more has the cause of popular government gained the victory , and we need not close our eyes to the fact that such a victory means cheer to the hearts of millions on the continent of Europe who looked to the United States for a vindication of democratic principles . Had Bryan been elected every semi-official newspaper in Germany would have rejoiced with a vigor only second to that which they would have experienced had they heard the news that Canada *r Australia had become German colonies . In conclusion let me emphasize , particularly for the benefit of such Germans as may see these lines , that I quite appreciate the distinction between the people of Germany and the government of Germany , but that like the expressions " Prussia " and " Germany " they may often , for purposes of brevity , be confounded.
