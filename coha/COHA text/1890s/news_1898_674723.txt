txt The details of the arrangement Under which the long strike and lock-out of the English " engineers " has been ended show that a very serious change has taken place in the position of trades unions in that country . The real question at issue from the start was whether employers could make bargains with their own workmen or must make them with the local trade union to which the men belonged or the " Amalgamated Society . " All other matters were really of very little consequence compared to this . This question has been settled practically in favor of the employers . These are the points covering that principle on which the employers stood firm and to which the men have , in fact , though not formally and in detail , agreed by returning to work : " Every workman shall be free to belong to a trade union or not , as he may think fit . Every employer shall be free to employ any man , whether he belong to a trade union or not . Every workman shall undertake to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belong to a trade union or not . " As to piece work : " The right to work piece work . , * * * shall be extended to all members of the federation ( of employers ) and to all their workmen . The prices paid for piece work shall be fixed by mutual arrangement between the employer and the workman who is to perform the work . " As to overtime , after laying down a general basis , or guide : " No alteration , restriction , or extension of this basis shall be made except by mutual agreement between the employer and the individual workman concerned . " Again : " Every workman shall be paid according to his ability , and no employer shall be restricted in employing any workman at any rate of wages mutually satisfactory . " Finally come the two crucial points : " There shall be no limitation to the number of apprentices , " and the following as to the regulation of machinery : " The machine tools are the property of the employers , and they are responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore will continue to exercise their discretion to appoint the men they consider suitable to work them and determine the conditions under which such machine tools shall be worked . The employers consider it their duty to encourage ability wherever they find it , and shall have the right to select , train , and employ those Whom they consider best adapted to the various operations carried on in their workshops , and will pay them according to their ability as workmen . " By going to work under these terms the men practically abandon several points which they have heretofore more and more firmly insisted could not be abandoned . These are : The right to shut out non-union men ; the right to fix the minimum wage ; the right to limit the number of apprentices , and the right to regulate the number of men and their wages employed in piece work or upon machines . All these points they thought they must insist on in order to get work for the greatest number of men on the best terms . This has been their one aim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience and fidelity in the pursuit of it , fighting every foot of the ground and undergoing great sacrifices to retain what they have won . Thanks to the splendid trade of England and its easy supremacy over any and all ceMpetitors up to a recent date , the workmen have won much . The margin of gain for the employer has been large enough to- make it better for him to yield . one demand after another than to suspend production . - But now the situation is changed . It has , come to be a question not of taking less profits , but of retaining trade . This for the first time has driven the employers to unite . Notht. ing less could have brought them together , for while trade is good they are rivals , each looking out for himself . United , they have been too strong for the men . But it does not follow that the latter will really suffer . On the contrary , if trade can be regained and ' extended there will be more work for more men  --  which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , If trade has reached its highest point , the men will get under the new system more than they would under the old , with reduced trade which was bound to follow .
