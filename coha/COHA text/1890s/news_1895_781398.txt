Mrs. Cooper , wife of Albert Cooper , the engineer of the bridge work , was sitting on a ledge of rock watching the men work , when the timbers began to crack , and J. C.

Newsan , formerly a magistrate on the island of Trinidad , was arrested in Brooklyn yesterday as a fugitive from justice . The arrest was made on a warrant sworn out by the British Consul to this city , In which , on information and belief , it is charged that in 1892 Newsan committed forgeries to a large amount , and that he fled from the island to escape arrest . Newsan was taken before United States Commissioner Shields in the Federal Building in this city , and at the request of Charles Fox , counsel for the British Consulate , he was held for a hearing to-morrow .

It was found in 1892 that he was converting a great deal of his possessions into cash , and an investigation wasjust about to be put on foot when he suddenly disappeared . The investigation then showed that Newsan had been committing many forgeries , and that by this means he swindled many people out of something like $250,000 . It was found that the fugitive had gone to South America , and the British Government had him followed there for two years until all trace of him was lost . Not long ago it was ascertained that Newsan 's wife , whom lie had left in Trinidad , was corresponding with her husband in New-York . The Government then started to get the fugitive again , and this effort led to rather ludicrous results . Chief of Police Casey came on from Trinidad to look for Newsen . He searched about for some time in vain . His search led him into the " Tenderloin " one evening , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Court . His condition was such that he could not give an account of himself , and he was committed to Blackwell 's Island for thirty days . Soon afterward he was released , matters having been explained , and he returned to Trinidad . The case was then given to detectives , and Newson was traced to 525 Evergreen Avenue , Brooklyln . When arrested , he did not appear to have benefited by his alleged forgeries . He has been working , it is said , for the John Hancock Life Insurance Company in Brooklyn .
