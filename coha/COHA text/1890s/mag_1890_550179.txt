BROTHER FILIPPO . A STORY IN Two I*AaTs . By George P. Baker , 7r . CHAPTER IV . TWO INTERVIEWS . " A deep absorbing interest . . has got as t were a gripe Upon my very life as strange as new . " - STORY . THE peace and the joy which had come to Brother Filippo with the discovery of the head of Jupiter did not leave him during the services of the evening . As soon as he could he went to his cell . There , at first , he could think of nothing but the head and its beauties . Later , the thoughts of his old home began to come back to him with a new force , for now at last the monk understood the fancies which had troubled him . Until be left Florence his life had been wholly artistic ; the beautiful had been the essence of whatever he heard , saw , or did from ( lay to day . Then , suddenly , he had broken from this life and had entered the Church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings , for the busy , outdoor life had occupied him fully . At San Ser polo , the novelty of his position , the routine of his life as a novice , had at first completely filled his mind ; only as he had become really aware of the bare , cold buildings , of the chilling character of everything around him , had he felt his artistic instincts struggling within him . It was their effort to regain their old power which had brought him the pain and the misery of the last month . Brother Filippo saw , now , how useless his struggle had been from the beginning . To-night , therefore , he welcomed gladly the thoughts which but a few hours before had puzzled and tried him deeply . He gloried again in the beauties of the statues and the pictures which he had known in Florence . Let the thoughts of the monk stray as they might , however , they always came back to the head of Jupiter . He felt that he must learn the history of this piece of marble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Filippo knew the Prior would not sympathize with his interest , would not like to have his attention called away from his duties to answer what would seem to him but idle questions . // Whom could he ask then ? Brother Filippo could at first think of no one among the grave , self-renunciatory monks ; suddenly he remembered old Brother Christoforo , the librarian . Yes , this old monk would help him . Planning to speak to Brother Christoforo in the morning , the young man fell asleep . No thought that to become deeply interested in what would be to many men but a piece of stained marble might be wrong had come to him . His peculiar early training still had too powerful an influence over him ; the spirit of the artist was too strong within him . When Brother Filippo decided to ask Brother Christoforo about the statue he chose well , for the old monk was beloved by all his brethren . On any bright afternoon his bent , slight figure might be seen walking up and down the ambulatory in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so from the thinness and the pallor of his face , and in repose his countenance would have been grim , had it not been for the kindly flash of the deepbrown eyes . His greeting was a thing which his brother monks cherished , for when he spoke his whole face was lighted with a winning , gentle grace . It was this smile which had first won the confidence of Brother Filippo . The old monk had charge of him as a novice , and they had spent many hours together in the scriptorium ; so he knew Brother Christoforo well . As Brother Filippo had spoken with the monk , naturally talkative , and in his declining years even a little garrulous , he had found that , like many a gentle spirit , Brother Christoforo was intensely bigoted . This was , perhaps , the reason why the genial , kindly soul had held his place for many years among his silent , cold brothers . As the monks came out from prime , Brother Filippo drew the old monk aside saying : - " Brother Christoforo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . Can you give me time ? " Pleased with the confidence in him shown by the young man , the monk readily consented . They went silently up into the scriptorium , which was dark except for the faint rays of the early morning light coming through the eastern window . Brother Filippo was wondering how he should put his question ; the old monk was waiting for the youth to speak . The more Brother Filippo pondered , the less he knew how to lead up to the matter he wished to talk about . At last he said bluntly - " Brother Christoforo , last night I found the head of a statue in the loft of the stable . Do you know anything about it ? " Brother Christoforo looked puzzled , for he had expected the confession of some little trouble , or a question about some manuscript . Before he could answer the question , Brother Filippo , relieved that he had put the momentous question , and warmed by grateful memories of his joy of the night before , broke into a glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the head , and even began to talk a little wildly , comparing the beauty of the statue to the work of Praxiteles and Pheidias . Suddenly he caught sight of the halfpuzzled , half-amazed face of the old monk . Evidently the young man had gone far beyond him . Chilled , Brother Filippo broke off in the middle of a sentence , saying almost sharply : - Brother , do you know anything about this head ? " Brother Christoforo looked relieved . Now , indeed , he knew what the young monk was talking about . Nearly all that had gone before had been to him but an amazing jumble of unknown names and epithets . So he said : - " Yes , Brother Filippo , I know something about it , and I wonder at your warmth . Why , it is but an ugly piece of marble cut by some poor Pagan - God rest his soul . Brother Pietro found it years ago - ten , perhaps . He was a good man , Brother Filippo ; he worked hardest of all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , he was better than most of us . " The old monk would have wandered on still more had not an impatient movement of Brother Filippo recalled him to himself . " Brother , " he said , " be patient , an old man must have his memories . Well , Brother Pietro found it one day when he was digging upon the point in the Tiber . I do n't know why he brought it home , - he was too wise and good to care for heathen relics ; and he knew that Father Beppi thinks such things vain and dangerous to the souls of men . Ah , it makes my heart ache to think how these men who lived long ago in the days when our blessed Church was young wasted their time amid such trumperies // as this statue . They thought not of their souls , but filled the world with palaces , and temples to the gods that sprang from their own brains . But they are all gone , with their idols and their fineries . God in his anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idols could stay undiscovered ; better still if they could all be destroyed . " Here the old monk glanced up at Brother Filippo . The face of the youth was glowing with an expression that Brother Christoforo mistook for hearty approval of his sentiments . So he went on - " I but repeat the words of Father Beppi when Brother Pietro brought the head home . Brother Pietro saw his sin , and prayed many days for forgiveness . Father Beppi was going to have the marble broken up , but we found it good for a horse-block , and so we used it for that . I do n't see how it got into the loft . Yes , I remember . Father Beppi found Father Pietro looking at it again one day , and told him to put it out of sight . Brother Pietro must have placed it in the stable . Were he alive he could tell you all about the stone , but he died - God rest his souleight years ago now . It was strange that such a thing pleased so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the head . Beware of it ! All such things are but inventions of the Devil to take our thoughts from higher things . Remember all the evil that came upon those who made such idols , and avoid them . They are idolatrous , ugly , wicked . " After a moment the old monk added with sudden sternness : " Brother Filippo , if I thought you were fascinated by this piece of marble , I should feel that I must speak to Father Beppi . He would have it broken up ; and that would be as well , for it has done nothing but harm , and never can do anything else . " At this point , as Brother Christoforo saw the look of horror dawning upon the face of his young friend , he relented , and said more gently : - " But I am too severe . Of course , yours was only an idle curiosity . It was natural , too , for you are young and ardent yet . Fear not ; I will say nothing to Father Beppi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , for good and blessed as he is , it would seem sinful to him to waste a thought on such an idol . You will forget all about it , now that you know its wretched history . " Here the monk arose . " I must go now : I am wanted in the refectory . " Nodding and smiling , Brother Christoforo disappeared . Brother Filippo did not attempt to detain him , but murmured a low " I thank you " as the old monk passed by him . For a moment the young man stood hesitating , his face troubled and clouded , a multitude of thoughts struggling in his mind . Suddenly , as if moved by some overpowering impulse , he passed hastily out of the scriptorium to the cloister below . Quickly , yet absent-mindedly , he went straight to the stable . A glance showed him that there was no one about it . Up he went to the corner of the loft where the head was concealed . Uncovering it , he dragged it to the window . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , and to consider them calmly . As he sat before the head , the words of Brother Christoforo came back to him one by one . They still stung him as he thought of them . What fearful bigotry , what narrowness , what ignorance the old monk had shown ! These old Romans were like friends to Brother Filippo . To hear them slandered angered him . Brother Christoforo had no appreciation of their knowledge , their virtue , or their greatness . They were to him but Pagans . Yes , Pagans : Brother Filippo granted that ; but in his disgust and his bitterness , he wondered whether many of them were not better than Christians whom he had seen in Florence . Then , too , the monk had dared to call the divine masterpieces of ancient art trumperies . I-low could any man be so devoid of all feeling for the beautiful ? Could not men see that even a fragment like this was better than any piece of sculpture of their own day ? As Brother Filippo pondered , the remembrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An " invention of the Devil , " this glorious piece of sculpture ! All the sense of the beautiful in the young monk rose up in passionate denial . Here , too , came a recollection that made his heart give a great throb of fear , - the threat to tell Father Beppi of the finding of the statue . That could mean but one thing , the destruction of the head . As Brother Filippo thought of this possibility , he felt that he could do anything rather than let it happen . At this point in bie* // musings he heard a footstep below . It startled him , and made him realize how exposed to discovery the head was . His mind filled with a vague uneasiness , he arose and quietly concealed the piece of marble in its corner . As he went to the fields , his thoughts recurred constantly to Brother Christoforo 's icrnorance of art and his utter lack of sym-b pathy for the past and its glories . His uneasiness about the safety of the head steadily increased too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . Brother Filippo knew what that meant . Absorbed in thought , the monk did not notice where he was going . Awaking suddenly from his dreaming , he found himself at the entrance to a grove , and as he looked ahout him , it flashed upon him that on the farther side of the trees lay the point of which Brother Christoforo had spoken . Brother Filippo hurried on into the field , which was almost triangular in shape . The view from it up and down the valley was superb . The soil , however , was poor . The monks had made but one slight , vain attempt to cultivate the place ; and the little piece where Brother Pietro had worked was the only part of the field that had been touched . Brother Filippo sat down and looked long at the scene . In imagination he saw before him the old Roman villa which he felt must once have been in the field . He knew exactly how it must have looked as it stood out , white and shining , against the background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpses of the distant Apennines must have been wonderfully beautiful . Somewhere in this court , too , the statue must have stood . For a long time Brother Filippo sat weaving charming fancies , but gradually his thoughts came back to the present . Rising , he went carefully over the field , prodding here and there with his staff . Of course he found nothing , but it seemed to him that there were elevations and depressions in the ground which could be explained only by the former presence of the villa . Quickly the hours went by . Once or twice he tried to read ; but he always fell to dreaming again , or rose to wander restlessly about the field . The services for the hours he said with little realization of their meaning . As the afternoon drew on , the vague uneasiness about the head which he had had in the morning came upon him again . He felt more and more that he must do something to save it from destruction . As yet he had no definite plans ; he knew only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it supplied him with something which he had long lacked . However , by the hour for going home a well-defined plan filled his thoughts . As he turned it over in his mind on the way to the monastery , it grew stronger and clearer in its details . When he had put his flock into the stable , he took a firmmeshed grain-bag and went up into the loft . He half-filled the hag with hay ; then with difficulty he lifted the great head and put it into the sack . Placing more hay on top of the marble , he concealed the bundle in the dark corner . When compline was over , Brother Filippo went to his cell . Here he became very uneasy , fearing for the success of his plan . Filled with dread he fell upon his knees before his crucifix and prayed for aid in his undertaking . After a long time he arose and paced his cell . He listened for every sound which echoed through the cloister . Now there was a distant footfall , now the cry of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noises came less and less frequently , till at last he had not heard a sound for a half-hcur . Every nerve alert , Brother Filippo went to the door and listened . There was no noise in the monastery . Hurrying back , he sank for a moment before the crucifix ; then he went out quietly into the ambulatory . It was a cloudy , moonlit night : light and darkness alternated constantly . When Brother Filippo reached the outer court , the walls of the stable showed clear and bright in the moonlight . Hurrying in between the rows of sleeping cattle , he went up to the corner in the loft . As he seized the bag , it rattled against something upon the floor , and the monk turned cold With terror at the sound . It seemed to him that it echoed and re-echoed through the monastery . Then , ashamed of his sudden fear , he stooped and groped on the floor . His hand touched something hard and flat . He raised it to the light and saw his breviary , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag , and swung it to his shoulder . It was very heavy ; Brother Filippo fairly staggered under the load . As he came down into the court-yard , it was dark again , - terribly // dark it . seemed to the young monk as he stumbled on under his heavy burden . Every moment he feared that he should fall . Reaching the passage by the refectory , he turned in , when suddenly he heard a footstep coming behind him . For an instant his courage almost gave out ; then he swung the bag from his shoulder into a dark niche near by and walked slowly on . Nearer came the step , and then the deep , stern voice of Father Beppi said firmly , - " Who is there ? " " Father , it is I , Brother Filippo . I have been to the stable . " " Why at this hour , Brother ? " The voice showed the deep displeasure which Brother Filippo knew was flashing from the eyes of the Prior . " I wanted something , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you left anything there ? " " Yes , Father , my breviary . " There was a moment 's pause , and then the Prior came nearer , saying more sternly - " Brother Filippo , I am astonished . Can it be that you do not yet know your breviary , as you certainly do not yet know your duties ? You have sinned , to leave your cell without permission at this hour . This time I will not punish you , but remember that this is a solemn warning . Do wrong again and you must answer for it in the chapter-house . Now go to your cell and pray for forgiveness . ' ' Brother Filippo bowed his head in silence and went toward the cloister ; but he moved on only until he heard the footsteps of the Prior die away in the distance . Then he ran back quickly to the niche and again swung the precious bag upon his shoulder . Filled with fear , heedless where he stepped , he dashed on toward his cell . He reached it breathless . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was safe . CHAPTER V. FAILURE . " And surely this the hitterest of ill : - To feel the old aspirings fair and free , Become Plind motions of a powerless will . " - DonsoN . FOR a few moments after Brother Filippo sank upon his bed an intense joy that he had escaped detection filled his mind , but as he grew calmer he began to think over the past hour . He realized that he had broken flagrantly a law of the monastery ; worst of all , that he who his whole life long had made truth his ideal , had lied to Father Beppi . Filled with a crushing sense of his guilt , Brother Filippo sank at the foot of the crucifix . How he had fallen , he who had felt no- pity for his patron , who could not forgive the lie which Niccoli had acted ! Now he , a monk , had been lying to his superior , was a hypocrite . For the first time since he left Florence Brother Filippo thought of Niccoli forgivingly . With the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He realized as he never had before how much the scenes of his childhood meant to him . Perhaps , - perhaps , - he might have lived in Florence . But at this point came the crushing thought : " Here where all is sacred you can not withstand temptation what , then , could you have done in Florence ? " Filled with remorse and hopelessness , he knelt long in prayer , his heart upon his lips . Over and over he asked for help . Yes , he would put down his desires . But what desires ? For the first time Brother Filippo fairly owned to himself the purpose which lay half-formed in his mind . He would not try to find the rest of the statue . He would confess to the Prior , and give himself to a life of prayer and fasting . Suddenly a great burst of self-renunciatory feeling came upon him ; he would give up the head to Father Beppi . No , no , that was too much . If the marble must be destroyed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filippo went toward the head . As he drew near it , every line of its subtle beauty stood out clearly in the light from the window . It seemed to the monk that the head had never looked so majestic , so grand , as now . Hesitating he stood and gazed , his breast torn by the conflict between his religious scruples and his artistic longings . As he realized how impossible it was for him to give up the piece of marble , he turned with a moan and sank again before the crucifix . Prayer followed prayer ; he scarcely knew what he said . Suddenly he seemed to see before him the statue restored to its full glory . Now it faded away ; now it reappeared . It vanished , // - and Brother Filippo lost consciousness . When he came to himself he was lying upon the floor , between the crucifix and the head , the faint light from the little window shining in his eyes . As , worn and unrested by his heavy sleep , he gazed at the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he felt quieted , strengthened . He arose and half-mechanically made ready for matins . Afterwards it seemed to Brother Filippo that during this day temptation was put in his path . As he was coming out from prime , Father Beppi met him , saying - " Brother Filippo , you will leave your sheep to-day . You know the point in the Tiber ? I think you are strong enough now to do some spading in the field opposite . " Brother Filippo bowed , and went to get his spade from the monk in charge of the gardening tools . He saw plainly the struggle which lay before him . All day he must work alone where he could see the site of the Roman villa . With a spade in his hands he must not use it upon the point . It proved , indeed , to be a trying day . Though he worked furiously , his reveries came upon him with ever-increasing force . He seemed to have less strength than at any time since his illness , and he felt as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , that before the day was over he should be upon the point . The defeat came when , early in the afternoon , he had finished his day 's work . He went slowly toward the bridge below the point . Going home he must pass the grove . He knew that he ought not to go into it , yet he felt as if urged on by some all-powerful force . When Brother Filippo reached the trees , he hesitated a moment , and then with a sigh of self-abandonment passed in among them . Upon the point he examined the ground with a critical eye . One place which lay beyond that which had been cultivated seemed to him to be depressed strangely , and he struck his spade into it . For a half-hour he turned over the soil with quick , nervous strokes . He began to think that he had been wrong in his conjectures about the spot when his spade struck something that gave out a ringing sound . The monk was upon his knees in an instant , brushing away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbedded in the ground . Feverishly , breathlessly he worked , and at last drew the object forth . In the fast-waning light the monk saw that it must have been part of a vase of exquisite beauty . He fancied that he stood upon the spot where the costliest belongings of the villa had been kept , - not far away must lie the body of the statue . Brother Filippo felt new life spring up within him ; the blood went surging through his veins . He dug rapidly , getting more and more heated in his excitement . Once or twice he struck against pieces of pottery , and these added to his excitement and his obliviousness . It grew very dark ; but he was not aware of it . He forgot everything except the possibility of finding the missing piece of marble . Gradually a heavy mist began to arise from the river . Cold and damp , it spread over the lowlands and came up over the field , shrouding everything in a soft , silvery haze . It seemed to Brotl'ier Filippo , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . Suddenly all his life , all his excitement , left him . Cold and shivering , he realized that it was long after the hour for going home ; worse , that again he deserved the censure of the prior . Afterwards he could remember scarcely anything of the journey home except the knocking at the gate , the surprise of the monk who opened it , and the incredulous look of the Prior , who met him just inside . He recalled one thing else , too , - that devoid of all self-control he had stood before his superior like one awaiting his doom . The face of the prior had an unpitying look as he said , - " Brother Filippo , come to the chapterhouse to-morrow morning after prime . " The monk could never remember without pain the night that followed . Distressing , confused thoughts pressed upon him from all sides . He felt , too , as if he should burn up , for the chilliness had left him . In agony of mind and body he lay upon his bed till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , heavy sleep . He awoke free from fever , but weak . With difficulty he made ready for matins , even now unable to think clearly . All that must happen in the chapter-house seemed something which affected some one else rather than himself . This feeling did not leave him till he entered the bare , cold // hall ; then , as he stood before the Prior and saw the rows of monks seated upon each side , an abused , hunted feeling took possession of him . Every nerve became alert ; he felt as if he could fight to the death . Suddenly he thought of Brother Christoforo . If he was present all the facts about the head must be made clear . As Brother Filippo looked about him anxiously , he heard two monks whispering together . One was just saying : - " T is sad about Brother Christoforo . He is very weak lately . He wished to come to-day , but Father Beppi would not allow it . " Brother Filippo gave a great sigh of relief . Let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them about the head . The rising of Father Beppi interrupted the thoughts of the monk . The Prior began : - " Brothers , I have called you together that you may reprimand with me our erring brother . Night before last I found him in the cloister out of hours . He had been to the stable for a breviary which he bad left there . I censured him for his wilful conduct , and tried to show him his sinfulness toward our Order and toward God , but in spite of my words , yesterday he again flagrantly broke one of our laws : he rernained outside the monastery till long after vespers . " The stern monks looked amazed at this disregard for the laws of the monastery . Father Beppi now turned to the young monk , saying , - " Brother , why were you late ? Have you any excuse to offer ? " Brother Filippo hesitated a moment , and then said slowly : - " Father , after I finished my work , I went over to the point in the Tiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some traces of the past . In my interest I forgot everything but these relics . For this reason I was late . " " What did you find upon the point ? " asked the Prior . " A piece of a broken vase , Father , " answered Brother Filippo . " Why did you go to the point ? " " Because once when I was there I fancied that a Roman villa had stood upon the spot , and I wished to see if there were still any traces of it . " Incredulity was upon the faces of the monks . Could any one be so foolish as this young man ? Forget his vespers to dream about the days of the Pagans ! Such a one deserved no pity . Father Beppi eyed Brother Filippo keenly for a moment , and then said , - " Brother , do you swear that what you have said is true ? " The young monk met the gaze of the prior firmly and said : " Yes . " The look was too honest to be doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatiently : - " Brother Filippo twice you have sinned against your Order and your God . Two nights ago you broke the rules of the monastery . Yesterday you neglected your duties to dream of Pagans and of days abominable in the sight of God . Sin once more and you will be in danger of the severest punishment . To-day , go work in the field again . It is best that you should fight against the sin where it most tempts you . Come to me to-night able to say before your God that yon have not trifled with these relics . Pray God to help you , as we shall pray to him for you . " As the Prior finished , a low , chorus-like " Amen " went up from the rows of standing monks ; then they filed slowly from the room . As the last monk disappeared , Brother Filippo sank on his knees with a low cry of pain . The baffled feeling had left him ; again he felt like a man struggling in heavy bonds . He could not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the statue must be . He should fail again . 0 God , he was stained forever with sin , he who had tried so hard to live the ideal life ! Why was it , why , that everything seemed wrong ? Aroused by the sound of a step in the ambulatory , he drew himself up wearily and went for his tools . Once or twice he passed a brother monk , but he avoided the stern gaze always turned upon him . He felt like a criminal , and yet the impression grew ever stronger with him that he was not really responsible , that some great power which he could not withstand was forcing him on . The day in the field was one of greater pain than any he had known . As he worked bard , he wrestled with his longings , and the prayers which he said as terce , sext , and none went by gave him no comfort . Finally , when night came , he went far out of his way rather than pass by // the grove . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that it was but a temporary victory ; the struggle would be just as hard for him if he had to return to the field . As Brother Filippo came out from vespers , Father Beppi came to him saying , - " Well , Brother Filippo ? " " Father , I have prayed and worked ; I have not sinned again . " The stern face of the Prior softened a little , and he said : - " It is well . Brother Filippo , only by this mortification of ourselves can we rise to the holiness of our Master . Your sin is strange , yet I know that each man has his own temptations . You will come out of this ordeal better , purer . To-morrow I go to Arezzo . Till I return , I think it best that you should work in the field , for only by repeated struggle can you hope to overcome your sinfulness . Pray God for help , and sin not . " Brother Filippo turned and went to his cell silently . Going in , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the contest of this day must be repeated again and again , he knew what it meant , - failure and disgrace . The monk felt too full of despair to think ; he could scarcely pray . Rising after a time , he went to his bed , where he tossed to and fro until he fell into the heavy , unrestful sleep which had come to him during the past few nights . The next day Brother Filippo succeeded in conquering his thoughts till afternoon came ; then the spading brought him to the brink of the Tiber , opposite the point . As he glanced across the river he seemed again to see the old Roman villa . Now , however , it looked different in one way ,  - -  the great courtyard seemed to him to run far out upon the point , and he saw that he had dug too far to the east to find the body of the statue . At last he knew the very spot in which the figure of Jupiter must have stood . Leaning upon his spade he dreamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , the weaker grew his power of resistance . Let come what might , he must go over to the point . In a few minutes he was spading about the spot where he supposed the piece of marble must lie . He worked , as he always did when in this field , breathlessly , but nothing appeared to repay him for his labor . The sun sank lower and lower until , as Brother Filippo looked up , he saw that he must go home . He was sorely disappointed , but , strangely enough , his defeat in his mental struggle did not trouble him . More and more he believed in the fancy that his fate rested , not in his own hands , but with some great power which was using him to accomplish its ends . This night for the first time in many days he fell asleep without a struggle with his thoughts . The week which followed was but a repetition of the day described . A sense of duty which steadily grew weaker kept him working for a time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more time upon the point . Mechanically he went through his prayers , his monastery duties , even his work upon the point . He hardly thought . It was a blank , cold life after the exciting days which had been crowded with tumultuous thoughts . One afternoon , near the hour for returning to the monastery , Brother Filippo was working on the point . Discouraged by his fruitless work , he thrust his spade deep into the earth with a gesture of disgust . It struck something hard . Again , as when he had found the vase , Brother Filippo was wild with hope . When he finally succeeded in removing the earth from around the object , deeply imbedded in the soil and hard to free , he saw that it was a heavy piece of marble . Brother Filippo knew that it was the pedestal of a statue , - of that of Jupiter , he fancied . Now he was certain that to find the missing statue was only a question of time . If Father Beppi would stay away only a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filippo heard from behind him those familiar , low , stern tones saying : - " Brother Filippo , come with me . I feared this . May God in His infinite mercy pardon your sinfulness . For a moment Brother Filippo turned his horror-stricken , tell-tale face toward the Prior , and then sank trembling upon the block of stone . Dazed , he felt the hand of Father Beppi upon his arm and heard the well-known voice saying , " Come . " Brother Filippo never knew how he reached home . His recollections broke off with the scene at the point and began again with that in the chapter-house in // the morning . Between the two scenes he could remember nothing but hours full of misery . It was early when the monks assembled in the chapter-house . Every seat was filled , for no such grave misdemeanor as this of Brother Filippo had been cornmitted in the history of the monastery . There was an ominous hush in the room . Brother Filippo looked again for Brother Christoforo , and once more the old hunted feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brothers , his eyes fixed sternly and wonderingly upon Brother Filippo . The youth felt that he stood alone against these men . They could not understand what he had suffered , and he must take his punishment , whatever it might be , without explanation of his fault . One thing , however , was settled in his mind : while he lived they should not have the head . His revery was broken by the voice of Father Beppi . Evidently this strange and mysterious trouble in the monastery troubled the prior sorely . His voice had a ring of suppressed bitterness in it that called up sympathetic looks in the faces of his hearers as he said : - " Brothers , God has sent to this monastery a great trial . This erring brother , whom we punished before I left you , is again guilty . Last night , after the hour for coming home , I found him dreaming among his Pagan relics upon the point in the Tiber . Thrice , now , has he been guilty of breaking our laws . Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer and to penitence . Each time he has failed again , and quickly . Brothers , I do not understand this matter . Our brother was faithful , upright , obedient , till lately . Now , for the sake of a few Pagan relics as he says , his soul is in peril . I can not believe him . I pray God that I may not be wrong , but I can not believe our brother . Can any one here tell me anything about this matter ? " There was a moment 's pause . Then Brother Filippo heard the gentle voice of Brother Christoforo asking for perrnission to speak . The old monk gave his testimony with some unwillingness , - even Brother Filippo felt that ; still he recounted clearly and minutely his interview with Brother Filippo about the head of Jupiter . The ardor of the young monk , and his interest in the river point , were made plain . As Brother Christoforo told his story , some things in the conduct of Brother Filippo which he had not understood became clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mention of the name of the Prior he told with a new appreciation of its meaning . As he sat down , a murmur of wonder and of awe ran through the assembled monks . Many thought Brother Filippo bewitched by the Devil ; no sane man could care so much as he for a useless piece of stone . Father Beppi now arose again . During the speech of Brother Christoforo his face had grown very stern . In tones full of restrained scorn he said , - " Brothers , the words of Brother Christoforo have made clear to me much which I did not understand . " The Prior now carefully recounted his meeting with Brother Filippo in the cloister passage . He pointed out the strong probability , that at the time of the interview the monk had been to the stable for the head ; that he had just removed it from the danger of discovery . As Father Beppi recalled the scene , and the false position taken by Brother Filippo , his voice rang out in righteous scorn . The monks moved uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran around the room . Here was a fearful scandal revealing itself in the monastery . As Father Beppi finished his testimony , he turned quickly to Brother Filippo , saying , - " Brother , can you deny that when I met you in the cloister you had just removed the head from the stable ; that you were returning from secreting it ? " It seemed to Brother Filippo that he could not speak . At last , however , he managed to say , " I can not . " " Do you deny that at the point you were searching for the rest of the statue ? " The words once more came hoarsely : " I do not . " A rustle and a deep murmur of horror greeted each of the answers of Brother Filippo . As he looked up at the last question , he saw that some of the monks had fallen upon their knees , and were praying earnestly . Again Father Beppi asked , his voice vibrant with suppressed feeling , - // " Have you any explanation of this sinful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt an impulse to tell all , to strive to make his hearers understand the overpowering influences of his childhood ; but in the eyes of those about him he saw the hopelessness of the attempt . No ; he would stand alone . Drawing himself up , he said firmly , " No . " His self-reliant movement destroyed his last chance for pity . Lather Beppi now put one more question to the young monk : " Will you tell us what von did with the head ? " The hot blood mounted to the temples of the monk . Never , never , should they know this from him . He looked up into the face of Father Beppi and said calmly , " No . ' ' A solemn stillness fell upon the room . For a moment all watched the guilty man ; then several fell upon their knees . Father Beppi bowed his head an instant , as if in silent prayer , and then said : - " Brothers , we are facing the worst trouble in the history of our monastery . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not deny it , but , hardened in his wrong-doing , refuses to give up that which has bewitched him . Brothers , we have given this man every chance to repent , to confess his full guilt , but he refuses : the laws of our Order must now take their course . " Here the Prior turned more directly toward the young monk . " Brother Filippo , you . will go to your cell , to spend your time in fasting and prayer . Pray that the evil spirit which possesses you may , by the grace of God , be taken from you . Until you shall confess where the head is concealed , you shall hold communication with no one but myself . The marble which you found shall be broken into pieces ; so , too , shall the head , if it can be discovered . If in a fortnight you have not confessed its hiding-place , nor shown penitence for your sins , you will be expelled from the Order . Beware ! think before you let your folly force us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by man , lower in the sight of your Maker than the beasts of the field , you will wander homeless , the curse of your God and of your Church upon you . Now , go ! Pray , pray , Brother , that God in his mercy may show pity to you and open your heart ! Amen . " Moved and stirred by the passion of the thoroughly aroused Prior , his hearers often interrupted him with low amens ; and , as he ceased to speak , half-audible words from the praying monks could be heard . There was a moment 's hush , and then Brother Filippo went slowly toward the door . No one else moved . All eyes were upon him , and none in pity , though his step was weak , his carriage weary . As he reached the door he turned and cast one questioning look about him , as if in wonder that there was not one sympathetic soul among the throng . His search was vain . An instant and he was gone . Father Beppi raised his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank in silent prayer . CHAPTER VI . JUPITER . " Peace , peace , . He hath awakened from the dream of life . " - SHELLEy . WHEN Brother Filippo reached his cell he sank down before the crucifix . At first he was too much overwhelmed by the scene through which he had just passed to be able to think . Sloxvly , however , he grew calmer and stronger . Then the first feeling that came to him was an overmastering joy that the monks did not suspect that the marble was in his cell . Filled with strange exultation , Brother Filippo turned and flung himself beside the great head . As he lay resting his face against the marble , the words of the Prior came back to him . " Expelled from the Order , " " an outcast , " he , Francesco Brunelli ! Ah , he had always sought peace and quietness , and always had failed to find it . 0 God , what had he done that he should suffer as he did ? He had but followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in constant misery . XVhat did it mean ? Why did God make the world beautiful , why did he give a man the genius to create this statue , if beauty is displeasing to him ? Torn with anguish , the monk threw himself at the foot of the crucifix , praying for forgiveness and help . In a weary movement he caught sight of the great head for a moment . It seemed to // him that it had never looked so divinely tender as now . He fancied that it gazed upon him as He might to whom he had just cried for help . " Give up this head , " thought the monk ; " never ! " With a despairing cry he threw his arms ahout it . A chilliness came over him ; he trembled violently and grew dizzy . With great difficulty he raised himself and reached his bed . As he threw himself upon it , the room reeled around him and he lost consciousness . For hours he knew nothing . Once he seemed to hear a deep , familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . Later the sound came again , forming itself into the words , - " Brother Filippo , have you anything to say to me ? The mouth of the monk felt parched and dry ; he seemed to be burning up with fever , yet he managed to answer faintly ,  --  " No , nothing . " He heard a baffled sigh , and then footsteps dying away in the distance . Again for hours he lay unconscious . When at last he came to himself , he fancied that some one was knocking at his door . He strove to answer , but could not . Then he realized that the knocking was really thunder , that a fearful stori* was raging outside . With difficulty he raised himself and looked out of the window . Water was everywhere . The fields were flooded , and a myriad little streams were running down from the hills to the Tiber . A cloud must have burst . Falling back upon the bed , the monk lay in that contented , unthinking mood which comes to the convalescent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to see no one , and so when he heard the voice of his dreams saying at the door , " Brother Filippo , are you ready to confess ? " he unhesitatingly answered , The voice of Father Beppi replied : " May God soften your heart , Brother . Three days are over . But a few more and you must leave this monastery . " All this seemed far away to the monk , something that did not concern him . With this fancy he fell asleep ? . At night he awoke . The storm had ceased . There was a little light in the cell , which varied as the clouds passed to and fro outside . Far away Brother Filippo could hear the rushing of the swollen Tiber . He drew himself up and looked out of the window again . A startled exclamation burst from him . All the valley was gullied . How queer it looked down by the point ! Why , a quarter of the grove was gone ! Suddenly an idea that brought him to his feet in wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overpowering impulse , he tore the covering from his bed and with it swung himself from his window to the ground . He felt alert , eager , as he stood outside . Quickly he ran down the valley , leaping a gully here , climbing one there , until he came out upon the farther side of the grove . Here all was chaos . The river was running close up to the spot where he had been digging . The hole was washed and gullied . As Brother Filippo came up to it , the clouds passed from before the moon and he saw something white sticking out from the side of the hole . Running to the spot , he threw aside the earth with his hands . Yes , yes , it was the body of a statue ! The flowing robe , the commanding figure , told the monk that the body belonged to the head of Jupiter . He threw himself upon it with a great cry of joy . It chilled him through and through . The river faded from his sight ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villa . On all sides were the white walls of the building . A fountain splashed musically . Far off the monk heard sweet voices and the song of birds . Grand , commanding , the statue towered high above him . A party of monks came down to the river in the morning to see the devastation . Amazed , they found Brother Filippo beside the statue , tossing in the wildest delirium . His days of fever had worn him so much that the monks hardly knew him . When Father Beppi was called to meet the sad party , he ordered the monks to put Brother Filippo down in the outer court , and sent for Brother Christoforo , the best nurse in the monastery . The old man and Father Beppi bore the young monk to his cell . They said nothing as they put the young man into his bed , though their eyes met as they saw the head of the statue resting in the corner of the cell . The glance was veiled upon both sides . When they had done all that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christoforo , saying : - " Brother , this is no ordinary case of // sin . We two will watch Brother Filippo . Until we solve the question of his wrongdoing , let nothing be said about our brother . " Brother Christoforo assented wonderingly . He could not know that in the mind of his superior a great doubt had been struggling for days . It filled just Father Beppi with remorse to think that , perhaps , through a misunderstanding of the nature of the young monk , he had been needlessly cruel . During the next few days the situation became clear to both men . In his deliriurn Brother Filippo lived over all his past life , dwelling upon his troubles . The ravings of the young monk seemed to affect the Prior strangely as from time to time he came into the cell . In his worry Father Beppi seemed to have forgotten both the statue and the head . The monks wondered that he did not order them to break up the marble found beside the river , but no such orders came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting away as he realized the awful struggle which had gone on in the mind of the young monk . A great tenderness and pity for the guideless , striving youth filled the heart of the old man . Slowly a plan requiring what would be for him great courage was forming in the mind of Brother Christoforo . Thus the days went by for a week with the three : Brother Filippo struggling in his delirium ; Father Beppi lost in troubled self-coin munion ; Brother Christoforo busy with his nursing and his plan for the sufferer . As the two monks went toward the bed , late one evening , ten days after the finding of Brother Filippo , the young man seemed to be sleeping more quietly than usual . Brother Christoforo , as he glanced at the youth , turned away with a sob , for he saw upon the face of Brother Filippo a change the meaning of which he knew but too well . But Father Beppi , as he saw the different look upon the face of the young monk , uttered a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brother Christoforo turned around in wonder . " Brother , " said Father Beppi , joyfully , " I think God will spare him to us . We shall vet win him back to the path from which he has strayed . " Brother Christoforo hesitated a moment , and then said sadly : - " Father , it can not be . This is the rest that comes before that which lasts forever . To-morrow , our brother will need you . Now we can do nothing for him ; nor after to-morrow can anything mortal please or hurt him . " The old monk paused for an instant , and then the thought which had been in his mind for days found voice . " Father , " he cried softly , " forgive me if I know not what I ask ; I must speak . Brother Filippo will know us for a few minutes to-morrow . 0 Father , Father , will it be wrong to let him see his statue before he dies ? " The old monk was upon his knees now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder when Father Beppi bent over him , saying in tones as gentle and as tender as his own : - " Rise , Brother Christoforo . Let us thank God for our lesson , as I thank you for strengthening me to do my duty . It shall be as you wish . " For a moment the two men grasped each other by the hand ; and then Father Beppi turned toward the door , saying , " Call me when he comes to himself . " All night Brother Christoforo sat watching by Brother Filippo . XVhen Father Beppi came into the cell about five o'clock , the two men did not speak , but the cordial handgrasp told the strong feeling welling up in the heart of each . Father Beppi sat down by the bed ; Brother Christoforo sank before the crucifix in prayer . Suddenly he heard a low , joyful exclamation from Father Beppi . Turning quickly , he saw that Brother Filippo was awake , his eyes fixed upon his fellow-monk . Brother Christoforo , his face beaming with happiness , went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frail hands and pressed it . Brother Filippo answered the pressure with a smile . With a kindly nod the old monk turned and left the room . No one ever knew what was said in the interview between the Prior and Brother Filippo ; but when Father Beppi at last came into the ambulatory , where Brother Christoforo was waiting for him , his face had a gentle , tender look which amazed the old monk . " Go in , " whispered Father Beppi . " He is sleeping now . God pity him ; the power that influenced him was too great to withstand . God have mercy upon us who have been too severe with // him ! Go to him , Brother . I will send the statue . " Brother Christoforo went into the cell and sat down beside the bed . Brother Filippo , tired by his talk with the Prior , was sleeping now as gently as a child . Suddenly the door opened and some monks , with wondering faces , brought in clumsily but quietly the body of the statue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign from Brother Christoforo left the cell . Almost immediately Father Beppi came in . The two monks went silently to the corner where the head was standing . Lifting it , they set it gently upon the massive shoulders of the statue . Both men fell back in wonder at the effect produced . Jupiter , his body wrapped in a flowing robe , stood erect in all his divinity and majesty . One hand hung at his side ; the other was outstretched in a gesture , half of command , half of blessing . The whole figure was grand , superb , a masterpiece . It did not dwarf the little room ; rather it seemed to make it larger , to brighten it by its presence . When their work was finished , the two monks sat down to wait . Far away sounded the chanting of the monks who were praying for the passing soul of their brother . Borne by the wind came the softly repeated words , " In manus tuas , Domine. ** Suddenly , as the two monks watched , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was gazing at the statue . A joy , too great at first for words , was glowing upon his countenance . Slowly he raised himself and gazed at the great figure with one long , breathless look . Then murmuring softly , " I thank thee , 0 my God , I thank thee , " he sank back , and closed his eyes as quietly as a babe . To-day a statue stands in the outer court of the monastery of San Serpolo . The great majestic figure , the head crowned with waving hair , the body wrapped in a flowing robe , is the first thing which strikes the eye of the stranger as he enters the gate of the court . If , impressed by the subtle mingling in the figure of majestic power and of tenderness , he asks one of the monks about the statue , he will be told that it is Jupiter . Probably , too , the monk will add that underneath it lies buried a youth who , filled with all the tendencies and the aspirations which gave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Serpolo from Florence , and here in this old monastery fought to the death the battle between ignorant mysticism and the longings within him . The monk will tell the stranger the story of Brother Filippo.
