txt While Robert Armstrong , Superintendent of J. Pierpont Morgan 's kennels , was walking through the kennel grounds yesterday morning , looking for a young collie , which had been missing for several days , his attention was attracted by a lot of birds flying excitedly through the air . High above them soared five large eagles . Mr. Armstrong stood almost spellbound by , the magnificent sight . The eagles flew in a circle , and would occasionally descend with light-ning rapidity toward the flock of birds , which scattered in every direction when they saw their relentless enemies swoop down upon them . When the eagles again ascended the small birds gathered courage and , with much noise , followed the upward course of their kings . While Armstrong watched with increased interest the manoeuvres of the eagles , one of the largest began descending toward the place where he stood . Some puppies had been released from their kennels , and were playing around among the rocks and shrubbery . A bull pup belonging to Miss Morgan was having a lively tussle with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty yards distant from where Mr. Armstrong stood . The Superintendent , who never permits any of the dogs to interfere with Miss Morgan 's pet , was so engrossed in the antics of the birds that he did not notice the two puppies on the rocks . Mr. Armstrong thought it prudent to get his gun , which hung in the reception room of the kennels near by . A minute later he came out with both barrels loaded . The sight that met his eyes as he came out almost took his breath away . There was the eagle with the bull pup in its talons trying to soar aloft , while the howls of the dog rent the air . The collies crouched among the rocks as if fearful that their turn might come next . Mr. Armstrong seeing that the eagle with its prey was well within range , blazed away . A mass of feathers flew in all directions . Dog and bird dropped toward the earth . When within a few feet of the ground the eagle released its hold . The dog dropped unhurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mighty effort , arose slowly and joined its four mates high in the air . Mr. Armstrong fired the remaining barrel at the eagle , but it soared away apparently little the worse for its adventure . The Superintendent is now convinced that the collie that disappeared a few days ago was carried off by the eagles . Hundreds of eagles have been seen lately in this vicinity . Last week an army service man said he saw one descend into Fort Clinton and carry off an opossum . Few believed the story at the time , but the attempt to carry off Mr. Morgan 's dog has convinced many that the eagles will soon become a regular pest in the Highlands if something is not done to exterminate them . At Garrisons , just across the river , there is an old eagle said to have been a native of the place during the revolution . It may he recognized by the drop of its right wing , which was shattered by the shot from a British soldier 's gun .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
