txt Nothing is more interesting , in the existingwar in the Transvaal , than the attempts of the combatants to throw on each other the onus of employing " natives " in war . We are not aware that it has cut any figure In the official and diplomatic correspondence . And no wonder . Because this controversy , of its own nature , begins where official and diplomatic correspondence ends . It is recognized , however , that the employment of " native " allies by a professedly Christian and civilized combatant is a disreputable operation , even though there has been no international prohibition of it at the conference at The Hague or at any of its predecessors . It is a queer situation , because part of the case of each combatant is that it commands more of the sympathy of " the natives " than its opponent , and yet it has to disclaim turning this sympathy to practical and armed account . In our own Revolutionary War Lord CHATHAM made it a ground of reproach against the Ministry of the day that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latest recrudescence of the same spirit is the British explanation of the stampeding of the ammunition and battery mules . The explanation is that the " native " mule drivers were in sympathy with the Boers and that the stampede was really the work of these drivers . But how does this explanation go with the contention that the natives are hostile to the Boers on account of the cruelty with which the Boers have treated them ? Obviously it does not go at all . Neither does it go with the report that the warlike Basutos are rising up to help the British beat the Boers . This report would be " important if true , " looking to the situation of Basutoland , between Natal and the Orange Free State . The truth we suppose to lie , as usual , between the two extremes . The natives do in fact loathe both Boers and British . The answer to the question which do they loathe the more probably depends upon the question which they have encountered the earlier and the oftener . It also depends largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boer or Briton the native has first encountered and from what specimen he has formed his impression of the species . No doubt the " native " loathes the Boer . No doubt he also loathes the Briton . If he has seen more Boers than Britons , or if he has seen more of the Boers than of the Britons , then he loathes the Boers the more warmly , and vice versa . We have nothing to boast about in such a comparison , because it was only the other day that an American officer , and therefore an expert witness , returning from the Philippines , gave it as his opinion that , although the Filipinos used to hate the Spaniards very bitterly , yet , now that they had come to know us , we had entirely displaced the Spaniards as objects of animosity . The ultimate conclusion is that there is really no conclusion to be drawn from these animosities , or these comparative animosities , of savages for comparatively civilized people . Least of all can any conclusion be drawn from the contradictory statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combatant and that they are also taking his part against the other
