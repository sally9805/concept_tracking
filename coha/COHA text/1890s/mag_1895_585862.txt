txt HE American young man , in the selection of a vocation , is practically cut off from two call *P* ' ings which are dear to his contemporaries in other civilized countries - the Army and the Navy . The possibility of war , with all its horrors and its opportunities for personal renown , is always looming up before the English , French , German , or Russian youth , who is well content to live a life of gilded martial inactivity in the hope of sooner or later winning the cross for conspicuous service , if he escapes a soldier 's grave . We have endured one war , and we profoundly hope never to undergo another . Those of us who are ethically opposed to the slaughter of thousands of human bein s in a single day by cannon , feel that we have geography on our side . Even the bloodthirsty are forced to acknowledge that the prospects here for a genuine contest of any kind are not favorable . Consequently , the ardor of the son and heir , who would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very apt to be cooled by the representation that his days would be spent in watching Indians or cattle thieves on the Western plains , or in cruising uneventfully in the Mediterranean or the Gulf of Mexico . At all events our standing , or , more accurately speaking , sitting Army , and our Navy are so small , that the demand for generals and captains is very limited . Therefore , though we commend to our sons the prowess of Cmesar , Napoleon , Nelson , Von Moltke , and Grant , we are able to demonstrate to them , even without recourse to modern ethical arguments , that the opportunities for distinction on this side of the water are likely to be very meagre . Also , we Americans , unlike English parents , hesitate to hold out as offerings to the Church a younger son in every large family . We have no national Church ; moreover , the calling of a clergyman in this country lacks the social picturesqueness which goes far , or did go far , to reconcile the British younger son to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . Then again , would the American mother , like the conventional mother of the older civilizations , as represented in biography and fiction , if asked which of all vocations she would prefer to have her son adopt , reply promptly and fervidly , " the min-istry ? " I put this question to my wife by way of obtaining an answer . She reflected a moment , then she said , " If one of my boys really felt called to be a clergyman , I should be a very happy woman ; but I would n't on any account have one of them enter the ministry unless he did . " This reply seems to me to express not merely the attitude of the American mother , but also the point of view from which the American young man of to-day is apt to look at the question . He no longer regards the ministry as a profession which he is free to prefer , merely because he needs to earn his daily bread ; and he understands , when he becomes a clergyman , that lukewarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community which is thirsty for inspirational suggestion , but which is soul-sick of cant and the perfervid reiteration of out - worn delusions . The consciousness that he has no closer insight into the mysteries of the universe than his fellow-men , and the fear that he may be able to solace their doubts only by skilful concealment of his own , is tending , here and all over the civilized world , to deter // many a young man from embracing that profession , which once seemed to offer a safe and legitimate niche for any pious youth who was uncertain what he wished to do for a living . Happy he who feels so closely in touch with the infinite that he is certain of his mission to his brother-man ! But is anyone more out of place than the priest who seems to know no more than we do of what we desire to know most ? We demand that a poet should be heaven-born ; why should we not require equivalent evidence of fitness from our spiritual advisers ? And yet , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling is there which offers to-day more opportunities for usefulness than the ministry ? The growing tendency of the Church is toward wider issues and a broader scope . Clergymen are now encouraged and expected to aid in the solution of problems of living no less than those of dying , and to lead in the discussion of matters regarding which they could not have ventured to express opinions fifty years ago without exposing themselves to the charge of being meddlesome or unclericaL The whole field of practical charity , economics , hygiene , and the relations of human beings to each other on this earth , are fast becoming the legitimate domain of the Church , and the general interest in this new phase of usefulness is serving to convince many of the clergy themselves that the existence of so many creeds , differing but slightly and unimportantly from one another , is a waste of vital force and machinery . In this age of trusts , a trust of all religious denominations for the common good of humanity would be a monopoly which could pay large dividends without fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vocation , the case of the ambitious , promising young man is the one which commends itself most to our sympathies ; and next to it stands that of the general utility man  --  the youth who has no definite tastes or talents , and who selects his life occupation from considerations other than a consciousness of fitness or of natural inclination . There are here , as elsewhere , born mer chants , lawyers , doctors , clergymen , architects , engineers , inventors , and poets , who promptly follow their natural bents without suggestion and in the teeth of difficulties . But the promising young man in search of a brilliant career , and the general utility man , are perhaps the best exponents of a nation 's temper and inclination . In every civilization many promising youths and the general run of utility men are apt to turn to business , for trade seems to offer the largest return in the way of money with the least amount of special knowledge . In this new country of ours the number of young men who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from personal inclination , has been very much greater than elsewhere , and the tone and temper of the community has swept the general utility man into mere money making almost as a matter of course . The reasons for this up to this time have been obvious : The resources and industries of a vast and comparatively sparsely settled continent have been developed in the last fifty years , and the great prizes in the shape of large fortunes resulting from the process have naturally captivated the imagination of ambitious youth . We have unjustly been styled a nation of shopkeepers ; but it may in all fairness be alleged that , until the last fifteen years , we have been under the spell of the commercial and industrial spirit , and that the intellectual faculties of the nation have been mainly absorbed in the introduction and maintenance of railroads and factories , in the raising and marketing of grain , in the development of real estate enterprises , and in trading in the commodities or securities which these various undertakings have produced . The resources of the country are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open which will make their owners superbly rich ; new discoveries in the mechanical or electrical field will afford fresh opportunities to discerning men of means ; and individual or combined capital will continue to reap the reward of both legitimate and over-reaching commercial acumen . But it would seem as though the day of enormous fortunes , // for men of average brains and luck , in this country were nearly over , and that the great pecuniary prizes of the business world would henceforth be gleaned only by extraordinary or exceptional individuals . The country is no longer sparsely settled ; fierce competition speedily cuts the abnormal profit out of new enterprises which are not protected by a patent ; and in order to be conspicuously successful in any branch of trade , one will have more and more need of unusual ability and untiring application . In other words , though ours is still a new country , it will not be very long before the opportunities and conditions of a business life resemble closely those which confront young men elsewhere . As in every civilized country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large portion of the population . From physical causes , a vast majority of the citizens of the United States must continue to derive their support from agriculture and the callings which large crops of cereals , cotton , and sugar make occasion for . Consequently business will always furulish ocVOL . XVJI. - 61 cupation for a vast army of young men in every generation , and few successes will seem more enviable than those of the powerful and scrupulous banker , or the broad-minded and capable railroad president . But , on the other hand , will the well - to - do American father and mother , eager to see their promising sons make the most of themselves , continue to advise them to go into business in preference to other callings ? And will the general utility man still be encouraged to regard some form of trade as the most promising outlook , for one who does not know what he wishes to do , to adopt ? He who hopes to become a great banker or illustrious railway man , must remember that the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts harbor similar ambitions . Doubtless , it was the expectation of our forefathers that our American civilization would add new occupations to the callings inherited from the old world , which would be alluring both to the promising young man and the youth without predilections , and no less valuable to society and elevating to the individual than the best of those by which men have earned their daily bread since civilization first was . As a matter of fact , we Americans have added just one , that of the modern stock - broker . To be sure , I am not including the ranchman . It did seem at one time as though we were going to add another in him  --  a sort of gentleman shepherd . But be it that the cattle have become too scarce or too numerous , be it that the demon of competition has planted his hoofs on the farthest prairie , one by one the brave youths who went West in search of fortune , have returned East for the last time , and abandoned the field to the cowboys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation made snug fortunes , but after them came a deluge of promising or unpromising youths who branded every animal within a radius of hunThe question of choosing an occupation . // dreds of miles with a letter of the alphabet . Their only living monument is the polo pony . Our single and signal contribution to the callings of the world has been the apotheosis of the stock-broker . For the last twenty-five years , the well-to-do father and mother and their sons , in our large cities , have been under the spell of a craze for the brokerage business . The consciousness that the refinements of modern living can not adequately be supplied in a large city to a family whose income does not approximate ten thousand dollars a year , is a cogent argument in favor of trying to grow rich rapidly , and both the promising young man and the general utility man welcomed the new calling with open arms . Impelled by the notion that here was a vocation which required no special knowledge or attainments , and very little capital , which 4&lt; * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind are not favorable. ' was pleasant , gentlemanly , and not unduly confluing , and which promised large returns almost in the twinkling of an eye , hundreds and thousands of young men became brokers - chiefly stock - brokers , but also cotton-brokers , note-brokers , real estatebrokers , insurance-brokers , and brokers in nearly everything . The field was undoubtedly a rich one for those who first entered it . There was a need for the broker , and he was speedily recognized as a valuable addition to the machinery of trade . Many huge fortunes were made , and we have learned to associate the word broker with the possession of large means , an imposing house on a fashionable street , and diverse docked and stylish horses . Of course , the king of all brokers has been the stock-broker , for to him was given the opportunity to buy and sell securities on his own account , though he held himself out to his customers as merely a poor thing who worked for a commission . No wonder that the young man , just out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of dollars a year so and so , who had been graduated only five years before , was making , and resolved to try his luck with the same Aladdin 's lamp . Nor was it strange that the sight of men scarcely out of their teens , driving down town in fur coats , in their own equipages , with the benison of successful capitalists in their salutations , settled the question of choice for the youth who was wavering or did not know what he wished to do . It is scarcely an extreme statement that the so - called // aristocracy of our principal cities today is largely made up of men who are , or once were , stock-brokers , or who have made their millions by some of the forms of gambling which our easyg o in g euphemism styles modern commercial aggressiveCruising uneventfully in the Mediterranean or the Gulf of Mexico . ness . Certainly , a very considerable number of our most splendid private residences have been built out of the proceeds of successful ventures in the stock market , or the wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many stars have shone brilliantly for a season , and then plunged precipitately from the zenith to the horizon ; and much has been wisely said as to the dangers of speculation ; but the fact remains that a great many vast fortunes owe their existence to the broker 's office ; fortunes which have been salted down , as the phrase is , and now furnish support and titillation for a leisurely , green old age , or enable the sons and daughters of the original maker to live in luxury . Whatever the American mother may feel as to her son becoming a clergyman , there is no doubt that many a mother to-day would say " God grant that no son of mine become a stockbroker . " I know stock-brokers-many indeed-who are whole-souled , noblenatured men , free from undue worldliness , and with refined instincts . But the stock-broker , as he exists in the every-day life of our community , typifies signally the gambler 's yearning to gain wealth by short cuts , and the monomania which regards as pitiable those who do not possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialism . There are stock-brokers in all the great capitals - of the world , but no where has the vocation swallowed up the sons of the best people to the extent that it has done here during the last thirty years . And yet , apart from the opportunity it affords to grow rich rapidly , what one good reason is there why a promising young man should decide to buy and sell stocks for a living ? Indeed , not merely decide , but select , that occupation as the most desirable calling open to him ? Does it tend either to ennoble the nature or enrich the mental faculties ? It is one of the formal occupations made necessary by the exigencies of the business world , and as such is legitimate and may be highly respectable ; but surely it does not , from the nature of the services required , deserve to rank high ; and really there would seem to be almost as much occasion for conferring the accolade of social distinction on a dealer in excellent fish as on a successful stockbroker . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why the business has been so popular . It appears that , even under the flag of our aspiring nationality , human nature is still so weak that the opportunity to grow rich quickly , when presented , is apt to over-ride all noble considerations . Foreign censors have ventured not infrequently to declare that there was never* yet a race so hungry for money as we free - born Americans ; and not even the pious ejaculation of one of our United States Senators , " What have we to do with abroad ? " is conclusive proof that the accusation is not well founded . In fact there seems to be ample proof that we , who sneered so austerely at the // Faubourg St. Germain and the aristocracies of the Old World , and made Fourth of July protestations of poverty and chastity , have fallen down and worshipped the golden calf merely because it was made of gold . Because it seemed to be easier to make money as stockbrokers than in any other way , men have hastened to become stock-brok " The whole field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be answered that this is only human nature and the way of the world . True , perhaps ; except that we started on the assumption that we were going to improve on the rest of the world , and that its human nature was not to be our human nature . Would not the Faubourg St. Germain be preferable to an aristocracy of stock-brokers ? At all events , the law of supply and demand is beginning to redeem the situation , and , if not to restore our moral credit , at least to save the rising generation from falling into the same slough . The stock - broker industry has been overstocked , and the late young capitalists in fur overcoats , with benedictory manners , wear anxious countenances under the stress of that Old World demon , excessive competition . Youth can no longer wake up in the morning and find itself the proprietor of a rattling business justifying a steam-yacht and a four-in-hand . The good old days have gone forever , and there is weeping and gnashing of teeth where of late there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for all the promising young men who are stock - brokers already , and the youth of promise must turn elsewhere . II BUT though the occupation of broker has become less tempting , the promising youth has not ceased to look askance at any calling which does not seem to foreshadow a fortune in a short time . He is only just beginning to appreciate that we are getting down to hard pan , so to speak , and are nearly on a level , as regards the hardships of individual progress , with our old friends the effete civilizations . He finds it difficult to rid himself of the " Arabian Nights " ' notion that he has merely to clap his hands to change ten dollars into a thousand in a single year , and to transform his bachelor apartments into a palace beautiful , with a wife , yacht , and horses , before he is thirty-five . He shrinks from the idea of being obliged to take seriously into account anything less than a hundreddollar bill , and of earning a livelihood by slow yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition is to be a promoter ; that is , to be an organizer of schemes , and to let others do the real work and attend to the disgusting details . There are a great many gentry of this kind in the field just at present . Among them is , or rather was , Lewis Pell , as I will call him for the occasion . I do n't know exactly what he is doing now . But he was , until lately , a promoter . A handsome fellow was Lewis Pell . Tall , gentlemanly , and athletic-looking , with a gracious , imposing presence and C // manner , which made his rather corninonpiace conversation seem almost wisdom . He went into a broker 's office after leaving college , like many other promising young men of his time , but he was clever enough either to realize that he was a little late , or that the promoter business offered a more promising scope for his genius , for he soon disappeared from the purlicus of the Stock Exchange , and the next thing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate set of offices on the third floor of a most expensive modern monster building . Shortly after I read in the financial columns of the daily press that Mr. Lewis Pell had sold to a syndicate of bankers the first mortgage and the debenture bonds of the Light and Power Traction Company , an electrical corporation organized under the laws of the State of iNew Jersey . Thirty days later I saw again that he had sailed for Europe in order to interest London capital in a large enterprise , the nature of which was still withheld from the public . During the next two or three years I ran across Pell on several occasions . He seemed always to be living at the highest pressure , but the brill- ? * " With the heninon of successful capitaliata in their ealutatic na. " iancy of his career had not impaired his good manners or attractiveness . I refer to his career as brilliant at this time because both h i s operations and the consequent style of living which he pursued , as described by him on two different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my capacity of ordinary citizen to savor of the marvellous , if not the supernatural . He frankly gave me to understand that it seemed to him a waste of time for an ambitious man to pay attention to details , and that his business was to originate vast undertakings , made possible only by large combinations of corporate or private capitaL The word combination , which was frequently on his lips , seemed to be the corner-stone of his system . I gathered that the part which he sought to play in the battle of life was to breathe the breath , or the apparent breath , of existence into &gt;* huge schemes , and after having given them a quick but comprehensive squeeze or two for his own pecuniary benefit , to hand them over to syndicates , or other aggregations of capitalists , for the benefit of whom they might concern . He confided to inc that he employed eleven typewriters ; that he had visited London seven , and Paris three times , in the last three years , on flying trips to accomplish brilliant deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely a week passed in which he was not obliged to run over to Chicago , Boston , Washington , Denver , Duluth , or Cincinnati , as the case might be . Without being boastful as to his profits , he did not hesitate to acknowledge to me that if he should do as well in the " The genera utility man . .4 // next three years as in the last , he would be able to retire from business with a million or so . Apart from this confession , his personal extravagance left no room for doubt that he must be very rich . Champagne flowed for him as Croton or . Cochituate for most of us , and it was evident from his language that the hiring of special trains from " A leisurely , green old age . time to time was a rather less serious matter than it would be for the ordinary citizen to take a cab . The account that he gave of three separate entertainments he had tendered to syndicatesof ten , twelve , and seventeen covers respectively , at twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick out , so that I felt constrained to murmur , " Your profits must certainly be very large , if you can afford that sort of thing . " Pell smiled complacently and a little condescendingly . " I could tell you of things which I have done which would make that seem a bagatelle , " he answered , with engaging mystery . Then after a moment 's pause he said , " Do you know , my dear fellow , that when I was graduated I came very near going into the office of a pious old uncle of mine who has been a commission merchant all his life , and is as poor as Job 's turkey in spite of it all-that is , poor as men are rated nowadays . He offered to take me as a clerk at one thousand dollars a year , with the promise of a partnership before I was bald-headed in case I did welL Supposing I had accepted his offer , where should I be today ? Grubbing at an office-desk and earning barely enough for board and lodging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I went into a broker 's office instead . By the way , between ourselves , I 'm building a steam-yacht - nothing very wonderful , but a neat , comfortable craft - and I 'm looking forward next summer to inviting my pious old uncle to cruise on her just to see him open his eyes . " That was three years ago , and to-day I have every reason to believe that Lewis Pell is without a dollar in the world , or rather , that every dollar which he has belongs to his creditors . I had heard before his failure was announced that he was short of money , for the reason that several enterprises with which his n am e was connected had been left on his hands-neither the syndicates nor the public would touch them-so his suspension was scarcely a surprise . He at present , poor fellow , is only one of an army of young men wandering dejectedly through the streets of New York or Chicago in these days of financial depression , vainly seeking for something to promote . When the promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Arabian Nights ' " notion , and recognize that signal success here , in any form , is likely to become more and more difficult to attain , and will be the legitimate reward only of men of real might , of unusual abilities , originality , or daunt- // / What have we to do with abroad ? less industry , some of the callings which have again socially . It may be , however , that modern business methods and devices have had the effect of killing for all time that highly respectable pillar of society of fifty years ago , the old - fashioned merchant , who bought and sold on his own behalf , or on commission , real cargoes of merchandise , and real consignments of cotton , wheat , and corn . The telegraph and the warehouse certificate have worked such havoc that almost everything now is bought and sold over and over again before it is grown or manufactured , and by the time it is on the market there is not a shred of profit in it for anybody but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the speculative spirit subsides , the merchant is going to reinstate himself and regain his former prestige . It may already be said that the promising youth does not regard him with quite so much contempt as he did . We have always professed in this country great theoretical respect for the schoolmaster , but we have been careful , as the nation waxed in material prosperity , to keep his pay down and to shove him into the social background more and more . The promising youth could not afford to spend his manhood in this wise , and we have all really been too busy making money to think very much about those who are doing the teaching . Have we not always heard it stated that our schools and colleges are second to none in the world ? And if our schools , of coumse our schoolmasters . Therefore why bother our heads about them ? It is indeed wonderful , considering the little popular interest in the subject until lately , that our schoolmasters and our college professors are so competent as they are , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indifference and superiority . How can men of the highest class be expected to devote their lives to a profession which yields little more than a pittance when one is thoroughly successful ? And yet the education of our children ought to be one of our dearest concerns , and it is difficult to see why the State is satisfied to pay the average instructor or instructress of youth about as much as the city laborer or a horse-car conductor receives . " Foreign cenoora have ventured not infrequently to declare that there was never yet a race ao hungry for money as we free-born Americana // There are signs that those in charge of our large educational institutions all over the country are beginning to recognize that ripe scholarship and rare abilities as a teacher are entitled to be well recompensed pecuniarily , and that the breed of such men is likely to increase somewhat in proportion to the size and number of the prizes offered . Our college presidents and professors , those at the head of our large schools and seminaries , should receive such salaries as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only would our promising young men be encouraged to pursue learning , but those in the highest places would not be forced by poverty to live in comparative retirement , but could become active social figures and leaders . In any profession or calling under present social conditions only those in the foremost rank can hope to earn more than a living , varying in quality according to the degree of success and the rank of the occupation ; but it is to be hoped ,  --  and there seems some reason to believe-that the great rewards which come to those more able and industrious than their fellows will henceforth , in the process of our national evolution , be more evenly distributed , and not confined so conspicuously to gambling , speculative , or commercial successes . The leaders in the great professions of law and medicine have for some time past declined to serve the free-born community without liberal compensation , and the same community , which for half a centUry secretly believed that only a business man has the right to grow rich , has begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health which ought to come high .

In the same class with the law , medicine , and architecture , and seemingly offering at present a greater scope for an ambitious young man , is engineering in all its branches . The furnaces , mines , mu anufactories , and the hydraulic , electrical , or other plants connected with the numerous vast mechanical business enterprises of the country are furnishing immediate occupation for hundreds of graduates of the scientific or polytechnic schools at highly respectable salaries . This field of usefulness is certain for a long time to come to offer employment and a fair livelihood to many , and large returns to those who outstrip their contemporaries . More and more is the business man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent for the economical or successful development and management of undertakings on the judgment of scientific experts in his own employment or called in to advise , and it is only meet that the counsel given should be paid for handsomely . Those who pursue literature or art in their various branches in this country , and have talents in some degree commensurate with their ambition , are now generally able to make a comfortable livelihood . Indeed the men and women in the very front rank are beginning to receive incomes which would be highly satisfactory to a leading lawyer // or physician . Of course original work in literature or art demands special ability and fitness , but the general utility man is beginning to have many opportunities presented to him in connection with what may be called the clerical work of these professions . The great magazines and publishing houses have an increasing need for trained , scholarly men , for capable critics , and discerning advisers in the field both of letter-press a n d illustration . Another calling which seems to promise great possibilities both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly is the comparatively new professiou of journalism . T h e reporter , with all hispresenthorrors , is in the process of evolution ; but the journalist is sure to remain the highpriest of democracy . His influence is almost certain to increase materially , but it will not increase unless he seeks to lead public thought instead of bowing to it . The newspaper , in order to flourish , must be a moulder of opinion , and to accomplish this those who control its columns must more and more be men of education , force , and high ideals . Competition will winnow here as elsewhere , but those who by ability and industry win the chief places will stand high in the community and command large pay for their services . An aristocracy of brains-that is to say , an aristocracy composed of individuals successful and prominent in their several callings-seems to be the logical sequence of our institutions under present social and industrial conditions . The only aristocracy which can exist in a democracy is one of honorable success evidenced by wealth or a handsome income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ambitions and tastes of the nation . The inevitable economic law of supply and demand governs here as elsewhere , and will govern until such a time as society may be reconstructed on an entirely new basis . Only the leaders in any vocation can hope to grow rich , but in proportion as the demands of the nation for what is best increase will the type and characteristics of these leaders improve . The doing away with inherited orders of nobility and deliberate , patented class distinctions , gives the entire field to wealth . We boast proudly that no artificial barriers confine individual social promotion ; but we must remember at the same time that those old barriers meant more than t h e perpetuation of perfumed ladies and idle gentlemen from century to century . We are too apt to forget that t h e aristocracies of the old world signified in the first place a process of selection . The kings and the nobles , the lords and the barons , the knights who fought and the ladies for whom they died , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the strong brains of civilized communities . They stood for force , the force of the individual who was more intelligent , more capable , and mightier in soul and body than his neighbors , and who claimed the prerogatives of superiority on that account . These master-spirits , it is true , used these prerogatives in such a manner as to crystallize society into the classes and the masses , so hopelessly for the latter that the gulf between them still is wide as an ocean , notwithstanding that present nobilities have been shorn of their power so that His bachelor apartments . ' // they may be said to exist chiefly by sufferance . And yet the world is still the same in that there are men more intelligent , more capable , and mightier in soul and body than their fellows . The leaders of the past won their spurs by prowess with the battle - axe and spear , by wise counsel in affairs of state , by the sheer force of their superior manhood. -* The gentleman and lady stood for the best blood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their actions . We , who are accustomed to applaud ' our civilization as the hope of the world , may well look across the water and take suggestions from the institutions of Great Britain , not with the idea of imitation , but with a view to consider the forces at work there . For nearly a century now the government , though in form a monarchy , has been substantially a constitutional republic , imbued with inherited traditions and somewhat galvanized by class distinctions , but nevertheless a constitutional republic . The nobility still exists as a sort of French roof or Eastern pagoda to give a pleasing appearance to the social edifice . The hereditary meaning of / titles has been so largely negatived by t h e introdnetion of ( new blood  --  the blood of the strongest men of the period - that they have become , what they originally were , badges to distinguish the men most valuable to the State . Their abolition is merely a question of time , and many of the leaders to whom they are proffered reject them as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , and here is the point of argument , the real aristocracy of England for the last hundred years has been an aristocracy of the foremost , ablest , and worthiest men of the nation , and with few exceptions the social and pecuniary rewards have been bestowed both by the State and by public appreciation on the maste*-spirits of the time in the best sense . Brilliant statesmanship , ' wisdom on the bench , the surgeon 's skill , the banker 's sound discernment , genins in literature and art , when signally contribnted by the individual , have won him fame and fortune . It may be said , perhaps , that the pecuniary rewards of science and literature have been less conspicuous than those accorded to other successes , but that has been due to the inherent practical temperament and artistic limitations of the Englishman , and can scarcely be an argument against the contention that English society in the nineteenth century , with all its social idiosyncrasies , has really been graded on the order of merit .

We are a new country , and we have a right to be hopeful that we are sooner or later to outstrip all civilizations . Nor is it a blemish that the astonishing development of our material resources has absorbed the energies of our best blood . But it now remains to be seen whether the standards of pure democracy , without traditions or barriers to point the way , are to justify the experiment and improve the race . The character of our aristocracy will depend on the virtues and tastes of the people , and the struggle is to be between aspiration and contentment with low ambitions .

Who are to be the men of might and heroes of democracy ? That will depend on the demands and aspirations of the enfranchised people . With all its imperfections , the civilization of the past has fostered the noble arts and stirred genius to immortalize itself in bronze and marble , in cathedral spires , in masterpieces of painting and literature , in untiring scholarship , in fervent labors in law , medicine , and science . Democracy must care for these things , and encourage the individual to choose worthy occupations , or society will suffer . We hope and believe that , in the long run , the standards of humanity will be raised rather than lowered by the lifting of the flood-gates which divide the privileged classes from the mass ; but it behooves us all to remember that while demand and supply must be the leading arbiters in the choice of a vocation , the responsibility of selection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals will society be saved from accepting the The Schoolmaster . 7/ 7 low , vulgar aims and ambitions of the mass as a desirable weal , and this is the strongest argument against the doctrines of those who would repress individuality for the alleged benefit of mankind as a whole .
