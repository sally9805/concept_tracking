THE CENTURY MAGAZINE VOL . LIII . FEBRUARY , 1897 . No. 4 . CAMPAIGNING WITH GRANT . BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER . FROM SPOT8YLVANJA TO THE NORTH ANNA . GRANT AND MEADE. field , but this promotion had to be confirmed at Washington . He said in his letter : eGen ( IN the morning qwq sponsibility could not be fixed upon him , and if he succeeded he could not reap the full reward of his merits ; that , besides , he had an irascible temper , and often irritated officers who came in contact with him , while General Grant was even-tempered , and succeeded in securing a more hearty coiperation of his generals when he dealt with them direct . The discussion became heated at times . At the close of the arguments the general said : 4 am fully aware that some embarrassments arise from the present organization , but there is more weight on the other side of the question . I am commanding all the armies , and I can not neglect others by giving my time exclusively to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detailed duties of an army commander , directing its administration , enforcing discipline , reviewing its court-martial proceedings , etc . I have Burnside 's , Butler 's , and Sigel 's armies to look after in Virginia , to say nothing of our Western armies , and I may make Sheridan 's cavalry a separate command . Besides , Meade has served a long time with the Army of the Potomac , knows its subordinate officers thoroughly , and led it to a memorable victory at Gettysburg . I have just come from the West , and if I removed a deserving Eastern man from the position of army commander , my motives might be misunderstood , and the effect be bad upon the spirits of the troops . General ' Meade and I are in close contact on the field ; he is capable and perfectly subordinate , and by attending to the details he relieves me of much unnecessary work , and gives me more time to think and to mature my general plans . I will always see that he gets full credit for what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation , and one to which the general mainly adhered throughout the war ; but after that day he gave a closer personal direction in battle to the movements of subdivisions of the armies . General Meade manifested an excellent spirit through all the embarrassments which his position at times entailed . He usually showed his orders to General Grant before issuing them , and as their camps in this campaign were seldom more than a pistol-shot distant from each other , despatches from the corps commanders directed to Meade generally reached the general-in-chief about the same time . In fact , when they were together , Meade frequently handed despatches to his chief to read before he read them himself . A*s Grant 's combativeness displayed itself only against the enemy , and he was a man with whom an associate could not quarrel without furnishing all the provocation himself , he and Meade continued on the best of terms officially and personally throughout this long and eventful campaign . FIELD DIVERSIONS . DURING the ten days of battle through which we had just passed very little relief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one staff-officer , a Colonel B , who often came as bearer of messages to our hea&amp;* quarters , who always managed to console himself with novel-reading , and his peculiarity in this respect became a standing joke among those who knew him . He went about with his saddle-bags stuffed full of thrilling romances , and was seen several times sitting on his horse under a brisk fire , poring over the last pages of an absorbing volume to reach the d6nouement of the plot , and evincing a greater curiosity to find how the hero and the heroine were going to be extricated from the entangled dilemma into which they had been plunged by the unsympathetic author than to learn the result of the surrounding battle . One of his peculiarities was that he took it for granted that all the people he met were perfectly familiar with his line of literature , and he talked about nothing but the merits of the latest novel . For the last week he had been devouring Victor Hugo 's ( ( Les Mis&amp;ables. * It was an English translation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was passing a house in rear of the ( ( angle ) ) he saw a young lady seated on the porch , and , stopping his horse , bowed to her with all the grace of a Chesterfield , and endeavored to engage her in conversation . Before he had gone far he took occasion to remark : ( ( By the way , have you seen ( Lees Miserables ? * anglicizing the pronunciation . Her black eyes snapped with indignation as she tartly replied : ( ( Do n't you talk to me that way ; they 're a good deal better than Grant 's miserables anyhow ! ) ) This was retold so often by those who heard it that , for some time after , its repetition seriously endangered the colonel 's peace of mind . SEIZING VANTAGE-GROUND . ON the morning of the 14th it was decided to move the headquarters of Generals Grant and Meade farther east to a position on some high ground three quarters of a mile north of the Ny River , and near the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania Court House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward on the Massaponax Church road , and came to a halt and dismounted at a house not far from the Ny River . About half a mile south of that stream , at a place called Gayle 's , there was a hill held by the enemy , which overlooked both the Massaponax and the Fredericksburg roads , and as it commanded an important position , it was decided to try to get possession of it . Just then General Upton rode up , joined the group , and addressing himself to both Generals Grant and Meade , said , with his usual enthusiasm and confidence , and speaking with great rapidity : *I can take that hill with my brigade . I hope you will let me try it ; I m certain I can take it. * He was asked bow many men he had left , as his brigade had seen very hard fighting in the last few days . He replied , ( ( About eight or nine hundred men . ) ) It was soon decided to let him make the attempt , and General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders to start forward at once and seize the position . Upton put his brigade in motion with his usual promptness , drove back the enemy in handsome style , and soon had his flags hoisted on the hilltop . But his possession of it was not of long duration . The enemy sent forward a portion of Mahone 's infantry and Chambliss 's cavalry , and Upton was compelled to fall back before superior numbers . However , there was no intention to allow the enemy to hold such an important position , and Meade directed Warren to send one of his brigades to recapture it . Ayres 's brigade moved forward with spirit , and the position was soon retaken and held . General Grant expressed to General Meade his pleasure at seeing Warren 's troops making so prompt and successful a movement , and as both officers had censured Warren on the 13th , they were anxious now to give him full credit for his present conduct . General Meade sent him the following despatch : sI thank you and Ayres for taking the hill . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two brigades to relieve Ayres . This was the only fighting on that day . GRANT AND THE WOUNDED CONFEDERATE . WHILE riding about the field General Grant stopped at a house and expressed a desire to prepare some despatches . A number of wounded were lying upon the porch and in the rooms ; they had made their way there in accordance with the usual custom of wounded 487 men to seek a house . It seems to be a natural instinct , as a house conveys the idea of shelter and of home . I walked with the general into a back room to see whether there was a dry spot which he might take possession of for a short time , to write messages and look over the maps . As we entered , there was seen sitting in the only chair a Confederate lieutenant of infantry who had been shot in the left cheek , the ball passing through his mouth and coming out near the right ear . A mass of coagulated blood covered his face and neck , and he presented a shocking appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward toward the general , and said , with a bow and a smile , ( ( Here , take my chair , sir . ) ) General Grant looked at him , and replied : ( ( Ah , you need that chair much more than I ; keep your seat . I see you are badly hurt . ) ) The officer answered good-naturedly : ( ( If you folks let me go back to our lines , I think I ought to be able to get a leave to go home and see my girl ; but I reckon she would n't know me now . ) ) The general said , *I will see that one of our surgeons does all in his power for you , * and then stepped out of the room . He told one of the surgeons who was dressing the wounds of our own men to do what he could for the Confederate . We did not hear what became of him afterward . He probably never knew that he had been talking to the general-in-chief of the Yankee armies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy had now set to work to discover the real meaning of our present movements . In the afternoon skirmishers pushed forward on our right , and found that Warren 's corps was no longer there . GRANT 'S TOILET IN CAMP . IN the night of the 14th Lee began to move troops to his right . Grant now directed Hancock 's corps to be withdrawn and massed behind the center of our line , so that it could be moved promptly in either direction . When the general got back to camp that evening his clothes were a mass of mud from head to foot , his uniform being scarcely recognizable . He sat until bedtime without making any change in his dress ; he never seemed particularly incommoded by the travel-stained condition of his outer garments , but was scrupulously careful , even in the most active campaigns , about the cleanliness of his linen and his person . The only chance for a bath was in having a barrel sawed in two and using // the half of it as a sort of sitz-bath . During most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used this method of bathing , or , as our English friends would say , ( ( tubbing . ) ) Afterward he supplied himself with a portable rubber bath-tub . While campaign life is not a good school for the cultivation of squeamishness , and while the general was always ready to rough it in camp , yet he was particularly modest in performing his toilet , and his tent fronts were always tied close , and the most perfect privacy was secured , when he was washing , or changing his clothes . While thus engaged even his servant was not allowed to enter his quarters . IMPORTANT DESPATCHES . THE next day , May 15 , the rain continued , and the difficulties of moving became still greater . Important despatches were received from the other armies . They informed the general-in-chief that General Averell 's cavalry had cut a portion of the East Tennessee railroad , and had also captured and destroyed a depot of supplies in West Virginia . Butler reported that he had captured some works near Drewry 's Bluff , on the James River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatch from Sherman saying that he had compelled Johnston to evacuate Dalton and was pursuing him closely . Sheridan reported that he had destroyed a portion of the Virginia Central and the Fredericksburg railroads in Lee 's rear , had killed General J. E. B. Stuart , completelyrouted his cavalry , and captured aportion of the outer lines of Richmond . He said he might possibly have taken Richmond by assault , but , being ignorant of the operations of General Grant and General Butler , and knowing the rapidity with which the enemy could throw troops against him , he decided that it would not be wise to make such an attempt . The loss of General Stuart was a severe blow to the enemy . He was their foremost cavalry leader , and one in whom Lee reposed great confidence . We afterward heard that he had been taken to Richmond , and had reached there before he died ; that Jefferson Davis visited his death-bed , and was greatly affected when he found that there was no hope of saving the life of this accomplished officer . THROUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On May 16 Grant wrote to Halleck : " We have had five days ' almost constant rain , with- VOL . LIII. - 62- 63. out any prospect yet of its clearing up . The roads have now become so impassable that ambulances with wounded men can no longer run between here and Fredericksburg . All offensive operations must necessarily cease until we can have twenty-four hours of dry weather . The army is in the best of spirits , and feels the greatest confidence in ultimate success . . . . The elements alone have suspended hostilities . ) ) In the Wilderness the army had to struggle against fire and dust ; now it had to contend with rain and mud . An ordinary rain , lasting for a day or two , does not embarrass troops ; but when the storm continues for a week it becomes one of the most serious obstacles in a campaign . The men can secure no proper shelter and no comfortable rest their clothing has no chance to dry ; and a tramp of a few miles through tenacious mud requires as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become saturated and weighted with water , and draft-animals have increased loads , and heavier roads over which to haul them . Dry wood can not be found ; cooking becomes difficult ; the men 's spirits are affected by the gloom , and even the most buoyant natures become disheartened . It is much worse for an army acting on the offensive , for it has more marching to do , being compelled to move principally on exterior lines . Staff-officers had to labor day and night during the present campaign in making reconnaissances and in cross-questioning natives , deserters , prisoners , and fugitive negroes , in an attempt to secure data for the purpose of constructing local maps from day to day . As soon as these were finished they were distributed to the subordinate commanders . Great confusion arose from the duplication of the names of houses and farms . Either family names were particularly scarce in that section of the State , or else the people were united by close ties of relationship , and country cousins abounded to a confusing extent . So many farm-houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same name that , when certain farms were designated in orders , seriotis errors arose at times from mistaking one place for another . GRANT AND THE DYING SOLDIER . THE weather looked a little brighter on May 17 , but the roads were still so heavy that no movement was attempted . A few reinforcements were received at this time , mainly some heavy artillery regiments from the defenses // about Washington , who had been drilled to serve as infantry . On the 17th BrigadierGeneral R. 0 . Tyler arrived with a division of these troops , numbering , with the Corcoran Legion , which had also joined , nearly 8000 men . They were assigned to Hancock 's corps . Headquarters were this day moved about a mile and a quarter to the southeast , to a point not far from Massaponax Church . We knew that the enemy had depleted the troops on his left in order to strengthen his right wing , and on the night of the 17th Hancock and Wright were ordered to assault Lee 's left the next morning , directing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the *angle , * or , as some of the troops now called it , ( ( Hell 's Half-acre . ) ) The enemy 's position , however , had been strengthened at this point more than it was supposed , and his new line of intrenchments had been given a very formidable character . Our attacking party found the ground completely swept by a heavy and destructive fire of musketry and artillery , but in spite of this the men moved gallantly forward and made desperate attempts to carry the works . It was soon demonstrated , however , that the movement could not result in success , and the troops were withdrawn . General Grant had ridden over to the right to watch the progress of this attack . While lie was passing a spot near the roadside where there were a number of wounded , one of them , who was lying close to the roadside , seemed to attract his special notice . The man 's face was beardless ; he was evidently young ; his countenance was strikingly handsome , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage attention , even in the full tide of battle . The blood was flowing from a wound in his breast , the froth about his mouth was tinged with red , and his wandering , staring eyes gave unmistakable evidence of approaching death . Just then a young staff-officer dashed by at a full gallop , and as his horse 's hoofs struck a puddle in the road , a mass of black mud was splashed in the wounded man 's face . He gave a piteous look , as much as to say , ( ( Could n't you let me die in peace and not add to my sufferings ? ) ) The general , whose eyes were at that moment turned upon the youth , was visibly affected . He reined in his horse , and seeing from a motion he made that he was intending to dismount to bestow some care upon the young man , I sprang from my horse , ran to the side of the soldier , wiped his face with my handkerchief , spoke to him , and examined his wound ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I found that he had breathed his last . I said to the general , who waswatching the scene intently , ( ( The poor fellow is dead , ) ) remounted my horse , and the party rode on . The chief had turned round twice to look after the officer who had splashed the mud and who had passed rapidly on , as if he wished to take him to task for his carelessness . There was a painfully sad look upon the general 's face , and lie did not speak for some time . While always keenly sensitive to the sufferings of the wounded , this pitiful sight seemed to affect him more than usual . BAD NEWS . WHEN General Grant returned to his headquarters , greatly disappointed that the attack had not succeeded , he found despatches from the other armies which were by no means likely to furnish consolation to him or to the officers about him . Sigel had been badly defeated at New Market , and was in retreat ; Butler had been driven from Drewry 's Bluff , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Banks had suffered defeat in Louisiana . The general was in no sense depressed by the information , and received it in a philosophic spirit ; but he was particularly annoyed by the despatches from Sigel , for two hours before he had sent a message urging that officer to make his way to Staunton to stop supplies from being sent from there to Lee 's army . He immediately requested Halleck to have Sigel relieved and General Hunter put in command of his troops . General Canby was sent to supersede Banks , this was done by the authorities at Washington , and not upon General Grant 's suggestion , though the general thought well of Canby and made no objection . In commenting briefly upon the bad news7 General Grant said : ( ( Lee will undoubtedly reinforce his army largely by bringing Beauregard 's troops from Richmond , now that Butler has been driven back , and will call in troops from the Valley since Sigel 's defeated forces have retreated to Cedar Creek . Hoke 's troops will be needed no longer in North Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our front materially strengthened . I thought the other day that they must feel pretty blue in Richmond over the reports of our victories ; but as they are in direct telegraphic communication with the points at which the fighting took place , they were no doubt at the same time aware of our defeats , of which we // have not learned till to-day ; so probably they did not feel as badly as we imagined . ) ) The general was not a man to waste any time over occurrences of the past ; his first thoughts were always to redouble his efforts to take the initiative and overcome disaster by success . Now that his co*iperating armies had failed him , he determined upon still bolder movements on the part of the troops under his immediate direction . As the weather was at this time more promising , his first act was to sit down at his field-desk and write an order providing for a general movement by the left flank toward Richmond , to begin the next night , May 19 . He then sent to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supplies to Port Royal on the Rappahannock . ATTEMPT TO TURN OUR RIGHT . THE fact that a change had been made in the position of our troops , and that Hancock 's corps had been withdrawn from our front and placed in rear of our center , evidently made Lee suspect that some movement was afoot , and he determined to send General Ewell 's corps to try to turn our right , and to put Early in readiness to coöperate in the movement if it should promise success . In the afternoon of May19 , a little after five o'clock , I was taking a nap in my tent , to try to make up for the sleep lost the night before . Aides-de-camp in this campaign were usually engaged in riding back and forth during the night between headquarters and the different commands , communicating instructions for the next day , and had to catch their sleep in instalments . I was suddenly awakened by my colored servant crying out to me : ( ( Wake up , sah , fo ' God 's sake ! De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ) He was in a state of feverish excitement , and his face seemed two shades lighter than its ordinary hue . The black boys were not to be blamed for manifesting fright , for they all had a notion that their lives would not be worth praying for if they fell into the hands of the enemy and were recognized as persons who had made their escape from slavery to serve in the Yankee army . Hearing heavy firing in the direction of our rear , I put my head out of the tent , and seeing the general and staff standing near their horses , which had been saddled , I called for my horse and hastened to join them . Upon my inquiring what the matter was , the general said : ( ( The enemy is detaching a large force to turn our right . I wish you would ride to the point of attack , and keep me posted as to the movement , and urge upon the commanders of the troops in that vicinity not only to check the advance of the enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can say that Warren 's corps will be ordered to coöperate promptly . ) ) General Meade had already sent urgent orders to his troops nearest the point threatened . I started up the Fredericksburg road , and saw a large force of infantry advancing , which proved to be the troops of Ewell 's corps who had crossed the Ny River . In the vicinity of the Harris house , about a mile east of the Ny , I found General Tyler 's division posted on the Fredericksburg road , with Kitching 's brigade on his left . By Meade 's direction Hancock had been ordered to send a division to move at double-quick to Tyler 's support , and Warren 's Maryland brigade arrived on the ground later . The enemy had made a vigorous attack on Tyler and Kitching , and the contest was raging fiercely along their lines . I rode up to Tyler , who was an old army friend , found him making every possible disposition to check the enemy 's advance , and called out to him : ( ( Tyler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who has a chance to make such a debut on joining an army . You are certain to knock a brevet out of this day 's fight . ) ) He said : ( ( As you see , my men are raw hands at this sort of work , but they are behaving like veterans . ) ) Hancock had arrived on the ground in person , and when Birney 's troops of his corps came up they were put into action on Tyler 's right . Crawford , of Warren 's corps , arrived about dark , and was put in position on the left . The brunt of the attack , however , had been broken by the troops upon which it first fell . Each regiment of Tyler 's heavy artillery was as large as some of our brigades . These regiments had been thoroughly drilled and disciplined in the defenses about Washington , but this was their first engagement , and their new uniforms and bright muskets formed a striking contrast to the travelstained clothing and dull-looking arms of the other regiments . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of the new troops . They would cry out to them : ( ( How are you , heavies ? Is this work heavy enough far you ? You re doing well , my sons . If you keep on like this a couple of years , you 11 learn all the tricks of the trade . ) ) They were particularly anxious to get hold of the new arms of the fresh troops , and when a man was shot down a veteran would promptly seize his gun in exchange for his // own , which had become much the worse for wear in the last week 's rain-storms . The fighting was exceedingly obstinate , and continued until after nine o'clock ; but by that hour the enemy had been driven back at all points , and forced to beat a rapid retreat across the Ny . His loss in killed and wounded was severe , and we captured over four hundred prisoners from him . We did not escape a considerable loss on our side , six hundred of our men having been killed and wounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw in the vicinity of the Fredericksburg road a row of men stretched upon the ground , looking as if they had lain down in line of battle to sleep . He started to shake several of them , and cried out : ( ( Get up ! What do you mean by going to sleep at such a time as this ? ) ) He was shocked to find that this row consisted entirely of dead bodies lying as they fell , shot down in ranks with their alinement perfectly preserved . The scene told with mute eloquence the story of their valor and the perfection of their discipline . The brevet rank predicted for Tyler was conferred upon him for his services in this engagement , and it had been fairly won . Lee had evidently intended to make Ewell 's movement a formidable one , for Early had received orders to coöperate in the attack if it should promise success , and during the afternoon he sent forward a brigade which made an assault in his front . The attempt , however , was a complete failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously issued for the general movement by the left flank from being carried out until the night of the 20th . The Army of the Potomac had been embarrassed by having too much artillery . Finding that the country through which it had to move was more difficult than had been supposed , General Grant gave an order on the 19th to send ninety-two guns back to Washington . ( ( BILL . ) ) THE next morning , May 20 , the general was later than ustlal in making his appearance , in consequence of having overslept . Finally his voice was heard calling from his tent to his colored servant : ( ( Bill ! Ho , Bill ! What time is it ? * The servant ran to him , found he was still in bed , and told him the hour . In scarcely more than ten minutes the general appeared at the mess-table . We were not surprised at the rapidity with which he had dressed himself , for we had learned by this time that in putting on his clothes he was as quick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers at headquarters were called up particularly early to start on the march , every one did his utmost to be on time and not keep the general waiting ; but , however vigorous the effort , no one could match him in getting on his clothes . There was seldom any occasion for such hurried dressing , but with him it was a habit which continued through life . Bill , the servant who waited on the general , was a notable character . He was entirely a creature of accident . When the general was at Cairo in 1861 , Bill suddenly appeared one day at headquarters with two other slave boys , who had just escaped from their former masters in Missouri . They belonged to that class of fugitive blacks who were characterized by those given to artistic comparisons as ( ( charcoal sketches from the hands of the old masters . ) ) Bill was of a genuine burnt-cork hue , and no white blood contaminated the purity of his lineage . He at once set himself to work without orders , taking care of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character resisted all efforts of that officer to discharge him . When any waiter was absent , or even when all were present , he would turn up in the headquarters mess-tent and insist on helping the general at table . Then he attached himself to Colonel Boomer , and forced that officer in spite of himself to submit to his services . After the colonel had been killed in the assault on Vicksburg , Bill suddenly put in an appearance again at headquai*ters , and was found making himself useful to the general , notwithstanding the protests of the other servants , and before long he had himself regularly entered upon the general 's private pay-roll . When his chief came East , Bill followed , and gradually took entire charge of the general 's personal comfort as valet , waiter , and man of all work . He was devoted , never known to be beyond call , had studied the general 's habits so carefully that he could always anticipate his few wants , and became really very useful . I had a striking illustration one morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general 's comfort . While we were camping in the region of wood-ticks , garter-snakes , and beetles , I saw Bill in front of the general 's tent thrusting his hand first into one of the chief 's boots and then into the other . ( ( What are you doing that for , Bill ? ) ) I asked . ( ( Oh , ) ) he explained , 4 allers feels around in de gin'ral 's boots afore I lets him put dem on , to see dat no insec 's done got into dem de pre // v ' US night . ) ) He followed in the general 's shadow all through his Presidential terms , then he insisted upon attempting business in Washington , and afterward tried his hand at preaching ; but he had fed so long at the public crib that his appetite had been spoiled for any other means of sustaining life , and he finally made his way into a government department as messenger , where he still is and where it is hoped that his eventful life may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public services entitle him . He will not be as dramatic an historical character as Napoleon 's Mameluke , but in his humble way he was as faithful and devoted to his chief as the famous Roustan . GRANT 'S UNPROTECTED HEADQUARTERS . IN discussing the contemplated movement to the left , General Grant said on the morning of May 20 : ( ( My chief anxiety now is to draw Lee out of his works and fight him in the open field , instead of assaulting him behind his intrenchments . The movement of Early yesterday gives me some hope that Lee may at times take the offensive , and thus give our troops the desired opportunity. * In this , however , the general was disappointed ; for the attack of the 19th was the last offensive movement in force that Lee ventured to make during the entire campaign . The series of desperate battles around Spotsylvania had ended , but other soil was now to be stained by the blood of fratricidal war . Torbert 's cavalry division began the march to the South on May 20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out for Milford Station , a distance of about twenty miles , to take up a position on the south bank of the Mattapony . Guiney 's Station was reached the next morning , after a night march of eight miles . Hancock 's advance crossed the Mattapony at noon and intrenched its position . At ten o'clock that morning Warren had moved south , and that night he reached the vicinity of Guiney 's Station . Burnside put his corps in motion as soon as the road was clear of Hancock 's troops , and was followed by Wright . Generals Grant and Meade , with their staffs , took up their march on May 21 , following the road taken by Hancock 's corps , and late in the afternoon reached Guiney 's Station . Our vigilant signal-officers , who had made every effort to read the enemy 's signals , now succeeded in deciphering an important despatch , from which it was learned that Lee had discovered the movement that our forces were making . While riding forward , a little in advance of headquarters , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the opposite side of a stream which we were approaching . This made us feel a little apprehensive for the safety of the commanding generals , as Hancock was many miles in advance , and the head of Warren 's corps was a considerable distance in the rear . Our party , besides a small cavalry and infantry escort , consisted entirely of officers , many of them of high rank . One might have said of it what Curran said of the books in his library , ( ( Not numerous , but select. * It was promptly decided to order the regiment of infantry commanded by Colonel C. H. T. Collis , which served as General Meade 's headquarters guard , to make a dash across the stream and endeavor to drive the enemy from his position on the opposite bank . This was promptly and gallantly done , and the detachment of the enemy soon beat a rapid retreat . General Grant sat on his horse quietly smoking his cigar , and watched the fight with considerable interest . It was suggested that , before pitching camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the road on which we had advanced until Warren 's troops should be met ; but General Grant made light of the proposition and ordered the camp to be established where we were , saying , *I think , instead of our going back , we had better hurry Warren forward. * Suggestions to the general to turn back fell as usual upon deaf ears . GRANT AND THE VIRGINIA LADY . WHILE our people were putting up the tents and making preparations for supper , General Grant strolled over to a house near by , owned by a Mr. Chandler , and sat down on the porch . I accompanied him , and took a seat beside him . In a few minutes a lady came to the door , and was surprised to find that the visitor was the general-in-chief . He was always particularly civil to ladies , and he rose to his feet at once , took off his hat , and made a courteous bow . She was ladylike and polite in her behavior , and she and the general soon became engaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , among other things : ( ( This house has witnessed some sad scenes . One of our greatest generals died here just a year ago - General Jackson- Stonewall Jackson of blessed memory. * ( ( Indeed ! ) ) remarked General Grant . ( *He and I were at West Point together for a year , and we served in the same army in Mexico . ) ) ( ( Then you must have // known how good and great he was , * said the lady . ( ( Oh , yes , ) ) replied the general ; ( ( he was a sterling , manly cadet , and enjoyed the respect of every one who knew him . He was always of a religious turn of mind , and a plodding , hard-working student . His standing was at first very low in his class , but by his indomitable energy he mai*aged to graduate quite high . He was a gallant soldier and a christian gentleman , and I can understand fully the admiration your people have for him . ) ) ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellorsville , * she continued . ( ( You probably know , sir , that he had been wounded in the left arm and right hand by his own men , who fired upon him accidentally in the night , and his arm had been amputated on the field . The operation was very successful , and he was getting along nicely ; but the wet applications made to the wound brought on pneumonia , and it was that which caused his death . He lingered till the next Sunday afternoon , May 10 , and then he was taken from us. * Here the lady of the house became very much affected , and almost broke down in recalling the sad event . Our tents had by this time been pitched , and the general , after taking a polite leave of his hostess , and saying he would place a guard over her house to see that no damage was done to her property , walked over to camp , and soon after sat down with the mess to a light supper . A RACE FOR THE NORTH ANNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this movement left so great a distance between Hancock 's corps and the rest of his army . He did it intentionally , and under the circumstances it was unquestionably wise generalship . He was determined to try by every means in his power to tempt Lee to fight outside of his intrenched lines . He had in the battles of the last two weeks thoroughly measured Lee 's capacity as an opponent , and he believed it would be difficult to force him to take the offensive unless some good opportunity were offered . He knew that Lee , from the distance over which he would have to move his troQps , could not attack the isolated Hancock with more than an army corps . Such a force he was certain Hancock could whip ; and Grant , being in close communication with the several corps , felt that he could bring up reinforcements as rapidly as the enemy , and that the chances would be greatly in his favor if he could thus bring on an engagement in the open field . There was no question in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get at him . The next morning , May 22 , headquarters moved south , following the line which had been taken by Hancock 's troops , which ran parallel with the Fredericksburg railroad . The officers and men had never experienced a more sudden change of feelings and prospects . The weather was pleasant , the air was invigorating , the sun was shining brightly , and the roads were rapidly drying up . The men had been withdrawn from the scenes of their terrific struggles at Spotsylvania , and were no longer confronting formidable earthworks . The features of the country had also entirely changed . Though there were many swamps , thickets , and streams with difficult approaches , the deep gloom of the Wilderness had been left behind . The country was now more open , and presented many clearings , and the range of vision was largely increased . The roads were broad , the land was well cultivated , and the crops were abundant . The men seemed to breathe a new atmosphere , and were inspired with new hope . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles they were now gaining toward the enemy 's capital , and out of reach of fire , made them experience that buoyancy of feeling which always accompanies the prestige of success . But while the country was covered with farms and houses , there was scarcely an inhabitant to be seen . Most of the able-bodied men were serving in the armies , and the slaves had been driven farther south . Many of the non-combatants had gone away to escape the invading army , and the only people encountered were women and children and old and decrepit men . The corps were now rapidly moving toward Hanover Junction , which is about twenty-five miles north of Richmond . Lee , notwithstanding his superior means of obtaining information , had not begun to move until Hancock 's corps had crossed the Mattapony at Milford . He then started rapidly down the Telegraph road , and as he had a shorter route than the Union forces , it appears that he reached Hanover Court House at the head of Ewell 's corps at 9:30 o'clock on May 22 . His telegrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived in regard to Grant 's movements . He reported at that time : " I have learned , as yet , nothing of the movements of the enemy east of the Mattapony . ) ) The day before , in speaking of the position of Grant 's army , he said : 4 fear this will secure him // from attack until he crosses the Pamunkey . ) ) Even after Grant had crossed the Mattapony , Lee spoke of the Union forces as being east of that river , and was hurrying forward troops in order to prevent Grant from crossing the Pamunkey , a stream formed by the junction of the North Anna and the South Anna rivers , while Grant was in reality moving toward the North Anna . In these movements Lee was entirely outgeneraled . On the morning of May 22 Hancock was instructed to remain at Milford during the day , while the other corps were directed to move south by roads which would not separate them by distances of more than four miles . It appears to have been about midday of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our advance toward the North Anna . Hancock could not well have reached Hanover Junction before Lee , for Lee 's route from the right of his intrenchments on the Po to Hanover Junction by the Telegraph road was about twenty-eight miles , while the route of Hancock 's corps from Anderson 's Mill to Hanover Junction via Bowling Green was about thirty-four miles ; besides , as Hancock was advancing with a detached corps through an enemy 's country and over unknown roads , he had to move with caution . A NOONDAY HALT AT MRS . TYLER 'S . EARLY in the afternoon General Grant decided to halt for a couple of hours , to be in easy communication with the troops that were following . He selected for the halt a plantation. which was beautifully situated on high ground , commanding a charming view of the valley of the Mattapony . A very comfortable house stood not far from the road *dong which Burnside 's corps was marching . In making halts of this kind a house was usu*ally selected , for the reason that good water was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps and conducting correspondence . General Grant never entered any of the houses , as they were usually occupied by ladies , and he did not wish to appear to invade their dwellings ; he generally sat on the porch . When we reached this plantation , the escort and the junior staffofficers lounged about the grounds in the shade of the trees , while General Grant , accompanied by two or three of us who were riding with him , dismounted , and ascended the steps of the porch . A very gentle and prepossessing-looking lady standing in the doorway was soon joined by an older woman . General Grant bowed courteously and said , ( ( With your permission , I will spend a few hours here . ) ) The younger lady replied very civilly , ( ( Certainly , sir . ) ) The older one exclaimed abruptly , " I do hope you will not let your soldiers ruin our place and carry away our property . ) ) The general answered politely , " I will order a gu*rd to keep the men out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ) ; and at once gave the necessary instructions . The ladies , seeing that the officer with whom they were conversing was evidently one of superior rank , became anxious to know who he was , and the older one stepped up to me , and in a whisper asked his name . Upon being told that he was General Grant , she seented greatly surprised , and in a rather excited manner informed the other lady of the fact . The younger lady , whose name was Mrs. Tyler , said that she was the wife of a colonel in the Confederate army , who was serving with General Joe Johnston in the West ; but she had not heard from him for some time , and she was very anxious to learn through General Grant what news he had from that quarter . The general said , " Sherman is advancing upon Rome , and ought to have reached that place by this time . ) ) Thereupon the older lady , who proved to be the mother-in-law of the younger one , said very sharply : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know all about that country , and you have n't an army that will ever take it . We all know very well t*t Sherman is making no headway against General Johnston 's army . ) ) We could see that she was entertaining views which everywhere prevailed in the South . The authorities naturally put the best face upon matters , and the newspapers tried to buoy up the people with false hopes . It was not surprising that the inhabitants of the remote parts of the country were in ignorance of the true progress of the war . General Grant replied in a quiet way : ( ( General Sherman is certainly advancing rapidly in that direction ; and while I do not wish to be the communicator of news which may be unpleasant to you , I have every reason to believe that Rome is by this time in his possession. * The older lady then assumed a bantering tone , and became *somewhat excited and defiant in her manner ; and the younger one joined with her in scouting the idea that Rome could ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Washington containing a telegram from Sherman . General Grant glanced over it , and then read it to the staff . It announced // that Sherman had just captured Rome . The ladies had caught the purport of the communication , although it was not intended that they should hear it . The wife burst into tears , and the mother-in-law was much affected by the news , which . was of course sad tidings to both of them . The mother then began to talk with great rapidity and with no little asperity , saying : " I came from Richmond not long ago , where I lived in a house on the James River which overlooks Belle Isle ; and I had the satisfaction of looking down every day on the Yankee prisoners . I saw thousands and thousands of them , and before this campaign is over I want to see the whole of the Yankee army in Southern prisons. * Just then Burnside rode into the yard , dismounted , and joined our party on the porch . He was a man of great gallantry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentler sex . He raised his hat , made a profound bow to the ladies , and , as he looked at his corps filing by on the road , said to the older one , who was standing near him , " I do n't suppose , madam , that you ever saw so many Yankee soldiers before . ) ) She replied instantly : ( ( Not at liberty , sir . ) ) This was such a good shot that every one was greatly amused , and General Grant joined heartily in the laugh that followed at Burnside 's expense . GRANT CROSSES THE NORTH ANNA . HANcocK 's corps had been fighting and marching almost continuously for over a week , both day and night , and the halt on May22 was made to give a much needed rest . It was a curious study to watch the effect which the constant exposure to fire had produced upon the nervous system of the troops . Their nerves had become so sensitive that the men would start at the slightest sound , and dodge at the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past them . One of their amusements in camp at that time was to throw stones and chips past one another 's heads , and raise a laugh at the active dodging , and bending the body low or ( ( jack-knifing ) ) as the men called it . This did not indicate any loss of courage ; it was merely an effect produced by a temporary physical condition which the men could not control , and gave ample evidence of the nervous strain to which they had so long been subjected . Dodging the head under fire is often as purely involuntary as winking . I have known , in my experience , only two men who could remain absolutely immovable under a heavy fire , without even the twitching of a muscle . One was a bugler in the cavalry , and the other was General Grant . In the evening of the 22d the general-inchief issued written orders directing the movement of the troops for the nexf day . The march was to begin at five o'clock in the morning , and the several corps were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads to ascertain the position of the enemy . The purpose was to cross the North Anna River west of the Fredericksburg railroad , and to strike Lee wherever he could be found . To understand the topography of the country , it is necessary to explain that the North Anna and the South Anna run in an easterly direction , at a distance from each other of eight or ten miles in the vicinity of the region in which Grant 's operations took place , and unite and form the Pamunkey River about five miles east of the line of the Fredericksburg railroad . This road crossed the North Anna about two miles north of Hanover Junction , the intersection of the Fredericksburg and the Virginia Central railroads . The Telegraph road crossed the river bya wooden bridge half a mile west of the rail* road bridge . Farther up the river there were three fords about a mile and a half apart . Hancock riiarched to the Telegraph-road bridge , Burnside to Ox Ford , and Warren to Jericho Ford . Wright followed Warren ; Burnside 's corps used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken by the corps of Hancock and Warren . Hancock approached the river at the Telegraph-road bridge about noon . He found the enemy holding an earthwork on the north side , and saw a force posted on the opposite bank . Seeing the importance of gaining possession of the defensive work , he determined to take it by assault , and did so handsomely , some of the enemy being captured , and the rest driven over the bridge , followed closely by our men . The retreating force was thrown into great confusion , and in the rush a number were crowded off the bridge and drowned . Burnside , on reaching Ox Ford , found it held by the enemy strongly intrenched on the south bank of the river , and no attack was made . Warren reached Jericho Ford soon after noon , seized it , laid a pontoon bridge , and by 4:30 P. M. had moved his whole corps to the south bank . At six o'clock Hill 's corps attacked Warren 's line before his troops were all in position , and forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repulsed . Wright 's corps was moved up to // support Warren , but it was not deemed necessary to send it across the river until the next morning . General Grant rode during this day , May 23 , with Hancock 's corps . While halting in the afternoon at a house not far from the river , he was told by the people living there that Lee had rested for a few hours at the same house the day before , and that his entire army had crossed the river . On the morning of the 24th Hancock crossed to the south side . Crittenden 's division crossed the river and joined Warren 's corps . They advanced against the enemy with a view of dislodging him from his position at Ox Ford , but his lines were found so strong that after a brief encounter our forces withdrew . They had not been able to take with them any artillery . That night our whole army , except one division of Burnside 's corps , was on the south side of the river and close up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GENERAL headquarters were established near Chesterfield Station on May 24 . That day Sheridan returned from his memorable cavalry raid , and was warmly greeted by General Grant at headquarters , and heartily congratulated upon his signal success . He related some of the principal incidents in the raid very graphically , but with becoming modesty . In describing a particularly hot fight , he would become highly animated in manner and dramatic in gesture ; then he would turn to some ludicrous incident , laugh heartily , and seem to enjoy greatly the recollection of it . It will be remembered that he started out suddenly on May 8 , passed round the right of Lee 's army , keeping out of reach of his infantry , crossed the North Anna in the night , destroyed ten miles of the Virginia Central railroad , together with cars , locomotives , and a large amount of army supplies , recaptured three hundred and Seventy-five of our prisoners on their way from Spotsylvania to Richmond , crossed the South Anna , struck the Fredericksburg road at Ashland , and destroyed the depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a large supply of army stores . Finding that the enemy 's cavalry were concentrating , he united his divisions , which had been operating at different points in the work of destruction , and fought a pitched battle at Yellow Tavern , about seven miles north of Richmond , capturing two pieces of artillery , mortally wounding the commander , J. E. B. Stuart , and killing Brigadier-general James B. Gordon . He then entered the advanced lines of intrenchments north of Richmond , crossed the Chickahommy , and reached Haxall 's Landing , on the James , where he replenished his supplies from stores sent to him by Butler . After remaining there from the 14th to the 17th of May , he started on his return to the Army of the Potomac . He had lost only four hundred and twenty-five men in killed , wounded , and missing . One important effect of Sheridan 's operations was that he compelled all of the enemy 's cavalry to be moved against him , which left our large train of four thousand wagons free from their attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teasing officers with whom he was on terms of intimacy , and in this interview he began to joke with his cavalry leader by saying to those who were gathered about him : ( ( Now , Sheridan evidently thinks he has been clear down to the James River , and has been breaking up railroads , and even getting a peep at Richmond ; but probably this is all imagination , or else he has been reading something of the kind in the newspapers . I do n't suppose he seriously thinks that he made such a march as that in two weeks . ) ) Sheridan joined in the fun , and replied : ( ( Well , after what General Grant says , I do begin to feel doubtful as to whether I have been absent at all from the Army of the Potomac . ) ) Sheridan had become well bronzed by his exposure to the sun , and looked the picture of health . It was seen at once that the general-in-chief did not intend to give him or his command any rest . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheridan saw that all his troopers would be wanted immediately at the front . MEETING BETWEEN GRANT AND BURNSIDE . THAT evening , the 24th , General Grant issued an order , which he had been considering for some time , assigning Burnside 's corps to the Army of the Potomac , and putting him under the command of Meade . It was found that such a consolidation would be much better for purposes of administration , and give more unity to the movements . It had been heretofore necessary to inform Meade of the iimstructions given to Burnside , and to let Burnside know of the movements that were to be undertaken by Meade , in order that the commanders might understand fully what was intended to be accomplished , and be in a position to coöperate intelligently . This involved much correspondence and consumed // time . The new order was intended to avoid this , and simplify the methods which had been employed . While General Grant was riding past the headquarters of Burnside the next morning , Burnside came out of his tent , and in company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had now halted by the roadside , shook hands with him , and said : " I have received the instructions assigning my command to the Army of the Potomac . That order is excellent ; it is a military necessity , and I am glad it has been issued . ) ) This conduct of Burnside gave the greatest satisfaction to the general-in-chief , and he commented very favorably upon it afterward . It must be recollected in this connection that Burnside was senior in rank to Meade , and had commanded the Army of the Potomac when Meade was a division commander under him ; and the manner in which Burnside acquiesced in his new assignment , and the spirit he manifested in his readiness to set aside all personal aims and ambitions for the public good , were among the many instances of his patriotism and his absolute loyalty to the cause he served . DESTROYING A RAILROAD . THE general headquarters were moved farther west on May 25 , and established on the north side of the North Anna , near Quarles ' Ford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day it became evident that Lee was going to make a permanent stand between the North and the South Anna . His position was found to be exceedingly strong , and was somewhat similar to the one taken up at Spotsylvania . The lines were shaped something like the letter U , with the base resting on the river at Ox Ford . It had one face turned toward Hancock , and the other toward Warren . The lines were made exceedingly formidable by means of strong earthworks with heavy obstructions planted in front , and were flanked on the right by an impenetrable swamp , and on the left by Little River . General Grant said , in discussing the situation at this time : ( ( It now looks as if Lee 's position were such that it would not be prudent to fight a battle in the narrow space between these two rivers , and I shall withdraw our army from its present position , and make another flank march to the left ; but I want , while we are here , to destroy a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which Lee is receiving a large part of his supplies and reinforcements . ) ) He ended the conversation by directing me to cross the river and superintend this operation . I went with a portion of Russell 's division of Wright 's corps , which began the work of destruction at a point on the railroad about eight hundred yards from the enemy 's extreme left . A brigade was extended along one side of the road in single rank , and at a given signal the men took hold of the rails , lifted up the road , and turned it upside down . Then , breaking the rails loose , they used them as levers in prying off the cross-ties , which they piled up at different points , laid the rails across them and set fire to the ties . As soon as the rails became sufficiently hot they bent in the middle by their own weight ; efforts were then made to twist them so as to render them still more unserviceable . Several miles of railway were thus destroyed . THE ENEMY REINFORCED . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lee 's army had reached him . Between 12,000 and 15,000 men arrived from the 22d to the 25th of May . Breckinridge had come from the valley of Virginia with nearly all of his forces ; Pickett brought a division from the vicinity of Richmond ; and Hoke 's brigade of Early 's division had also been sent to Lee from the Confederate capital . On the 22d , as soon as Grant had learned the extent of the disaster to Butler 's army on the James , he said that Butler was not detaining 10,000 men in Richmond , and not even keeping the roads south of that city broken , and he considered it advisable to have the greater part of Butler 's troops join in the campaign of the Army of the Potomac . On May 25 he telegraphed orders to Halleck , saying : ( ( Send Butler 's forces to White House , to land on the north side , and march up to join this army . The James River should be held to City Point , but leave nothing more than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive . The enemy will not undertake any offensive operations there , but will concentrate everything here . ) ) At the same time he said : " If Hunter can possibly get to Charlottesville and Lynchburg , he should do so , living on the country . The railroads and canals should be destroyed beyond the possibility of repair for weeks. * These instructions were given in consequence of the withdrawal of Breckinridge 's command , which left the valley of Virginia undefended . A FEMALE ODDITY . WHEN I recrossed the river and returned to headquarters in the evening , I found General // Grant sitting in front of his tent smoking a cigar and anxious to hear the report as to the extent of the damage to the railroad . About the time I finished relating to him what had been accomplished , an old woman who occupied a small house near by strolled over to headquarters , apparently bent upon having a friendly chat with the commander of the Yankee armies . The number of questions she asked showed that she was not lacking in the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . She wore an old-fashioned calico dress about six inches too short , with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows . She had a nose so sharp that it looked as if it had been caught in the crack of a door , and small gray eyes that twinkled and snapped as she spoke . She began by nodding a familiar " How do you do ? ) ) to the general , and saying in a voice which squeaked like the high notes of an E-flat clarinet with a soft reed : " I believe you command all these h'yah Yankees that are comm ' down h'yah and cavortin ' round over this whole section of country . ) ) The general boxved an assent , and she continued : *I m powerful glad General Lee has been lickin ' you-all from the Rapidan cl'ah down h'yah , and that now he s got you jes wh'ah he wants you. * Then she drew up a camp-chair alongside the general , seated herself on it , and finding that her remarks seemed to be received good-naturedly , grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ( Yes , and afo ' long Lee 11 be a-chasm ' you-all up through Pennsyivany ag'in . Was you up than in Pennsylvany when he got aftah you-all last summer ? ) ) The general had great difficulty in keeping his face straight as he replied : ( ( Well , no ; I was n't there myself . I had some business in another direction . ) ) He did not explain to her that Vicksburg was at that time commanding something of his attention . Said she : " I notice our boys got away with lots of em Conestoga hosses up than , and they brought lots of em back with em . We ye got a pretty good show of em round this section of country , and they re jes the best drafthosses you ever see . Hope the boys 11 get up than ag'in soon , and bring back some more of em . " The general kept on smoking his cigar , and was greatly amused by the conversation . After a little while the woman went back to her house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h'yah ; I m all alone in my house , and I am kinder skeerd . I expect them Yankee soldiers of yourn 11 steal everything I have , and murder me afo ' morning , if you do n't give me some protection . ) ) ( ( Oh , ) ) replied the general , ( ( we will see that you are not hurt * and turning to Lieutenant Dunn of the staff , he said : ( ( Dunn , you had better go and stay in the old lady 's house to-night . You can probably make yourself more comfortable there than in camp , anyhow ; and I do n't want her to be frightened . ) ) Dunn followed the old woman rather reluctantly to her house , and played guardian angel to her till the next morning . GRANT RECROSSES THE NORTH ANNA . GENERAL GRANT had now presented to him for solution a very formidable military problem . Lee 's position , from the strength and location of his intrenchments and the defensive character of the country , was impregnable , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving great loss of life . The general had therefore decided to withdraw , and make another movement by the left flank , in the hope of so maneuvering as to afford another opportunity of getting a chance to st rike Lee outside his earthworks . However , a withdrawal in the face of a vigilant foe , and the crossing of a difficult river within sight of the enemy , constitute one of the most hazardous movements in warfare . There was the possibility , also , that Lee might mass his artillery on his left flank , and try to hold it by this means and with a minimum of his infantry , and with the bulk of his army move out on his right in an attempt to crush Hancock 's corps . This is exactly what Grant himself would have done under similar circumstances ; but he had by this time become familiar with Lee 's methods , and had very little apprehension that he would take the offensive . Nevertheless , Hancock was ordered to take every precaution against a possible assault . The withdrawal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instructive lesson in warfare . In the first place , the enemy had to be deceived and thrown off his guard to make the movement at all safe . For this purpose Wilson 's division of cavalry was transferred to the right of the army on May 25 , and ordered to cross the North Anna and proceed to Little River on Lee 's extreme left , and make a vigorous demonstration , to convey the impression that there was a movement of the army in that direction with a view to turning Lee 's left . This was done so effectually that Lee telegraphed to Richmond the next morning : ( ( From present indications the enemy seems to contemplate // a movement on our left flank . ) ) During the night of the 25th the trains and all of the artillery , which was in position on our right wing , were quietly moved to the north bank of the river . Russell 's division of the Sixth Corps was also withdrawn and moved in the rear of Burnside , and at daylight the next morning halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the enemy during the day . Its position in front of the enemy had been skilfully filled with men from the other parts of the command , and its absence was not discovered . Early in the morning of May26 instructions were issued for the withdrawal of the entire army that night . After these orders had been despatched , the general seated himself in front of his tent for a quiet smoke . In a few minutes the old woman who had had the familiar chat with him the evening before rushed over to his tent in a high state of excitement . Swinging her arms like the fans of a windmill , and screaming at the top of her shrill voice , she cried out : " See h'yah ; these Yankees o ' yourn got into my bahn last night , and stole the only hoss I had , and I want you to send some of your folks out to find him and bring him back . ) ) The general listened to her story , and when she had finished remarked quietly : *Madam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that belong up in Pennsylvania , and some of our men have made up their minds to take him back home . ) ) The old lady at this remark was rather crestfallen , and said with a grin : ( ( Well , I reckon you ye got me on that ; but you Yankees have no business down h'yah anyhow , and I think you might get me back that hoss. * The general replied : ( ( I m very sorry indeed that this has occurred , and if the army were in camp I would send you around with a guard to see whether the horse could be recognized by you and recovered ; but the troops are moving constantly , and it would be utterly impossible to find the animal . ) ) She finally went off , shaking her fist and muttering : " I m sart'in of one thing , anyhow : General Lee 11 just dust you-all out of this place afo ' you kin say scat . ) ) The operations of the last two days had made the duties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were feeling the effects of the last week 's hard work and exposure , the loss of sleep , and the breathing of a malarious atmosphere . In conijection with the renewal of the work of destroying the railroad , I was sent across the river again on the 26th , and on returning that afternoon to headquarters found myself suffering severely from fever and sick-headache . About dark General Grant wished me to make another trip to the extreme right , to assist in the work of withdrawing the troops , as I was particularly familiar with that part of the lines . Sickness is no excuse in the field , so I started across the river again without making my condition known to the general . To make matters worse , a thunder-storm came up , accompanied by vivid lightning , and between the flashes the darkness was so impenetrable that it was slow work finding the roads . Babcock , seeing my condition , volunteered to accompany me , so that if I gave out , the orders I was carrying might still reach their destination . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On my return to headquarters a surgeon supplied me liberally with roundshot in the form of quinine pills , which were used so effectively that my fever was soon forced to beat a retreat . As soon as it was dark the other divisions of Wright 's corps had begun the recrossing of the river . This corps followed the route which had been taken by Russell 's division , while Warren took a road a little farther to the north . Burnside and Hancock next withdrew , and so cautiously that their movements entirely escaped detection by the enemy . All the corps left strong guards in their fronts , which were withdrawn at the last moment . The pontoon bridges were taken up after crossing the river , and cavalry was sent to the several fords to hold them after they had been abandoned by the infantry , and to destroy any facilities for crossing which had been neglected . The withdrawal from the North Anna had now been successfully accomplished .                 @ @ @ @
