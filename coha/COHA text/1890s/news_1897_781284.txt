txt Lispenard Stewart , President of the State Prison Commission , paid his first visit to Auburn Prison to-day . After an inspection of the institution he submitted to an interview , in which he expressed his satisfaction of the condition of affairs as he found them , and he also made several suggestions . " The general public , " he said , " does not understand the condition of affairs . In this prison there are only about 250 men unemployed . There is no frantic clutching of iron bars , no eyeballs starting from the sockets , as has been intimated . The men are not threatened with insanity . " He declared that the cells were too small , but said it was better than to have two men . in a cell , as was made necessary at Sing-Sing . Continuing , he said : " You may say that the Commissioners feel that as the prison has accommodations for 1,250 men , with only 1,056 inmates , transfers should be made from other prisons which are overcrowded . There is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is room to spare in other institutions . " In speaking of the woman 's department of the prison he said : " I am delighted with it . I can not understand why the Judges throughout the State persist in sending women to penitentiaries when they should send them here . It is cop trary to the intent of the law passed last Winter , but there is no way to compel the Judges to do this , as there is an old law on the statute books which makes it discretionary with the courts . There should be some new legislation compelling the incarceration of women offenders in this model institution . If all the Judges of the State could only see this prison they would prefer sending women here , for it Is far ahead of any penitentiary. "
