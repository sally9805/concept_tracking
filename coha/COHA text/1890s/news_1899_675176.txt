txt " The Dewey fund has been started , " said Assistant Secretary Vanderlip to-night . " Very simple machinery has been employed to open it , and the rest must depend to a large extent upon the newspapers that have suggested the raising of the money with which to present a home to him . The first subscription was received soon after noon to-day . It was for $250 , and came from The Baltimore American , to which newspaper a receipt was sent in acknowledgment of the contribution . The second subscription was made by F. S. Deland of the Treasury Department , who contributed a day 's salary . " The committee to direct the subscription , on behalf of the newspapers that have suggested it , consisting of Assistant Secretary F. A. Vanderlip , United States Treasurer E. H. Roberts , Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Allen , Brig . Gen. H. C. Corbin , Adjutant General of the Army , and First Assistant Postmaster General Perry S. Heath , met at noon to-day at the Treasury Department and was organized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts as Treasurer . In addition to that , nothing was done toward arranging a plan , except to suggest that the Governors of the different States be added to the committee to receive subscriptions , and that a form of receipt be provided with which to acknowledge the sums of money sent to the Chairman of the committee . Mr. Vanderlip said after the meeting that additional arrangements would be adopted from day to day as they became necessary , but the main thing , in the estimation of the committee , was to get the work started . That the proposition is a popular one , agreeable to a sentiment almost unanimous , Mr. Vanderlip found from the fact that he had received many letters and telegraphic dispatches from all parts of the country asking if the idea of making a handsome gift to Admiral Dewey was to take shape . Business men , patriotic organizations , clubs , people of large and small means , all appeared to be desirous of participating in the testimonial . It is perfectly evident , " said Mr. Vander-lip. " that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The temper of the country is apparent , and the inclination to be very generous is revealed by the offers from every section . It does not seem to me to be desirable to limit the amount to be contributed , for it is apparent that if the amount to be raised were fixed at $100,000 , as suggested , it would not afford a chance to a fraction of those who wish to be among the number to honor our naval hero . " So far as I am aware now , the selection of the site and construction of the house will be left until Admiral Dewey can be consulted . He has not been notified by the committee , or in any other way , of the tribute that is to be paid him by the American people . All I can say for the committee at present is that it is ready to receive contributions , and as soon as any plans are formed they will be given  --  to the public . " United States Treasurer E. H. Roberts has been appointed to take charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treasury until some plan is formulated regarding the home to be provided . The Governor of each State in the Union will be expected to appoint State sub-committees . In this manner it is proposed to make the offering to Admiral Dewey National in its significance . Personal subscriptions will also be received , and possibly the name of each donor will be enrolled on the testimonial . Navy and army officers are enthusiastic in their support of the proposition , and will lend every aid to its furtherance . " The plan to present to Admiral Dewey a home in Washington . " said Adjt . Gen. Corbin this afternoon , " is a most appropriate one , and I shall do everything in my power to carry out the plan . " Secretaries Long and Alger have been approached on the subject , arid both express their entire approbation of thus showing the appreciation of the American people to Admiral Dewey . Admiral Schley has expressed himself as follows : " I am delighted , and indorse heartily anything that will do honor to Admiral Dewey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The plans of the committee , when formulated , will be made known to the representative organizations in every city and town in the country , and it is expected that by the end of the week the amount of subscriptions received will have reached large proportions . Two suggestions regarding the purchase of a house for Admiral Dewey have been made to-day . Mrs. Kate Chace Sprague , whose home , Edgewood , is to be sold at auction , called at the Treasury Department to recommend her place as one that would make a fine home for the Admiral . Later in the day the Hearst home , on New Hampshire Avenue . a house formerly owned by Secretary Fairchild. and practically rebuilt by Senator Hearst , was proposed to be taken for Admiral Dewey . The people with real estate to dispose of in WashingtOn will not be encouraged just now . There is to be no constraint upon Admiral Dewey to bring him to accept hiS home in Washington , although there is a general belief that he will select it here , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund has been used in part for the purchase of a fine house here , to provide him with a Summer place in his native State or at the seashore , or . wherever he may choose to have it . DID N'T PROMISE $100 DINERS . Letter from Admiral Dewey that Was Construed as an Acceptance Was Not Intended as Such . The plans for the hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria in honor of Admiral George Dewey , which have been in charge of Alfred Chasseaud , may be considerably upset by the news which has now come to light that Admiral Dewey has not accepted the invitation to this dinner . A letter has been received in this city from an officer of Dewey 's fleet , which establishes this fact . The other day a circular letter was sent out by Mr. Chasseaud , which said : " It is intended that the occasion will be the most magnificent and artistic of its character in the history of this country , and we feel privileged  --  and honored in having just received an acceptance from Admiral Dewey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This circular was yesterday brought to the attention of Col. H. G. Prout of The Railroad Gazette , who showed a letter from an officer of Dewey 's fleet , written on behalf of the Admiral , to a member of the Engineers ' Club of this city in response to a letter from him . This member of the Engineers ' Club , Col. Prout explained , had written to the officer at Manila some time ago , telling him of Mr. Chasseaud 's movement , and expressing the opinion that it was not in any wise a representative one . The letter from the officer , which was written on Mdreb 27 and received on May 8 , was in part as follows : ' Had your letter reached me one day earlier , I could have clogged the wheels better . I wrote the day before a perfectly courteous but non-committal letter to Mr. Chasseaud for the Admiral . I do n't think he will act on that letter , for nothing was promised . ' When Mr. Chasseaud 's attention was called to the letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I construed Admiral Dewey 's letter to be an acceptance , and the gentlemen of the committee regarded it in the same way . Of course , if it 's all off , it 's off , but I do n't believe it is . We shall proceed with our plans as usual . " Mr. Chasseaud showed the letter from Adniiral Dewey , which was dated March 15 . It said , in part , after acknowledging the receipt of the invitation : " Will you kindly say to the committee that it would give me much pleasure to meet them upon any return to the United States , but that atpresent it is impossible to state when such return will take place . " $150,000 DEWEY WELCOME . Municipal Assembly Will Likely Authorize the Expenditure ? Both Land and Naval Parade . Mayor Van Wyck had a conference yesterday with a sub-committee of the Dewey Reception Committee appointed last week by the Presidents of both branches of the Municipal Assembly , in reference to the scope of the welcome to be extended to the Admiral on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a resolution will be presented at to-day 's meeting of the Board of Aldermen , authorizing an appropriation of $150,000 to cover the expenses of the celebration . This resolution under the charter will require a four-fifths vote of all the members elected to each branch of the Assembly , but no trouble is expected in getting it through , and it is believed that the appropriation will be available after next Tuesday . At the conference in the Mayor 's office yesterday , preliminary plans were discussed in an informal manner . There were present besides the Mayor , Councilmen Brice and Goodwin , and Aldermen McCall and Goodman . At the outset the Mayor declared that he felt that the occasion was one which demanded a large approphation by the city . He was opposed to any plan of providing for the expenses of the affair by a public subscription , and he stated that , in his opinion , it should be made as far as possible an official reception . The Mayor 's views on this matter were concurred in by the members of the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the Board of Aldermen to-day . It was the sense of the meeting that provision should be made for a land parade as well as a naval pageant , and in order to make this feature of the demonstration commensurate with the other general plans , it was suggested that the Governor be requested to order all the National Guard and Naval Militia to take part and to invite the Governors of all the States to attend with at least one regiment of the troops of their States . This idea suggested to Mayor Van Wyck a plan for a review of all these troops by the Admiral . The Mayor said that the Olympia would , in all probability , be anchored off Grant 's Tomb after the naval parade had reached that point , and he suggested that Admiral Dewey and such of his officers as could leave the ship be taken ashore then and es
