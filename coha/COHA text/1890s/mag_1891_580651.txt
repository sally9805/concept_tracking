txt JOHN RUTLEDGE . THE conditions of society in South Carolina during the latter part of the eighteenth century were well adapted to the nurture of a ruling class . A few families , some of them of superior English stock , had early acquired and continuously retained the richer lands near Charleston . On their large estates ; by reason of the abundance of slave labor , they had been on the one hand relieved from the drudgery of agriculture , and on the other nourished by its fruits and disciplined in its management ; while in their leisure they had turned readily to the various pursuits of social , religious , and political life . As lords of the soil they had naturally become upholders of the Church and rulers of the State ; and it is not surprising that at the approach of the Revolution South Carolina discovered in her opulent planters such efficient versatile leaders as the Lynches , Charles and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney , and the Middletons , father and son . From this class , the Charleston aristocracy , came also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutledge , was a physician in Charleston , who had emigrated from Ireland in 1735 ; and their mother , Sarah Hext , belonged to an old and wealthy colonial family . She was evidently a woman of extraordinary virtues ; for , left a widow at the age of twenty-six , with seven children and a diminished fortune , she was able largely to retrieve her paternal estate without neglecting her household . Aided by her exertions and self-denial , John Rutledge was well prepared for his future career . He had not , indeed , the advantage of a liberal education . His early training , first with a clergyman and later with a master , was brief ; but his subsequent study of the law was thorough and systematic . After several years in a law office , he passed three years in London , at the inns of court ; and when , in 1761 , at the age of twenty-two , he returned to practice at Charleston his success was already anticipated . He surpassed all expectations . Even before he reached home he was retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eagerness , had gone out in the pilot-boat to meet the ship . Rutledge conducted his case with so much skill and eloquence , says Ramsay , that // " he astonished all who heard him . " He won a verdict for his client , and received a fee of a hundred guineas . He soon became attorney-general of South Carolina , and for ten years enjoyed a lucrative practice . Josiah Quincy , Jr. , who visited Charleston in 1773 , wrote in his diary that John Rutledge was then one of the three first lawyers in the province . Such immediate and decided success was the more creditable because of the high character of the members of the bar among whom it was achieved . Many of his associates , like himself , had traveled abroad and studied at the inns of court . As a class , they were perhaps the best educated and the most influential men in the community . Their number at that time did not much exceed twenty ; and they were not less dignified than select . Attired in wigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f ormalities of the courts , whether they were engaged in dispensing justice , or were conducted by the sheriff in solemn procession from the court - house to hear the sessions sermon in the neighboring church . Rutledge had not been long in his profession when his attention was drawn to politics . He entered the provincial legislature , and exhibited marked capacity in dealing with the pending disputes . In fact , he soon became the leader of the legislature . It was due to his exertions mainly that South Carolina was the first colony south of New England to elect delegates to the Stamp Act Congress ; and in that Congress itself , though he was the youngest member , he was excelled by few in usefulness . He represented his province also in the Continental Congresses of 1774 and 1775 , in each case acquitting himself with great credit . Indeed , the political situation more and more absorbed his energy , and finally rendered the practice of law impossible . By 1775 the people of South Carolina had become so exasperated at the attempts of Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . The royal governor , Lord William Campbell , took refuge on a British man-of-war . The courts were closed , and royal government was at an end . On hearing of this crisis , Rutledge obtained leave of absence from the Continental Congress , and hastened to Charleston . His arrival was timely . Since the departure of the royal authorities , the Whig , or patriot , party had attempted to direct public affairs through an improvised committee of safety and provincial congress , but with little success . They had summoned a convention , accordingly , to consider the emergency ; and Rutledge , chosen a delegate in his absence , returned just in time to participate in its deliberations . He became the guiding spirit . Unlike Christopher Gadsden , he did not yet favor a total separation from the mother country . On the other hand , he would not oppose the institution of a popular government . Standing thus between the two extremes of opinion , with his long and varied experience in the Continental Congress , he naturally found great favor with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances redressed and their rights acknowledged , to resume , under the British connection , that supremacy in provincial politics which they had from the first enjoyed . They would hardly tolerate the idea of a permanent rupture . In accordance with this policy the convention fashioned the new government outwardly after the old , and declared , in the preamble written by Rutledge , that it should continue only " until an accommodation of the unhappy differences between Great Britain and America can be obtained . " Yet practically the existing alienation necessitated radical and significant innovations . All political functions hitherto exercised by the Crown were now transferred to the people . Notably , the colonial governor , // who had usually been a favorite of the king , was superseded by an elective president , who should thenceforth be the agent and representative of the people . Thus South Carolina was the first of the Southern colonies fully to realize the idea of a popular government . Evidently the most important officer in the new government was the president . He represented the power and dignity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as civil . In the great emergencies that were already apprehended , though but dimly foreseen , he would be the leader about whom the people would rally , whether to repel foreign invasion or to quell internal strife . It was , therefore , a great tribute to the character and talents of John Rutledge that , in a convention containing so many trusted patriots , he was the one selected to be the first president of South Carolina . The action of the convention was enthusiastically ratified by the people . They made the day of the inauguration memorable in the history of the State . Marking as it did the beginning of the first government constituted and conducted throughout by the people , it was celebrated with extraordinary pomp and rejoicing . The occasion is graphically described by Drayton in his Memoirs of the American Revolution : " The two houses , preceded by the president and vice-president , and the sheriff bearing the sword of state , made a solemn procession from the State-House to the Exchange , in front of the line of troops ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed by the sheriff , amidst the heart-cheering plaudits of the people : which was unmediately responded to by thirteen discharges from the cannon of the artillery , a feu de joge from the line of troops , and the cannon of the Prosper , shipof-war , and other armed vessels in the harbor . " The anticipations of the people were not disappointed . Immediately the new government went into operation , order was enforced , justice administered , and confidence restored . The legislature , having enacted such laws as the circumstances required , presented to the president an address , congratulating him on the public welfare , and pledging to his support their fortunes and their lives . Rutledge replied in a tone equally spirited and patriotic . He urged them , on returning home , to acquaint their constituents with the rights and grievances in dispute , and with the necessity , nature , and benefits of the new government . In conclusion he said : " The eyes of all Europe - nay , of the whole world - are on America . The eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose reputation for generosity and magnanimity is universally acknowledged . I trust , therefore , it will not be diminished by our future conduct ; that there will be no civil discord here ; and that the only strife amongst brethren will be , who shall do most to serve and to save an oppressed and injured country . " This speech contained such a succinct , vigorous statement of the Whig views that the General Assembly ordered it , together with the constitution , to be published throughout the State . Then it adjourned to the next autumn , leaving the conduct of affairs in the hands of the president . Rutledge soon found his hands more than full . Indeed , for a time there rested , as it were , within his grasp the fate not of South Carolina alone , but of the whole thirteen colonies . From the collapse of the royal authority , Lord William Campbell , the fugitive governor , and his Tory sympathizers had been urging upon the British ministry an invasion of South Carolina . Only a small British force was needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to effect the capture of Charleston and to restore South Carolina to the Crown . At last the ministry were persuaded . About the // beginning of the year 1776 , they fitted out land and naval forces sufficient in strength , they believed , to bring the American colonies to submission , and directed a large division to operate against the Carolinas . At the same time , General Howe , the British commander in America , dispatched Sir Henry Clinton with a small force from Boston , with orders to effect a union with the contingent from England , and to take command of the Southern expedition . Meanwhile , rumors of these intentions and movements had reached Charleston , and President Rutledge had made strenuous efforts to fortify the city . All available laborers , including a large force of negroes from the country , were employed incessantly in strengthening the works . Expresses were sent throughout the State to urge forward the militia ; and the scanty supply of ammunition was increased by stripping lead from the windows of dwellings and churches . All ranks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , and imitated his indefatigable energy . Believing in the justice of their cause , they awaited with confidence the impending attack . They had not long to wait . Just inside the bar and at the entrance of Charleston harbor lies a long , low , narrow strip of land called Sullivan Island . At its southwestern extremity , commanding the narrow approach from the sea to the town , a fort had been hastily constructed of soft palmetto logs embanked with sand ; and , rude and unfinished though it was , it constituted an insurmountable barrier to the advance of the British fleet . Its reduction was a condition precedent to the bombardment of the town . Accordingly , on the morning of the 28th of June , 1776 , the hostile ships , weighing anchor , bore down upon the apparently insignificant structure . In reality the fort was not much stronger than it seemed . Square in form , with a bastion at each angle , it was finished only on the two sides most exposed , and , situated at the bend of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire of any ship that should round the point . This defect was deemed fatal by Major-General Charles Lee , who , entrusted by the Continental Congress with the Southern department , bad hastened to Charleston and assumed command . He took great pains , therefore , to secure the retreat of the garrison to the mainland , and even gave orders that when the powder , of which the supply was scanty , should be exhausted they should spike their guns and retire to the mainland . But Colonel William Moultrie , the commander of the fort , and his little band - four hundred and thirty-five in all - were not of the retreating sort . They had determined to hold their position or perish in the attempt ; and in this they were encouraged by President Rutledge . The latter , in order to avoid any conflict of authority , had , with great moderation and discretion , relinquished to Major-General Lee the supreme command of the state militia , including the garrison , but he would not countenance a retreat . " Gen. Lee wishes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You will not without an order from me . I would sooner cut off my hand than write one . " In the midst of the action he sent out to the fort five hundred pounds of powder , with the laconic suggestion : " Do not make too free with your cannon . Cool and do mischief . " The advice had been anticipated . Firing at longer intervals as the supply of powder ran low , and training their guns upon the larger ships , the plucky untrained militiamen not only maintained their position from morning till night , but also inflicted such damage that with the rise of the tide the hostile ships slipped their anchors and dropped out of range . The first victory at the South had been won , and Charleston saved . Nay , more : coming as it did at the beginning // of the war , the affair gave courage and confidence to the patriots everywhere ; while it so disabled and dispirited the British that they abandoned the Southern expedition , and the Southern States enjoyed a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon when news reached Charleston of the declaration of independence . It was gladly received . The people , exasperated by the recent attack , were now prepared for this decisive step . It was celebrated in a noteworthy manner . An official proclaination of independence was followed by a public procession of the state officers , both civil and military , headed by President Rutledge ; and later in the day there was a parade of the troops in a field adjoining the town . The assertion of a common independence was soon followed by an assimilation of the forms and principles of government in the several States- The democracy , having severed all external bonds , now began to assert itself , and South Carolina early responded to the movement . In 1777 the constitution was greatly modified : the church establishment was abolished , the office of president was superseded by that of governor , and a senate elected by the people was substituted for the legislative council chosen by the Assembly . The people thus secured equality before the law among the different religious bodies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they antagonized the clergy , whose ancient privileges were revoked , and the aristocratic planters , whose political supremacy was threatened . Among the latter , both in association and in sympathy , was President Rutledge . When the new constitution was submitted to him , lie returned it with his veto , He objected chiefly to its democratic spirit and tendency . " However unexceptionable democratic power may appear at the first view , " he frankly stated , " its effects have been found arbitrary , severe , and destructive . " Like Alexander Hamilton , Robert Morris , and other contemporary leaders , he had little faith in government by the masses . These men believed that what they had thus far accomplished was due largely to their bold assumption and ready exercise of liberal powers , encouraged by the generous confidence of the people . As for John Rutledge , he was ever inipatient of restraint . He could not approve the new constitution , so he withdrew from the head of affairs . His retirement was of short duration , for his services soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of 1778 the repose that South Carolina had been enjoying was seriously interrupted . After many efforts , the English armies had failed to subdue America by invading New England and the Middle States . Now they changed their plans . They resolved to conquer the colonies in detail , attacking first those more infused with Tory sentiment and less accessible to Whig support . Accordingly they attempted the subjugation of Georgia and the Carolinas ; and at first with astonishing success . Three thousand men , dispatched from New York by Sir Henry Clinton , landing near Savannah , speedily routed the American forces and seized the town . Thence reinforced and commanded by General Prevost , they proceeded to capture Augusta and the stations along the Savannah River . Within a month they had conquered all Georgia and restored her to the Crown . Sir James Wright , the former royal governor , was reinstated , and , by kind treatment and liberal promises , the people were induced to enter the British service in large numbers . In South Carolina , this iiivasion , so sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caused great alarm . Her delegates in the Continental Congress obtained the appointment of General Lincoln , who had distinguished himself at Saratoga , to the command of the // Southern department ; and her legislature , which fortunately was then in session , exerted itself to the utmost to strengthen the public defenses . It provided for filling the Continental regiments , for impressing boats , wagons , and other conveyances , and for apprehending suspected persons . Above all , in its anxiety for the public welfare , it turned again to the man who two years before , as president , had done so much to ward off invasion and ruin . At this crisis it would trust no one but John Rutledge at the head of affairs . Having elected him governor , it voluntarily clothed him and his council with almost unlimited discretionary power . Once for all it authorized them " to do everything that appeared to him and them necessary for the public welfare . " Such confidence was no more than the emergency required . The State was menaced at once by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the interior , and by the victorious General Preyost from the south ; while in several quarters the Tories , encouraged by the English success , were organizing for active service . In order to be prepared in any event , Rutledge in person established a camp at Orangeburgh , in the middle of the State , making it a rendezvous for the militia and a centre of operations ; while he entrusted the fortification of Charleston to the lieutenant-governor and the council . He also coiiperated with General Lincoln , and promptly yielded him precedence when a conflict of authority arose . Encouraged and strengthened by these vigorous measures , the patriots determined to act on the offensive . *Tith a considerable army General Lincoln crossed into Georgia , in the hope of ejecting General Prevost and regaining the State . But the latter was too wary and alert . He eluded the attack by a counter invasion . Crossing the Savannah , he advanced boldly and swiftly in the direction of Charleston , driving before him General Moultrie , who , with an inferior force , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was confusion and consternation . Aroused by expresses from Moultrie , Rutledge hastened to Charleston by forced marches and with all available troops , and Lincoln , already far on his way toward Augusta , began to retrace his course with all possible expedition . The latter could not overtake Prevost , but hoped to cut off his retreat should the town hold out . An immediate assault was expected by the townsmen , and that with grave forebodings . Rutledge and Moultrie had barely brought their scanty forces into the terror-stricken place , and stationed them along its unfinished defenses , when the enemy were at hand demanding a surrender . Should the demand be refused and the assault be made , great loss of life and destruction of property must result , while victory seemed almost certain to the British . On the other hand , to give up the town without an effort to defend it would scarcely become the men who two years before , though poorly disciplined and equipped , had bravely faced superior numbers and achieved a glorious victory . In this dilemma Governor Rutledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deferred , they believed that General Lincoln , who was already expected , might arrive and turn the scale . Accordingly they sent a flag to General Prevost , asking what terms he would grant in case of capitulation ; and when he replied that such as should not accept his offers of peace and protection must surrender as prisoners of war , they sent again , objecting to the terms , and requesting a conference . Thus in messages and counter messages the day was nearly spent , but without any agreement . Finally , as a last resort , Rutledge and his council sent " to propose a neutrality during the war between Great Britain and America , and the question whether the State shall // belong to Great Britain or remain one of the United States be determined by the treaty of peace between these two powers . " This proposition also being rejected on the one side , and capitulation being at last refused on the other , an assault now seemed inevitable . But at this point Prevost gained news of Lincoln 's rapid advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made his escape . One would fain believe that this offer of neutrality also was made simply to gain time , and so it has been suggested by at least one historian , and by a distinguished descendant of Rutledge ; but it is hard to find any evidence to support the suggestion . On the other hand , it would not be just to accuse Rutledge of treason . At that time the States were indeed acting in common , but they did so mainly on grounds of expec*iency , - in order the better to promote their common interests . As yet they did not admit an organic union by which they were indissolubly bound to one another , but each maintained the right to act independently of the rest , at least when necessary for self-preservation . For this reason , if for no other , the proposition of neutrality , which now appears heinous , may then have seemed justifiable . In effect , whatever was its intent , it added to the delay ; and , however admirable was the spirit with which Mioultrie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and procrastination were , under the circumstances , more expedient . Virtually they saved the town . But the fate of Charleston was decreed , and no temporary delay could prevent its fulfillment . The expedition against Georgia had been an experiment , and it had , on the whole , succeeded so well that it warranted a more serious effort . In December , 1779 , Sir Henry Clinton himself sailed from New York against Charleston with over five thousand men . At this time the legislature of South Carolina was in session . When it heard of the impending peril it turned again to Rutledge , and delegated , " till ten days after their next session , to the governor , John Rutledge , Esquire , and such of his council as he could conveniently consult , a power to do everything necessary for the public good , except the taking away the life of a citizen without a legal trial . " Evidently , the proposition of neutrality had not diminished Rutledge 's popularity . Probably it had increased it , as an evidence of his regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . His energy and resources were equal to the emergency . He ordered forthwith a general rendezvous of the militia ; and when there was no considerable response , he made a proclamation , requiring such of the militia as were regularly drafted , and all the inhabitants and owners of property in the town , to repair to the American standard , and join the garrison imme ( liately , under pain of confiscation . " But he met with discouragement at every turn . Within the town and the State were greater enemies than there were without . The smallpox in a virulent form had recently appeared , and from the terror that it caused was a serious obstacle to the assembling of the militia . Worse than all , food and other necessaries of life were both dear and scarce , and the paper currency was almost worthless . It is not strange , therefore , that when Sir Henry Clinton and his powerful armanient appeared the people fell into much despondency , and Governor Rutledge was almost in despair . Yet he made strenuous efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investiture , Rutledge was induced by General Lincoln and others to go out into the country in order to rally the people and maintain the civil authority ; and though he was unable finally to prevent the fall of Charleston , he performed most valuable services . They are best described by Gen // eral Moultrie in his Memoirs . " It was very fortunate , " he says , " for the province that the governor was not made a prisoner in town . His presence in the country kept everything alive ; and it gave great spirits to the people to have a man of such great abilities , firmness , and decision amongst them . He gave commissions , raised new corps , embodied the militia , and went to Philadelphia to solicit reinforcements . He returned and joined the army . He stayed by them , enforced the laws of the province , called the legislature ; in short , he did everything that could be done for the good of the country . " It is difficult adequately to describe or to estimate the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never was that cause in such desperate straits . During the two years succeeding the fall of Charleston the Carolinas were the principal theatre of the war ; for here was put to a thorough trial the chief and final scheme for subduing America , and for a long time it seemed about to succeed . From Charleston as a base of operations the British forces pressed steadily northward , while far and near , on either side , the swift and daring Tarleton spread terror and desolation . Nothing availed to check the tide . When General Gates was overwhelmed in the disaster of Camden , the reduction of the whole South appeared inevitable . But there now arose elements of resistance upon which the English had not counted . They had not reckoned on the indomitable spirit and manifold resources of the patriot leaders . Sumter , Pickens , and Marion ! What visions of valor and romance attend the mention of their names ! With their little bands of fellow-fugitives and refugees , miserably clad and poorly equipped , yet resolute and devoted , they crept stealthily from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detached body of regulars , now a roving company of Tories . If repulsed , they disappeared as suddenly into their mysterious retreats , and eluded all pursuit ; but if successful , they supplied themselves with the arms and clothing of the fallen enemy , and pushed on to new enterprises . They inflicted so much damage and inspired so great terror that the British army was obliged not only to check its northward course , but also to secure its line of retreat . With these men Governor Rutledge was in constant communication and cooperation . As commander-in-chief of the South Carolina militia , he exercised a general direction over their movements , and gave them assistance , encouragement , and reward . He made Sumter brigadier-general of militia in recognition of gallant attacks on Rocky-Mount and Hanging-Rock ; and later he promoted Marion and Pickens to the same rank for similar services . His aid was equally constant and efficient to General Greene , who , as the successor of General Gates in the command of the Southern department , completed the work the militia had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In thus promoting active military operations , Governor Rutledge exercised his dictatorial power with promptness and discretion . For example , he suspended for a time the act of the legislature making the paper currency a legal tender , and he authorized the impressment of specie and horses in extreme cases . His scrupulous care embraced small matters as well as great . " It gives me pleasure , " he declared , " to restore every encroachment on the liberties of the people . " He was unwilling to retain his extraordinary power any longer than was absolutely necessary . Accordingly , so soon as the state of hostilities would permit , he issued writs for an election ; and when a new legislature assembled in January , 1782 , he was able at last to say that all of the State , save Charleston and its vicinity , was rid of the invaders , and " the legislative , ex // ecutive , and judicial powers are in the free exercise of their respective authorities . " For three weary years , the most calamitous and eventful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone the weight and responsibility of the military and civil authority ; and now , his term having expired , he gave back , neither lessened nor misused , that authority with which he had been so generously clothed . The legislature was not willing to dispense with his services . Almost at the same time that it tendered him its " most sincere and unfeigned thanks " for his " persevering , unabated , and successful exertions , " it elected him a delegate from South Carolina to the Continental Congress ; and to this body he now returned after the lapse of seven years , with a reputation greatly enhanced by the conspicuous part he had taken in the brilliant defense of the South . Few men had rendered such varied and important public services , and his views received corresponding consideration . As usual , they were outspoken and decided . For example , he urged , though in vain , that the American commissioners should be freed from the necessity of consulting the French regarding the terms of peace ; and when they eventually did as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defended their conduct . Instructions should be disregarded , he declared , whenever the public good required it . In pressing the payment of the public debt occasioned by the war , the price of freedom , he was equally decided ; and when the power to lay taxes required by Congress for this object was persistently and selfishly denied by the States , he recognized the essential weakness of the existing Confederation and the imperative necessity of a new political system . In the framing of the Constitution of the United States John Rutledge took a memorable part . Influenced , doubtless , by his own experience as chief executive of South Carolina , he agreed with Wil son that the national executive should be a single person . But he could not sympathize nor cooperate with him in his persistent efforts to found the general government more directly upon the people . Rutledge preferred to keep it , as it was , based on the States . Hence he urged that the state legislatures should continue to choose the national legislature , and the latter in turn should appoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advocated repeatedly , though in vain , by Madison , that the general government should have a negative on the legislative acts of the States . " Will any State ever agree , " Rutledge asked , " to be bound hand and foot in this manner ? " It is easy to infer that his views on government were cast in an aristocratic mould . He did not hesitate to approve the proposition of his fellow townsman and delegate , Charles Piuckney , that the possession of a fixed amount of property should be required of all candidates for the national executive , Supreme Court , and legislature . With thorough consistency and frankness he was also the champion of slavery . When Luther Martin and George Mason eloquently pleaded that the Constitution should prohibit the slave trade , Rutledge replied : " Religion and humanity have nothing to do with the question . Interest alone is the governing principle with nations . " " If the Convention thinks that North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia will ever agree to the plan , unless their right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In this resolution he was inflexible . It was fortified by his training , his temperament , and his experience ; and , what most influenced the Convention , it certainly was , as he said , the sentiment of the extreme South . Yet Rutledge was not intentionally narrow or bigoted . Slavery and state supremacy aside , he had a firm grasp and a broad view of political questions . // For example , foreseeing a wide extension of foreign commerce , he urged that the power given to Congress of regulating trade should be unrestricted , notwithstanding the suggestion that such power might be used to the relative disadvantage of the South . " As we are laying the foundation for a great empire , we ought , " he declared , " to take a permanent view of the subject , and not look at the present moment only . " Though but little of the Constitution as it stands is traceable directly to Rutledge , nevertheless he greatly influenced its construction , and his work in the Convention materially increased his reputation . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams , in the choice of his native State , for the vice-presidency . He was the first of the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States to be appointed by President Washington ; but he soon resigned this position in order to accept that of chief justice of the court of common pleas and sessions in South Carolina ; and he was not again drawn into national affairs till he was selected by President Washington , in 1795 , to succeed John Jay as Chief Justice of the United States . To have filled this position - in some respects the most eminent in public life - would fittingly have crowned his career ; but such was not his destiny . The man that hitherto had uniformly been favored by fortune was now overtaken by misfortune and gloom ; and the cause was partly in himself . About the time of his appointment by the President to the office of Chief Justice , the terms of the Jay treaty reached America . In Charleston they aroused great indignation and excitement ; for they were thought to involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay and the treaty were burned in effigy , and the British flag was publicly insulted . With the prevalent hatred of England and affection for France Rutledge deeply sympathized ; and , notwithstanding his recent obligation to the federal administration , he allowed himself to be drawn into the popular demonstration against its obnoxious measure . At a public meeting in Charlcston he gave full rein to his feelings , and denounced the treaty in severe terms . At once his speech was read throughout the country , and was hailed with delight by the party in opposition . Among the Federalists , on the contrary , it was received with surprise and indignation , and threats were openly made of preventing , in the Senate , the confirmation of Rutledge as Chief Justice . But Providence now interposed , and turned all party passion into feelings of pity and regret . In the fall of 1795 Rutledge was suddenly attacked by a disease that affected his intellect and incapacitated him for the bench , and for this reason chiefly his nomination was rejected . " The Senate 's refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the last spark of sanity . " After a lingering and pathetic illness , he died in July , 1800 . The conduct of Rutledge toward the Jay treaty illustrates his impetuous , impatient temperament . He was still bitter against England at the ravages of her arms in South Carolina , and it is not surprising . In the war he had lost his valuable library and a large part of his property , and his was a common misfortune . When , therefore , the Jay treaty , which he deemed to be infamous , recalled those outrages and calamities , he would not refrain from denunciation , even though he should sacrifice the honor of being Chief Justice of the United States . Yet his impulses were generous , and his sense of justice wa exact . On one occasion , when Charleston was anxiously awaiting an assault from General Preyost , Governor Rutledge observed that some militiamen were inattentive to duty . Impetuously riding up , he not only re // primanded them severely , but actually struck one with his whip . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his act . Such qualities greatly endeared him to the people . Few public men in America have enjoyed in their day such unclouded , uninterrupted popularity . From the time when , a youth fresh from the inns of court , he began the practice of law at Charleston to the day when , at fiftysix years of age , selected for the highest judicial office in the United States , he became the victim of a melancholy disease , he was the favorite representative in intercolonial councils and the chief leader in local politics . For a considerable period he was the main , almost the only stay of public order and defense . He was repeatedly the dictator of South Carolina . His power was not more ample than he desired , yet he uniformly exercised it with discretion and moderation ; he often tempered it with clemency . It is difficult at the present time to realize the extent and bitterness of the fratricidal strife that divided and devastated the more southern colonies during the Revolution . American history at no other time affords any parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another with almost savage ferocity , and the damage they mutually inflicted almost equaled what they received from invaders . The evil was so obstinate that it merited severe treatment , and such it did at times receive . But Rutledge was the rather inclined to conciliation . During intervals of repose he repeatedly offered pardon and protection to such Tories as should return to their homes and keep the peace . So far , indeed , did he carry his pacific policy that in several cases he was opposed by his friends . Seldom , however , was his judgment or his conduct questioned , for he truly represented , while he ably directed , the ruling class of South Carolina . That class was high-spirited yet conservative , exacting of obedience but generous of favor , and such also was John Rutledge . At times , when he assumed his " gubernatorial air , " he would brook no opposition nor denial . Had he not been clothed with dictatorial power , and was he not responsible for its exercise ? As in temperament , so in convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His political principles were drawn niore from his own experience and environment than from either the observation of nations or the maxims and speculations of philosophers . Hence his limitations as compared with such men as Hamilton , Wilson , and Madison , who drew alike from all these sources . Within his range his knowledge was thorough and precise , for he excelled in acumen and force , if not in culture . This fact was evident especially in his speech . As a writer he was neither fluent nor graceful , but as a speaker he possessed uncommon abilities . Terse , direct , and incisive , he delivered his thoughts with animation and skill . When his sympathies were evoked or his indignation aroused , he would win by his earnestness and sincerity , or he would overwhelm with his invective . In his manner at the bar he is said to have resembled Mr. Dunning , later Lord Ashburton , the most celebrated advocate of the time . Perhaps the chief impression which he left upon the listener was that of earnestness , - an impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tall , robust , and commanding , while his face wore an aspect of firmness and decision touched with severity . On the bench , his bearing shed dignity and exacted respect . His decisions evince a thorough and accurate knowledge of law , and also a tendency to control the absolute dictates of precedent by a liberal regard for justice . The fact most significant of his judicial // capacity is his successive promotions on the bench of South Carolina , and his selection at last by Washington to preside in the Supreme Court of the United States . Nevertheless , his services as a judge came late in life , and occupied but a small portion of his career . His chief claini to distinction is as an executive . Above all else , John Rutledge was a man of action , and as such he impressed himself deeply upon his time . In the early awakening and final revolt of the American colonies he played a part secondary in importance to few , if to any , of the patriots ; for it was he more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the North in the Stamp Act Congress , and afterwards held her in support of the successive measures adopted in Continental councils . When the war , which , in spite of his impetuous temperament , he had constantly endeavored to avert , was at last precipitated , no man of equal prominence at the time in civil affairs entered more deeply and more devotedly into the conflict , or displayed greater energy and persistence in the common defense . There is reason to doubt if , without his efforts , the South would have escaped conquest . Had the South been subjugated , could independence have been achieved ? Though he had been educated and accustomed to civil pursuits , the smell of powder did not lessen his ardor , nor did his contact with arms diminish his reputation . Indeed , from military men have come some of the warmest encommums of his genius and his work . He is , said General Greene , " one of the first characters I ever met with ; " while General Lee writes in his Memoirs , " An accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inflexibly firm , he infused his own lofty spirit into the general mass.
