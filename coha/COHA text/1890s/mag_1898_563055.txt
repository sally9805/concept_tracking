txt THERE are two theories of the relation of the American college to its students . One is that the college is a family , that the college officers stand in the place of the parent , and the students in the place of the son . It is , therefore , the duty of the college officer to maintain watch and ward over each student . The rules and regulations of the college are supposed to take the place in the college of what the family gives through its various personal ministries . A second system of government is the very opposite of the domestic ; it is a system that is distinguished by its lack of government . The college has no relation to the personal character of the student ; the college is concerned only with the giving of instruction , and the student in his function of a student is concerned only with receiving instruction . These two systems seldom exist in the naked and bald form in which I outline them , but , as theories , they obtain to a very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications ; the emphasis is sometimes placed upon the domestic side and sometimes upon the side of freedom ; and in the same college at varying periods the emphasis varies . In the discussion of these and related theories at least four questions emerge : ( 1 . ) Are American college students old enough to determine their own conduct ? ( 2 . ) Sliculd the college attempt to control the private and personal life of students ? ( 3 . ) Should the college demand of students conduct which their homes do not demand ? ( 4 . ) Is there any method by which even a small minority of college students can be saved from going to the bad ? // The age of men entering the ordinary American college is now about eighteen and one-half years ; it varies , of course , in different colleges , and also in the same college at different periods . The average age of the members of the freshman class of Adelbert Oollege of Western Reserve University , entering in the fall of 1897 , was a little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of the present century increased . At the present time , however , through better methods of education prevailing in the secondary schools , the age is in many colleges lessening , but it is safe to say that eighteen and a half is the average age of the collegian beginning his course . Is a student , therefore , of an age from eighteen to twenty-two years sufficiently mature to be left to himself in all matters of conduct ? Is he fitted to work out the salvation of his character without supervision or aid of arty kind from the officers of the college ? It is certainly true that some men are fitted to perform this most serious and happy task : some men at twenty years are as mature as other men are at thirty . At eighteen some boys have habits as well formed , both in point of the content of the habit and its fixedness , as others at the age of twenty-five . It is also true that certain boys at the age of eighteen and twenty are as unformed in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others may be at fifteen or even twelve . A friend of mine writes , saying " In general , College did not do its duty by me ; it took me at sixteen out of a quiet home in a remote town and gave me no affectionate personal supervision of the older brotherly sort , and not even effective surveillance of the schoolmaster kind . I think the active , personal interest , then , of a good college professor might have expedited my eventual development at least five years . My own and my friends ' principles were not established ; we squandered time atrociously , though not in vice , beyond whist and a little beer ; had no regular habits in work and in play , and in general were negligent and neglected children . " The man who now writes these words is a conspicuous author , and he writes them after more than twenty years absence from the college in which he was a student . Another , who also was a student in the same college and at the same time , writes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much controlled by principle as the average man of the world , more under such control , I think . I doubt if more stringent regulations than existed would have secured better results . " // It is to be at once said that the degree of maturity which is found in college *tttdents depends to a large e*tei2t . QhOtlier*-*-they were fitted in high schools and lived in their own homes during the time of preparation , or whether they were fitted in academies away from their homes . In certain colleges a large proportion of the students come from high schools ; in other colleges a large per cent . come from academies which are in corporate association with the colleges themselves , and in other colleges a large proportion come from the large and independent academies . In the twenty years between 1866 and 1885 the public schools furnished about twenty-nine per cent . of the members of the freshman class of Harvard College ; from 1866 to 1869 the proportion was thirty per cent. ; from 1870 to 1873 , thirty-three per cent. ; from 1874 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1881 , thirty-one per cent. ; and from 1882 to 1885 , twenty-six per cent . About the same proportion entered from endowed schools , such as the Phillips Academies , and the balance came largely from private tutors and from other colleges . Students who enter our colleges from endowed schools are usually fitted to regulate their own conduct , but those who find their first absence from home contemporaneons with their entrance to college , who , in other words , while pursuing their preparatory course , lived at home , should not at once be given absolute and entire freedom , or , if this is given to them , it should be given to them under such personal or semi-official conditions as to cause them to feel the restraining inspiration of friendship . Every man who enters Yale College at once feels the difference , in the maturity of his class-mates , between the men who entered from the Hopkins Grammar School aud those who came from Andover and Exeter . The truth , therefore , seems to be that some boys are old enough on entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not . The general truth is that those who enter college are neither boys , as some say they are , nor are they men , as others also affirm , but that they are young men ; certain characteristics of boyhood still are theirs , certain characteristics of manhood are also theirs ; from the condition of boyhood they rapidly emerge and as fast enter the condition of manhood . It becomes , therefore , evident that in certain cases it is the right , even if not the duty , of the college to control the private life of students . It is also evident that in certain cases it is not // expedient for the college to attempt any such direction . But it -. - 4s*ust *p s*ytliat the college as aeollege is deeply interested in the private life of each of its students . For the college desires that each student shall secure the noblest , richest , and best resuits from his college course . Nothing can be foreign to the college which promotes the interests of its students . The only question for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways and means can it best influence the private life of each man who is committed to it for four years ? It may be said , I think , that students at once are rebellious against the control of their private life by the college authorities , and are also hospitable to all general influences of the college that look to the formation of their best character . Students wish to be helped ; students do not wish to be commanded ; they are open to influence , but not to control . Personal influence , therefore , rather than law represents the wise method . Not a few American colleges are subject to a difficult condL tion in respect to the control of their students . American education has not yet fully and exactly articulated itself . In most , but not all , of the universities which attempt to give graduate instruction , the department of graduate instruction and the undergraduate department are very closely related ; graduate students are usually found in undergraduate classes , and certain undergraduate students are frequently found in classes designed primarily for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Haven . On the other hand , many American colleges have in very close association with themselves a preparatory department . Even if there be a formal division made between the work of these two departments , the same general influences control the students of both departments ; frequently , too , the students in the two departments recite in the same classes on certain subjects . Graduate students represent a degree of maturity and worthy self-direction which undergraduates do not possess , and undergraduate students represent a degree of selfcontrol which preparatory students can lay no claim to . When these two classes of students , the graduate and the undergraduate , are placed under the same general conditions it is difficult to subject them to the same general control , and also , when undergraduate students and preparatory students are found to be in the same institution , it is difficult also to ask them to obey the // same set of rules . But the necessity is laid upon the officers of institutions which are beset with these duplex or even triplex relationships to ask students of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same governing principles and methods . The fact is that those principles and methods which are fitted for the less mature set of students are those which ought to prevail . College authorities think it is better to subject undergraduate students to the same conditions which preparatory students ought to submit to , than to give to preparatory students that freedom which undergaduate students might properly enjoy . With the increasing differentiation prevailing in American education this difficulty , however , is sure to lessen . The best method of guiding the personal morals of a student is through making constant and severe intellectual demands upon him . Hard work is an enemy to easy morals . Professional schools attempt only indirectly to influence the personal character of their students , but the officers of such schools hold that the most effective method of aiding students to maintain uprightness in conduct is by maintaining high scholastic standards . Such a method should control in the undergraduate college . The man who works hard in college , who is required to devote eight or ten hours a day to the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil indulgence ; or , if he has time , has little strength ; or , if he has strength , has little inclination ; and the man who lacks time , strength , and inclination for base indulgence is quite sure of being free from it . The question whether attendance upon recitations shall be voluntary or whether the rules in a college shall be strict is a minor question in relation to the necessity of making intellectual requirements severe . In addition to the aid which necessity of hard work gives in the securing of a fine personal morality , every college should recognize that the personal relation of professors to students is of primary value . The importance of this relation is becoming more and more conspicuous . The system known as " Advisors " obtaining at Harvard represents and embodies this method . The nickname , which is given among the students to advisors , of " nurses , " embodies in essence the idea of the personal relationship . One of the officers of the college writes me in reference to this system , saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater I believe its power to be ; the only drawback // is the shortness of life and the necessity that an instructor should have some time for study . " The first duty of the teacher in the American college is to teach ; his second duty is to teach ; failure in teaching is fundamental , But when the professor has taught he has not finished his duty , he is still to give himself as a person to his students in such ways as he deems fitting , in order to help them to become better persons . As a part of this general relationship of the college the relation of the students to each other is not to be so easily passed over , as it has often been ; for older students may be of the greatest help to the younger . The influence of college student over college student is frequently of greater value than the influence of college professor over college student . We recognize the power of influences toward evil ; the value of the influence of the student toward good may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the qualities of a strong personality united with tact , patience , and enthusiasm , may be of the utmost worth in helping their associates to the best life . One special means or condition embodying the influence of student over student is seen in the fraternity . The fraternity is a unique exponent of college life ; it represents more than any other element the expression of fellowship . College officers are now using , to an extent hitherto unknown , members in a fraternity to influence other members in the same fraternity . In a sense the fraternity is a college within a college . The bare value of the buildings of the fraternities at Cornell , at Yale , at Amherst , far exceeds the average endowment of the American college . This condition of good fellowship opens the way to the operation of all kinds of healthful and helpful influences . The perilous time in the life of a college man is his first year ; if , in this time of peril , he can have a man who stands at the other and older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who himself is pure and strong and wise and tactful , he secures the best method for keeping himself in the way of truth , and of honest and good living . I know a student at Williams College who was at one time told that a classmate and fraternity associate of his would be obliged to leave college unless the derelict man could be taken as a room mate by the wiser and stronger one . He was so taken , and I have no reason to think that the wiser and stronger man was injured , though the younger and less strong man was helped . // The college officer should not , and seldom does , if ever , allow himself to employ unworthy means in discovering the ill deeds of students or in preventing students from doing such deeds . Not a few college men believe that college officers employ students whom they call " spies " to learn and to report the evil doings of students . I have never known of such methods being employed . Nothing , therefore , can be more evident than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control by rules and regulations the conduct of college students . It is equally evident that through personal influence they may control the conduct and form the character of students . Upon this point I have recently read scores of letters from graduates of long standing and from many college officers . One of these writers , who is the chairman of the faculty of an old and conspicuous university , says : " In my college days , which were passed at Ilampdeti Sidney College , in this State , and at this university from 1868 to 1873 , the control exercised by the officers of discipline was mainly through influence rather than through authority . There was never any espionage , but we were trusted to do what we knew to be right , and the sole effective check upon bad habits was found in the test offered by the college work . " Ibelieved then , and believe now , that it is not only wise , but necessary , t. * leave the college student to govern himself . Some will fall into error , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of a young man when his character needs the very discipline that is offered by this reliance upon his own powers of self-control . If at this period students are kept under constant surveillance , their characters are likely to be permanently distorted . All that can be done and ought to be done is to bring every salutary and uplifting influence to bear upon the student life , to offer legitimate and wholesome amusements as rivals of those that are unhealthy and illicit , to encourage among the young men a feeling of personal pride and honor and - self-respecting uprightness , to establish a public opinion among the students which frowns upon gr'oss vice **nd all forms of dishonorable action ; in other words , to make the college career in this way a moral gymnastic and create out of the college student a worthy , honest , upright citizen. ** Another , an able lawyer , a graduate of the University of Michigan , writes : " It was my fortune to spend two years in a New England colleg*having about two hundred students , entering Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former institution students were subjected to a close watch-tutors and professors rooming in the same dormitories with the pupils , the attendance upon chapel and church being reported by monitors . Notwithstanding this oversight , or on account of It , no opportunity was lost on the part of the boys of giving vent to their ani // mal spirits . Half-dressed attendance at early chapel , and summer nights made hideousby the horn blowing of ghost-cladboys on the roofs of the dormitories , together with the dangerous practice of hazing , often accompanied by a rain of stones , like a hail storm , demolishing scores of panes of glass , remain as vivid pictures in my mental gallery . " Upon entering the University of Michiganll found there were no dormitories ; the marking system had been abolished ; there were no class honors or rivalries for prizes . But what was entirely new to me was an intellectual atmosphere and the spirit of earnest work that pervaded the university town , and this gives me an opportunity to answer , in a general way , the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in interesting the students in their work ; the numbers were large and there was a strong current in the direction of earnest application which seemed to carry every one with it . A number of our professors were making discoveries and original investigations and were publishing books upon their various specialties . The works on spherical trigonometry and calculus that were afterward published by Prof. Olney were used in manuscript in our class and in the form of lectures . It is unnecessary to say that there were no ponies or diminutive books on shirt cuffs , Prof. Watson was frequently " bagging an asteroid . " Prof. Cocker 's Christianity and Greek Philosophy was just out and placed as a text book in the hands of the senior class and Cooley 's ConstitutiOnal Limitations was giving him and the university a name on both sides of the ocean . In other words , the university was not conducted as a military post where boys were instructed to do some definite things and continually warned not to do other specific things , but all alIke , faculty and students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a common object . The moral as well as the intellectual life of the students was on a much higher plane than at the Lollege which was governed by stricter rules . " Another , a physician in St. Paul , writes : " Last summer I was in Cambridge for a week . I roomed in the college buildings and took my meals in the Memorial Hall . It was the week of Class Day , when nearly all the college students had finished their college duties ; and if the Devil finds woi*k for idle hands , here was a first-class opportunity , During that week I failed to see a single act that the most critical observer could censure . " A few days later I wa* for a few hours at another institution , noted for its strictness , and I confess I saw a good deal of rowdyism . Harvard has practically no laws ; the other has a statute book full of them . 1 think I may be regarded as an impartial observer , for I am not a graduate of either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might greatly multiply , but all such testimonies that I might cite would be evidence to prove this point ; that it is useless for the American college to attempt to control conduct by rules ; it is worse than useless ; and further , it is of abounding value in the American college to attempt to control conduct and to form character through personal relationships and through the necessity of hard work . // Has the college the right to demand of students personal conduct which the homes from which students come , and to which they still belong though in college do not demand . It may be at once said that the college has the right , abstract and absolute , to make any demand which it sees fit to make . The college is usually a private corporation , although in certain large relations it is a public trust , and therefore it may do whatsoever seemeth to itself good . But a college never interprets its rights in such a hard and fast way . It holds its powers in trust for the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of the people may be promoted . Yet the president of one college writes to me defending the right of the college to exact from students , in the matter of drinking for instance , conduct not required in their homes , on the ground , ( 1. ) that a college ought to have a higher standard of life than many homes , ( 2. ) that college life is beset by special temptations , and ( 3. ) that in their homes young men are surrounded by older friends and little children . They are in their homes to be compared to grains of powder scattered through a barrel of sawdust , while in college the inflammable material is sifted out from the community and put by itself , so that special vigilance is required to prevent excess . A graduate of Amherst , himself a distinguished clergyman of the Congregational Church , writes : " No college can afford to lower its moral requirements to please anybody , and it can not afford to imperil its students by allowing any who followed evil practices at home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate also writes in a bold spirit that : . " The college has the right to demand of students , in the matter of drinking for instance , conduct not required in the home if the college has , or proposes to have , any character itself . If the student smokes , drinks or swears at home , afortiori he ought to be taught better in college . " A professor in a New England college says : " I think the deterioration in college life due to the change in the community . Cards and spreads were not countenanced in old times , and the same was true of dancing , smoking , and social evils . I believe cards hurt our students worse than all else put together , but even the ministers of today are expert at whist , certainly the professors . The country is wealthy , and it is the rich people that bring these evils upon us . It is not that I consider cards , dancing , and smoking wrong , but they take away Interest in study ; you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not appoint professors who think more of these things than of their studies . Encourage Y. M. C. A. and healthful exercise . " VOL . CLXVI. - *- NO. 496. // 306 Another graduate , who is at the head of one of the great missionary boards of one of the great churches , says : " If the conduct of a student is such as to affect unhappily the character of the college , I should say that the college had the right by all means to exact from that student different conduct , whatever his home life may be . I feel that our colleges should show a life and character with more sinew than can be found in a great many of our homes . " Further testimony is derived from another graduate of Amherst College who is also at the head of one of the great home missionary organizations : " I should hold the opinion that the college has the right to require of students conduct which may not be demanded in their homes , In so far as the welfare of the college seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the home , with the home influences around the boy , which may not be allowed with safety in college when the boy is out from under the watch and care of parents . " But , on the other side , it is said that colleges have no right to exact from their students conduct which their homes do not demand . The judge of the Probate Court and Court of Insolvency of one of the large counties of Massachusetts writes " Colleges should not exact total abstinence from drinking , smoking , card playing , dancing and other things not wrong per Se . The professor of hygiene may lecture on the evils of excess in any of these habits , but the college should not interfere unless such habits prevent the student 's attaining the minimum standard of scholarship and deportment . " A professor in a divinity school says : " I think that the college has the right to have its own standard of personal conduct irrespective of the home habits of students , but I should hesitate to make that a punishable offence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon as a thoroughly Innocent indulgence . The expressed wish of a parent in such matters would seem to be entitled to some consideration When I was a member of the faculty of Antloch College under the presidency of Horace Mann , the habit of profane swearing was made a bar to graduation and card playing by the students was prohibited , but Mr. Mann attempted in general the maintenance of a higher ethical standard among his students than has been thought feasible in most other colleges . It must be confessed that in these efforts he was in no smaj degree successful . " A gentleman , himself able and distinguished and the son and grandson of able and distinguished statesmen , writes upon this point saying : " All the college has the right to exact from the students in the matter of drinking , for example , is a fair degree of temperance and respect for the public . Exceptional cases of disorder should be ruthlessly weeded out . Except where these cases appear the students should be allowed to conduct themselves in such way as they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school says : " Certain rules as to conduct , e. g. against the keeping of wines or liquors in college rooms , may be permissible , though I think such prohibitions should be established with caution ; but I should think any attempt to denounce as immoral practices which students have been in the habit of seeing indulged in by the nersons whom they most respect in the community in which they have lived , such as smoking , drinking , card-playing , however well intended such denunciations be , would be pretty certain to have an evil result . " And also , a distinguished citizen of Boston a short time before his death wrote as follows : 1 ? Several rules tending to good conduct , as , for example , the forbidding of the use of liquor in college rooms , would seem proper , as showing the opinion and influence of the college on the subject , but in a general way one of the most important objects is to teach the students self-restraint and self government rather than to make them correct by compulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most precise and closely regulated schools are , in the largest proportion , wild ' when they get to college . " I have thns at length set forth opposite opinions respecting the right of the college to exact of students methods of conduct which their homes do not demand . The general question , the two sides of which are thus set forth through these testimonies , has its quickest application to the question of the use of liquors . Shall the college endeavor to promote total abstinence among its students , or shall it endeavor to promote what is literally called temperance ; in other words , shall it through the practice of its officers indicate that it is well , if they so desire , for men to partake temperately of liquor , or shall it , through the example and practice of its professors , indicate that total abstinence is the only rule for the highest type of self-respecting gentlemen ? Upon this point I can have no question , but that the best rule for the American college , through the person of its officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only reason for this judgment , to which I now refer , lies in the fact that the reputation of a college as favoring the most temperate indulgence in liquor by its officers hnrts that college in the judgment of a large body of the American people . Whether with reason or without reason , many homes would decline to send their sons to colleges which do possess this reputation . It is the duty of the officers of a college to see to it that in every possible way the reputation of that college shall be of the worthiest. // I was riding a little while ago in the smoking room of a car and a distinguished gentleman , a professor in a very consph*uous American college , coming into the smoking room , lit his cigar . He at once said to me , " I suppose you do not object to my smoking . " Of course I replied in the negative . But he added , " I suppose you do not smoke . " I also said I did not , and I enquired , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8U**O36 you do not smoke . " ' His answer was , " I think a college president should not smoke . " The reasons which would lead my distinguished friend to the opinion that the college president should not smoke would also lead him to think that the college president should not drink . But upon this point a college may prefer to make its own choice ; it may prefer to minister only to those who do wish their children to be brought up in the temperate use of liquors . If a father wish his boy to be brought up in the temperate use of liquor , it is fitting for him to send his son to a college in which the temperate use of liquor is promoted . 1 suppose it must be said that there is no method by which every boy going to college can be saved from evil . In any system of moral government it is apparently true that some will make evil choices and must suffer the results of such choices . In any system of college government it is probably true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results occurring in the colleges do not at all militate against a free and large treatment of individual students . On the whole , it is apparently the rule to give to men freedom , even though freedom will be to some a very expensive and destructive luxury , rather than to make all men puppets and nonentities . Let rather the American college believe that its students come to its halls with high purposes , with characters directed toward righteousness , eager to learn the truth , susceptible to personal influences , and willing to lend themselves to the best relationships of the college . The life that the students live in such an atmosphere is the best life itself and is also the preparation for the best life . With each passing generation the freedom belonging to the American college student increases . It ought to increase , for the college students of to-day are better men than the college students of thirty and forty years ago . A professor in Johns Hopkins University , writing of his own college , Amherst , says : // " College life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my student days . I ascribe the fact to the gradual blending of student life with a larger social life , which is always saner and sounder than that of monastic communities and college halls , where young men are thought to be secluded from the world . Old-time college life was barbaric and uncivilized compared with that of the outside world . The sooner students are taught to be citizens and members of society the better it will be for colleges and for the country . I think the highest type of education is to be found only in a city university , where the student is in the world , but not of it . The country college is perhaps better for boys and for athletics , but country seclusion is by no means an ideal condition for student morals . " A friend , writing to me of his college , says that after a careful observation of his own class he had come to the conclusion that 85 per cent . of his class-mates werc morally clean . Twenty years ago I know that hardly 50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally clean ; the change has been great and in every respect salutary . The newspapers teem from time to time with reports of the frolics and escapades or the deviltries , sins , and crimes of college boys . Such reports are usually exaggerations ; but it is to be at once said that the personal morals of college men are far superior to the personal morals of any body of young men of equal size outside of the college . A distinguished graduate of Harvard writes me saying : " The moral tone of college life among the students In my day was , to the best of my judgment , distinctly better than the moral tone of young men of the same age outside of college walls . There were dissipated young men there then , as there are dissipated young men there now ; but the dissipation of young men outside of the college walls was in my judgment distinctly lower , more vulgar , and more degrading than that of those inside of them . " A professor in the College of Iowa says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the average student is noticeably superior to the non-student in life and in character . Were this not so I should be tempted to the most profound pessimism ; as it is , how3ver , I am able to indulge only in the most cheerful optimism . " The college man is none too good , but he is growing better with each passing generation . He now represents the highest type of young manhood . He will continue to grow better with each passing generation ; he will embody a yet finer and nobler type of manhood . Worthy freedom under worthy conditions represents the best method and agency.
