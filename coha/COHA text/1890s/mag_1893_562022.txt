txt THE last half century has seen changes as great in the Church as in the State of England , and it is only those who have seen them , and lived in the midst of them , who can realize how great these changes have been . It is to the Oxford movement that most of them are due . At the commencement of that period the most earnest and influential school of religions thought in the church was the Evangelical , of which the Rev. Chas . Simeon was the leader . The Oxford movement was in its infancy . The " Tracts for the Times , " commenced ten years earlier , were beginning to attract attention as a possibly serious force in the future . Consequently against them men of very different schools of thought banded themselves together , though they could agree about little else . A good story that illustrates this is told of what happened at a dinner given by a leading Evangelical clergyman . The dinner was in May , when the societies favored by the Evangelical party hold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests ; the lady sitting next to him inquired whether he had been to any of these meetings , upon which , to the surprise of the company , the clergyman shouted out : " Meetings in May , Madam ? Meetings in May ? Hounds meet in May ? Never heard of such a thing . " At that time the influence of the State in church matters was excessive . The power of governmental control which had hindered the Church from sending bishops to America a century before was felt to be paramount . Until the year 1819 , no church could be built in England without an Act of Parliament authorizing its erection . The difficulty and expense of obtaining such an Act were great , and consequently at a time when population was // increasing at a rate never before known , not more than one or two churches were built annually , and good sort of ignorant Church people erected dissenting chapels to preserve the people from lapsing into heathenism . As the State then hindered Church expansion on the one side , so it thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrament of Holy Communion into a test for civil office . The Test and Corporation Act required every officer in the army or navy , every candidate for the office of Alderman or Mayor of a corporate town , and for many other positions , to bring a certificate of having received the Holy Communion at church before he could be admitted to office ; whilst the Roman Catholics were excluded from public positions of all kinds by the oath which the law required them to take . It would be difficult to invent two more effective hindrances to the growth of the Church 's spiritual influence than those just named . Between 1819 and 1840 these State arrangements for the Church had been happily swept away and a strong antagonism to her claims and position had been aroused . A popular Prime Minister had bidden the Bishops set their house in order , leaving them to complete the sentence . The Bishops in times of political excitement were mobbed and insulted on the streets . As an example of what was done it may be mentioned that whilst the Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a poor neglected part of his diocese , a bull was turned loose amongst the people gathered to see the ceremony . Ten Irish sees were suppressed , and each year was expected to see more far reaching changes . When we turn from the political aspect of the Church 's affairs to the condition of her sacred buildings and services and her hold upon the spiritual thought of the country we find very much what might be expected . Her temporalities had been rigorously defended in the past , but there had been no thought of making them effective for the spiritual edification of the people . Pluralities were almost universal . Benefices were looked upon as estates to be held by men in Holy Orders , rather than as cures of souls . So lately as 1820 one man held the Deanery of St. Paul 's with the Bishopric of Lincoln , both being well endowed ; and he provided for one of his sons by giving him a c*nonry at Lincoln and another at Winchester and several benefices in // different parts of the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who could thus accumulate to themselves spiritual offices , or rather the income of spiritual offices , could not be expected to be very regardful of the spiritual interests of their flocks . Ill-paid curate* were placed in charge of the parishes in which the Rector did not reside ; and it was a rare thing for a parish , however large or populous , to have more than one clergyman to minister to its wants . The consequence was that only the routine duties required by law were discharged , anything beyond that was considered superfluous . There was no aggressive action on the part of the Church against the unbelief and practical materialism that were growing up on all sides . The sick and the dying were uncared for , the people were unvisited , the children were untaught , the most solemn services of the Church were so negligently performed as to be productive of evil rather than good ; whilst the social improvement and well-being of the poorer members of society were unthought of . There were , of course , many exceptions to this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the spiritual welfare of their people , who mourned over the miserable condition to which the Church was reduced , and who sacrificed themselves and their fortunes to make full proof of their ministry . Such men were exceptions , but they happily existed . They were looked upon as enthusiasts , and were carefully excluded from the important positions of the Church by those in authority . For the most part they were found in benefices with incomes too small to tempt the cupidity of worldly-minded men . The condition of the churches was as unattractive as neglect could make them . There was no thought of decoration , no effort to beautify them . They were filled with appropriated pews , the sides of which were sometimes so high as effectively to hinder their occupants being seen by the rest of the congregation . In some country churches the squire 's seat was fitted up as a parlor , with a table and chairs and a fireplace , and with curtains to hide the occupants from the view of the rest of the congregation . Nor were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unknown , a metrical Psalm was sometimes sung , with the accompaniment of an orchestra that must have been intolerable to musical ears ; opportunity being furnished for this outburst of song by the clergyman retreating // into the vestry to exchange the surplice in which he had read the prayers for the black gown in which he was to preach . The people rarely joined in the responses , while the Psalms for the day were read alternately by the parson and clerk . Little provision was made for the poor , and dullness was the prevailing feature of the service , There was little to distinguish the church from the meeting-house , except that its services were colder , and its sermons more scholarly and correct , but much less exciting and amusing . In the eastern counties it was no uncommon thing for one clergyman to serve three or even four churches , one hurried service a week being given to each . In Lincolushire it was very rare to find a clergyman serving only one parish ; if not a plnralist , he would give one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was rector , and then provide the same amount of spiritual ministration as curate to some non-resident incumbent in a neighboring parish . Even in such cathedrals as St. Paul 's , London , where there was great reason for more being done , there are many who can recollect the verger coming to them and saying he hoped they would not give the minor canon the trouble of celebrating the Holy Communion for their benefit , as he would have to do if they did not withdraw . The week-day services in cathedrals were compulsorily maintained , but the choirs and clergy attended so irregularly and behaved so irreverently as effectually to keep worshippers away . There were few churches in which Holy Communion was celebrated more frequently than once a month . Under these grave conditions , when the old defences for the Church Establishment had been swept away , and when a government hostile to the Church was in power , schemes of all kinds were suggested for ending or mending the Church . The wildest proposals for altering the Prayer Book were freely canvassed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential Churchman wrote : " I would have little or no fear if I thought we could stand for ten or fifteen years as we are . " But such an anticipation seemed out of the question . As an illustration of the extent to which this feeling pervaded the country , and was seriously contemplated by men in a position to take a fair view of what was likely to happen , I may mention what happened with regard to a valuable estate belonging to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul 's . It had been lew I for 300 years to the Corporation of // London , and the lease was on the point of expiring . Land that had been open fields when the lease was granted had been covered with valuable buildings . It was discussed in the Corporation solicitor 's office what should be done to obtain a renewal of the lease . After discussion it was determined that nothing should be attempted , for it was said : " We shall soon have the cow , why care for the calf ; " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longings will soon be confiscated ; why trouble about a fragment of its property . Such was the state of things viewed from the outside . Looked at from within there were defenders unequal to contend against the enemies who surrounded them . Those . who had leaned on the arm of the State , and their name was legion , had lost the power on which they had relied for protection . Evangelicals were earnest and zealous , but their theology was too narrow , too much like that of the sects who were assailing the Church , to make it possible for them to rear an effective barrier of defence ; and there was a liberal school , of which Dr. Arnold was a leading n*ember , who were prepared to surrender all that was distinctive in the church teaching to unite in one body with the dissenters . All this has to be borne in mind if people would rightly estimate what has been accomplished in the English Church during the lasL half century . Then it was that a few earnest men keenly felt that the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly to reassert the principles for which her more earnest defenders had contended in days gone tzy , the principles for which Archbi3hop Laud had been content to die , and which had marked the writings of great divines in the Elizabethan and Caroline periods . Foremost amongst these there was John Keble , a man of great literary attainments , a double-first class man at Oxford , a tutor of his college , a poet , but shy and retiring , not formed to lead a party , preferring the quiet of a small country curacy to the more prominent life of Oxford with its possibilities of future eminence . To train some future clergymen who might benefit the Church , lie took charge of several young Oxford men in the vacations , to whom he acted as tutor in the country , and from whom he would never receive any payment . Amongst their number were Hurrell Froude , Isaac Williams and others . The first of these was destined to play an important part in the fcw years of life that were allotted him . // He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to be true , not averse to controversy , nnselfish , indifferent to worldly interests . On him Keble 's teaching had the greatest influence ; it completely moulded him in the religious principles of his instructor . As a fellow of Oriel College he gradually became intimate with Newman , who had begun life as an evangelical , and had then been attracted by Whateley , afterwards Archbishop of Dublin , and his liberal school . At that ' period of his life he had so little sympathy with that school of thought in the English Church with which he was afterwards identified that he had secured the election of Dr. Hawkins as Provost of his college by defeating Keble . Through his friendship with Froude he became intimate with Keble after a time , and supplied what was needed to make the enterprise on which he embarked successful , and now these friends , together with some others , resolved to do whatever could be done to persuade churchmen to rest the defence of the Church upon the principles just spoken of , At first Dr. Pusey stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an active and important part in their proceedings . This great venture was the publication of a series of tracts , well known since as " Tracts for the Times . " The first of these , written by Newman , bears date Septemier 7 , 1833 , and the special principle for which these publications were to contend is thus set forth in that tract which was primarily addressed to the clergy : " There are some who elect their Divine mission on their own nnsupported assertion ; others who rest it upon their popularity ; others on their success ; and others who rest it upon their temporal distinctions . This last case has perhaps been too much our own . I fear we have neglected the real ground on which our authority is built-our qpostolical descent . " To establish this , and what follows upon it , the divine character of the Church , its independence of the State in all that relates to its doctrine and discipline , was the one aim of the Tract writers , as it has been of those who have followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the government of the day desired to force the University to receive dissenters , a stand was made against the attempt chiefly by these men , and Denison , afterwards Bishop of Salisbury , accidentally meeting Newman at the time , said to him : " To make a stand against the government // by a handful of men here is absurd . What do they care for you ? They will only despise you . " But they had resolved to go by faith , to do what they believed right regardless of what the result might be , and they counted the cost . They knew that by so doing they forfeited all prospect of fame or success in their profession , and that they must give np all thought of what is most attractive in this life-promotion , wealth , comfort . Slowly they won their way . The example of their holy , self-denying lives had an attraction which enthusiastic and religiously disposed young men could not resist ; and seven years later when I entered the University of Oxford nearly the whole of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by them . One way in which that life showed that the men who accepted it were in earnest , was that they regarded obedience to all college and university regulations , as not less part of their religious obligations than seeking for the teaching in which they took more interest and pleasure . Instead of college chapel being regarded as an irksome disciplinary regulation , undergraduates attended twice in each day instead of the once that was obligatory , the college fellows and tutors who agreed with the Tract writers setting them the example . The solitary celebration of Holy Communion in college chapel during each term was supplemented by a weekly celebration at St. Mary 's ( of which church Newman was Vicar ) at 7 o'clock , and it is pleasant to recall the appearance of Dr. Pusey and others who were never absent , some of whom had evidently found but scant time to attend to their toilet . Then it was no uncommon thing to find men who took a Sabbatarian view of their religious duties and practically spent the whole day in fulfilling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 8 , University sermon at 10 , and also at 2 , Newman 's service at St. Mary 's at 4 , when most of his Parochial sermons , subsequently published , were preached , and then prayers in College Chapel at 7 . Religion became the dominant principle in Oxford . I can truly say that in no other place have I ever seen such attention to its outward requirements ; fasts and festivals were strictly observed ; theology was studied to such an extent that the writings of the fathers in old editions became difficult to procure , even at greatly increased prices . There was an enthusiasm that seemed to &amp;arry everything before it The sad reflection is that in looking back one has to mourn // over so many friends , with whom one was then entirely in accord , who have strayed into other paths , some having deserted to Rome , others having adopted what are euphemistically termed liberal views of religion ; all of them having been more or less shaken by the subsequent action of Mr. Newman . At the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the views of the Tract writers would be looked upon with the greatest disfavor by the rulers of the University and those outside it . The Provost of Oriel cross-questioned every candidate for a fellowship in his college on the subject , and made it certain that his opposition would be assured against all disciples of this school , whatever their qualifications might be , and he emphasized his opinions by practically dismissing from their tutorships some of the more distinguished writers of the Tracts . The heads of some of the colleges altered the dinner hour on Sundays , so as to make it impossible for the men to attend Newman 's service at 4 o'clock ; and it was understood that rustication might follow if a man failed to dine in hall on that day . Fanatical clergymen came to preach in their turn before the University and took the opportunity of denouncing the teaching of the Tracts and their writers ; one preacher , more zealous than wise , took for his text : " They wax fat ; they shine , " applying these words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ascetic forms of Dr. Pusey and*Mr . Newman were seen below the pulpit , to the intense amusement of the congregation . There was nothing in the ceremoniaf employed by Mr. Newman and his friends to distinguish it from what was practised elsewhere , except that the services were more reverent . At the early celebrations at St. Mary 's an old custom was continued that I have never seen elsewhere . The communicants were ranged round the stalls of the long chancel , and white cloths were spread on the desk for books before them ; there they remained , and the celebrant and his assistant went round administering the sacred elements to them . There were one or two memorable scenes in church . When Newman was preaching his last University sermon , which was on Development , he startled the crowded congregation by saying : " Thus Protestantism has unexpectedly developed into polygamy , " referring , no doubt , to the case of Philip , Prince of 2Hesse , Luther 's defender . It seemed as though an electric shock // had passed through the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he preached his last sermon in the English Church . His subject was the parting of friends , and as in calm , unimpassioned words he poured out eloquent descriptions of such partings there was not a dry eye in the church . Strong men like Dr. Pusey and Jack Maurice sobbed aloud ; the church literally rang with the sound of their weeping , and gave such an illustration to the words " he lifted up his voice and wept " as I had never witnessed before . When the sermon was finished , the preacher came down from the pulpit , took off his University hood and threw it over the altar rails , as much as to say , Now my office as a teacher has come to an end . Another remarkable day at an earlier period was that which succeeded the publication of " Tract 90 . " The whole University was wild . with excitement . Four well-known tutors had signed an appeal to the Vice-Chancellor , asking for its condemnation , and their appeal was posted at the buttery hatch of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours the first edition was exhausted , , and men rushed eagerly about seeking to borrow a copy from any friend who had been so fortunate as to secure one . I remember one of my college friends , who was helping Newman , rushing up to me to beg for the sight of a copy , saying , " I hear we are to be burned . I should like to know what for before it happens. * ' After the events just named , it was felt that the whole aspect of affairs was changed . Men said the Oxford movement is shipwrecked . There was distrust where there had been confidence . A reaction had set in , and no one could tell how far it would go . Some men deserted to Rome ; others felt disinclined to trouble themselves further about religion . It was a shock to find that , after all , Newman had doubts about his position , though no hint to that effect had been publicly given in his sermons or elsewhere . The question was asked , Did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or was it only a mere academical discussion ? After all that Newman had said against Rome , will he become a convert ? Earnest , enthusiastic young men who had yielded to the influence of his teaching , felt sick at heart ; they did not know what to do . If what they had learned was not true , they felt there was nothing true . It seemed to them for the moment that they had been deceived . Fierce attacks were // made on the movement from all sides , and he who had been the leader was like Achilles , sulking in his tent . Those outside his intimate circle of friends could only guess what would happen ; whilst his intimates , as we now know from recent publications , could never have had a doubt what the end would be . Still , when the end came , it was a shock to them , as I learned from a friend of his who showed me a letter from him announcing his submission to the Church of Rome , which was the first intimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was found , after a time , that he had taken with him much fewer people than might have been anticipated . Of all the writers of the " Tracts for the Times , " he was the only one who left the communion of the Church of England , and he was the only one of the number who had been educated in Low Church traditions . The shock that had been given was eventually found to have been far less injurious than was at first supposed . It had compelled earnest men to examine how far they were leaning upon principles and how far upon the influence of a teacher whom they reverenced . The former remained steadfast ; the latter fell off to the right and to the left . Men like Dr. Pusey came more to the front , and soon obtained the confidence of those who had been influenced by the teachings of the Tracts . After a time a new phase came over the movement . Some enthusiastic mew thought that oral teaching ought to be enforced by a corresponding ceremonial . They revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonial beyond that of which churchmen generally could approve . They aroused a fierce antagonism ; and every instrument by which their opponents could hope to overwhelm them was unscrupulously set in motion . It would be difficult to defend the consistency of the judgment of the law courts in cases where their aid was sought to suppress the practices objected to . In one point only did these judgments agree , and that was in not favoring innovations . Parliament was besieged with petitions to put down these so called troublers of Israel ; a Royal Commission that sat for three and a quarter years was appointed to examine the question and report upon what could be done , and their report was on the popular side . Legislation was attempted and one Act was passed , which was expected to crush the movement . But no weapons that were forged against it prospered . In spite of everything that was done , its influence in // the country increased ; its opponents after a time practisd nYany of the observances against which they had at first vigorously protested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paramount importance of the truth , which they felt had been intrusted to them , and defended the principle for the support of which the writers of the " Tracts for the Times " had commenced their publication . The principle was that the Church was not a branch of the State , but that it was responsible for making its own laws and enforcing its own discipline . Men were found willing to suffer imprisonment and the loss of all things , rather than yield a hair 's breadth in a matter which they felt to be vital . They were content to be condemned unheard in a civil court , rather than give their sanction , as they felt it would be , to the right of such courts to interfere in such matters , by pleading before them . Without examining the wisdom , or the want of wisdom , of what they said and of what they did , it must be acknowledged that this result has been attained . The principle for which they contended has been accepted to a great extent by the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living influence such as it did not possess ; its claims to a Divine authority have been realized by foes as well as friends ; and if its enemies are more actively hostile , and more determinately set upon its destruction than they were , its friends are infinitely more resolved to do whatever can be done to make its spiritual power and influence more widely felt , and to secure that it should be worthy to become in reality , what it is in name , the Church of the Nation.
