Too much for science and for me , by half . There , dear , I promise , next time , on my word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My life shall be the forfeit . Yes , I own it , I am " just horrid . " Well , you will postpone it ? A half an hour ? I knew she would , God bless her ! Too gentle to the stupid old Professor . He sits at table R. Sweet little Kate !

Turns to his writing Let 's see ! " This gas is strictly not a gas , but rather  --  " Look here , Professor , you 're a precious father . These serious duties you 've assumed , are you Quite sure you 've conscientiously gone through ? The child of thirteen summers is to-day A woman  --  a " young lady . " Come , we 'll say You 've taught her Latin , Greek , and Mathematics , Algebra , Botany , and Hydrostatics , History , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thoroughly  --  and unnecessarily . O wise preceptor ! with pedantic goad Urging the tender mind to bear this load . Putting a sweet child 's youth upon the shelf To make her like your sciolistic self . At cost of happiness growing over-wise  --  She ca n't be happy thus . She has blue eyes And golden hair , and cheeks of rose and white , And I have set her Latin themes to write ! She 's sweet eighteen ; she 's pretty , and she 's gay . My Kitty 's probably inclined to play . She 'll learn to love balls , dancing , admiration ; And then , of course , come young men , and flirtation . They 'll find her pretty . That I must expect , too . Further , they 'll say so . This I may object to . Well , well , a selfish gardener , my flower , My one , I 've hidden in a gloomy bower  --  Robbed it of freedom , as of light and air !

Enter Kate L. U. E. Kate . Kate Winstanley May I come in ? The Professor . The Professor Of course ! Kate . Kate Winstanley Here is a letter Marked " most important "  --  but perhaps I 'd better Let the epistle with my luncheon wait Till the report  --  The Professor . The Professor Unscientific Kate ! Give me the note , drop that irreverent air , And reads  --  hm-hm-hm ! This , dear , is your affair . Kate . Kate Winstanley Mine ? Who 's the writer ? The Professor . The Professor Buckingham de Brown , My pupil , he who was to settle down And study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist , Whose careless laugh bids serious thought avaunt  --  He 's just the very husband that you want . Kate . Kate Winstanley The husband ! The Professor . The Professor Yes , the very husband ! Pray Listen to me , my dear . This very day I had recalled a duty long neglected ; That letter is no more than I 'd expected . Kate . Kate Winstanley But , if you please , what is all this to me ? The Professor . The Professor That 's true , I did n't mention . Well , you see , Just listen then to Buckingham : " My dear , My most respected master "  --  So far , clear ? Kate . Kate Winstanley Quite . The Professor . The Professor Well , you see , I could n't but remember That you were May , if I was  --  ah  --  September . Not with my logical train of thought to bore you  --  I felt that I must seek a husband for you . Of course , you notice the necessity ? Kate Kate Winstanleycrossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me ? So , sir , to settle my hymeneal fate , Till long past noon you 've let my luncheon wait ? The Professor . The Professor Kitty ! Kate Kate Winstanleycrossing R. I thought you deep in your report  --  Had I suspected anything of this sort  --  The Professor . The Professor Indeed , I  --  Kate . Kate Winstanley No excuse ! it 's rankest treason Against my welfare , without rhyme or reason . Why spend the time Science might better fill In marrying me off against my will ? The Professor . The Professor Aha ! I see . The persecuted ward  --  The cruel guardian  --  the unwelcome lord . What , would the fairest maiden ever seen Braid the gray tresses of St. Katharine ? Kate . Kate Winstanley I did n't say that . The Professor . The Professor Then the bridegroom meant Is hateful ? Kate . Kate Winstanley Not quite that  --  indifferent . The Professor . The Professor The ground for your objection I ca n't see Quite clear . Kate . Kate Winstanley You wish to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks it . Kate . Kate Winstanley Well , it shall be as you say : You are my guardian  --  I can but obey . The Professor . The Professor My dear , your choice shall be your own , of course . I do n't habitually use brute force . But see  --  I am your guardian and your tutor : From these two standpoints do I view your suitor . I judge him by known quantities , and find The youth quite tolerable  --  never mind ! I 'm thirty-five , old , crabbed , and pedantic ; You are eighteen , and possibly romantic . You 've formed your own ideal of a lover  --  You want your romance  --  Buckingham goes over . So much for him . Kate . Kate Winstanley I think you take a pleasure In planning to dismiss me , sir ! The Professor . The Professor My treasure ! Dismiss you ! That is , to dismiss the light , The life of my poor house  --  to exile outright The gracious spirit , the delightful fay , Whose magic wiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I fain To break my willing little captive 's chain . I shall be lonely when you leave me  --  Kate . Kate Winstanley Who Has spoken , of leaving you ? The Professor . The Professor Not I , nor you , But common sense and reason . Fate lays out The path of every mortal . You forget How long we 've walked together , you and I. It 's more than time we separated . Kate . Kate Winstanley Why ? The Professor . The Professor " Why ? " Do you ask ? My task is ended now . My friend , your dying father , made me vow That I would take his place  --  Kate . Kate Winstanley And well , dear friend , You have kept your vow . Heaven took him , but to lend A dearer father to the lonely child , Who wept , abandoned ; learned to love , and smiled . I have never known a parent , saving you , Nor ever felt the loss , nor ever knew Where else to bring the love and gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all my childish joys and sorrows  --  The Professor . The Professor Crying ! Kitty , my dear ! Please do n't ! I 'm only trying To make things pleasant . Kate Kate Winstanleystill sobbing . Oh , indeed , quite charming ! The Professor . The Professor I ca n't see that the prospect 's so alarming . You 'll have a quiet , obedient little spouse , And stay and share the old Professor 's house , And he sha' n't part us . Kate . Kate Winstanley But I do not see Why there is any need of marrying me . The Professor . The Professor My duty . I have told you once , my dear  --  Your happiness . Kate . Kate Winstanley My happiness is here . The Professor . The Professor To that kind compliment I 'm quite alive . But ah ! I know I 'm old  --  Kate Kate Winstanleylaughing . Yes ! Thirty  --  The Professor . The Professor Five ! Full five-and-thirty . Kate . Kate Winstanley Five-and-thirty you 'd Think marked the confines of decrepitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The younger men you seem to me as young . And you yourself know , I could never say " Papa " to you . The Professor . The Professor O flatterer , away ! Kate . Kate Winstanley No flattery ! Get some gray hairs before I can believe you old . The Professor . The Professor You ask no more ? A gray peruke without delay I 'll don  --  One with a bald spot . Kate . Kate Winstanley Well , that 's getting on . The Professor . The Professor And then we 'll speak of marrying you ? Kate . Kate Winstanley Oh , come ! Marriage , like charity , should begin at home . You who on marrying all the world are bent , Why do n't you marry ? The Professor . The Professor I ? That 's different . Kate . Kate Winstanley " Do unto others as you 'd have them do To you . " Please say , is the reverse not true ? The Professor . The Professor A right sound doctrine ! But , all jest aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . Kate . Kate Winstanley Oh , pardon me ! The Professor . The Professor Well , from that day I vowed My life to study ; kinder fate allowed That you should fill the heart that bled for her : And I , by memory left a widower , And by my love for you , a father , thought My broken life was rounded  --  Kate . Kate Winstanley Which you ought Not ! Most decidedly . What if happiness Once more this " broken " life of yours should bless , Can you think truly the beloved shade You mourn would envy you ? The Professor . The Professor But what fair maid Would smile upon me now ? Kate . Kate Winstanley I know one or two That I could mention . The Professor . The Professor You have known me blue , Humdrum and stupid , misanthropic , slow ; Pedant and bookworm , rusty as a crow ; Bent o'er my books  --  I 've almost got a hunch  --  And never ready at the hour of lunch . Kate . Kate Winstanley I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ; Wise without pedantry , though you seem to doubt it ; Kind , and still kinder than the world has known ; A kindness shown to , guessed by , me alone . And she would have just reason to rejoice On whom might fall the honor of your choice . The Professor . The Professor A list of virtues which would scarcely steal The heart of a young lady  --  Kate . Kate Winstanley I appeal From that unrighteous verdict . Do you hold All girls so frivolous ? The Professor . The Professor No , not when they 're old . Kate . Kate Winstanley Indeed ! Your mood 's sarcastic , sir , to-day . Believe me , there are some quite different ! The Professor . The Professor Nay ! Deceiver worst of all , can even your flattery Call me respectable in my  --  my  --  cravattery ? touching his necktie . Is this old coat with foxy velvet collar The fashion ? Would n't , say , a half a dollar Be well laid out in treating to new soles These shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And , worst of all my faults , Have I the faintest notion of a waltz ? Of talent , charm , or grace , have I one jot ? Would you take such a husband ? Kate . Kate Winstanley Well , why not ? The Professor . The Professor Dear child ! You 're very young and innocent , And I  --  blind bookworm o'er my folios bent  --  Have never told you life may yet disclose Another love than child to father owes ; And that some day  --  but I have been too fast : I thought you a woman  --  you 're a child  --  Kate . Kate Winstanley At last ! I thought ' t would come . In toto I deny The soft impeachment.  --  Child , indeed ! Not I. I am a woman ! And my woman 's heart Has known that love already  --  felt its smart . I have had my romance  --  not a happy one . The sunflower of my life has found its sun . The Professor . The Professor What  --  no  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Already  --  loving  --  secret and alone . And I guessed nothing . Yes , I see it now  --  Your late refusal . And I noticed how You started when I spoke . What could say more Clear that the little heart had throbbed before ? Who is your hero , then ?  --  Who is it ? Say ! Handsome and young ? Brilliant and polished  --  gay ? And does he know that he has won possession Of that sweet heart ? Come , let 's have full confession ! Kate . Kate Winstanley Handsome ?  --  Perhaps ! I know that he is good . Young ?  --  Well , I think he could be , if he would . Less brilliant than profound ; less gay than true . As far as I 'm concerned , he  --  oh , he 'll do ! I have known him at your house . I have loved him  --  well  --  Always ! But yet I 've never dared to tell . And now I 'm very much afraid I sha' n't Unless he  --  helps me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 'll have to guess  --  I 'd rather not . I 'm going now  --  to keep that luncheon hot ! Exit precipitately L. U. E. The Professor The Professoralone . Kate ! I  --  confound it  --  I am dreaming  --  no ! Yes ! What 's the lucky devil 's name ?  --  do n't go ! His name ! By Jove ! I must have fallen asleep , And dreamed . It strikes me I have dreamed a  --  heap . No , I 'm awake . My wits have ta'en an airing . Asleep or crazy ? Neither ! I am staring , Stark wide awake . Fates adverse and propitious ! What hear I ? Things impossibly delicious . Yet real  --  unpermissible and real . That is important . I am her ideal . Is it  --  any other fellow , if not me ? No ! Ca n't mistake it  --  it 's too plain to see She loves me . I am sure of it  --  I know it . That 's what she meant . Did n't her features show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while Is beating in a rather lively style . My blood 's on fire ! I feel just like a  --  star . Kate ! I 'm in love , dear  --  more so than you are . But no . The devil ! This will never do . I 'm but a father to her . ' Tis n't true  --  Poor little thing , so good , so innocent  --  For love she takes a child 's fond sentiment . ' T is madness  --  sweet to me , but madness still . And I must cure it , cost me what it will . Enter Kate , L. U. E. , with the luncheon . Kate . Kate Winstanley The luncheon , sir . The Professor The Professorhuskily . My daughter ! Kate Kate Winstanleyaside . Daughter ! gracious ! His way of guessing things is  --  is vexatious ! The Professor . The Professor Come here , my child . Kate . Kate Winstanley I come . The Professor . The Professor I 've understood . Kate Kate Winstanleyaside . Upon my word , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know your hero . Kate Kate Winstanleyaside . This is perspicacity Indeed ! The Professor . The Professor Although it took some slight audacity To recognize the flattering portrait . Yet , My Kate , think calmly if your heart is set Upon a love that may be , at the most , A warmer gratitude . I can but boast Poor paltry claims , that your too kindly eyes Exaggerate , to this too generous prize . You are young , and louder than cool reason 's voice Impulse may speak , and guide a childish choice . When the young heart is filled with love 's soft light , All things it looks on catch the radiance bright . You scarcely realize , I 'm sore afraid , The shade you take for love  --  and such a shade ! But he you think you love knows all too well Your error : knows his duty is to tell What sacrifice , unconscious though it be , This dream entails . A cruel guardian he Who thus would cheat his child . My little Kate ! Your debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you paid me long ago . If debt there be , ' t is what to you I owe . Pride of my home , joy of my heart  --  oh say , Is it a debt that I shall ever pay ? Kate . Kate Winstanley Then , my Professor , none may give you love , Whose eloquence a heart of stone would move , Whose burning words would render , I believe , A Romeo jealous ? You can not conceive A woman 's heart must yield itself to one Who sings of love  --  as  --  well , as you have done ? The Professor . The Professor But , Kate ! Kate . Kate Winstanley You 're better pleased the account to cast So that the balance to my side is passed  --  To search arithmetic and logic through To prove by A plus B I do n't love you . The Professor . The Professor I cry you mercy ! Kate . Kate Winstanley To your will I bow . You were my guardian ever , and are now . You 're wisdom 's self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark , since your own hand 's so strong . Before your great experience I incline . To prove how I mistrust this will of mine  --  Write to De Brown , then , that at your command I accept his  --  love  --  his fortune , and his hand . The Professor . The Professor Do you accept ? Kate . Kate Winstanley His hand , his fortune  --  The Professor . The Professor You 're Not jesting ? He your husband ! Are you sure ? Kate . Kate Winstanley Why not ? He 's young , destined to cut a dash , Handsome  --  and such a wee  --  wee  --  wee mustache ! The Professor . The Professor You are laughing . Kate . Kate Winstanley No . He is a good parti ; A well-assorted couple we shall be . He 's of good family , and , it 's only fair To mention also , he 's a millionaire . The Professor . The Professor I know you better than to think you speak Your mind in this . Your judgment 's not so weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cold . You 're not a girl to love a sack of gold . Say what you may , I do n't believe you care For Brown , were he ten times a millionaire . You can not like him , and , to tell the truth , I do n't , myself , greatly admire the youth . A boy , as boys go , good enough , agreed  --  But not the one to marry you . Kate . Kate Winstanley Indeed ! The Professor . The Professor A shallow dandy  --  a mere mutton-head , Who puts on mighty airs ; snobbish , half-bred ; Ignorant , careless , loose , unscientific ; Of good works barren and of debts prolific . Laziest of men , unwilling or unable To read a book . At home in club or stable , But nowhere else  --  a man who will , of course , Divide his love between you and  --  his horse . Kate Kate Winstanleyaside . I thought so . The Professor . The Professor He 's unworthy such a treasure , Look elsewhere for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as you say . But I supposed you knew I was but doing as you told me to . The Professor . The Professor Well  --  but  --  I thought  --  Kate . Kate Winstanley You see , one may mistake At any age . But what choice shall I make ? Young Buckingham de Brown is , we will say , A type of all the young men of the day . If this be so , and if we wo n't have him . The chances of the rest grow rather slim . In very truth , as far as I can see , I 'll never get a husband  --  The Professor . The Professor Kate , take me ! Kate . Kate Winstanley You ? The Professor . The Professor Yes , my love , you wanted to , just now . Kate . Kate Winstanley Oh , but , since then , you know , you 've shown me how I erred in such a choice . And to the letter I 'll follow your advice . The Professor . The Professor For want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , if you were not so old . The Professor . The Professor So old ? Kate . Kate Winstanley Yes , thirty-five . The Professor . The Professor I never told Any one that ! My birthday is next week . I 'm thirty-four at present . Kate . Kate Winstanley So to speak , That 's middle-aged . The Professor . The Professor I have n't one gray hair  --  In my whole head . Kate . Kate Winstanley Well , they 'll soon be there . The Professor . The Professor No , I 'll be bald first . Kate . Kate Winstanley But you never go Into society . The Professor . The Professor But I will , you know . Kate . Kate Winstanley Your dress adds to your years full eight or nine . The Professor . The Professor Buckingham de Brown 's own tailor shall be mine . Kate . Kate Winstanley Algebra ' ll be my rival , I foresee . The Professor . The Professor Only to prove my love by A plus B. Kate . Kate Winstanley You 'll not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Professor ' Twill be your task to teach me all those things . Kate . Kate Winstanley But then , my guardian , is it your advice That I should make this awful sacrifice ? The Professor . The Professor You saucy jade ! Kate . Kate Winstanley And only as a daughter Can a girl love the patriarch who 's taught her To say " papa ! " The Professor . The Professor No  --  that I did not  --  never ! O Kate ! you 're laughing . Oh , you saucy , clever , Malicious  --  angel ! Jove enthroned above ! Mars ! Gods eleven , I have won her love ! Her love ! Yes , I was idiotic , blind , Not to have guessed it . Kitty , never mind ! We 'll make up for lost time now  --  wait and see  --  I love you , dear , more even than you love me . Back matter Curtain .
