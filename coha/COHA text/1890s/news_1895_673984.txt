txt A railroad-crossing fight took place here this afternoon between the employes of the Harlem Railroad Company and those of the White Plains Trolley Company . The electric company is completing its line in order to provide for the traffic of the county fair , which will open Monday . The Harlem tracks cross Railroad Avenue , which is the route of the trolley road . The rail construction has been completed on both sides of the Harlem tracks , but the crossing has not been made . In order to operate cars , it is necessary to connect the tracks on the west of the railroad with those on the east side by a bond wire , in order to complete the return circuit to the power house , which is on the east of the railroad , while the county fair route is on the west . Superintendent A. K. Foss of the trolley road attempted at 2 o'clock this afternoon to run a wire through a waterway under the tracks , but Superintendent Phyfe of the Harlem Road called his men and stopped proceedings by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon dashed up with 150 men . They were strung along the crossing with picks and shovels . The attempt to cross under the rails was then abandoned , and an attempt was made to string a wire overhead . The wire was attached to a trolley pole on one side of the tracks , and was carried over . The wire was seized by the railroad men , and the trolley employes were forced back by superior numbers . The trolley linemen then mounted two telegraph poles , and attempted to gain their point in this way , but were thwarted by the railroad people , who pulled their rope line down . By this time fully 2,000 persons had gathered to watch the proceedings . Their sympathies were evidently with the trolley people , and bystanders eagerly took hold of the wire to assist the trolley workmen . When the war had been waged for three hours the wire was carried over , but the gravel engine was backed up and a rope was thrown over the wire , the end being pulled from the hands of the trolley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught one of the railroad gates , and it fell among the crowd . George F. Coombs , a contractor , was struck by a piece of the failing timber , and his shoulder was broken . George Hemingway of Sing Sing was injured about the hand and arm . The United States mail catcher beside the track was caught and smashed . A team of horses plunged among the crowd . Chief of Police Bogart arrested Richard Powers , conductor of the gravel train , for signaling the engineer to back . Roadmaster Eggleston caught hold of the wire , and was ordered to loose his hold by Superintendent Foss of the trolley road , and , refusing , was struck on the hands , and three fingers were broken . At several times a riot and free fight appeared imminent , but cooler heads prevailed . Superintendent Phyfe ordered his men off at 6 o'clock , and in a few minutes the wire was strung by willing hands . When it was stretched in place the crowd cheered loudly and dispersed .
