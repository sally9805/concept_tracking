txt The new regulations made by the Department of Agriculture , which the department has beer . empowered b , 7 recent legislation to enfcrce after July 1 , will prevent the shipment across State lines , for domestic consumption , of carcasses of pork or beef which have been rejected for the export trade on account e , f : their diseased condition . The department has - no power , however , to compel the destruction of such carcasses or the transformation of them into fertilizers or harmless food products , nor can it lawfully enforce a regulation forbidding tire sale of them for domestic consumption in the State where they have been examined and condemned . The new regular tions will , however , make it very difficult for owners of such carcasses to sell them anywhere as wholesome food . It is provided that if the owners shall refuse to dispose of the carcasses in the proper way , the Government 's Inspectors shall brand the word " condemned " upon each side and quarter and keep a record of the carcasses zio treated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sworn report to the departmeat every month as to the disposition of the ca ? - casses so branded , showing to whom t  --  iey were sold ( if sales were made ) and for what purpose , and whether the purchaser was informed as to the condemnation of them by the Inspectors . If the owners Shall attempt to defeat the purpose of the department , a little judicious publicity will , as we suggested a few clays ago , bring them to terms . The enforcement - of these regulations , with the cooperation of local Boards of Health , will prevent the sale for consumption at home of diseased beef and pork which the Government will nut permit to be shippod abroad .
