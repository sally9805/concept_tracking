txt Commissioners of Accounts , like Sheriff 's juries , are expected to bring in a maling without much regard to the evidence . Commissioners Wahle and Owen present the usual report in the case of the charges made by ex-Fire Commissioner Henry Winthrop Gray in regard to the purchase of supplies for the depart- ment . They find , as they were expected to do , that the charges are not sustained and that the management of the department is particularly virtuous and wholesome . Nevertheless , we have the best of reasons for believing that conclusive evidence to support and prove the principal charges made by Mr. Gray can be found by whoever will look for it in the right place . We believe it can be demonstrated that the kerosene oil for which the department paid 10 cents per gallon could be bought for 6 cents ; that the blue vitriol for which Mr. Soteldo paid 6 cents could be had for 3 3-4 cents , and that the grate bars which Mr. Soteldo bought at 4 cents a pound could have been had at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to be fooled by testimony some portions of which were prepared with too little care and other portions , we fear , with a great deal too much care . They dismiss the charge as to the destruction of public records as being beyond their jurisdiction , which is a just plea , but those charges are already proved by the confession of Commissioners Scannell and Eickhoff . The matter can not be allowed to rest here . The Commissioners allude to a public examination which may be held if deemed necessary . In our judgment , the credit of the Fire Department and of the City Government calls somewhat loudly for an inquiry of a very public and thorough nature .
