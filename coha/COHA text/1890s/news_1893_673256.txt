txt The proceedings of any convention called at the suggestion of so pestilent a demagogue as IGNATIUS DONNELLY Will inevitably be colored more or less by propositions and discussions calculated to make the judicious grieve . At the first.session of the Anti-Trust Convention we find . DONNELLY soberly proposing that the courts should encourage crime by declining to permit the prosecution or any person  --  who has stolen property belonging to any Trust or similar combination . He also suggests that all the property , real and personal , of combinations should be confisoated . Several delegates have urged that the Government should buy all the coal mines and railroads , and at the very beginning of its labors the convention had before it a fine medley of remedies for the evils which it is to consider . If anything is to be , accom plished , the sober-minded among the delegates who have been sent to Chicago by the Governors of thirty-four States must shut off the pernicious gabble of the cranks . The convention should consider the antiTrust laws already enacted by Congress and the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several States . The Federal law is described by the author of it , who is a delegate to this convention , as an adequate and effective statute . Is it either adequate or effective/ If not , how should it be amended / Why has it not been enforced If it be well designed to meet the ends which the author of it had in view , what measures should be taken to insure the enforcement of it by Federal prosecutors 7 These are some of the questions which the convention should try to answer . Others are suggested by the State laws enacted within the last three years .. It is notorious not only that these have not been enforced , but also that no honest attempt to enforce them has been made . Are they defective ? If so , in what way should they be amended ? And if they are not defective , how are the people to bring about an effective use of them The delegates ' from the States where such laws have been enacted ought to be able to report intelligently on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust combination so obnoxious that it can not procure a corporate charter from the people in any one of a dozen States that might be named and . that are represented in this convention . We say " from the people , " and it is true that the laws under which such charters are granted have been enacted by the people in their representative assemblies ; but if the application of an obnoxious Trust for a charter should be Submitted to a popular vote in any one of these States it would be rejeoted by an enormous majority . What the people could not be induced to do by their votes at the polls , if the issue should be presented to them there , they are doing every week at the capitals of their States through the agency of their statutes relating to corporations . This is a matter that may well engage the attention of the convention . It is absurd that the people should be giving valuable corporate privileges and powers with one hand , so to speak , to combinations which they are prosecuting or trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
