txt TH * commercial primacy of the world belongs to the country that can produce the cheapest pig iron . For this carries with it the ability to command the cheapest machinery and the cheapest transportation , which , in their turn , render possible the conversion of raw materials into manufactured products and the delivery of these to tbe consumer at the lowest attainable range of cost . Iron and steel are produced in the least favored localities of the United States as cheaply as in Great Britain ; in the most favored localities they are produced more cheaply . Yet , in the very centre of American iron and steel production the ore and the fuel have to be brought together from points a thousand miles apart , while in Great Britain a hundred miles is quite an exceptionally wide interval between the two . How has this formidable handicap of 900 miles of transportation been overcome ? How has it become possible to produce a ton of pig iron in Pittsburg to-day at about the same price as the ore entering into that iron cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer would have to enumerate a variety of causes , including improvements in blast furnace construction and practice , and economies in the production of coke . But underlying them all is the controlling influence which determines the cost of the ore  --  the depth of water in the Lake channels . By every foot that this depth has been increased the distance between Duluth and Cleveland has been virtually shortened by 100 miles , so that in the 40 years in which the depth of water on St. Clair Flats has been doubled , and a navigable depth of 20 feet has been established in the St. Mary 's Falls Canal , the cost of transporting a ton of ore on the Lakes has come down from four mills to six-tenths of a mill per ton per mile . // Time was , and that but recently , wh ? n Pennsylvania , New York , New Jersey and Ohio found within their own borders most of the ore that was iieeded to supply their furnaces . In the census year 1880 , the mines of these four States yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States being but 7,120,362 tons . In that same year the Lake region contributed only 1,677,814 tons , or 23.6 per cent . of the total output . In 1896 the total ore production of the country was 16,005,449 tons , to which the contribution of the four States named was only 1,456 ,  - -  740 tons , while that of the Lake region was 10,566,359 tons , or 66 per cent . of the whole . Last year the total shipments of ore by Lake from all the Lake ports aggregated 13,681,522 net tons . In other words , the expansion of the iron and steel industry of the United States has become contingent on the supply of ore from Minnesota , Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan . The question of whether the ore should go to meet the coal or the coal to meet the ore has been answered in favor of the movement of the ore , for two reasons : First , because of the greater nearness of the coal region to the seaboard and to the great primary markets for finished steel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage is greatly simplified by the fact that the coal required for general use in the Northwest supplies , in part at least , a return freight . Were the coal taken to the ore , the whole freight movement , except in grain and lumber , would be in cue direction , while , as matters stand , against ore shipments of 13,000 tons , the tonnage of co4 going in the opposite direction is about 6,500,000 tons . But for the water transportation furnished by the Great Lakes , it is safe to say that the Superior mines would never have been developed , and the rapid advance now being made by the United States toward the industrial supremacy of the world would have been impossible . There are , it is true , practically unlimited supplies of ore and coal in the States of Alabama , Tennessee and Georgia , but the ores are mostly what is known as non-Bessemer in quality , having , as a rule , too much phosphorus to admit of their profitable employment in the making of steel . In addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much less rich in iron than those of Lake Superior . The advantage which rich ores enjoy over " lean " ores is cumulative , resulting in a smaller cost per ton of product , because of the *aving in fuel , fluxes , labor cost , and furnace space . There are no // finer Bessemer ores in the world than those which the Lake Superior ranges yield , a fact which is becoming painfully apparent to the British iron master , who has to go to Spain and Sweden to supplement the deficiency of his native ore . Even at a rarddly increasing scale of consumption , the period of their probable exhaustion ean hardly be said to belong to the arena of practical discussion . It is but six years since the discovery of the Mesabi range nearly doubled the productive possibilities of the Lake mines , and developed a system of surface mining at whose rapidity and economy of operation the world has not ceased to wonder . Here , then , is the very keystone of the rapidly expanding structurE of the industrial greatness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change from Pittsburg to the south shore of Lake Erie ; the head of Lake Superior , even , may come to be the seat of furnaces and rolling mills to supply the needs of the Northwest ; but , be the ore converted where it may , the five great ranges of Marquette , Gogebic , Men ominee , Vermilion and- Mesabi will continue to supply , as they do to-day , the raw material for most of the steel produced in the United States . An expenditure of between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000 will represent the contribution of the Government of the United States toward bringing the head of Lake Superior as near to the foot of Lake Erie as the latter is , in point of cost of transportation , to Pittsburg . The work has been , on the whole , intelligently and honestly done . Much of the money expended has gone to the deepening of the Lake harbors , a work no less essential than the deepening of the Lake channels . Of these latter in which are found the natural obstacles to navigation between Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beyond it Lake St. Clair and St. Clair River , connecting Lake Erie with Lake Huron , and the St : Mary 's River , connecting Lake Huron and Lake Superior . The draft of vessels navigating the lower Lakes has always been controlled by the depth of water on St. Clair Flats . The St. Clair River originally entered Lake St. Clair through several different mouths or passes . Previous to 1858 the depth of water by way of the North Pass was only 9* feet . Improvements at the South Pass , concluded at about that time , provided a depth of water of nearly 12 feet . The St. Clair Flats Canal , projected in 1856 and finished in 1871 , gave a depth of 13 feet , which by 1874 was increased to 16 feet . In 1887 the work of // 158 deepening the canal and its approaches to 20 feet was begun , and is now practically complete . On the lower Detroit River , the channel at what is known as the Lime-Kiln Crossing could not be depended on for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in 1874 and progressed from year to year till by 1890 a navigable passage 440 feet wide and 20 feet deep was finally secured . This is to-day the most important water highway in the world , the vessel tonnage traversing it being four times as great as that passing through the Suez Canal , and as much as the entrances and clearances in the foreign trade of Liverpool and London combined . But the trade of the lower Lakes could never have approached its present dimensions had the trade of Lake Superior remained undeveloped , and the rapids of the river at Sault Ste. Marie continued to obstruct navigation . The first ship canal to turn these rapids was constructed by a private corporation under a land grant from the State of Michigan . It was begun in 1853 , and opened to navigation in 1855 . Its cost was about a million dollars , and it was a little over a mile iii length , with an available depth of 12 feet . How limited was the commerce thus provided for may be inferred from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the canal was 405 tons . In 1870 the United States Government made its first appropriation for improving the canal , so as to obtain a 16-foot navigation . The new lock was open for business in 1881 , but had not been five years in use before the need of further improvements became manifest . These began in 1886 , and have finally resulted in the construction of a new lock 800 feet long and 100 feet wide throughout , with 21 feet of water on the sills . The prism of the canal has also been deepened to correspond with the available draft of water in the lock . Supplemented by the improvement of the Hay Lake Channel , from the canal to Lake Huron , this work supplied the last important link of a 20-foot channel between Buffalo and Duluth . In 1891 , General 0 . M. Poe , who has been identified for 40 years with the improvement of the lake channels , reported that an expenditure of $3,339,567 would be required to remove the remaining obstructions to a minimum depth of 20 feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and the results are already apparent . During the season of 1890 a little over 9,000 ,  - -  000 tons of freight passed through the St. Mary 's River ; in 1897 // the total was close on 19,000,000 tons . Speaking of the former aggregate and the corresponding figures for the Detroit River , General Poe remarked : " The increase in the available depth of channels on the lakes from 9* feet in 1852 to 16 feet in 1882 developed this commerce , and it is only reasonable to expect that a further increase of 4 feet will make a correspondiniir increase in the shipping . The results are most noticeable , perhaps , in the character of the vessels employed in the carrying trade . These have increased in size and seaworthiness until they form a fleet which has not its equal upon any inland waters on the face of the globe . Of large capacity and great power , regardless of wind or weather , steamers of the prevailing type bear their cargoes to and from ports a thousand miles apart with the precision of railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten ordinary freight trains . Surely , such a commerce deserves every aid and encouragement that can be extended to it . Give it channels practically navigable upon a draft of 20 feet , and it needs no prophet to foretell a wonderful growth ; but only a prophet can foretell its degree . The fact is to be noted , however , that the increase of Lake traffic since 1890 has been almost entirely traceable to the increase due to Lake Superior . The gain of 9,000,000 tons passing through the Detroit River is more than covered by the gain of 10,000,000 tons passing through the St. Mary 's Falls Canal . Of course , that part of the freight movement of Superior whose port is Chicago or Milwaukee does not enter into the returns of Lower Lake traffic . There is even a considerable current of freight-that of ore from Menominee and Escanaba to Chicago-which , passing through neither the upper nor the lower of the great passes of the lakes , escapes tabulation . Keeping in mind these qualifications , it is interesting to note that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Falls Canal during the navigation season of 1897 , 10,633,715 net tons were iron ore . In 1890 the ore tonnage passing through the canal was 4,774,768 tons , so that of the total increase of 10,000,000 tons in the canal traffic since 1890 , 6,000,000 tons have been in iron ore . It seems a clear case of the facilities creating the trade ; but it is more than this , it is a satisfactory example of intelligently directed public expenditure lending new vitality to private enterprise , and laying the foundation of national supremacy in the fundamental department of // manufacturing industry . During the 40 odd years of continuous improvement of the Lake channels the ship-builder has pressed close on the heels of the Government engineer . In fact , the builder has frequently been somewhat ahead of his pioneer . Steamers requiring when loaded a given draft of water have always been on the stocks while the corresponding depth of channel was being secured , and have often been afloat before it was forthcoming . The 20-foot minimum is , by no means , a finality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the Lake harbors have been deepened to conform to the channels . The process of harbor improvement is now going on , and as the Lake steamer requires but a foot or two of water under her keel the new ones have been built for a mean draft , when loaded , of 17 feet . On this draft the largest of them , measuring 475 feet over all , 50 feet beam and 29 feet deep , can carry 6,500 to 6,750 gross tons of ore . This is the latest phase of the evolution of a type that had its origin some 50 years ago , when the capacity of the largest of Lake craft was 600 tons . In the early seventies a steamer of 1,300 ton*i occupied the front rank ; by 1885 the maximum had risen to 2,500 tons , and a steamer of 3,000 tons was a monster , about the possibility of whose profitable employment practical men had grave doubts . Most of the steamers composing the Rockefeller fleet , and constructed within the last few years , are built to carry 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer could have got into Lake Superior 13 years ago ; and , while the capacity of the Lake freighter has thus been doubled during a period comparatively short , the cost of building and running it has been reduced at a ratio of from 30 to 40 per cent . That is to say , the 5,000-ton steamer of to-day costs only $5 per ton to build , while the 2,500-ton steamer of 1885 cost $7 per ton ; the coal cost per trip of the 5,000-ton steamer instead of being double that of the 2,500-ton ste*mer , does not average 25 per cent . more ; and , while 16 round trips between Lake Superior and Lake Erie ports was considered a good season 's work in 1885 , 22 round trips are now merely a fair season*s Work . It will be perceived that , though the average freight rate on ore is less Lhan half what it was in 1885 , there may , for the modern type of vessel at least , still be a sufficient profit in the business . With the increase in size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining and transfer appliances has fairly kept // 161 pace . The open-pit mining , which has become possible on a large scale since the discovery of the Mesabi range , has reduced to a minimum the cost of taking the ore from the ground and placing it on a railroad car . To open a mine of this kind it is only necessary to strip off some 30 feet in depth of superincumbent soil and begin with a steam shovel or a " wiuze " the process of extracting the gigantic deposit of soft ore . The capacity of the steam shovel is nothing short of marvellous . Professor Tunell , who made a report to the Secretary of the Treasury on Lake commerce early this year , says that during one day in the summer of 1896 three stcam shovels , working 14 hours each , dug and raised from the natural bed of the Oliver mine of the Mesabi range 10,700 gross tons , or 420 carloads of ore . Twenty-five-ton ore cars have been continuously loaded from the ore bed at the rate of 2* minutes per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hoisting engines of 200 horse-power , has loaded as much as 5,825 tons , or 233 cars , in a day of ten hours . The average cost by this process of loading the ore into cars from the bed of the mine is easily within 5 cents per ton . It is calculated that since 8 tons of ore are uncovered for each yard of surface stripped off , and as stripping costs some 40 cents per cubic yard , an additional cost of 5 cents per ton must be added to the mining cost under this head . That makes the initial labor cost of Mesabi ore on the cars 10 cents per ton . The remaining cost consists of interest on and depreciation of mining plant , royalties and transportation . The first step in the process of transportation consists of the 70 miles , more or less , from the mine to the shipping port . This is covered by railroads equipped with cars specially designed for the ore traffic , and with ore docks built as high as 57 feet above the water , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the holds of the vessels lying alongside . So expeditiously is the work of loading done that vessels frequently leave port with an ore cargo of 3,500 to 4,000 tons within two hours of the time of arriving at the dock . The work *f unloading is effected with only less expedition . It is not more than 13 years since the only method of unloading was to use horse power to lift the ore from the hold in buckets , dump it into wheel-barrows , wheel it on the dock and empty it on the stock pile . To-day , on the new dock at Conneaut may be seen at work the most highly developed mechanical method of handling the ore . There is no // longer any stock pile , but in its place a steel car capable of carrying 50 tons , , into which the ore is delivered direct from the hold of the vessel . The apparatus of transfer consists of 12 great legs , divided into four separate groups of three machines each , running on a 20-foot track . Each leg spans five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine the boom extends to the further side of the vessel , permitting more than one bucket to operate in the same hatch . When all the legs are at work the capacity of this plant is between 900 and 1,000 tons per hour  --  a speed at which vessels of the 6,000:ton type can be unloaded in less than 7 hours , or within one-half the time which has been but recently regarded as the minimum . About all the manual labor that is expended on the ore in its passage from the mine to the furnace is called into requisition during the process of transfer from the freighter to the railroad car , and , as will be perceived , this quantity is a steadily diminishing one . As to the remaining cost of hauling the ore from Conneaut to Pittsburg , it is the expectation of the directors of the road to be able to reduce it below three mills per ton per mile and still leave a sufficient margin for a dividend . Low as this rate is , however , it would make all the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transportation between the head of Lake Superior and the Lake Erie port . A ton-mile rate of three mills from Duluth to Conneaut will result in a freight charge of $2.55 , or a little more than the probable aggregate of all costs and profits on the ore from its place in the ground to the furnace at Pittsburg . The whole process of extraction , transportation and transfer is a very instructive study in the potency of small economies for building up a great industry . Foreign observers have remarked that the higher rate of wages prevailing in the United States has compelled our manufacturers to exert themselves in so perfecting their equipment as to get rid of manual labor whenever that was practicable . This process has been specially manifest in all stages of the iron and steel industry . The steam shovel is a product of the same necessity as the mechanical apparatus which has minimized the cost of production at blast furnaces and rolling mills . The point that seems to escape the foreign observer is that it is in the last degree improbable that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of price . Th* tendency of late years has been to bring about a consolidation of interests between // the mine owners and the iron and steel manufacturers-to eliminate not only the middleman in the ore market , but also the independent common carrier , whether by water or by rail . From the stripping of the mine to the production of the steel ingot , the effort has been to make but one continuous process , every stage of which should be under virtually the same direction , and at none of which should there be any tax paid in the shape of interest or dividends which does not inure to the profit of the combination . About one-third of the whole product of the Lake Superior mines is taken by the Carnegie Steel Company , and around this fact centre the influences which have given the ore situation its present shape and which are likely to make that shape a permanent one . Th* Carnegie establishment might be appraised at anywhere from thirty to fifty millions of dollars . It is a plant established on an enormous scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success that it should be fully employed . There is much more profit in working such a plant to its full capacity on a low range of prices than in having only part of it employed at relatively higher prices . But to establish such prices for steel as will insure the full activity of works capable of consuming 4,000,000 tons of ore per annum , it is evidently necessary that the strictest economy should be observed at every step in the process of production , from the mine to the rolling-mill . It is equally necessary that the company should be sure of getting its ore at a fairly uniform price , since under any other condition it would be impossible to make large contracts extending over a considerable period of time . For the cultivation of a foreign trade it is specially necessary that there shOuid be some degree of certainty as to the future price of raw material . It is considerations like these that underlie the so-called " deal " made between the Carnegie and Rockefeller interests . Mr. Rockefeller is the largest owner of the mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of the Mesabi ore renders its exclusive use in furnace practice impossible , 40 per cent . of it can be used in combination with harder and coarser ares . The agreement between the Carnegie Company and Mr. Rockefeller contemplates the taking of at least 1,200,000 tons of Mesabi ore every year , on the basis of a payment which is variously represented at a royalty of 25 cents per ton , or a payment of $1.05 per ton for the ore delivered over Mr. Rockefeller 's railway at the Lake Superior port . // 164 In the latter case , to the mining royalty of 25 cents has been added a uniform transportation charge of 80 cents per ton , which ineludes the cost of providing the transfer facilities already outlined . In addition to the railroad from the mine to the shipping docks , Mr. Rockefeller owns the fleet required to carry the ore from the Lake Superior to the Lake Erie port . The agreement provides that the rate of freight to be paid for this service shall be the average rate of the season  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per ton . At the Lake Erie port the ore is transferred to the Carnegie road , the Pittsburg , Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie route from Conneaut to Pittsburg . A simple calculation will show that under such an agreement as that above indicated the Carnegie Company gets its soft ore delivered at the furnace at a price below the lowest at which Bessemer ore has ever been sold at Lake Erie ports , and is entirely independent of the changes of the market to which the ore accumulated there used to be subject . But , Mesabi ore being good for only 40 per cent . of the composition required for satisfactory furnace work , the other 60 per cent . had to be provided for in some similar manner . This explains the acquisition by the Carnegie interest of the great Norrie mine on the Gogebic range  --  the largest iron mine in the world  --  and of other properties yielding a like product . To avoid the risk of being exposed to a disastrous competition , other great iron and steel producers have made similar combinations with mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two great branches of the industry on which commercial supremacy is built have become one . The question of controlling the steel market of the world is primarily one of ore , as Great Britain , which has to import about a third of its entire consumption , is finding out to its cost . It is because this question has been finally settled here , and all further progress can tend only to make the ore cheaper than it is to-day , that the statement may be hazarded that for gen*rations to come the primacy of the United States in the production of iron and steel is manifestly secure.
