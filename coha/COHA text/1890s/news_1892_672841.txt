txt Every visitor to the President for a fortnight has come away from the White House convinced . if lie has ventured to lead the talk up to the Chilean controversy , that the President , while desirous that Chile should avoid breaking friendly relations , was fearful that the delay in offering the reparation demanded by the United States was rather for the purpose of making ready for resistance than for bringing the Chilean people to an attitude of consent to the President 's demands . None of the assurances obtained from Chile have been encouraging . The result of the talk between Mr. Wharton and Minister Montt , which Mr. Wharton reported directly to the President , was calculated to encourage the belief that there was no intention yet formed by the Chileans to do anything except to postpone a conflict until Chile could be better prepared for it . One of the most conservative of Democratic Senators , who had persistently ridiculed the notion that war could possibly come out of the controversy , came away from President Harrison with a contrary opinion . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President than ho would have believed If told him by any less well-informed person , and he was a convert to the belief that a collision is imminent . The dispatch from Commander Evans stating that four Chilean vessels are ender sailing orders to start from Valparaiso Wednesday next leads naval officers to believe that the Chileans , in thus materially reducing their forces in their home waters , have concluded to send this squadron to the Straits of Magellan to waylay Admiral Walker and dispute the passage of the straits . Admiral Walker will be sent through before war is declared . and for the Chileans to interfere in any way with his passage would be to precipitate hostilities . If this course should be followed Commander Evans would be in a tight place with the Yorktown , which would be exposed to the attack of the forces in Valparaiso Harbor . Minister Egan would have to be notified and given time to get away , and in the meantime the Yorktown would probably be able to get off . People who know her commanding officer do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight unless the odds against him were overwhelming . Commander Evans has boon in a very dill-limit situation over since he was left alone at Valparaiso , but the Navy Department has every confidence in his discretion and in his ability to take care of himself and his ship . Secretary Tracy to-night made public the following dispatch he had received from Coin . mender Evans In regard to the Balmacedist refugees put aboard that vessel by United States Minister Egan and the Spanish Minister : VALPAIIA ISO , Chile , Jan. 16 , 1892 . Secretary of the Navy , Washinutou , D. C. : The American Minister informs me that the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs has chanced his mind about the refugees now on the Yorktown , and that they may be taken out of any merchant vessel touching at a Chilean port by local authority . Arrangements had been made for all of them to sail to-day , but this change of base on the part of the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs compels me to keep them , which crowds me vow much . Shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peru t No steamers from hero go direct to neutral territory . Tins unexpected act of the Chilean Minister of Foreign Athtirs is due , he states , in part to my saintlag the Spanish Minister when he came on board to deliver two ( 2 ) refugees . I have requested the American Minister to say to the Minister of Foreign Atfairs that I am responsible to my own ( 3overnmeut and not to that of Chile in such matters , and that I consider his criticism offensive and I will not accept it . His action seems unworthy of the representative of a serious Government . EVANS . This ref asal of the Chilean Government to allow the transfer of the Balmacedist refugees from the Yorktown to a mail steamer may make it necessary for Commander Evans to carry them up the coast to a Peruvian port , or to take them out to sea and transfer them to the mail steamer beyond the three mile limit . If he leaves Valparaiso It is probable that the Boston will be sent down from Callao to take the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been kept in ? Chilean waters during most of this controversy , as the Administration does not wish to seem to be threatening the Chileans while diplomatic negotiations are in progress . It has not been intended to send any more ships directly to Chile until all possibility of a peaceful settlement has passed away . If Chile yields without a fight , it will be be- , lieved that her course was dictated by the preparations made by the United States and her conviction that there must be an apology or a ruinous war . One noticeable feature of the naval preparations is the unanimity with which officers of all grades have applied for service in case of hostilities . As soon as there seemed to be a probability of war . applications for service afloat began to pour in at the department until the Secretary has many more volunteers than there could be planes for at once . The applications came not only from officers on the active list , but from retired officers as well . If war is declared , many of these veterans will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger men will be available for sea service .
