txt We are surprised that in its daily lecture to the United States Senate our high-tariff neighboi the Tribune , has ignored some recent and notable expressions of opinion Western Republican journals . Yesterday the Tribune undertook to tell the Senate " how the people stand " with respect to the pending Tariff bill and all its abominations , and it assured Senators - that " great multitudes " of Republicans in the West - were hoping for the " changes " . devised for the benefit of the rings in what our neighbor called some time ago " the bravest " of all tariff bills . And at the same time the Tribune had in its office the St. Louis GlobeDemocrat of the 4th inst. containing a very notable editorial article on " The Revolt against Higher Duties , " in which Mr. Proms is warmly commended and some interesting statements are made . For example , the Globe-Democrat says of " the attitude of - the Republicans of the West toward the tariff " that they have " interpreted - the revision to - which the party pledged itself in 1888 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the interpretation proclaimed on the stump and in the press . " The West insists that when duties are touched they shall be lowered . " Will the Tribune say that the Globe-Democrat knows nothing about the opinions of Western Republicans ? " So far as we have everbeen able to learn from atolcrably careful and conscientious study of the matter , there is not the shadow of en excuse for a single increase of duty which is made by the faefivi-nley bill . Not one argument has ever been presented in defense of this policy which ' is worthy of a moment 's consideration . " What does our neighbor say to this ? The Globe-.Dentocret even expresses regret that the party did not rise while the bill was in the House " against the policy which would condemn it to destruction . " But the ring organs - will keep up the stereotyped cry , " Pass ' the bill quickly . Delay is dangerous . "
