txt There was a flavor of romance in the final hearing before Magistrate Milligan this morning of the plausible young fellow who has been swindling the women of this and other cities . When the prisoner confronted the magistrate ho was self-possessed and apparently confident of acquittal . When he left in the custody of Lieut . Warnock of the Nineteenth District , en route to Moyamensing Prison , he was as dejected a specimen of humanity as a criminal could be pictured . " The most consummate scoundrel that ever appeared before me , " were the scathing words with which Magistrate Milligan dismissed the prisoner and , taking a bundle of letters and photographs from his desk and placing them in his pocket , he added : " Were it not for innocent people who have suffered through your rascally operations I would permit further evidence to be brought against you .

" By what name shall I commit you I " demanded the magistrate. , " You have my name , " whispered the prisoner . " Yes , I have a number of your names , " returned the magistrate , " J. B. Graff ; John W. Thompson , Jr. , and W. L. Russell . Which is the correct name ? " No answer . " I will hold you in $2,000 bail to answer at court the charges of forgery , false pretense , and passing fraudulent checks . " The young fellow 's lips quivered and he stammered : " You are the Judge ; you can do as you please with me . " " And I will commit you in the name of John W. Thompson , Jr. , " continued the magistrate . " Why do you use that name 's " asked the prisoner , looking up . Because I have every reason to believe that to be your real name .

" I will keep the names of your victims sacred , " . said the magistrate , sweeping the telltale documents into a drawer . " As for you , I can only repeat that so consummate a rascal has never before appeared before me . " " ; You can do what you please with me , " said Ate prisoner , " but I ask you not to mention the name you find in those letters . She was engaged'to be married to me . I do n't care for myself , but for her . She is of a good family . I do n't want her name published . I have not been doing the business very long . She trusted me . The only women that I have tried to get money or valuables from have been women for whom I have had no respect .

She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the civil engineer , for such the swindler has proved to be , and became engaged to be married to him . Thompson was not a drinking man or a gambler , but his parents had cut him off on account of some Youthful irregularities and he was dependent on his own resources . Well educated , with a remunerative profession and engagingaddress , he had no trouble in making his own way in the world until he met the young woman who captured his affeo- , tions . Then his discretion stati , swept away and his energies were beistupon acciumulating money in order that he might provide a handsome home for his prospective bride . With that object in view he jumped into his swindling career , making it his atm to fleece women who advertised for positions as governesses , companions , and aotresSes . Ills home is in a small town not far from this city , and the authorities , out of respect for his family , which is highly respectable , will not permit its name to be divulged .

The first witness against Thompson , alias J. B. Graff , before Magistrate Milligan this morning was Juliette Guerpillom the daughter of Mme. Marguerite S. Guerpillon , the teacher of French at 919 Spruce Street . The testimony of this young lady and her mother showed that while he attempted to swindle them out of the price of their tickets to California , where he pretended that he wanted them to go , the daughter as companion and the mother as governess in the family of his pretended sister , Mrs. P. D. Armour of Chicago , he had not succeeded in his scheme .

" Well , the evidence is not heavy against you , " said Magistrate Milligan . The prisoner took up his silk hat and smiled , but his joy was short-lived , for the magistrate called several other witnesses who fully identified " Graff as the man who , while masquerading under the name of W. F. Russell , " had forged the name of William F. . Russell , 615 North Seventeenth Street , a member of the firm of Russell &; Mason , Cotton brokers at 111 Chestnut Street , to-several checks for large sums , and had passed the checks , chiefly to persons living in Now-York . Tie prisoner would say nothing in answer to these unexpected charges . When Magistrate Milli , gan asked if there were any other witnesses against the prisoner , Detective Donaghy of Chief Wood 's staff , who , with his partner Murray , had been on hand to take the prisoner into custody should there be no " case " against him , stepped forward and said : " Well , you 've covered everything against him ; only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victimized many people , chiefly ladies .
