txt London Truth , in its characteristically frivolous way , makes a serious charge . What is gross and immoral in contemporary literature , it asserts , owes its existence chiefly to the demand of people of wealth and social station , if not necessarily of brains . It quotes , at second hand , however , the assertion of the keeper of a railway book stall in Paris , that " thirdclass " travelers like primitive sentiment , and , while the " second-class " readers are " omnivorous , ' it is the " first-olass " people , almost entirely , who buy the wicked literature and make the worst kind of French journalism profitable . This is a very grave charge to make , and if it is true France is certainly in a bad way . If it were only the ignorant , vulgar , and criminal classes who bought and read vulgar and criminal books and papers , there would be more hope for the country . We strongly doubt if the makers and vendors of that kind of stuff in America rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supposititiously refined persons . There seems to be a large and growing class of people here who support , either openly or on the sly , the worst kind of vicious journalism and read wicked and trashy books who could not well bo grouped , in the manner of the French vendor of reading matter , according to their incomes and social station . Whoever the majority of the readers of this stuff may be , it is certain , however , that no small share of the blame for its existence lies with people to whom we ought to be able to look for better things . New York " society , " using that term in its restricted sense , is essentially moral . As a body it has lent its influence to nothing harmful , but there are persons , and many of them , who get all their prestige from that society whose influence , we fear , is sometimes given to projects which are calculated to do infinite harm to Society at large . While the making of vicious books continues to grow more profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community seems powerless to check it , a certain portion of our minor periodical press seems to be emulating that of Paris . It only lacks now the wit and literary ability of the French feuilletonista and paragraphers . In the matter of illustrations it leaves nothing undone . The art is generally poor , to be sure , but the spirit is there . France can produce nothing worse . The foibles and scandals of " society " are the principal themes of these prints , and those members of " society " who think exhibitions of " skirt dancing " and the new pas de quatre fit " sport for ladies " are their heroes . As for the books , that are never mentioned in decent newspapers , but are notwithstanding conspicuous in current literature , they are largely cheap and ill-made translations from the French . but there is a variety of contemporary American romance that is just as shocking to the moral sensibilities and rather more vulgar . This sort of thing can not with impunity be overlooked by the respectable portion of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds .
