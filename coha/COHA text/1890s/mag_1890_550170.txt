THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES . By lames P. Colt . HE Supreme Court of the United States has celebrated its centennial . It has had a wonderful career . It deserves more than respect from Americans , and it has won the respect of all nations . We owe our reputation as a nation not so much to our advancement as compared with the rest of the world in arts and sciences , as to our form of government . The best government is that which secures to the governed peace and general welfare , along with the greatest measure of freedom . The Constitution of the United States provides for this as well as any constitution can , and the gratitude of the nation is due to the Supreme Court which has maintained and in a large degree made the Constitution what it is . Although the judiciary is the weakest of the three departments of our system , it has perhaps done more than either the executive or legislative to make the great John Jay First Chief Justice of the United Stetes. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheld the Constitution , even at times when doing this threatened danger to existing institutions ; it has taught both the executive and legislative that the Constitution must be strictly oheyed ; it has shown the states that its mandates are not mere words , and it has taught the people that the government which they instituted can not be changed or shaken save by the people . The Supreme Court has properly been called " the living voice of the Constitution . " We owe to it a national stability and sense of security which are among our greatest national blessings . " Few American institutions , " says Bryce , " have more contributed to the peace and well-being of the country " ; and we may add that few , if any , have more contributed to its permanent existence . The century just ended has been a momentous one . We , as Americans , may well be proud as we recall the great jurists who have adorned our supreme tribunal and read the long line of their decisions , which , to use the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to Westminster Hall in the proud season of English law . " The court is a novel and peculiar feature of what , at the time of its institution , was a novel form of government , but not unprecedented . Eleven out of the thirteen states had adopted constitutions in which the judiciary was distinct from the legislative and executive departments , and it was to be expected that a similar system would be chosen hy the framers of the Federal Constitution . It is an interesting fact that as early as the thirteenth century there existed a judicial system quite similar to ours . In the kingdom of Aragon , which was as nearly a republic as a kingdom could be , there was a judicial officer called a lustiza . The iustiza was elected by the people , and his decisions were final . He could declare an act of the legislature void , and the king himself was obliged to submit to his decrees . The novelty of our system does not consist so much in the fact that the court derives its existence from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent and character of its jurisdiction . We can best perceive this by comparing it with the English court of highest powers . The American Constitution is the enactm ent of the people ; and if Congress passes a law contrary to constitutional precepts , the Supreme Court can declare such law absolutely void . The British constitution , like ours , is the enactment , or rather series of enactments , of the people , but by a strange fiction , Parliament is considered to be the people . Its members do not merely represent , they are the people . This is hard for an American to realize . Parliament can and has prolonged its session several years beyond the time for which its members were elected , and it could , if it saw fit , dissolve itself without leaving any means of convoking a successor . Nothing but English common sense has stood in the way . It thus happens that the Lord Chief Justice and his asso chief Justice John Rutledge. // ciates can not declare an act of Parliament void or contrary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the people 's will , takes precedence over all previous acts , and is in the nature of a constitutional amendment . Constitutional law as a distinct branch of judicature is therefore unknown in England . The Supreme Court of the United States has another kind of jurisdiction , equally unknown in England , and which places it at the head of the world 's judiciary , and that is the power of settling controversies betwean states that call themselves sovereign . This is the highest function of a court , and the exercise of it brings into play qualities of mind which belong to the statesman as well as the jurist . When we consider what the court has had to do in the last hundred years , as the interpreter of the Constitution , the arbiter of the most delicate questions of international law , the judge of state controversies , and the chief check on the other branches of the government , we are amazed in finding so few mistakes . The Supreme Court is , however , like all other law courts in this respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come before it in the regular order of business . There must be a case with proper parties . If a constitutional question arises , it must be one on which the case d*pc ; u/s , else the court will not and can not decide it . If the constitutional question be a side issue , then all that the judges may say on it will be mere dicta . A dic/zuit is not a decision , and carries with it but little more weight than the opinion of any learned constitutional lawyer . It is valuable as showing how the court would probably decide if a case depending on a solution of the question should come before it , but it decides nothing . This necessity of an actual case , to any interpretation of the Constitution by the court , is oftentimes the means of preventing a decision on the validity of an act of Congress . It takes a long time to get a case before the court , the expense is often great , and litigants , rather than stand the cost and delay , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has thus happened that an act of Congress has been declared void thirty years after its enactment , the question of its legality having only then come before the court . The question arises , How came we to have this admirable tribunal ? to whom do we owe its conception ? and how came it to spring into existence , full-grown and in the amplitude of its present powers ? It has neither grown nor have its powers increased during the century . It was the same court in 1790 that it is in 1890 . Its duties were then , as now , to interpret and enforce the Constitution as the supreme law of the land . On the 29th of May , 1787 , the Federal Convention , assembled in Philadelphia for the purpose of draughtiug a constitution for the United States , began its great work . Edmund Randolph , then governor of Virginia , was the first to speak . After dwelling on the weakness of the confederation and the necessity of a stronger government , having for its basis the republican idea , he introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " each Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth. // of which he carefully explained , and one of which was as follows : " A national judiciary ought to be established ; to consist of supreme and inferior tribunals ; to be chosen by the legislature ; to hold their offices during good behavior ; with jurisdiction to hear and determine all piracies and felonies on the high seas ; captures from an enemy ; cases in which foreigners and citizens , a citizen of one state and a citizen of another state , may be interested ; cases which respect the collection of the national revenue ; impeachments of the national officers , and questions which may involve the national peace and harmony . " This resolution introduced the subject of federal courts to the convention , and contains the main principles concerning the judiciary which were afterwards incorporated in the Constitution . As most of the delegates were lawyers , it was natural that they should early turn their attention to the formation of the judiciary ; and on the 4th of June the above resolution was taken up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Supreme Court , and one or more inferior courts . The next day was devoted to a discussion as to the jurisdiction of the courts , and then the subject was dropped until the *8th of July . On the *8th it was again taken up . It was virtually decided that the judges of the national courts should be appointed by the executive , with the consent of the Senate . Trials by impeachment were taken from the Supreme Court , and the jurisdiction extended to all cases arising under the national laws . On the 25th of July the convention referred its previous proceedings to a committee , who were ordered to arrange them in the form of a constitution and report . This committee , called the Committee of Detail , consisted of Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts , Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut , James Wilson of Pennsylvania , Edmund Randolph of Virginia , and John Rutledge of South Carolina . The last four of these five men were eminently fitted for drawing up a plan of the judiciary . Wilson , " one of the deepest thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was an able lawyer , and was afterwards an associate justice of the Supreme Court ; Randolph was Attorney General of the United States under Washington ; and both Rutledge and Ellsworth became the highest officers of a judicial system , the foundation of which they helped to lay . On the 6th of August the committee made its report , and that part of it which pertained to the judiciary was adopted with no essential amendment . The convention then decided that the tenure of office of the judges should be during good behavior , and that their salaries should not be diminished during their continuance in office , believing that " a power over a man s subsistence amounts to a power over his will , " and that the judiciary should in no way be dependent on the legislative . Madison strongly urged that a veto power similar to that of the President should be given to the Supreme Court , but his views were not adopted for two reasons : because the legislative should not be in any way subject to the judiciary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a part in passing laws , the constitutionality of which they might later be called upon to decide . Law and equity jurisdiction was conferred , and the judicial power was extended to all cases arising under the Constitution , to all cases affecting ambassadors and other public ministers , to all admiralty and maritime cases to cases in which the United States should be a party , to disputes between different states , and to controversies between a state and foreign citizens , or between citizens of differ- ent states . In the first three instances the word " all " is imperative , and such cases must of necessity come before the federal judges ; in the others it was impliedly left in the power of Congress to determine what cases should come before them only on appeal from the state courts . Great care was taken to reserve to the judiciary departments of the several states all cases which might properly belong to them . Had this not been done , the business of the federal courts would soon have been hopelessly in arrears . The Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the labors of the convention were ended . The Constitution was submitted to the people , ratified by them , and became the supreme law of the land . In the conventions called together in the various states for the purpose of ratifying the Constitution , objections were made to the plan for the federal judiciary , on the // ground that it was given too much power , and that the state courts would be ousted from jurisdiction rightfully theirs . The objections were , however , met and overcome by the advocates of the Constitution . After ratification , all that remained was for Congress to organize the courts and fix the salaries of the judges . The Senate convened for the first time on Monday , April 6 , i 789 , and the next day appointed a committee to bring in a bill on the judiciary . Great care was taken in drafting the bill , so that when presented to Congress it was adopted by both houses with but few amendments . It provided that the Supreme Court should consist of a Chief Justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District courts , were established , and appeals from the lower courts provided for . Each state constituted a district , as did the territories of Maine and Kentucky , and the states Statue of Chief Justice Marshall by Story , at Washington . // were grouped together in three circuits . A marshal , with the powers and duties of a sherifl and a district attorney were to be appointed by the President for each district . The honor of drafting this bill belongs chiefly to Oliver Ellsworth , afterwards Chief Justice , and the fact that most of its provisions are yet in force is a sufficient encorniurn on the forethought and wisdom of its author . The original copy of the bill in Ellsworth 's handwriting is still preserved at Washington . Statue of Chief Justice Taney at Baltimore . // On the very day of the passage of the bill the first Chief Justice was appointed . President Washington fully realized the great importance of a strong Supreme Court . He knew that incapacity on the part of the judiciary would , in the unsettled state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to have judges who not only had the public confidence at the time of their appointment , but who would be able to hold that confidence . They must be statesmen as well as judges . They must be accurate reasoners , able lawyers , fair-minded , impartial , fearless , and , above all , friends of the Constitution . The events of the previous fifteen years were such as necessarily brought into prominence men well suited to hold public office , and therefore the task of selecting judges was not diffictilt . Washlngton nevertheless gave the subject much thought , and when the names of the judges were announced there was timversal approval . The first Supreme Court consisted of four judges John Jay of New York was Chief justice William Cushing , then Chief Justice of Massachusetts , James Wilson , the leading Federalist of Pennsylvania , and John Blair , an eminent judge of Virginia , were the associates . Robert H. Harrison , Chief Justice of Maryland , declined the honor . All were appointed in September , I 789 , an ( l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North Carolina was appointed in place of Harrison , and qualified in August , 1790 ; but it was not until August , 1792 , after Thomas Johnson of Maryland had been qualified , that the court had its complement of jtidges . No one stood bigher in the estimation of Washington than John Jay . This is evinced by the fact that Washington offered him his choice of the federal offices . Jay 's professional training and judicial experience at once prompted him to select the Chief Justiceship . The President was much pleased at the choice , and wrote , in the letter enclosing his commission , that it was a pleasure to address him as the head of " that dep* rtment which must be considered as the keystone of our political fabric . In nominating you for the important station which you now fill , I not only acted in conformity with my best judgment , but I trust I did a grateful thing to the good citizens of the United States . " The Chief Justice , at the time of his appointment , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known throughout the country . Jay was born in Ncw York in I ) ecember , 1745 . In 17fi0 he entered Columbia College , and four years later graduated with high honors . Upon graduation he gave his entire attention to the study of the law , and was admitted to the bar in i 7fi8 , when he formed a partnership with Robert R. Livingston , who afterwards became famous as Chancellor of New York . The future Chief Justice and the future Chancellor madle rapid stridles , and in a short time were prominent figures at the bar . The partnership , however , was not long lived , and Jay was destined soon to give up practice for a public career . He was successively a member and president of the Continental Congress , a member of the Provincial Congress of New York , Chief Justice of New York , minister to Spain , negotiator of peace with England , and secretary of foreign affairs , before he beChief Justice Salmon P. Chase . // came Chief Justice of the United States . In person the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine figure . His carriage was distinguished , and his fine , clearcut features indicated refinement and great strength of purpose . The first term of the Supreme Court was held in New York , the seat of the Federal Government , in February , r 790 , and after the adoption of rules of procedure , there being no business , the court adjourned . It does not appear that there was any case before the court until the August term in 791 . It is a little singular that there is no record of the place where the court sat during the first ten years of its existence . The first Circuit Court was held in New York on the 4th of April , 1790 , and then was delivered the first charge of a federal judge to a federal jury . Chief Justice Jay presided , arrayed , it is said , in a scarlet robe . His charge to the jury indicates that he deeply felt the solemnity of the occasion . In the course of the charge he said : " It can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our individual prosperity depends on our national prosperity , and how greatly our national prosperity depends on a well-organized , vigorous government , ruling by wise and equal laws faithfully executed . Nor is such a government unfriendly to liberty , - to that liberty which is really estimable . On the contrary , nothing but a strong government of laws , irresistibly bearing down arbitrary power and licentiousness , can defend it against those two formidable enemies . Let it be remembered that civil liberty consists not in the right for every man to do just what he pleases , but it consists in an equal right for all citizens to have , enjoy , and do , in peace and security , and without molestation , whatever the equal and constitutional laws of the country admit to be consistent with the public good . " The case of C/iis/iolm Exor. v. Georgia , decided by the Supreme Court at the February term , r 7* , involved a constitutional question of much importance , and was the direct cause of a constitutional amendment . Chief Justice Morrison Ft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal courts by a citizen of another state , and refused to submit to the jurisdiction . The excitement in Georgia was intense and communicated itself in no small degree to the rest of the country . Everything depended on the construction which the court should give to that clause of the Constitution which extended the judicial power to controversies between a state and citizens of another state . Georgia claimed that to summon a sovereign state into court against her will was to do violence to her dignity as a state , and contrary to every principle of law . She further claimed that the clause in question was inserted in the Constitution by the framers for the purpose of giving a state the right to appear in the federal courts as plaintiff , and that it was far from the intention of the framers to have the clause so construed as to cornpel a state to appear as a defendant . There seems to be no doubt that such was the understanding of the states when the Constitution was ratified . John Marshall himself in a speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman will think that a state will be called at the bar of the federal court . . . . It is not rational to suppose that the sovereign power should be dragged before a court . The intent is to enable states to recover claims from individuals residing in other states . " The court , however , could find nothing in the Constitution in support of this view , and decided that the state of Georgia must enter her appearance or suffer a default to be entered against her . The decision created a great stir throughout the country . At the next session of Congress an amendment to the Constitution was proposed and afterwards ratified . This was the eleventh amendment , and it provides that the judicial power shall not extend to suits " against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state . " This first important decision of the court had one The United States Supreme Court Room . // lasting and beneficial . effect , in that it roused the people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the federal system . In April , 1794 , Chief Justice Jay was nominated , confirmed , and sent to England ' as envoy extraordinary . Upon his return , in May , 1795 , he found that he had been elected governor of New York , and thereupon resigned his position as Chief Justice . There was another judge on the bench with Jay , who was in no mental respect Jay 's inferior . James Wilson , who came to America from Scotland in i 765 , was one of the most remarkable men who have yet appeared in American politics . From the very start he was a leader . In the constitutional convention he was second to no other member in usefulness . Hardly an important measure was considered in which his plans were not adopted . He was an orator of high attainments , and his logic was irresistible . He was considered in the convention the best-read lawyer present . Madison called him " the most careful statesman " in the convention ; and Bancroft , " the most learned civilian . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write his history . He was one of the original justices of the United States Supreme Court , and had not his judicial career been cut short by an early death , would undoubtedly have been ranked with the greatest jurists who have honored that bench . On the ist of July , 1795 , Washington appointed John Rutledge , of South Carolina , Chief Justice . Like his predecessor Jay , Rutledge had held almost every important office within the gift of his native state , and was one of the great men of the formative period of the United States . Chief Justice Rutledge only sat on the bench a few months . In December , the Senate considered and refused to confirm the appointment , owing partly to the opposition he had stirred up among the Federalists , but chiefly to the state of his health . Directly after his rejection by the Senate , his mind gave way , and he became hopelessly insane . Justice William Cushing must also be mentioned ; for , upon the rejection of Rutledge by the Senate , he was nominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice . Washington announced the appointment at a dinner-party , saying , as Cushing entered the room , " The Chief Justice of the United States will take his seat at my right . " Cushing held the office about one week , and then resigned to resume his position on the bench as an associate justice . The state of his health forbade him to resume any additional responsibilities . Cushing was the only one of all the Chief Justices who became Chief Justice by promotion from the bench . The duty of nominating a fourth Chief Justice now devolved upon Washington , and he made an admirable choice . Oliver Ellsworth , then United States Senator from Connecticut , was nominated , and coufirme4 by the Senate on the 4th of March , 1796 . The early career of Chief Justice Ellsworth is interesting because of the difficulties he had to surmount . His father destined hint for the ministry , and with this end in view sent him to Yale College , where he graduated in 1766 . After studying theology for a year he gave it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only textbooks were Bacon 's Abridgemen and Jacob 's Laze Dictionary . He was poor , and in gaining his education had contracted some debts which he determined to pay at once . Taking an axe , he went to a small tract of woodland which he owned on the Justice Samuel F. Miller . // Connecticut River , and which he had in vain tried to sell , and there , for two or three months , cut wood , sending it down the river to Hartford , where it was sold , and the money applied to the payment of his debts . No sooner was this done than he married . His professional income yielded him nothing , so he took his wife to a small , uncultivated farm at Windsor , and for three years literally earned his bread in the sweat of his brow . During this time the income he derived from his profession did not exceed three pounds , Connecticut money , per annum . His farm was situated ten miles from Hartford , and he was too poor to have a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning when court was in session , returning in the same way at night . But a change in his fortunes came at last . He won an important case , and from that time on his success was umriterrupted . In 1775 he was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress , and served as a distinguished member of that body until 1783 . From 1784 to 1789 he was a judge of the Superior Court of ConJustice Stephen J. Field . // necticut . He was one of the leaders in the Federal Convention in i 787 , and in 1790 took his seat in the first Senate of the United States . Ellsworth was Chief Justice until the year i8oo , when he resigned . In the latter two years of his term he acted as envoy extraordinary to France . " He was , " says Flanders , " tall , erect , and dignified ; his large blue eyes , well set Justice Joseph P. Bradley . under heavy and highly intellectual brows , were firm and penetrating . His silk robe and powdered hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave him , in the seat of justice , a dignity of demeanor which was felt by all who appeared before him . " Upon his resignation John Jay was again nominated , but declined the honor . " The Supreme Court , " says Judge Cooley , " has seemed to be gradually gaining in dignity and power with the growth of the country and of its interests , but its real importance was never greater than at the first . And the judges who occupied the bench before the time of Marshall are entitled to have it said of them that what they did was of incalculable value to representative institutions , not in America alone , but throughout the world . " No official act of President John Adams redounds more to his credit than his ap pointment of John Marshall df Virginia to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . Destined to become perhaps the greatest judge in the annals of the law , Marshall was , when appointed , one of the most conspicuous figures of his time . In these days his fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , a career which had much to do with fitting him for the high position he afterwards filled . He was an officer of the Revolution from 1775 till 1781 , with but two short intermissions , during which he studied law . Admitted to the bar of Virginia in r78i , he was soon its leader . In the Virginia Convention of 1778 , and in the state legislature , his words were the ones most attentively listened to . Awkward and ungainly , with an unsympathetic voice , he possessed an extraordinary power over his hearers , because he had , said William Wirt , " one original and almost supernatural faculty , - the faculty of developing a subject by a single glance of his mind , and detecting at once the very point on which every controversy depends . " Seeing the necessity of a strong central government , he was the ablest advocate of the ratification of the Constitution in Virginia . His convincing speech in support of the " Jay Treaty " brought him prominently before the country . As envoy to France he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all sides with the most manifest enthusiasm , and publicly entertained by Congress . As a member of Congress and as Secretary of State he in no way diminished his fame . But he is best known as the great Chief Justice , " the expounder of the Constitution . " For nearly thirty-five years he presided over the Supreme Court . They were critical years . The national government was still a new thing ; it was an experiment . The people were anxious and distrustful . The Constitution had many fierce opponents . The powers of the government were unknown and feared . Questions of tremendous import must of necessity come before the federal judiciary . When Marshall became Chief Justice , constitutional law was a branch of judicature almost unknown ; it had to be created , for there were no precedents . At such a time the appointment of Marshall was a good fortune to the country ; and yet it was not altogether fortune , for , as his able contemporary , William Pinckney , said , " he was // born to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was appointed on the 3Ist of January , i8oi , and was then forty-five years of age . William Wirt thus describes him : " The Chief Justice of the United States is in his person tall , meagre , emaciated ; his muscles so relaxed as not only to disqualify him apparently for any vigorous exertion of the body , but to destroy everything like harmony in his air and movements . His head and face are small in proportion to his height ; his complexion swarthy . His countenance has a faithful expression of great good humor and hilarity , while his black eyes , that unerring index , possess an irradiating spirit which proclaims the imperial powers of the mind that sits enthroned within . " His learned associate , Justice Story , speaking of the manner in which he treated a legal proposition , said : " It was a matter of surprise to see how eAsily he grasped the leading principles of a case and cleared it of all its accidental incumbrances ; how readily he evolved the true points of the controversy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught even a glimpse of the learning upon which it depended . Perhaps no judge ever excelled him in the capacity to hold a legal proposition before the eyes of others in such various forms and colors . It seemed a pleasure to him to cast the darkest shades of objection over it , that he might show how they could be dissipated by a single glance of light . He would , by the most subtle analysis , resolve every argument into its ultimate principles , and then , with a marvellous faculty , apply them to the decision of the cause . " During the thirty-four years Chief Justice Marshall presided over the court , sixty-two decisions were rendered which involved constitutional questions , and in thirty-six of these Marshall delivered the opinion of the court . The total number of cases in which opinions were given was iio6 , and the opinions in 519 of them were written by Marshall . Many of these cases were extremely important , and have had great influence not only on subsequent proceedings of the court , but in the shaping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in keeping the government centralized so far as was possible under the Constitution . He had been an active participant in the struggle of the colonies for independence , and before the adoption of the Constitution had witnessed the lack of unity and consequent lack of stability in a confederation where the doctrine of state sovereignty was carried to an extreme . While he believed in state sovereignty to a certain extent , he believed that it should always be subservient to national sovereignty . With this conviction he construed the Constitution . It was not long before states rights advocates began to measure swords with the federal judiciary . State legislatures passed laws contrary to federal decisions , and state courts refused to acknowledge the superior power of the Supreme Court . A crisis was at hand ; but the Chief Justice was equal to the occasion . In a series of masterly opinions he vindicated the position of the court , and convinced the people of th futility of contrary views . Justice John M Harlan . The first collision of federal and state authorities took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The facts of the case were , in brief , as follows : The sloop Active had been captured by an armed vessel of Pennsylvania in 1777 , and condemned as a prize . The proceeds were turned over to the state treasurer . // The money was claimed by one Olmstead , and in 1803 he recovered judgment for it in the United States District Court , and was about to enforce his judgment , when the state legislature passed an act declaring that the money belonged to the state , and that the federal courts had no jurisdiction , at the same time commanding the governor to protect the money against the processes of such courts . The Supreme Court , being appealed to , ordered the district judge to enforce the judgment , which he attempted to do , but was met by the bayonets of a brigade of Philadelphia militia under General Bright , acting under orders of the governor . The united States marshal then summoned two thousand citizens to assist him , and would have called on the President for national aid , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid over peacefully . General Bright and others were arrested , tried , and sentenced to a fine and imprisonment . The sentence was partially remitted by the President . In his opinion , Chief Justice Marshall said : " If the legislatures of the several states may , at will , annul the judgments of the courts of the United States , and de stroy the rights acquired under those judgments , the Constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery , and the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by the instrumentality of its own tribunals . " In 1819 the case of Mc Cullo cit v. Maryland was decided , the Chief Justice holding that it was within the powers of Congress to establish a national bank . This case , with two that followed , established the principle that the states could not by a tax or otherwise hinder the United States in the collection of the national revenue . The case of Gihbons v. Ogden decided that a state could not grant the exclusive use of navigable waters within its own boundaries . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservation was not a foreign state within the meaning of the Constitution . In Fletcher v. Peck the court interpreted the clause of the Constitution forbidding the making of laws which impair the obligation of contracts , and held that the word contracts " included contracts made as well as contracts to be made . The famous Dartmouth ( ollege ( ase was decided on the same grounds , the court holding that the charter of the college was a contract which the legislature of New Hampshire had no right to impair , and the acts of the legislature amending the charter were declared void . A few of the important constitutional cases have been mentioned , but it is impossible here to even touch upon the vast contributions of Chief Justice Marshall to every branch of jurisprudence . In every case his opinions were masterly . No judge ever excelled him in logic . He was not a learned judge in the sense that Story was , and in his case great learning was not necessary . He knew the law , and was neither familiar with nor needed precedents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judgment , he remarked : " I have stated the principles of law on which this case is decided ; I refer you to Brother Story for the authorities . " Several of the cases decided by Marshall possessed a dramatic interest , not alone because of the questions involved , but because of the renown of the counsel employed to argue them , and the character of the parties interested . Such a case was the Dartmouth College Case , and similarly , the trial of Aaron Burr for high Justice Horace Gray . // treason . In the latter case the attention of the entire country was aroused . President Jefferson was open in his hostility to Burr , and his feeling was shared by almost every one . Marshall , after hearing the arguments of the best counsel the country afforded , decided that no overt act of treason had been proved against Burr . The decision at first was loudly criticised , but afterwards was accepted . The great Chief Justice fully realized that the decis*on would be regarded with popular disfavor , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his decision he said : " No man is desirous of placing himself in a disagreeable situation . No man is desirous of becoming the peculiar subject of calumny . . . . But if he has no choice in the case ; if there is no alternative presented to him but a dereliction of duty or the opprobrium of those who are denominated the world , he merits the contempt as well as the indignation of his country who can hesitate which to embrace . " The incidents of the Par/mouth College Case are too well known to require mentioning . Certain it is that no court-room during a civil trial ever witnessed such a scene as that which took place at the close of Webster 's argument , when the great orator , his voice choked with emotion , made his final touching appeal in behalf of his beloved alma mater . Chief Justice Marshall died on the 6th of July , 1835 . " No judge , perhaps , was ever regarded with more veneration and affection , " says Flanders , " than Chief Justice Marshall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much gentleness , modesty , and simplicity , united with such depth and compass of mind , that the profession loved him quite as much as they admired and respected him . " The counsel who in those days appeared before the Supreme Court were eminent for learning , acuteness , and eloquence . Webster , Wirt , Pinckney , Butler , Clay , Emmet , and many others were in frequent attendance , and added not a little to the fame of the now world-renowned tribunal . Of the judges who sat on the bench with Marshall , and who were , with few exceptions , jurists of the highest ability , Joseph Story is the most widely known . His learning was something marvellous . He was equally familiar with every branch of the law , and the text-books which he wrote are still in continuous use . One branch of jurisprudence , Conflict of Laws , he may be said to have founded , for the principles Justice Lucius Q. c . Lamer . Justice Samuel Blatchford. // which he laid down for the first time have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject has never been superseded . Story 's admiration for Marshall amounted to veneration . " He Marshall is beloved and reverenced here beyond all measure , though not beyond his merits , " wrote Story . " Next to Washington , he stands the idol of all good men . And who so well deserves it ? " He always sent the Chief Justice copies of his published writings . Marshall , in acknowledging a favor of this kind , wrote : " On my return , a day or two past , from an annual trip to our mountains , I had the real gratification of receiving a number of the NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE for August last , containing an essay entitled Statesmen : their Rareness and Importance , ' forwarded to me by yourself , and thank you truly for the real pleasure afforded by its perusal . " The Chief Justice who succeeded Marshall was Roger B. Taney of Maryland . Taney was commissioned March 16th , 1836 , and from that time until 1864 sat as the presiding justice of the Supreme Court . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of cases which came before him for decision is much greater . From 1836 to 1864 the growth of the country was marvellous , and the docket of the court increased proportionately . Case after case arose , involving questions of the greatest importance , all of which were disposed of by the Chief Justice and his assOciates with remarkable ability and learning . Marshall was a believer in a strong , centralized government . Taney was a believer in states rights . As the opinions of the former show a tendency towards keeping the states strictly within the bounds prescribed by the Constitution , so the opinions of the latter show an equally strong tendency towards a construction of that instrument giving the states , as such , greater prominence . Each was sincere in his views , but we can not help thinking , now that the Civil War has settled the question , that Marshall 's judgment was correct . The opinions of Taney , like those of Marshall , are noted for firmness , simplicity , directness , and sound reasoning . With few exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all his decisions indicate a great judge . In 1856 the now famous case of Bred Scott v. Sanford was decided by the Supreme Court , Chief Justice Taney delivering the opinion . No case of equal importance , considering its after effects , ever came before a tribunal . For some time the political horizon had been growing darker . The question of slavery was the all-absorbing topic . The North and the South were rapidly falling apart , and it was with the gravest anxieties that the whole people watched for the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Bred Scott Case . The learned and ingenious opinion of Taney , occupying many pages , was eagerly scanned . The majority of the court decided that a free negro , whose ancestors were slaves , could not be a citizen of the United States ; they decided that the plaintiff Scott was still a slave , and that the law making the territory of Wisconsin a free territory was unconstitutional , and that the Missouri Compromise Act of 1820 was void . Justice Benjamin R. Curtis and Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissenting opinion of Curtis is one of the most remarkable in the history of the court . It was " profound in its examination of the sources of the law upon the subject ; luminous and learned in its consideration of the political and judicial history of the country ; and convincing in Justice David J. Brewer . // the conclusions at which it arrived . " A shout of exultation went up from the South when the decision was announced , and an ominous cry of indignation and disappointment from the North . The question again came up for decision , but this time before a higher tribunal than the Supreme Court . The now aged Chief Justice keenly felt the trying position in which he was placed by the logic of events , and saw too late that the Dred Scott opinion was neither politic nor wise . Taney died in 1864 , in the eighty-eighth year of his age . He was in all respects a great judge , beloved by the bar for his kindliness , and honored for his learning and upright character . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of Marshall , is more entitled to respect and veneration . In December , 1864 , Salmon P. Chase was appointed Chief Justice , and from that time until 1873 , when he died , he presided over the court . Chase was not a great lawyer ; his life had been devoted to politics to the exclusion of the law . An active free-soiler , he joined the Republican party at its outset , and became one of its leaders . He was in rapid succession governor of Ohio , United States Senator , and Secretary of the Treasury . The latter office he held under Lincoln at a time when its duties were especially onerous , and was notably successful . He was a man of commanding appearance , an orator of high attainments , with great abilities and large ambitions . " As Chief Justice , he presided with urbanity and general acceptance . . .. As a judicial writer his style is clear and unusually agreeable . " Many important questions , the direct results of the war , now came before the court . Questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion , during the war ; as to the right of secession ; as to the constitutionality of the thirteenth ; fourteenth , and fifteenth amendments . The validity of the National Bank Act and the Legal Tender Act were to be determined . How these questions were settled is a matter of common knowledge . The Legal Tender Gases afford a striking example of the way early political training influences the judges in the matter of constitutional construction . In 1871 , three Democratic judges , with Chase , originally a Democrat , held that the Legal Tender Act was in a large part void . The three Republican judges dissented . Later , after two more Republican judges were appointed , making a Republican majority , the former decision was overruled . Finally the question was decided in 1884 , affirming the last decision , one Democratic judge dissenting . Morrison R. Waite of Ohio was the next Chief Justice . He was commissioned January 21 , 1874 , and remained Chief Justice until his death in March , 1887 . He and his successor are the only Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their elevation to the bench . Waite owes his reputation wholly to his excellent work as lawyer and judge . As executive officer of the court , he was much admired by his associates . The judicial character of his mind , his learning , and his courteous and kindly manner won the esteem of all . His judicial opinions are clear and precise , and his expositions of the law are in every way admirable . While he was on the bench , the docket of the court was crowded with cases turning upon the right of states to regulate the business interests within their own boundaries . In every such case the Supreme Court has declined to interfere with the state authorities , holding that the questions arose under local laws , and that unless the laws were contrary to those laid down by the Federal Constitution , the federal courts must follow the state courts in the interpretation of state statutes . Such were the famous Slaug/zier House Cases , decided during the administration of Chief Justice Chase , in which the court held that the Constitution gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle that whatever is not directly , or by necessary implication , conferred on the national government , is withheld and belongs to the states . It has always been a rule of the Supreme Court never to engage in matters connected with outside politics . The judges have repeatedly refused to give opinions or to act in an extra-judicial capi*city . The reasons for this rule are obvious , and only once has it been broken . In 1876 five justices were appointed on the Electoral Commission , to decide the disputed Hayes-Tilden election : As might have been expected , every one decided on strict party lines , and there being a Republican majority of one , Hayes was declared elected . The wisdom of the general rule was never more clearly demonstrated . // The present Chief Justice , Melville W. Fuller , was commissioned July 20th , i888 . Like his predecessor , he was comparatively unknown when appointed . He had never held an important public office . He was , however , a prominent member of the 1111-nois bar and was highly esteemed by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sterling qualities of his mind and character . As Chief Justice he has already won the confidence and regard of the nation . It is to be feared that future Chief Justices will not be , as a rule , eminent men , in the sense of being well known throughout the country . Such eminence is rarely obtained save through politics , and politics and law nowadays seldom go together . The present Supreme Court is not inferior to the Supreme Court of earlier days . Its members are learned and impartial men , and its decisions are marked by great learning and convincing reasoning . The judges honor the bench that has upon its records such names as Jay , Ellsworth , Marshall , Story , Curtis , and Taney . At present the Supreme Court consists of the Chief Justice and eight rtssociate justices , whose names and dates of appointment are as follows : Samuel F. Miller of Ohio , 1862 ; Stephen J. Field of California , 1863 ; Joseph P. Bradley of New Jersey , 1870 ; John M. Harlan of Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Blatchford of New York , 1882 ; Lucius Q. C. Lamar of Mississippi , 1888 ; and David J. Brewer of Kansas , 1889 . There have been in all , exclusive of the eight just mentioned , but thirty-five associate justices since the court was founded , one hundred years ago . Nine , including Chief Justice Fuller , have occupied the highest judicial office , and of these one served less than six months , and another less than a week . Two hundred and one cases involving constitutional questions have been decided , many of them questions of the gravest importance , affecting all future generations of Americans . Since 1873 the court has sat in Washington from October till July in each year , and thither all suitors must repair , for the court never sits en bctnc in any other place . The fact that the judges live in Washington for the greater part of the time , in an atmosphere of politics , necessarily has some influence on their way of looking at certain questions coming before them . This influence is mainly beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds to its usefulness . In a great and growing country , with its diversity of interests and changing conditions , a court of final appeal which was too rigid would often work at a disadvantage , and might in many cases cause great injury . For many years the Supreme Court has occupied as a court-room what was formerly the Senate chamber in the Capitol . The room has a notable history . Here it was that Webster , Clay , Benton , and Calhoun pronounced their matchless orations . Here took place the anxious deliberations and fierce controversies preceding the Civil War . Now , everything save the room itself is changed . The oftentimes noisy and turbulent Senate chamber has become the quiet hall of justice . The room seems to have gathered a grave dignity to itself from the judges who sit there . Around its walls are placed the marble busts of past Chief Justices , and the spirit of Marshall and Taney seems to pervade the very atmosphere . The Supreme Court of the United States , sitting together , listening to the argument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet dignity , the evident learning , and the courteous bearing of the silken-robed judges make one involuntarily wish to hear them addressed as " Most potent , grave , and reverend signiors , " in place of the usual " Your Honors. ** Of late years the court has been much overworked . The ever-increasing number and variety of cases , due to the growth of the country , have made the work of the court more than five times greater than it was at the end of the first half-century . Over fifteen hundred cases are on the calendar of the present term . It is impossible for the court to keep pace with its work . Something should be done at once by Congress to remedy an evil which has become a crying one . In the course of his remarks at the recent centennial cele*ration , Mr. Justice Field said " In view of the condition of the court , its crowded docket , the multitude of questions constantly brought before it of the greatest and most extended influence , surely it has a right to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To delay justice is as pernicious as to deny it .
