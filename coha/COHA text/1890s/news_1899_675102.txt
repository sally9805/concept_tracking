txt The amendments , to the Rapid Transit act have been prepared by the Commissioners to enable them to overcome the obstacles which the debt limit apd . Tammany hostility have placed in their path . They have been commanded by a vote of the people to build an underground rapid transit railroad . Being prevented from building it in one way , it became their duty to find another way . The amendments provide the way . Construction at the cost of the city is for the present out of the question . The commission therefore asks the Legislature to give it the power to grant to any company owning and operating a railroad in the city , or to a corporation formed for the purpose , a franchise to construct and operate the road . This will enable the Commissioners to enlist private capital hi the enterprise . The bill embodying these amendments should be treated as a matter of high urgency by the Legislature . It will take years to build the road after it is authorbed . Within five years the people of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in the meantime no addition shall have been made to the city 's passenger carrying facilities other than by the extension and improvement of existing roads ? on or above the surface . Provision altogether new and of a more comprehensive nature must be made . There is not room on the surface or above it for this immense increase of traffic . Underground roads are the only adequate and possible resource . If the Legislature seeks the good of this city it will promptly give to the Rapid Transit Commissioners the new powers they ask .
