txt To use a seeming paradox , reforms come slowly , yet quickly , too , in Ireland . For more than half a century , the great majority of the Irish people had been calling out in vain for a change in the system of administering their local affairs . Within my own time in Parliament-that is , during the last thirteen or fourteen years-efforts were annually made , up to last year , to alter that system even in part ; but they all failed ; and it is safe to say that , twelve months ago , no one in Ireland expected a different result , in respect of this matter , in the near future . Since then , however , not merely a change , but a complete revolution has been virtually accomplished in the Irish system of local government . By the time these lines are published the royal assent will , in all probability , have been given to an act which will take the admini*tration of most Irish affairs of a local character out of the hands of a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history in the hands of the people . It would be an error to suppose that this Unionist measure of local government for Ireland is in any degree a satisfaction of the Irish National demand for legislative independence . It is not Home Rule . Home iRule means a National Parliament and a National Executive for all affairs distinctively Irish . Local selfgovernment merely means the administration by the Irish people , through elected local bodies , of the laws passed by the British Parliament for the management of Irish local affairs . The Government offer it , avowedly , indeed , as a rival to and a substitute for Home Rule ; Ireland , on the other hand , receives it merely as an installment of justice , and warns its authors that it can never satisfy the aspirations of the Irish Nation after National liberty . Yet , it may well be doubted whether the Irish minority at whose // powers and privileges it strikes a final and fatal blow would not be well advised if they , at last , acted on the assumption that there is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ought to continue to oppose Home Rule . A quarter of a century ago , the establishment of the system of secret voting at Parliamentary elections marked the commencement of the decline of the political power of the Irish aristocracy and gentry , who mainly constitute the minority in three and a half of the four provinces of Ireland . In 1884 that power was extinguished by the establishment of household suffrage , by which the occupier of the poorest cabin was placed , in the matter of a vote , on an equality with the owner of the richest mansion . The various Land Acts have stripped them of the right of capricious eviction and of raising rents at will , which they had so long exercised without mercy . There remained to them the management* of county affairs , and this privilege is now about to pass out of their grasp , with the result that the new possessors of power can , if they please , keep them ostracised for all time from all share in the transaction of business which has been in their control ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English law into Ireland . To understand the extent of the change which is now determined on , and which will be in working order throughout Ireland in less than a year , it is necessary first to describe the system *f Irish Local Government which is about to pass away forever . Broadly speaking , that system consisted of three parts , viz. : the Grand Jury , the Poor Law Boards , and various forms of Municipal Government in towns and cities . Let me deal with each in turn as briefly as possible . The Grand Jury was about the most anomalous and indefensible institution which can be conceived . It consisted , usually , of a couple of dozenpersons chosen from a larger number selected by the High Sheriff for the county or the city , as the case might be , the High Sheriff himself being the nominee of the Lord Lieutenant , who acted on the recommendation of the Superior Court Judges , who , in their turn , always recommended some leading landlord and magistrate . The*only limit to the Sheriff 's freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a representative of each division of the area over which he presided ; that repiirement fulfilled  --  and he cQuld and did fulfill it often by // summoning persons who to his knowledge could not or would not attend-he could make up his jury as he liked ; and , in fact , the Grand Jury in every Irish county , down even to the present year , has always consisted almost entirely of members of the landlord class , and mainly of Protestants also . To bodies thus constituted was entrusted the control of all public roads and other public works of the county , the contracts therefor , the management of the prisons , the care of the public buildings , the power to contribute to infirmaries , lunatic asylums and fever hospitals , the appointment of all the paid officials of the county , and the right to levy a tax called the county cess , which , of late years , has produced considerably more than a million pounds sterling annually . Associated with the Grand Juries were smaller bodies , the members of which met at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiate county works . Those bodies also were non-elective , and represented mainly the landlords and magistrates of the respective counties . In the old days , these Grand Juries became-not unnaturally-not merely nests of jobbery and corruption , but an agency of social and political oppression . They devised sinecures for the friends and relatives of their constituent members . They spent the public money on roads and bridges for their own private convenience and advantage . Accepted by the Government as the mouthpieces of public opinion in Ireland , they seized every possible opportunity to bring down coercion on the masses of the people , who periodically showed , not merely by words but by deeds , their discontent with the Grand Jury system and the working of the land laws . For many years past , indeed , the Grand Juries have not been open to all those charges . They have not , as a rule , been the corrupt jobbers they were forty or fifty years ago . Their administration of the business entrusted to them has been fairly honest and efficient . But in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be what they were ; they have , broadly speaking , confined the appointments in their gift to hangers-on of their own class , and they have continued te show a bitter anti-Irish spirit . When the Irish Poor Law system was established , it was no longer felt to be possible to create another set of public institutions , supported by the taxes of the people , on a purely no*i-elective and non-representative basis* But the lEng // lish rulers o* Ireland at that time had neither the courage , nor the justice , nor the wisdom , to abandon the old policy of hatred and distrust of the Irish people . They went only a little way in practically recognizing the representative principle in the constitution of the bodies appointed to give relief to the destitute poor . They gave votes , indeed , for members of the Poor Law Boards to every rate-payer ; but they took care that the landlords should be at the same time predominant in those bodies , and this end they secured by two devices . First , the multiple vote was introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as thirty-six votes , while the average tenant could have no more than one . In the second place , it was boldly decided that a full half of every Board should consist of magistrates as ex-officio members . Yet the Boards of Poor Law Guardians have in the course of time become more or less popular bodies , and , besides their original function of dispensing relief out of the rates to the destitute poor , have been invested with the management of so many other matters in recent years that their title is now really a misnomer . They are , for instance , the sanitary authorities in all rural and in some urban districts ; they have to do with the registration of births , deaths , and marriages , and-not to go through the whole list of their powers and duties-they have had the administration of the Laborers ' Acts , under which a good deal has been done , since the year 1883 , to improve the homes of agricultural laborers . It remains to notice the system of Government in the towns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality in the phrase , " local self-government " - at least , for the last forty or fifty years . Down to 1840 there was no really representative system of government in any Irish town or city . The corporations , in the few places which possessed corporations , were representative only of a small minority professing the Protestant religion , although in almost every one of those places the overwhelming majority of the citizens were Catholics ; and right gaily did the men in possession of power plunder and squander the municipal revenues . In Dublin , for instance , the city possessed a splendid freehold estate , which might now produce such a revenue as would suffice to meet at least half the city expenditure , but that estate was given away , sometimes in after-dinner orgies , to distinguished personages for barleycorns a year , the private // 291 considerations , of course , to the corrupt corporators not appearing in the deeds . In this way certain families have been in possession of whole streets of houses in Dublin for generations , and it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in and that the city has begun to get hold of its own again . In 1840 , when the first great Municipal Reform Act was passed , the state of the Dublin City finances was such that Daniel O'Connell , the first Catholic Lord Mayor , and the other Catholic corporators , elected in that year , had to put their hands into their own pockets , and with their own money redeem the very furniture of the Dublin Mansion House , which had been seized by the Sheriff for debt . Since the year mentioned the corporations have been more or less representative , and since 1854 the smaller towns in Ireland have been allowed the right to possess municipal institutions of a less important , but still representative , character . In respect , however , of both the corporations of the cities and of the town boards of the smaller civic communities , the franchise for municipal purposes has been ridiculously restricted . In Dublin , the population exceeds 300,000 ; the Parliamentary electorate is upwards of 40,000 ; but the municipal electorate amounts to only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of all the other municipalities , except a few which , like Belfast , have by special acts of Parliament obtained extensions of the suffrage peculiar to themselves . Here , then , was a state of things which , assuredly , required mending , and , as I have said , innumerable efforts to mend it had been made up to last year with no result . Last summer , however , the reform now virtually accomplished was announced to the House of Commons one afternoon by Mr. Arthur Balfour , without anyone having asked for it and without any warning whatever . The chief features of the measure may be briefly described . In the first place , the ground is cleared by absolutely sweeping away the Grand Juries for fiscal purposes . Those bodies are still retained for their original purpose-that , namely , of dealing with indictments . Whether they will long continue even for that purpose remains to be seen , for the gentry will hardly care to give themselves the trouble of assembling together twice every year to determine whether or not they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and petty jury . The probability is that they will not do so , and that in a few years ' time the Grand Juries // will be relieved of their criminal business also , and will thus cease to exist for all purposes . With them go the Boards of Guardians as they are at present constituted . Bodies will still continue to exist under that name , but they will be no longer constituted as they are now . The only existing Local Government institutions which are left untouched are the City Corporations and the Town Boards . It may be said at once that this work of demolition was the one necessary preliminary to any really satisfactory scheme of Irish Local Government reform . Any attempt to patch up the Grand Juries , for instance , or to rear a new edifice of local administration on such a foundation , would have inevitably ended in failure . Nor would any attempt to reconstruct the Boards of Guardians have been in the least successful* if the ez-officio element had been left in existence . The Government were , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old system of local administration . In the place of the Grand Juries and the Boards of Guardians there has been set up a rather complicated system of County CounciTh and District Councils , these latter being sub-divided into two classes-Urban District Councils and Rural District Councils ; and at this point one provision applicable to all those bodies , and also to every Corporation and Town Board in the country , may be conveniently mentioned . It is that which enacts that the electorate in each case shall be the Parliamentary electorate , in addition to peers and to such women as would , if they were men , be qualified for the Parliamentary franchise . Here is manifestly a great reform in itself . For , what is the Parliamentary electorate ? If the registration system did not throw obstacles in the way , it would embrace , broadly speaking , every head of a household in the land , in addition to other classes of persons ; and even as it is , it actually does contain the greater number of the householders in town and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of those electors will thus have the power of saying who shall spend the public rates and , to some extent , how those rates shall be spent , and may even be elected to spend them , although they need not pay rates themselves at all . The allusion is to lodgers and the occupiers of tenement houses in towns ; and it is , no doubt , true that those and one or two other smaller classes of voters are not directly responsible for the payment of rates . But everyone who pays rent may be said to pay rates also . // If he does not pay them directly , he pays them indirectly . At any rate , all will now vote , whether they pay rates or not , and every one will have only one vote . The change is a vast one , in view of the narrow foundation on which even the most popular Irish local institutions have hitherto rested . It means the transfer of power from a class to the people . It means the ousting of what used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to regard as its inalienable heritage . It marks the entry of the Irish Nation , after ages of weary waiting , into at least a considerable portion of its birthright . To the County Councils , which will thus repose on a thoroughly popular basis , and one of which will be established in every county , will be entrusted all the fiscal business of the Grand Juries , with one exception . The excepted business is that of assessing compensation for malicious injuries . Here a few words of ex*ilanation are , perhaps , necessary . One of the laws peculiar to Ireland is that under which , when an outrage is perpetrated on a human being or on certain sorts of property , the whole community in the midst of which it occurs may be mulcted in a fine . It is a barbarous relic of a barbarous past , and in the hands of the Grand Juries it has been made , from time to time , an instrument of gross and vindictive injustice . No one expected that the present Government would take occasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , expected that they would transfer the administration of it to the new elective bodies . But it was equally impossible , under the circumstances , to leave it to the Grand Juries , and what has been done is to entrust it to the County Courts with a right of appeal to the judges on circuit at Assizes . Whether this particular change will work satisfactorily remains to be seen . In addition to the fiscal business of the Grand Juries ( with the single exception mentioned ) the County Councils will also have the control of the lunatic asylums ; a participation in the control of other public bodies , such as Boards of Inland Navigation and County Infirmaries , to the cost of which they contribute ; the power of making , assessing , and levying all rates within rural areas and of dispensing the proceeds ; the conduct of the preparation of the voters ' lists ; and other less important rights and duties which it would be too tedious to set forth in full detail . It may be added that the County Councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty members returned // by single-membered constituencies ; they must meet at least four times a year , but , of course , may meet as much oftener as they like , or delegate their work to committees , whose acts , however , to be valid , must receive their sanction ; they will be elected triennially , all the members being chosen together ; and the Chairman will be a Justice of the Peace for the County  --  the first instance , by the way , of a person in Ireland owing his position as a Justice to popular election . The area over which the County Councils will have jurisdiction for certain purposes is sub-divided for the purposes of the Rural District Councils and-where the conditions for them exist - of Urban District Councils . The latter will be constituted only where there are towns of over 6,000 population , unless towns of a smaller population , but above 1,500 , petition with practical unanimity to be constituted urban districts . Except in the latter event , many counties in Ireland will have no Urban District Councils , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rural District Councils will divide between them the administration of local affairs . The electoral districts will be the same in all cases as those for the County Councils , and the elections , as in the case also of the elections for the County Councils , will be triennial , all the members being elected together . The Urban District Councils , where they exist , will be almost as important in respect of the business entrusted to them as the County Councils themselves . They will have , within the area of their jurisdiction , some of the Grand Jury business which the County Councils will possess in the rural districts-such , for instance , as the management of the roads and other public works , and the collection and expenditure of their own rates ; and they will , besides , have the business of the Boards of Poor Law Guardians as " sanitary authorities "  --  a multifarious collection of duties , the due discharge of which embraces , in many cases , the provision of an adequate water supply for a large civic community as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except , in fact , in the matter of business affecting the whole county , including the urban area , the Urban District Councils will be of equal importance with the County Councils , and will , perhaps , have even more to do than the latter . They will , of course , from the nature of the case , meet oftener and , by reason of that fact , attract greater attention . // The Rural District Councils , as such , will have all the business of the Boards of Poor Law Guardians except that of dispensing relief to the destitute poor and that of assessing and raising the poor 's rate ; and they will have the former part of this latter business also when they sit , not as Rural District Councils , but as Boards of Guardians . From what I have said as to the constiti , ition of the present Boards of Guardians it will be easily understood that the establishment of these Rural District Councils , elected entirely , as they will be , by the Parliamentary electorate , will mean in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exofficio element from all power in the administration of the business of the Poor Law Boards is in itself a serious change . For the history of the action of this ex-officio element in Irish Boards of Guardians is the history of one of the greatest scandals of the time . Appointed becaus ? they were supposed to be persons who could always be relied upon to do what was right-or , at least , what was right in the eyes of the Government  --  the ex-officio members of the Boards of Guardians habitually neglected their duties and attended the meetings of the bodies to which they belonged only when a job was to be perpetrated ; and hence it has come to pass that the overwhelming majority of the Poor Law Guardians in regular attendance at the meetings of their respective Boards , have in only a few cases been able to determine , for instance , who should occupy a paid office in the Guardians* service . All this , of course , will now come to an end , and only persons elected by the votes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any part of the Guardians ' business . I now come to the provisions in the new Irish Local Government scheme regarding the cities and towns of Ireland . In mentioning that the franchise has been extended in these municipalities , I have indicated the greatest change made in the case of these municipalities . Doubtless , the results of the extension of the suffrage will not , generally speaking , have a material effect on the political situation in any place . Nationalists and Orangemen are in such an overwhelming majority in their respective districts that it does not really matter to either party , as a party , whether the suffrage is extended or not . But , otherwise , the result can not but be important . It will give the workingmen , for instance , in the cities and towns , a power which they have never hitherto possessed in the selection of their municipal representatives . But // there is another point of importance . In accordance with the scheme adopted in England and Scotland , certain large civic cornmunities-namely , Dublin , Belfast , Cork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county boroughs , " and their governing bodies , without a change of name , have been made County Councils for their respective areas . By this means the six cities mentioned have been made practically self-governing in respect of all local affairs , except the distribution of relief to the destitute poor , which they will share in conjunction with the adjoining rural districts . But it will be very different with the other cities and towns which have hitherto ruled themselves by means of Corporations or Town Boards . These latter will , if they qualify as the urban districts for Urban District Councils , have the powers and advantages of urban districts which I have already described ; but , as to all other matters , they will be merged in the counties to which they respectively belong ; and how all this will affect some of them , at least , may be imagined from one example . Take the case of Galway . Here is a very ancient and historic town . Two hundred years ago it had a commercial connection with Spain which rendered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has left its impress on the place to the present day . In 1840 it was deprived of its Mayor and Corporation , but it still retains its separate existence as " a county of a city , " with the attendant accompaniments of a Sheriff of its own , a city magistracy , and other incidents of a similar kind . Galway will now lose its position as " a county of a city , " and , with it , all the other distinctive marks of a separate civic community which it has possessed for hundreds of years . The circumstance will not mean much pecuniary loss for Galway ; but one can easily understand how it will otherwise affect it adversely . The case of Galway is that of at least ten or twelve other towns and cities . Such , then , in broad outline , is the new scheme of local government reform for Ireland ; and , no doubt , the reader will have already grasped its chief feature . It does not enlarge the scope of the powers of local authorities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly does is to transfer that power as it exists from local bodies , which were either not representative at all or were so little representative as to be practically non-repre* sentative , to bodies elected on a popular franchise . It has been pointed out that this measure of local government // reform is not Home Rule . So much must be evident from the explanation given of its principal details . It deals , in the first place , with the question of administration , and not with the subject of law-making ; in the second place , the matters of administration with which it is concerned are all of a strictly local , not of a national , character . But it remains to be pointed out that it does not amount even to the local self-government which one of its chief authors has for years been recommending or Ireland and without which , he used to contend , Ireland ought not to be content . Mr. Chamberlain , in the days when he was supposed to be a Home Ruler , denounced the system under which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger , without being confronted , interfered with , controlled by alien boards of foreign officials , " and advocated the substitution for that system of " a system of genuine Irish administration of Irish affairs . " So far as the present local government scheme goes , it unquestionably tends in that direction ; but every one of " the alien boards of foreign officials " of which Mr. Chamberlain spoke will continue to exist and will exercise every one of its old powers of control concurrently with the establishment of the new elective local bodies . In some respects , indeed , one of those central boardsthe Local Government Board-will have , under the new scheme , if anything , agreaterpowerof control than it has ever hitherto posBessed . The new scheme , therefore , does not mean even what may be called Chamberlain Home Rule . But , in truth , Mr. Chamberlain can not very well have known very much of his subject when he advocated the abolition of the central boards referred to and the replacing of them hy representative Irish boards , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a pretty considerable step in the direction of real Home Rule . To make the additional change which he contemplated would be to go a long way towards setting up an Irish National Executive , and to have an Irish National Executive dependent on a foreign Parliament would be both an absurdity and an impossibility . The next inevitable step would be to set up an Irish Legislature . A word or two now about the financial provisions of the new system of Irish local government . The grant of a sum of between ? 700,000 and ? 800,000 to be appropriated to the payment of half the local rates in the agricultural districts of Ireland , is to be disposed of by paying the landlords ' half of " the poor rate " and half // of " the county cess " for the tenant  --  the poor rate and the county cess being the two chief rates levied in Ireland and the only rates levied in the agricultural districts . As the poor rate is the only one to which landlords are liable , that class , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . It is on this ground that the Government and the Unionist party justify their change of attitude on this whole question of Irish local self-government , and even propose a measure dealing with that subject which goes beyond anything to which they have been hitherto willing to agree . But one notable change in the incidence of rating follows . Henceforth , not only the whole of the existing local rates will be borne by the occupiers or tenants and none of them by the landlords , but all future rates also will be borne by the occupiers or tenauts , for there is an express provision to that effect in the Government measure . Now , this liberation of the landlords , as such , from all local burdens , may seem to some advocates of the interestg of the tenants to be unjust . Personally , I do not think that it is a matter of much practical consequence . In the first place , in the case of agricultural tenancies , in respect of which rents may be fixed by the courts under the Land Acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landlords than they would have got if they had paid none of the local rates , and in other cases the landlords have always taken care to exact in rent what they paid in rates . In the second place , as regards existing rents , express provision is made for an adjustment of rent to meet the change in the incidence of rating . In other words , although the proposal of the Government is a novel one , and at first sight favorable to the landlords , in practical effect it will scarcely make any change at all . As to what will be its consequences , much might be written . If it works well-that is to say , if the Nationalist majority , who will have a majority everywhere outside two or three counties in IJlster , do not utterly boycott the minority from the new bodies , but allow them to have a fair representation upon them . and , if the new boards administer well and honestly the business entrusted to them-at least half of the whole case against Home Rule in the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer possible to allege that the Irish people are unfit to govern themselves or manage their own affairs ; at least , it will be rather difficult to get many persons to believe such an allega*.1 // tion . On the other hand , of course , if the reverse takes place in the actual working of the new system , one may expect to hear more frequently than ever the old cry that the Irish Nation is incapable of managing its own business justly or wisely , though even under such circumstances it might and , indeed , would have no justification . This Jeing so , it is to be hoped that the electorate , and the bodies which it will call into existence by its votes , will remember the responsibilities cast upon them and act accordingly ; and there is , I may add , a fair prospect that this hope will be realized . But a more important point remains to be noticed . It is that it will be impossible long to maintain a system under which bodies elected on a household franchise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a British Ministry . The thing will be an anomaly from the start , and after a while will seem , as well as be , intolerable . But only one remedy for such a state of things can be found . It is Home Rule  --  the very thing which this concession of local self-government was intended to avert ; and it is a conviction that such is the case , which has already led some English , as well as Irish , opponents of Home Rule seriously to reconsider their whole position on that question.
