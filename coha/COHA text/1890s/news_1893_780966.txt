txt William F. Sheehan read John G. Milburn out of the Democratic Party last week . J. G. Milburn bade defiance to the Sheehan machine last night . It was at the Liberal Club banquet Said he : " I say , as long as the present machine is in control of Democratic politics in the State of New-York , if the Republicans would give fair men for the Senate and Assembly , we should all unanimously work for and vote for the men trio Republican Party put up for these odices . In other words . I do n't believe that , as long as that machine is in control of the State , we can safely put Democrats into control of either Senate or Assembly unless the machine should make the extraordinary mistake from its point of view of putting up Democrats for those effIcea who will go to Albany and represent the true interests of the city , and who will bow down before no known power . " Thus did th ' man whom Lieut . Gov . Sheehan read out of the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ou " The Government of cities , " the topic of the evening . and was referring to the theories of good government when he said : I have SOluetlineS , as I sat listening , " wondered how much of precept was transmitted into actual conduct . If some man unfurled a banner to lead the way against the ruling powers of the city , how many of those gentlemen who were applauding would come out openly and say : I am in the ranks of the men behind that banner , happen what may . ' " " Try it , try it , " urged Dr. Slicer , who sat near Mr. Milburn . " Well , I 'll make a proposition to the club , " said Mr. Milburn , " and see if it meets with its approval " Mr. Milburn then spoke of the intrusion of politics into municipal affairs . " We mean by that . " said he , " that the city is furnishing every year a large fund for carrying on the public business on which the politicians - look with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to primaries for them , do faithful political service whenever they are required to do so . get votes , help to count votes , and when everything is not all right , count them wrong .
