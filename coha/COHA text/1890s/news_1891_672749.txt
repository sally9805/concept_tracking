txt The announcement of Special Census Agent IvAN PETROFF that the population of Alaska has actually decreased during the last ten years comes as a surprise . The falling off in Nevada from the census of 1880 is , to be sure , far greater than in Alaska , while Vermont has not quite held its own . But with the increase of . the mining excitement in our far-off Northwestern Territory ands the growth of the town of Juneau , it was natural to expect a decided increase there . In fact , Mr. PETROFF finds that there has been an increase among the whites and the Chinese , but that it is more than offset by the diminution in the native population . His suggestion that the use of ardent spirits is the chief cause of this large decline is certainly startling . In a , previous report be had noted that the Chinese laborers employed at the canneries manufacture a deadly kind of liquor , " nearly all of which passes into the hands of native laborers and of the worst element among fishermen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four dollars a bottle , and so extensive is this trade that the large amount of coin used by the ' various establishments for paying off laborers invariably becomes locked up in the hands of the Chinese toward the end of the sea-son , " Mr. PETROFF now speaks of the natives as learning the use of liquor from the whalers , and as manufacturing fiery potions for themselves . Altogether , Alaska seems to form a very promising and urgent field for temperance work , and to be further in need of good local magistrates with power to execute the laws . As ex-Senator BLAIR is out of a job he ought by all means to go to Alaska and exhort the natives to eschew the vile Chinese beverage .
