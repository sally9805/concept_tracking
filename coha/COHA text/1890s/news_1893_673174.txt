txt The Japanese have produced beautiful things in ceramics , but their potters have to yield to those of China in the sterling beauty of their porcelains , more especially when quite unadorned by anything but a single color and compelled to base their claim for admiration on shape and hue alone . In variegated pieces the Chinese are often weak ; they pile up too many colors , though tho same fault is not absolutely unknown in Japan . The Committee on the Loan Exhibition has made up a very choice , though limited , collection of pieces from the Middle Flowery Kingdom . So it comes about that the West Gallery , at the Fine Arts , on Fifty-seventh Street , has , fronting the doorway , a long case , whose shelves are dotted with vases , jars , and cups of porcelain from China . The depth and intensity of color in many of them rival precious atones . Here is a jar the hue of a carnelian , and another smooth and brilliant like half-polished rabies ; they are offset by a stately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese inscription in gilt just visible about the nook . Another red is that of Spitzenberg apples , frozen and darkened after a thaw ; another , the dark bull 's blood color so much sought by collectors of ceramics , which often shades up toward the lip of the jar to a paler hue . Then there are the light and dark coral , the sulphur yellow , and the yellowish white , with an exquisite specimen or two of the ivory white . The greens in this case are very noteworthy , from celadon and olive to robin 's egg , from apple green and the note of Spring grass to the dark green of a wet June meadow . Mirror black , purple blaok , and other dark porcelains are aeon here , requiring strong light to bring out their special shades . To this ease only Chinese porcelains in single or solid colors have been admitted ; they include six superlative small pieces of " peach bloom . " The case against the wall to the left Is devoted to blue and white porcelains. among which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jars in blue , and a tall urn with a ground of deliciously-tender ivory white , on the broad curve of whose sides the fabulous animal called shi-shi is seen in sky blue administering comfort to its cub with a soft white tongue . The shi-shi , although called a lion . appears to be in the nature of a bear , but as eccentric a bear as the pop-eyed , four-tailed goldfish in the aquaria of the Orient are eccentric ) as goldfish . A very simple stand or jar for flowers , Ivory white , with medallion frame outlined gracefully in blue , is a superb little piece for sweetness of color . Fantastic like the shi-shi are the snakes which writhe over a broad-bellied bottle , each snake having thrust out a tri-pronged tongue , more like a conventional sign for lightning than anything else ; indeed , it is safe to consider these snakes as a form of tho more common dragons of the firmament above and the firmament beneath  --  the principle of moisture In air and ocean . A line jar , with lid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle of stalks and tendrils , to which embellishments the potter has added a large crackle . One of the finest pieces in the case is Mr. C. A. Dana 's broad jar covered by a big floral pattern like two palm-leaf fans back to back . The porcelains in these two oases are from the collections of Messrs . Dana . Henry Sampson , Oastler , Marquand , Cyrus J. Lawrence , T. B. Clarke , H. A. Fraser , and others . Porcelains not blue and white , and not of solid colors , are in the smaller oases . In one near the door . to the left as one enters , stands a tall , straight jar with a Chinese domestic scene elaborately and very beautifully painted in colors . The ground is soft white . The scene includes a mendicant monk or other grotesque elder , a father with a child in his arms , an attendant , a boy , and so forth . Here is a bowl with a yellow ground covered with fantastic bats in brick red . A finely-shaped bottle , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serrated decoration about the base . all done in a pale red or peach color . Another bottle pale green of ground is twined about by dragons in gold . Very dainty is the pure white bowl , half a sphere in shape , which has been decorated in the socalled " rice-grain " pattern , the component strokes of the decoration being something like a long grain of rice in shape . There is no color . The porcelain white as snow ice seems to have been stamped through where the decoration occurs and the holes tilled with translucent glazing , thus making a very delicate and refined contrast with clear ice to the dull ice of the ground paste . This method adds to the apparent fragility of the bowL A narrow , tall case to the right of the entrance has many pieces of green and ivory white , apparently of a softer texture than porcelain and more like pottery . Green parrots are here with yellow or red beaks , letter screens formed of a single character in Chinese writing , diminutive cups , small pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lizards . A twohandled cup , the handles formed by climbing salamanders or dragons , sits in an opening on top of a porcelain arbor . latticed on three sides , open on the fourth . These pieces are all in variegated colors , with green for the chief note . A little case with many shelves contains curios wrought from rook crystal , amber , jade of red , white , pale green , and dark green tones , or from carnelian. lapis-lazuli , amethyst , sardonyx , and agate . With these the most brilliant porcelains mar be profitably compared . Another case is full of blue and white snuff bottles made during the last three centuries . Another has solid-color bottles of small size , including tea-leaf colored and mustard-crackle specimens , and one of a silver-shot bronze , more curious than beautiful . Still another ease has porcelain . knickknacks of variegated colors and examples of the glassware , paste on paste with cameo effect , for which the Chinese are noted , and near by is a case with Chinese cloisonna enamels shown on large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase in this ware , the ground rich dark blue , and the decorative , design a broad floral one . The Vanderbilt gallery has beneath its broad skylight several cases of ceramics , among which is a big burial jar of native American workmanship assigned to the ninth century . Mr. Marquand has lent several very beautiful Spanish and Sicilian platters of earthenware , barbaric , but in good taste , some of which have the metailio reflection of the cook pigeon 's throat or the wings of the dark-blue swallowtail butterfly . It is supposed that Persian craftsmen in the Mohammedan armies which overran Sicily , Morocco , and Spain brought the traditions of Persia in faience with them . Mr. Marquand also shows a number of blue and white Persian pieces which one might almost call porcelain ; they have very aplendid large decorative motifs . These are only a part of the attractions of the present Loan Exhibition at 215 West Fifty-Seventh Street . To-day there will he music from 2 to 6 in the afternoon , and on Sunday the galleries are open in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
