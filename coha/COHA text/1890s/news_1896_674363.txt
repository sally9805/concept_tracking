txt The action of the Board of Aldermen Tuesday , in granting a franchise to the Consumers ' Gas Fuel , Heat , and Power Company to lay its pipes and mains in the streets of this city , came In for much discussion yesterday . The vote in favor of granting the franchise was 26 for and 4 against , the latter being President Jeroloman and Aldermen Hall , Ware , and Olcott . All others , with the exception of Mr. Hackett , Republican , who was absent , voted for ft . The Corporation Counsel , in his letter to the board , practically warned it that there was grave doubt whether it had any power to grant such a franchise . Ever since this matter has been before the Lamps and Gas Committee there has been talk of " boodle " about the City Hall . This was renewed yesterday . There are many who do not believe such a valuable franchise could be so readily granted without corruption , but there has been no proof . Interested Aldermen say . they voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to get cheaper gas and fuel . They say that charges of corruption are made every time a franchise is granted . The franchise does not enable the Consumers ' Company to send illuminating gas through its pipes . But if the franchise ever becomes operative the company may send gas through its pipes for fuel , heat , and power . This distinction is important . If the pipes were for the transmission of illuminating gas it is said that the Aldermen could do nothing without the consent of interested property owners . The New York Gas , Heat and Power Company had also applied for a franchise similar to that asked for by the Consumers ' Company . Representatives of the former insist that their offer was by far the best . It was accompanied by a certified check for 10,000 as a guarantee of good faith . It was apparent , the officials of the New York Company say , that the majority of the Aldermen had made up their minds to give the franchise to the Consumers ' Company , and they would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at least suggestive of some strong personal motives . It is claimed that the New York Gas Company was organized in good faith for the manufacture and distribution of fuel gas , and that it is composed of men who are not only practical gas men , but have large financial means to carry out their project , while the Consumers ' Company is merely a franchise peddler . Its only object in obtaining a franchise before the Legislature has time to modify the existing law , it is said , is to sell out to some other company and make a handsome profit without emending a cent for legitimate purposes . It is the opinion in some quarters that the franchise will amount to nothing . An appeal has been taken in the matter of the Wilcox injunction , which was vacated by Judge Smyth on technical grounds . If the appeal is sustained the franchise will be void . If the appeal should fail other legal steps doubtless will be taken . Some comment in this connection was caused by the possibility that Alderman Olcott may be appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said that he would insist on investigating the granting of the franchise . Mayor Strong did not express an opinion upon the matter . Last night he took the papers home . He will refer the whole mat-t &; to the Corporation Counsel , and it is generally agreed that the latter will advise him to veto the franchise resolution . Assistant Corporation Counsel Turner is clearly of the opinion that the resolution is illegal . He has been paying attention to the subject for Mr. Scott . The Consumers ' Company was incorporated last May for the purpose of manufacturing non-illuminating gas and of supplying it for fuel purposes . Milo M. Belding of 455 Broadway is its President .
