txt Yesterday morning THE TIMES printed the story of a little group of negroes who had just arrived from Sierra Leone , Liberia , ragged , sickly , and destitute . They had gone out there as part of a colony from the South , and declared that they had been deceived , cheated , and left to starve . But when their story was reported to the Vice Consul of Liberia at this port , he declared without hesitation that the trouble with colonists of this stamp was that they would not go to the plateau country , where labor would yield a living , would not work if they could help it , and clung to the coast and the town , where the , climate was dangerous for those not used to it .

He has the hearty approval of the Colonial Offices of Great Britain , Germany , Belgium , and France  --  the Governments that exercise what authority exists in the interior of Africa . These colonies will be the advance guards of qwq fidelity , they can do an enormous amount of gOcd . From. the testimony of those who are in a position to know , we have no doubt that the colonies will be so managed , and that they deserve the hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
