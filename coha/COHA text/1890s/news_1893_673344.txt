txt " The verdict of the jury is that David J. Solomon is perfectly sane . " Scarcely had the words been uttered in Part II. , Supreme Court , last evening , when there was one of the liveliest , jolliest , most Uproarious scenes ever looked down upon by the grimy old ceiling and inhospitable walls . First there was applause ; then kissing ; more applause ; kissing again ; more kissing , kissing , and kissing . David J. Solomon and Miss Thomas , his fiancee , stood the central figures in this cyclone of osculation . David kissed his counsel theatrically , Miss Thomas kissed David hysterically , David kissed Miss Thomas resonantly , and some eight women , who were sympathizers , kissed them both effusively . Several young men , also sympathizers , kissed David and Miss Thomas and all the other women , and then it all started over again with David and Miss Thomas . So rapid , sharp , and continuous were the volleys of smacks that the Commissioners called loudly for order , and had to threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seemed particularly disgusted , however , were the adherents of Henry J. Solomon and employes of the necktie firm of David J. Solomon &; Co .. who had testifiedto their belief that David was a paretic . They hurried from the courtroom after the verdict in very uncomfortable frames of mind , as David has promised to make it decidedly interesting for them before long . Neither Henry J. Solomon nor Lemond , another brother , was in court . Very little testimony was taken in the case yesterday . Keeper Costello of Bloomingdale Asylum wanted to tell , for Lawyer Sanger , of havingplayed billiards with . David J. Solomon Thursday night , when David had acted . queerly , but on Lawyer Haire 's objection the testimony was ruled out . Bookkeeper Potter of David J. Solomon &; Co. testified that between July 29 and Aug. 2 , 1892 , David had drawn out $1,500 or $2,000 of the firm 's money . Lawyer Haire , in summing up , said that not only the life of David J. Solomon was involved in this suit , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acted in an utterly unbrotherly manner , and it seemed as if Henry had suddenly come to the conclusion of locking up David to get control of his property and to prevent his marrying Miss Thomas . Then , looking around him , Mr. Haire continued : " Henry Solomon does not dare to face his wronged brother here . After looking up hi brother as a lunatic , he offered him his hand to shake like a Judas . No wonder that David became angry and expressed himself in such terms as have been stated . " David 's business transactions , he claimed , showed . no evidence of insanity . Lawyer Sanger argued that a man could be insane without necessarily being altogether a raving maniac . David 's conduct on the stand Thursday ought to be sufficient to convince any one that he was insane . Mr. Sanger continued : " I have seen Dr. Bpitzka every day in court . He was employed by the other aide to examine David and to testify to his sanity . They had every opportunity or putting Dr. Spitz/re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him tell what was the result of his examination . " David 's erratic business methods were reviewed at length to show that he was unsound mentally . The jury went out shortly before 6 o'clock and returned in about twenty minutes . Then came the verdict , and thou the kissing . There was a load burst of applause , and David jumped up smiling from ear to ear . Stepping briskly over to Mr. Haire , he threw his arms around the lawyer and gave him a smack full on the lips . Mr. Haire smiled . Miss Thomas also jumped up . put up her hands , and then threw back her head as if about to faint . But fainting was no longer necessary , so . as David turned . round , she gleefully exclaimed : " Oh , Davie I Oh , darling ! Now I 've got you back again ! Is n't it just too nice for anything ! " The two rushed into each other 's arms and hugged and kissed , and kissed again . Then Mrs. Thomas grabbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all three started in on a triangular ? hysterical kissing match . In half a minute the kissing was epidemic among the entire Davis party . The female friends of Miss Thomas separated the kissing trio and began kissing them , too ; then young men joined in , and the kissing bee lasted until the Commissioners interfered . Lawyer Sanger , who was completely surprised by the verdict , moved that it be set aside on the ground of irregularity in the testimony and improper rulings by the Commissioners . His motion was denied , and once more the applause and kissing began . David broke away from the women , finally : and advancing to the jury said : Gentlemen , please accept my heartfelt thanks for your just and kind verdict . My heart overflows with gratitude , and some day during the coming week I shall be able to say more . " " That means a champagne supper , at least , for the jury , " remarked a bystander . " Or , perhaps , a necktie for each , " said another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again applauded by- David 's party . One of the jurors , a young man , had evidently won the hearts of most of the girls , for as soon as he had stepped on the floor he was surrounded . by them and embraced and kissed once or twice . He blushed , but seemed to enjoy it . " When is your wedding to be celebrated , " a reporter asked of David . " Within the next ten days , " he answered . Then he again kissed miss Thomas and the rest of the girls . Mr. Haire wanted to take David along with him , but the Commissioners held that David would have to be dispharged formally by order of the Supreme Court . Mr. Haire said he would hunt up Judge Ingraham during the evening and ask for an order of discharge . He was evidently unsuccessful , for David , who had meantime been returned to Bloomingdale Asylum , passed last night there .
