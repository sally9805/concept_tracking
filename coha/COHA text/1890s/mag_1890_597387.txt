A YANKEE IN ANDERSONVILLE . THE following pages were written during the years i866 and 1867 , almost immediately following my release from the Southern prisons . It is my own personal experience , and was written while fresh in my mind that it might not be lost to memory . It is but the experience of several thousands of others who were comrades with me at Andersonville , Charleston , and Florence , only the half is not told ; while if the experience of many others was told it would be greater and worse than my own . After twenty years I revised the original manuscript , leaving out much of its bitterness , and nearly all the explosive adjectives and personal opinions . My experience embraced three years of service , twenty-two battles , and ten months in different Southern prisons . I enlisted as a private soldier the twentieth day of May , i86i , in a company that was raised in my native town of Wrentham , and composed almost entirely of schoolmates and acquaintances . The following June , together with nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner as our own , we were organized into the i8th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment , with James Barnes of Springfield , a prominent engineer , for our colonel . He was soon promoted to command a brigade . Our fortunes were soon cast in with the Army of the Potomac . The *8th Massachusetts Regiment took part in all its marches , and was present on every battlefield of that army . I was always present with my regiment till the event which is recorded below . General Grant took the Army of the Potoinac under his personal observation in April , 1864 . The third day of May following we started for Richmond for the fifth time , in a little different manner than ever before , as the sequel shows . Two days later , soon after noon , we entered the first fight of the campaign , the battle of the Wilderness . My company , I , were deployed as skirmishers . Our forward movement was soon stopped by a volley from the concealed enemy , which brought down Charley Wilson , one of the first victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move back . We found our division drawn up in line of battle , with knapsacks and all unnecessary baggage stacked in a heap , and a guard detailed from each company to watch over it . The preparations did not seem to indicate that our generals apprehended much of a force in our front , but expected only a small skirmish . We were soon ordered to advance upon the enemy , which we did by moving slowly through the woods and underbrush , keeping our line as straight and compact as possible , about half a mile , when a dropping fire of musketry began . The nature of the battleground was such that artillery could not be used to advantage , though I noticed upon the turnpike to our right that two pieces had been planted so as to command the road , but they were not used , as I shall explain , till nearly night . The dropping fire did not check our advance . The order to charge soon rang along the line , and our slow advance broke into a double-quick and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told upon our men , dropping one here and there , seeming to make no particular selections . Our line soon became very much disordered , owing more to the underbrush than to our reception at the hands of the enemy . One brigade of our division was two hundred yards in advance of us , hotly engaged upon the top of a wooded knoll , // while the brigade to our right was nearly half a mile in our rear . The enemy , no doubt seeing this disorder , took immediate advantage of it and pressed us harder than ever , when the order was passed along the line to fall back and re-form . We did so in part , but did not succeed in connecting with the brigade upon our right . Again we charged through the brush upon the enemy , driving them more than half a mile , causing our line to become still more disordered and scattered among the brush , and again we were ordered to fall back and re-form . The afternoon was very hot ; the young growth of forest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stirring outside , and the trees had not yet leaved enough to afford any shade . The powder smoke was stifling , causing exhaustion and extreme thirst . Some few were sunstruck , or completely overcome by the heat and smoke . It was about four o'clock in the afternoon , and we had been fighting nearly three hours without any advantage to either side . Our loss was pretty heavy in killed and wounded . We had treason to suppose the enemy 's loss equaled ours . As we moved back they charged upon us in turn . In trying to move across a miry place , together with several of my immediate comrades , we were held fast in the mud , and before we could extricate ourselves , in our partially exhausted condition , the " Rebs " were upon us , giving us no choice but to surrender or be shot down . Of course we surrendered , and were ordered back to the rear of their line of battle , about two hundred yards , where we were considered safe enough without having any special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in ministering to the wants of our wounded , who lay scattered about in every direction and every possible condition of si*ffering , bringing them water , and binding up their xvounds to the best of our ability . It was nearly five o'clock in the afternoon when I saw those two cannon , before spoken of as posted on the turnpike , do fearful execution . The turnpike was straight as an arrow , and crowded ,  --  massed full of Confederate reinforcements coming to the front ,  --  and these two pieces of artillery opened upon them , each firing only a single shot ; but the shot skipped down and along the road , opening two distinct gaps through the rebel ranks for full three hundred yards . I had no means of knowing how many those shots disabled , but it must have been hundreds . In three seconds there was not a man left in the road , as far as the eye could reach , who was able to help himself out . About dark all the scattering prisoners were collected by our captors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear of his corps . About nine hundred of us were collected in this way , and we found that the most of us had been captured by the celebrated " Stonewall Brigade . " Here I saw General R. E. Lee for the first and only time in my life . He sat upon his horse carelessly , with one knee resting upon the pommel of the saddle , and leisurely smoking a cigar . He appeared a middle-sized man , with iron-gray hair and full gray beard , not very closely cut ; as fine-looking a specimen of a man and soldier as I ever saw . He remarked , as we filed past him , " Am sorry to see you in this fix , boys , but you must make the best of it . " His tone was kind , and spoken as though he really sympathized with us , as I have no doubt he did . After dark a guard was detailed to march us to Orange Court House , distant twenty-five miles . We were all exhausted with the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look very promising ; for go we must , and that , too , at the point of the bayonet . Our thoughts upon this lonely , tiresome march were anything but pleasant and comfortable . Only one month more and my term of service would expire . I had been thinking very strongly of the home I had left three years before , and during the whole of that time had not seen it , or even been outside the lines of the Army of the Potomac . Now we were marching the opposite way , towards the rebel prisons - of which we had already heard too much . Our guard used us well , and I would say here that during our whole captivity we always experienced good usage from an old soldier-from all those who had fought and met us upon the many battlefields of the war . It was left for the " home guards " to maltreat and abuse the prisoners of war , and to heap insult upon injury . No truer statement was ever made than " A brave man is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindictive . " The brave men of the South were mostly at the front with their armies . We were told by our guard that we should be exchanged in a few days by way of Richmond and City Point . We believed it , and therefore none of us m*de any attempt to escape . We arrived at Orange Court House about one o'clock the next morning - to use an army phrase , " completely played out " - and were there crowded into the jail yard , our number just packing it full . Distributing ourselves upon the ground , we made the best of our circumstances , and generally slept till nine o'clock in the morning . Before noon we began to realize the meaning of the word " prisoner . " // We had been used as brother soldiers by Lee 's army , but at the Court House we fell into the hands of the dreaded " home guard . " We were searched , and robbed of everything valuable - watches , money , knives , extra blankets , and shelter tents , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more of the same kind . All that we were allowed to keep , except the clothing upon our backs , was our choice of an overcoat or a woolen blanket . Some of my comrades succeeded in secreting their money , andin someinstances theirwatches . I saved my own watch by slipping it into my shoe under the sole and instep of my foot ; and my money ( about eight dollars ) went into the lining of my jacket-both saved for a time . One poor fellow , with more pluck than discretion , tore his rubber blanket into shreds , but was rewarded by a blow upon the head from the sword of an officer . I saw the blow and was told that it caused his death in an hour . About noon we started for Gordonsville , very much lighter loaded than the night before , and reached that place ( about nine miles ) in the afternoon . A train of box-cars was waiting , and we were soon hustled on board , packed *xty in a car . We rode thus all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought into the place on the train following ours , having been severely wounded in the second day 's fight at the Wilderness . I just got a glimpse of him as he was borne from the train upon a stretcher . We were marched outside the village half a mile , down through a steep gully , into a kind of natural basin containing perhaps five acres , surrounded on all sides by high hills , and overhead the blue sky . A brook , clear as the blue heavens above us , came leaping through it from the foot of the Blue Ridge ; a prettier , more retired spot could not be imagined . Nature had done her best , and man absolutely nothing , for our convenience . Here we remained one week , without any serious cause for complaint , except once they neglected to issue our daily allowance of hardbread and two ounces of bacon . The weather was fair and warm , so we did not once think of shelter . Additions were made to our number daily , so that at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had begun to congratulate ourselves upon having nearly enough to eat , and on the advantages of our prison over close confinement between brick walls . Many of my comrades were planning for an escape to the mountains , and were only waiting for a dark , stormy night to put those plans into execution , when it would have been a comparatively easy matter to pass our guard . But the chance was never given ; instead , one morning all was VOL . XL. - 6o. bustle and confusion , because we were going to be sent South for " immediate exchange , " so we were soberly informed by the officers of our guard . Our exchange proved to be from the open air to the crowded , filthy rooms of a large tobacco warehouse at Danville , Virginia . For once , and the only time during our travels in " * we were crowded into the regular passenger coaches , instead of the box or baggage cars , and accommodated with seats , for our " exchange " to - Danville . It took us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than one hundred and fifty miles . The first day exhausted our provisions ; the following thirty-six hours we subsisted upon faith and the beautiful scenery of the upper James River , where we saw substantial-looking plantations and a rich country , but thriftlessness was stamped upon it all . Our arrival at Danville was not so much noticed by the townspeople as at Lynchburg . They had seen many a like deputation before , for we found several thousand of the " boys in blue " confined in the six different tobacco warehouses that the town contained . The prison selected for us was upon the bank of and overlooking the Dan River - a plain , brick , three-story building . Two hundred and fifty were packed upon each floor , giving each man a space of six by six feet , which made it very crowded . An approach to the windows was not allowed , and was considered to afford a legitimate target for the guard below . Who ever saw a soldier that was not looking for something to eat ? We had fasted thirtysix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern was for something to eat . Just before night corn-bread and bacon were issued to us in fair quantities . This , then , was the exchange promised us at Lynchburg ! To be sure , we were exchanged from the open air to close confinement between brick walls , our rations from hard-bread to corn-bread . The quantity of our rations was now sufficient , though the quality was doubtful ; but quantity was the principal item with the majority of us , although the stomachs of many rebelled against the coarse corn-bread and fat bacon . The bacon had a habit of acting a little queer and lively at times , although we were repeatedly assured that it had been killed once more than two years before ; the bread was never more than half baked ; b&amp;t the lack of fresh air during the heat of the day was the most unbearable . A barrel of water stood on each floor , and a detail was made from our number to keep the barrels full . I succeeded in being detailed for one day , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and from the river than ever before or since , and would have esteemed it a privi // lege to carry water the greater part of each day . I met prisoners from the other prisons , conveying water , who had been confined in these tobacco houses for nearly two months , and they looked more like ghosts than human beings - hardly able to drag one limb after another , their skin bleached to a dead white , and their bodies thin with the appearance of transparency . I began to fear prison life more than ever . It was repeatedly asserted by the commanders of our guard that exchange or parole was not far distant ; that news from our Government was expected every day of its readiness to receive us as fast as we could be shipped . We began seriously to doubt their sincerity . The dispositions of old comrades were rapidly undergoing a change . They were not so ready to help each other , and do that for another which would in the least lessen one 's own chances or advantages . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament , that trait now began to predominate . It is hardly right to call it a selfish trait ; it was rather the instinct of self-preservation , an instinct that human nature will rarely resist to the death I , for one , had great faith in the strength of human friendship , knowing from absolute experience what one friend will do and sacrifice for another ; but here it would not do to reckon too much upon the amenities of our supposed friends . Our life between the brick walls of the tobacco xvarehouses of Danville was of short duration , only six days , when the story was freely circulated , " to be exchanged by way of Charleston . Several of your transports already awaiting you there ! " We had not heard of Andersonville , and did not then know that such a place existed . We had heard that some of our officers were very " pleasantly located " at Columbus , but were not aware of any place south of Virginia where private soldiers were confined . We knew that General Grant was pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsafe for prisoners of war to be retained there . We were told by our guard that owing to the proximity of Lee 's and Grant 's armies they could not exchange us over the old route , by the way of City Point , so we were again made to believe and swallow the " exchange " lie . We left Danville rather elated with the idea of being able to see something of the Southern country as we journeyed to Charleston . I was among the first train-load , and learned subsequently that the prisoners were taken from Danville at the rate of one train-load each day . At that time there were seven or eight thousand in the different Danville prisons . We were crowded , as usual , into box-cars , sixty in each car , one sentinel posted inside at each door , and a number upon the top of each car . A special car was attached to the rear of the train for the use of the guard . This was the manner in which all our journeyings were conducted , forward and backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few who could secure a standing-place by the open doors , or obtain a seat upon the floor of the car , with legs dangling outside . I usually obtained such a seat , reaching it in a quiet way , without any loud assertions as to my rights or supenor powers , but squirming and squeezing myself into it in a very unostentatious but persistent manner . I wished to examine the country as we moved along , and it was impossible to do so except from the open door . After riding a few miles we all left the train and marched sixteen miles over an unfinished section of the road . In going this distance we somewhere crossed the North Carolina line . We were marching to be exchanged , else the insufficient guard would not have succeeded in conducting us through this wild , unsettled country . As it was we took our own time , and on the whole made a comfortable march of it . One evening we camped in a pleasant spot by the side of a clear stream of water . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweet-bay trees were in full bloom , which loaded the evening air with a rich , sleepy perfume , very pleasant to the senses . We were hungry and our empty haversacks only laughed at us , but about nine o'clocT a quart of flour was issued to each man ; no salt to be had . Every other man soon had a fire of small sticks started , and by a careful inventory we discovered that about every third man was the owner of a tin plate , so we quickly formed clubs of three for baking purposes . A stick split at one end would grasp the plate like a pair of pincers , making a handle to our baking-dish . One kept the fire in operation by constantly feeding and blowing it ; another procured the water and mixed the dough in our tin cups , and the third attended to the baking . In place of grease for the pan , flour was sprinkled upon it , which answered the purpose very well in preventing the dough from sticking to it . Owing to the unskillful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents dumped into the fire , and the split stick would often burn off causing a like result ; but by eleven o'clock we all managed to eat a hearty supper of unleavened , unsalted cakes . Heavy as dough though they were , yet we hungry men never tasted food that relished better . The following morning we were again // packed into the box-cars and journeyed south . The country in North Carolina through which we passed was desolate and barren in the extreme . It appeared to be a land that once was cultivated , but now worn out and left to grow up with what it would . Occasionally we passed through long stretches of the Southern pine ; large , noble-looking trees , but all bearing the scar of the turpentine maker 's ax , with here and there an old still , where a few years before the pitch obtained from the pine was converted into turpentine . About them were immense piles of resin . We met many negroes upon our route , but very few white men . The negroes had hardly rags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we met white men or women they were almost as shabby . Their houses were mere hovels , and bore no marks of distinction that would distinguish them from the huts of the negroes . We stopped a few moments at one place that broke the desolate monotony - Charlotte . It was pleasantly located and contained some comfortable residences . Close by the depot , in a beautiful park , was located the female institute of North Carolina . The young ladies crowded balconies and front yard of the seminary . They waved their handkerchiefs and flags of stars and bars . One young lady , evidently of the right stamp , cunningly grouped a red and blue ribbon with her white handkerchief in swSh a way as to catch our eyes , and one car-load of us honored her with three cheers . It was very soon hushed , however , by our guards , who inquired what we were cheering at . Of course they obtained no satisfactory reply . We knew that there was one young lady in the seminary who was on our side , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly withdrew . There were plenty of lone xvidows who gathered about the train , each with a fragment of something to sell . One had half a doz*n ginger cookies in a peck basket for which the modest sum of ten cents each was asked ; another had three-quarters of a sweet-potato pie , rather a doubtful compound , and asked only twenty-five cents a quarter for it , in Confederate money . One of my comrades , of the ist Michigan , dickered with her for it , and finally obtained the whole three-quarters for five cents in silver . They seemed willing to take our greenbacks in exchange for their produce , but asserted that it was a prison offense to do so , and therefore dared not openly take them in presence of our guard . Another of my comrades sold his watch to one of the citizens of the place for $212 of their currency , the watch being worth in ours about six . Our stop at Charlotte was only about twenty minutes . We crossed the Catawba , and several smaller streams , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land on each bank . The rivers were sluggish , dark , gloomy-looking streams . The first place of note met in South Carolina was Chesterville . We passed near the village just at nightfall , but made no stop until clear of its outskirts , when the train came to a stand by the side of a brook . The guard permitted our canteens to be filled with water from the brook , and also informed us that we would receive some rations of some kind before we were moved on . I never could discover the reason why we stopped at this place during the night , though the matter was pretty thoroughly discussed , for packed as we were , sixty in a car , there was but little opportunity for sleep . While moving on through the day new scenes were constantly opening up that served in part to help us keep our tempers in our crowded , cramped , and starved condition ; but during this night there was nothing to interest , not even sleep , and furthermore we had had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw the officers and many of the men that composed our guard stringing back towards our train from the direction of the village . From their dogged , haggard looks we surmised that they had been indulging pretty freely in " pine top and sorghum , " as whisky was called , so of course we got little consolation or relief from them . In a few minutes , however , we heard the cry from the rear end of the train , " Rations in sight ! Rations in sight ! " Sure enough , there they came . A single mule with a two-wheeled cart loaded down with rations of some sort in bags ; their nature or quality we could not even surmise , although every guess of a Yankee was exhausted . We were told by our guard that they would be issued to us after the train was under way . We saw the bags loaded upon the train , and immediately we started . Very soon the order passed along the train for a sergeant from each car to climb to the top and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon returned and tossed a bag into each car containing - corn ! There was a deal of muttering and cursing indulged in for a while , the import of which it is not necessary to repeat ; but when we discovered that each of us would obtain nearly a quart , the growling and muttering subsided , or was confined to the unlucky few who had poor teeth . My teeth were good , my appetite was good , the corn tasted good ; and , by diligent application , before noon my rations were well ground in the mill that nature provided . All this time we were moving onward , // PLAN OF THE STOCKADE AND SURROUNDINGS AT ANDERSONVILLE . THE stockade was formed of pine logs planted in the ground . The inner or main stockade was twenty feet high ; outside of it were two other stockades not far apart ( indicated by a single line in the shove plan ) , the inner one sixteen feet high and the outer twelve . On November 27 , 1863 , the site of the prison was chosen hy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who arrived to take command in April , 1864 . The first detachment of Unjon prisoners reached the prison on the z5th of the previous Fehruary . Winder 's reputation in connection with the Richmond prisons was so had that the Richmond " Examiner " said , when he was sent South , " God have mercy upon those to whom he has been sent . ' Winder died Feb. 9 , 1865 . Captain Henry Wirz , who commanded the stockade , was a native of Switzerland , a physician hy profession and before the war was a citizen of Louisiana . In August , s86* , he was tried hy a Union Military Commission , and executed . In the summer of 2864 Lieutenant-Colonel D. T. Chandler officially inspected the Andersonville prison ; his report is dated August 5 , and in it he hegged the Richmond government to send no more prisoners to that pen and to remove all of the prisoners then there , above 5 , ooo ; that is , he reported that 20,000 to 25,000 prisoners ought to he provided for elsewhere . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical attendance provided within the stockade . Small quantities of medicine are placed in the hands of certain prisoners of each squad or division , and the sick are directed to he brought out hy sergeants of squads daily , at sick-call , ' to the medical officers who attend at the gate . The crowd at these times is so great that only the strongest can get access to the doctors , the weaker ones being unable to force their way through the press ; and the hospital accommodations are so limited that though the beds ( so called ) have all or nearly all two occupants each , large numbers who would otherwise he received are necessarily sent hack to the stockade . Many-twenty yesterday - are carted out daily , who have died from unknown causes and whom the medical officers have never seen . The dead are hauled out daily hy the wagon-load and buried without coffins , their hands in many instances being first mutilated with an ax in the removal of any finger-rings they may have . The sanitary condition of the prisoners is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heing scurvy and chronic diarrhea . Nothing seems to have heen done , and hut little if any effort made to arrest it by procuring proper food . The ration is * pound of bacon and A pound unbolted corn-meal , with freshheef at rare intervals , and occasionally rice . When to he obtained - very seldom - a small quantity of molasses is substituted for the meat ration . A little weak vinegar , unfit for use , has sometimes been issued . The arrangements for cooking and haking have been wholly inadequate , and though additions are now being conspleted it will still he impossible to cook for the whole number of prisoners . Raw rations have to be issued to a very large proportion , who are entirely unprovided with proper utensils , and furnished so limited a supply of fuel they are compelled to dig with their hands in the filthy marsh before mentioned for roots , etc . No soap or clothing has ever been issued . The present hospital arrangements were only intended for the accommodation of the sick of 20,000 men , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present needs ; the number of prisoners being now more than three times as great , the number of cases requiring medical treatment is in an increased ratio . . . . My duty requires me respectfully to recommend a change in the officer in command of the post , Brigadier-General J. H. Winder , and the substitution in his place of some one who unites both energy and good judgment with some feeling of humanity and consideration for the welfare and comfort ( so far as is consistent with their safe keeping ) of the vast number of unfortunates placed under his control ; some one who at least will not advocate deliberately and in cold blood the propriety of leaving them in their present condition until their number has been sufficiently redticed by death to make the present arrai*gement suffice for their accommodation ; who will not consider it a matter of self-laudation SIld boasting that he has never been inside of the stockade , a place the horrors of which it is difficult to describe , and which is a disgrace to civilization : the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and judgment , even with the limited means at his command , have considerably improved . " // crossing the Wateree River , making a short stop at Columbia , the capital of the State , but hardly long enough to get a sight of the city . I noticed , however , that it wore a deserted appearance , and contained many line buildings . I obtained a glimpse of the prison , where several hundred of our Federal officers were confined . After leaving Columbia we passed through no other town of any note in the State , and the same night , after crossing the Savannah River , which divides this State from Georgia , we reached Augusta . Here we remained through one night , and were permitted to leave the train and to camp in an open field outside the city . Extra guards were sent out to care for us , and about ten o'clock in the evening rations of hard-bread and bacon were distributed among us in fair quantities . We were here informed that the reason of the lack of rations along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended upon chance supplies for the prisoners along the route , without sending any notice ahead of our approach ; that the inland towns could not get tog*ther enough to ration us all without at least a day 's notice . The trains that followed ours fared better . Up to the time of our arrival at Columbia it had all been " exchange . " Our guard and officers in charge talked " exchange " - exchange by way of Charleston . We talked " exchange . " It was all " exchange . " At Columbia a revolution took place . Many of us knew the lay of the land , and were aware that we must now take the Charleston and Columbia Road in order to reach Charleston . We gently hinted this fact to our guards , making eager inquiries regarding another fact , that we were taking the road to Augusta instead of to Charleston , but we could get no satisfaction from them . The earnest discussions among ourselve* soon reached the ears of the commanding officer , and he very quickly set the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of siege , that we could not be exchanged by that port ; that he had received a telegram while at Columbia to take us on to Savannah for exchange . The majority were ready to believe and swallow this new dose , but several questioned whether we were now taking the most direct route for Savannah . The majority ruled , however ; therefore it was voted , exchange by way of Savannah . At Augusta there was a branch road for Charleston , but we did not take it . Our cramped condition in the box-car prisons was becoming unendurable . We finally reached Macon . This was the point where the doubting ones were to decide the matter of exchange . Here the road branched again , one section running to Savannah , and the other continuing south and terminating at Americus . At Macon we saw another prison where Federal officers were confined . It had become a settled question in all our discussions that if we took the road from Macon to Savannah it was for exchange ; if the other road , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards " a prison of some sort . " The officers in charge , well knowing our destination , put a double guard over us and ordered a closer watch upon our movements . The inquiry was in every comrade 's mouth , " Where are we going ? " " What kind of a prison are they going to find for us ? " Our guard soon had an answer for us , because instructions were sent along down the train from the commanding officer that our destination , for a short time , was within a few miles of Americus ; that the prison grounds were pleasantly located , well shaded by nature 's forest trees ; the " fence , " as they termed it , inclosing two slopes or hillsides that were richly carpeted with grass ; on the whole as pleasant a spot as the Confederacy afforded , and " too good for you Yanks anyway ! " It was near noon of the 20th of May , 1864 , that our train came to a stop , in a clearing of the pine forest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straining eager eyes to catch some glimpse of our stopping place . It was here before us . Looking from our position upon the railroad towards the southeast , at the extreme end of the clearing , some three or four hundred yards away , a cloud of smoke was curling upward from a rectangular , substantial-looking pen . Upon inquiry we were told , " That s where you Yanks will put up ! " We had little time for thought before a round-shouldered , blustering little man upon a white horse rode the length of the train , and with many a curse and oath ordered us all out . During our exit from the close , cramped quarters we had occupied so long a fresh guard came , in the wildest confusion and unmilitary order , from the direction of the smoke , and after much blustering and more cursing we were formed into two lines , giving room for us to pass between , four deep . After some more swearing the officer on the white horse placed himself at the head of the column and ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unhappily our first introduction to him was not our last . Upon reaching the inclosure we halted while a part of our number were formed into a detachment , and the remainder were ordered to be placed upon the rolls of the older detachments already in the pen . I have hesitated thus far to pronounce the // word Andersonville . We knew nothing , or had heard nothing , of the place , so we had not a moment 's notice of the life we were about to enter upon . These many years after , the word " Andersonville " excites the same curiosity that it did before we entered upon the months of suffering that can not be told . This , then , was Andersonville , or , as it was called by the guard , " Camp Sumpter . " We entered it by a swinging door or gate , large , heavily ironed , and guarded . As we passed within the doors were closed behind and heavily barred - closed upon me for five long months , and upon one-half our number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the misery before our eyes . The attempt to picture our mental depressIon , as we took in , with one quick , swift glance , the condition of those who had entered before us , would be futile . We joined inside the inclosure. thirteen thousand of our comrades in arms , but they were not to be recognized . They seemed a different race of the human family , and vasijy more squalid than any I ever had seen or heard of- emaciated forms , half human and half spectral , black with filth and smoke , and swarming with vermin . As we were driven like sheep into the stockade they crowded about us , making inquiries faster than they could be answered . I think we were the first detachment of fresh prisoners that had reached Andersonville for two or three months . Those that we met there were immigrants from Belle Isle , Libby , and Danville , and all of them prisoners of from three to sixteen months ' experience . For convenience in drawing rations and being counted each morning they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one of their own non-commissioned officers placed over each company . Each detachment was subdivided into sections of ninety men , with a non-commissioned officer over each , but we found the numbers of the detachments diminished fully one-third by deaths . I was placed in one of the old detachments , together with a number of my more intimate comrades - " Detachment 13 , Squad 3 . " The sun was giving us the benefit of its direct rays , which soon roused us , in a degree , from the stupor into which we had subsided as a partial realization of the situation crept upon our senses ; and we began to make a move towards forming some kind of shelter to protect us from the scorching heat . My stock consisted of an overcoat - nothing more . Richard Lovell , Richard Williams , and Charles Wilmarth , who had associated with me thus far , now proposed that we unite our stock , and thus build a common shelter . Our combined effects consisted of two woolen blankets , two overcoats , two case-knives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tin plate , and three canteens ; nothing superfluous , as can be readily seen , in necessary material for four men to build a house and begin keeping it with . We selected the best unoccupied spot for a location ; with our case-knives and hands we scooped a level place upon the hillside barely large enough for our number to lie upon . It was necessary that we should have two upright poles and a cross pole , or ridge pole , in order to stretch our blankets in the form of a roof over our heads . We thoroughly searched the whole interior of the stockade for material enough for the purpose , but could obtain none without purchasing ; and we finally bargained for three poles , each of them smaller than common bean-poles , by paying a dollar and fifty cents in greenbacks . Towards night we had finished our shelter , so far as lay in our power , but were obliged to leave both gable ends open , using our coats for pratection between our persons and the ground . We were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but about the middle of the afternoon rations began to come in . They were loaded upon wagons , each wagon drawn by two mules , and consisted of coarse cornbread and old bacon . Each wagon was accompanied by a guard while being driven within the stockade and distributing its load at the headquarters of each detachment . The detachment sergeants issued it in equal lots to the three squad sergeants , and they again , dividing it as equally as possible , gave to the ninety individual men . I was somewhat curious to see the operation VIEW FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE SOUTH GATE . ( FEOM A SKETCH MADE AT THE TIME BY H. E. SNEDEN. ) // of issuing the rations to so many men ; how it might be done fairly , so that each would be satisfied . The sergeant in charge , seeing me looking on with so much interest , called upon me to assist . After the bread and meat had been divided into the requisite number of pieces they were placed upon a log , which I was informed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about half the size of a brick , and a piece of meat , as large as two of my fingers , was the ration for each man for a whole day . It would be impossible for any man , however nice his judgment , to divide the bread and meat into exactly even pieces ; some would have a mouthful or a mouthful and a half more than others , and some pieces would be better in quality than others in either case an item not to be overlooked by starving men . We were all numbered , and so soon as the rations were ready for delivery I was asked to turn my back to them ; then the sergeant would place his hand upon one of the rations at the same moment asking me what number should have it . I called out what number I pleased ; and , not being able to see what particular ratioh the sergeant had his hand upon , no one could complain that any favoritism was shown . This was , in substance , the manner in which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole stockade . As night came on I repaired to the shelter we had improvised , but not to talk with my comrades ; neither did they show any disposition *o converse during this first evening and night spent in Andersonville : our individual thoughts were too busy with themselves . I was trying to comprehend the situation , to weigh the probabilities of life or death . Whatever other scenes or experiences may be in store for me , none can leave the deep mark of despair or the dark forebodings which took possession of my mind that evening . It was miot the confinement within the stockade . It was not the fear of starvation . It was not the fear of exposure to beat , cold , or midnight dews . It was the spectacle presented by the thirteen thousand comrades whom we first found within that inclosure : it required no prophetic powers to convince us that they could never be men again . Our prison was an inclosure of fifteen acres ; the stockade was built of pine logs , hewn square , set into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and set side by side so closely that no space was left between . Upon the outside of the stockade , and near the top , sentry-boxes were placed at short intervals completely around the whole . Inside the stockade , fifteen feet from it , a slender railing was run , known as the " dead line , " the sentries being ordered to shoot any person who set foot over it or in any manner interfered with it . Every night large fires were kindled of torchwood , or " lightwood " as it was called , forming two lines of these fires , one on each side of the stockade , some thirty or forty feet outside , and intended to light up the prison , so that no secret movement could be made under cover of the darkness of the night . Upon two sides of the stockade , and some two to four hundred yards distant , were two earthworks , one upon either side , and each mounting four cannon . These were manned at all hours of the day and night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire of grape and canister into the crowded pen . The stockade inclosed two side hills , a brook , small and muddy , running through the valley between , dividing the inclosure into nearly equal halves . About three acres of this valley , most of it upon one side of the brook , but a part of it upon both sides , was a swamp , and uninhabitable , it being the upper part of miles of impassable swamp which stretched off to the eastward below us . The cook-house , where all the bread was baked and meat boiled , stood upon this very brook , above and outside the stockade , so that all.the greasy scum , refuse , and dirt from it came floating through the inclosure that we inhabited , upon the surface , or mixed with the water we were obliged to drink and to use for washing . The camps of our guard were so located that all their sewerage came down through our inclosure . In building the stockade every tree within it had been cut , and although made within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same pine was not worth here the labor of cutting it - not a tree was left for a shade from the scorching Southern sun , or to furnish us with material with which to build our own shelters , to say nothing of firewood for cooking purposes . No provision was made , until near the very close of our incarceration at Andersonville , towards carrying off the refuse and sewerage of our prison , and no sanitary regulations had been put in force . The filth that accumulated through those long summer months can neither be described nor imagined . Most of it collected in and about the three acres of swamp , * and I have seen that three acres one animated mass of maggots from one to two feet deep , the whole swamp moving and rolling like the waves of the sea . We had no books , papers , or pamphlets ; only a few Eibles brought in by the prisoners . I was fortunate enough to possess a copy , which was so well read by my comrades that nothing remained of it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the stockade upon our arrival in May had , almost to a man , given up all hope of exchange or of ever reaching home again , and were every day and hour simply lying down to die . There was hardly a half-hour during the whole day and night but that at least one was passing away to his everlasting home . They had ceased to care for cleanliness , or to take precautions for their health thou oh any b upon the arrival of our fresh-looking men they seemed to show a little more regard for their personal appearance and health . Upon our rallying them , some would brighten up and appear more hopeful , so that for a few weeks the death rate was materially reduced ; but as the heat of summer advanced nd the number of l ) risoners increased to thirty or thirty-five thousand , our death rate rapidly grew , and it was soon a common occurrence to carry out a hundred dead men from the stockade in one morning . Two hundred and twelve were carried out one day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and comrades were comparatively light ; but abok*t the first of July one of them , Charles Wilmarth , was taken sick , and very soon died . In his place we took a John Brown , another member and one of the recruits of my own regiment . Brown was about fifty years old , had served out his time in the English navy , had been several years a whaler , had been three years in our own navy , and knew nearly every important port in the world . He was the only man in the whole prison coming under my observation who did not seem afflicted by prison life . It did affect him , but in the form of a blessing rather than an evil . At the time of his arrival in the prison . he was a mere brute , crazed with whisky ; and his intellect , which was naturally strong , even brilliant , was nearly destroyed . After one month 's abstinence he seemed stronger , healthier , and improving rapidly every day . His conversation , stories of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our immediate circle , and were of assistance towards keeping our spirits good . With all our sufferings this man I ) roved to us , beyond a doubt , that there was one condition in this world that a man might reach worse than Andersonville . We began to dig wells , as much for employment as anything , but yet for the purpose of procuring more and better water . We used an old tin plate or a split canteen for a shovel , and our haversacks for buckets to elevate the dirt . The soil was hard red clay , yet with our meager tools several wells were dug over eighty feet deep , and one that reached one hundred feet in depth . But the supply of water thus obtained was very small , only satisfying the wants of the few who had the courage and pluck to dig . Another industry was the digging of tunnels , which required great outlays of labor and cunning , with little inducements , and only a slight hope of escape . I engaged in a number of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of construction at one time . In several instances the operators were successful , and made good their escape from the stockade for a few days or weeks perhaps , but were almost invariably recaptured by the hounds and hunters . The majority of the tunnels were a total failure , except that they served to give employment and to keep hope alive . They were pretty sure to be discovered by our keeper Wirz , who had the aid of traitors among our own numbers , or of spies sent among us . The mode of operating in one tunnel , in which I was engaged , and which came the nearest to a success , will be a fair sample of operating with them all . One of the members of my company ' , who was brought into the stockade several weeks later than myself , had built a shelter of blankets and rags very near the " dead-line , " which also brought his stopping-place within the shadow of the stockade as it was cast by the night fires from the outside . This made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several of us made a social call upon this comrade , William Moore , late one evening , and broached the subject of beginning a tunnel from his domicile . He fell in with the proposal very readily , and we concluded to begin operations the next night . It was about the first of July , for I remember that upon the night of the Fourth of July , when the whole North was supposed to be celebrating the birth of our nation , I was five feet under ground , upon my hands and knees , in a hole barely large enough to craxvl in , working inch by inch with an old c* se-knife and my bare hands , trying to find the liberty that the North was celebrating . li*Te first dug directly down into the ground a hole large enough for one to work in and about seven feet deep ; then we began to dig in a horizontal direction , from its bottom , towards the stockade . Our mining operations were upon a small scale and very simple , our ingenuity being all engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the general mass of the prisoners . The shaft was only large enough for one to dig at a time , and that upon his hands and knees . The operator would loosen the hard clay with the case-knife , scrape it into one of our haversacks with his hands , and a comrade at the // entrance to the shaft would draw out the filled haversack by means of an improvised rag rope , replacing it with an empty one by pushing it in with a slender pole , this pole being spliced from time to time as the tunnel proceeded . Now came the most particular part of the job : this dirt must be scattered upon or about the heaps of dirt thrown out from the numerous wells ; and these wells were invariably near the center of the inclosure , not being allowed very near the dead-line . Several haversacks of dirt might be carried from our excavation without attracting the attention of the vigilant guard , but to carry them at regular intervals throughout the entire night seemed almost impossible . But the stockade cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this shadow the sentinels could not distinguish objects in a dark night ; therefore the comrade employed as carrier did not leave this shadow to approach the center of the stockade twice in the same place , and always with his load underneath his overcoat or blanket of rags . Twelve of us were thus employed upon this tunnel , six working every night . After the shaft had been carried beyond the first few feet it was impossible for one to remain within it longer than half an hour at a time without being overcome and rendered insensible from lack of sufficient air . Several times we had to drag a comrade from the tunnel in this condition . We worked patiently and steadily nearly four weeks without detection , though several other tunnels were discovered and demolished VOL . XL. - 6i. during this time . To keep the secret of its location safe , we made a shoulder upon the mouth of the shaft , and after nicely fitting some boards into it , the whole was covered six inches deep with dirt that corresponded with the soil at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose ; then our comrade Moore and his chum spread their overcoats over all , and slept thereon the greater part of each day . One night , after careful measurement , we ascertained that our shaft was eighty feet long . It was commenced twenty feet from the stockade ; therefore we were sixty feet outside the stockade , and ten or twenty feet outside the usual line of fires . This was deemed sufficient ; and we voted to suspend further operations and await the advent of a dark , stormy night the better to favor our escape through the tunnel . About this time  --  the latter part of Julythere was more loud talk of exchange . Reports of the resumption of the exchange of prisoners were common enough , evidently put into circulation by the authorities outside for purposes of their own ; but this one , in particular , came so well recommended that it was pretty generally believed , for the following reasons . The only authorized representative of the Christian religion who possessed enough of it to visit the thirty thousand men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton , who came in quite regularly , at least every Sabbath , for several weeks . He talked kindly to us , displaying much sympathy SCENE NEAR THE NORTH GATE - DISTRIBUTING RATIONS . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH. ) // for our condition , and administering the last rites of the Church to all the dying men who would accept , without any regard to individual beliefs . He stated that strong efforts were being made to bring about an exchange by both the North and South , and that their efforts would probably soon be successful . Upon the strength of this report we concluded to let our tunnel remain quiet for the time , thinking that if exchange failed we could have final recourse to it . The exchange did fail ; and a heavy thunder shower loosened one of the timbers of which the stockade was composed , so that it settled into the shaft , discovering to the authorities our tunnel , and they quickly filled it up . The sentinels and guard at Andersonville were " home guards , " composed of boys from twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfit for active duty . The older sentinels were not so rash or bitter in performing their duties , but the boys would often embrace the slightest opportunity for maltreating us . It was a common rumor that a premium - a furlough of thirty days - was offered for every prisoner shot by a sentinel while upon his post , and his positive orders were to shoot any one who encroached upon the dead-line in any manner . So well were the orders obeyed that hardly a day passed without some unlucky prisoner being shot at from a sentry-box , and I never saw or heard of the slightest fault being found with any sentinel for this shooting . Although many were being carried to the burial-ground each day , the prisoners increased very rapidly till the ist of July , when our number reached 35,000 , all crowded upon about twelve acres of land . That was the highest number reached ; and after July i the death rate equaled the recruits , the number being kept at about 35,000 by the frequent arrival of new prisoners in squads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been nearly doubled there was pretense of cooking the rations of corn-bread and bacon ; but before the ist of July they were issued to the majority of us raw-about one pint of coarse corn-meal and two ounces of bacon per man . This would have been preferred , only there were no adequate measures taken to supply us with fuel to cook it with . Loud and repeated complaints were made to the authorities , until they finally allowed small squads to go out each day , from two to four hundred in all , to carry in their arms the fuel to cook rations for thirty thousand men . If the rations could have been cooked in messes of hundreds or thousands , it is possible the fuel thus brought in might have been of some little use ; but there were no cooking utensils in the prison larger than quart cups and tin plates , and the cooking by messes was an utter impossibility . These squads would rarely bring in any more wood than they used individually , and if any passed from their hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of from twenty-five cents to one dollar per stick . The only way in which the great mass procured even the smallest amount of fuel was by hacking to pieces the stumps which were left within the stockade , generally using their case-knives for this purpose . In three weeks every vestige of a stump had disappeared ; then the roots were dug ; and ALLOTTING SQUAD RATIONS BY NUMBER . // within a very few weeks every foot of the ground inclosed by the stockade was cleaned of roots to the depth of six feet . In spite of all our complaints and begging , all our grubbing for roots , after exhausting all our ingenuity , thousands ate their corn-meal raw every day , and jt certainly was not strange that so many perished in Andersonville from diarrhea alone . Add to the raw , coarse corn-meal the warm , filthy water which the great mass were obliged to drink , and one of the causes of the fearful death rate in Andersonville is explained . About the middle of July the stockade was enlarged by an addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled our space , yet the fact was hardly noticed . It gave us for fuel the old section of stockade , which was rendered useless by being inclosed within the new , and ten acres more of stumps and roots , thus affording for three or four weeks some relief for the fuel famine . There was a sutler located within the stockade , whose establishment contained a little flour , soda , salt , cream of tartar , pepper , sweet potatoes , onions , etc . The whole contents of the store could have been swallowed , at any one time , by ten of our hungry men in an hour . He charged one dollar per pint for salt , one dollar per quart for flour , ten cents each for very small onions , forty cents per pound for sweet potatoes , four to ten dollars per pound for tobacco , and everything else in proportion . A lemon did occasionally find its way within our prison , but I never saw one sold . I saw a few very small Irish potatoes that sold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scurvy . Some time in July " cow peas " made their appearance , a vegetable that seemed to be a cross between a pea and a bean , and about the ist of August they commenced to issue rations of these beans to some of the prisoners . The beans took the place of the corn-bread and bacon , and were issued to some raw and to others cooked ; about half a pint of the raw being a day 's ration , and two-thirds of a pint of the cooked . About this time commenced the great mania for trade . One had two spoonfuls of pease which he would trade for half a ration of corn-bread ; another offered half his ration of raw pease for a small morsel of bacon to cook with his remaining half . For a short time after pease began to come in as rations those who received them could readily exchange them for a double ration of bread . Trade grew rapidly among us , and soon one-half our number were trying to better their own condition by trading with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , captured from Sherman 's and Thomas 's commands , were not robbed of their money and valuables , as were the Eastern troops , so there was considerable money floating within the prison among the privileged few ; but it was constantly changing ownership , and finally it all got into the hands of the very few , except the greater part that found its way outside by passing through the sutler 's shop . A few , by sharp trading , commencing with a dollar or two , were soon worth their hundreds . Little stands were erected in all parts of the prison , those who could not erect a stand using their knees , upon which they would display perhaps half a dozen sweet potatoes , a pint of salt , two or three pounds of flour , a quart of pease , etc. , all well covered with dust and flies . The only living things that seemed to thrive at this place were the flies , and they swarmed . Everything was covered with them , and they were responsible for the maggots that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOUTH HILLSIDE OF ANDEESONVILLE PRISON . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH. ) // " Main street , " as it was called , the driveway for the teams that brought in the rations , soon became the center of trade - our " exchange . " Hundreds crowded it from early morning till late evening with their rations of bread , pease , or bacon to exchange or sell for something they had not got ; and although tobacco was more plentiful than any other article in the Confederacy , it would take two days ' rations of food to buy enough tobacco to satisfy an ordinary chewer or smoker for a day . I have seen one of these tradesmen sit within the " exchange " wand cry out the good qualities and cheapness of less than half a pint of stewed pease for three longhours , and finally exchange the whole stock for three quids of tobacco ; though not exactly satisfied with his bargain , all his murmuring would cease upon getting a taste of the precious weed .

At the same time there was not food enough in the whole prison pen to give one-third of our number one meal in quantity , to say nothing of quality .

' T H. Mann , AL D. ( To he concluded. ) 1 In the official " Report on the Treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several reports of Confederate surgeons and inspectors to the Richmond authorities , on the condition of Union prisoners at Andersonville . It is impossible , on account of the horrible nature of the details , to quote generally from them . The following , which is the report of J. Crews Pelot , Assistant Surgeon , C. S. A. , for Sept. 5 , 1864 , inasmuch as it does not refer to the appearance and sufferings of the prisoners and to the worst features of their surroundings , may properly be quoted without omissions . It gives an idea of the destitution in the hospital , where it would be supposed special efforts would have been made to alleviate hunger and dis-tress : SIR : As officer of the day , for the past twenty-four hours , I have inspected the hospital , and found it in as good condition as the nature of the circumstances will allow . A majority of the bunks are still unsupplied with bedding , while in a portion of the division the tents are entirely destitute of either bunks , bedding , or straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . I would earnestly call attention to the article of diet . The corn-bread received from the bakery , being made up without sifting , is wholly unfit for the use of the sick ; and often ( in the last twenty-four hours ) upon examination , the inner portion is found to be perfectly raw . The meat ( beef ) received by the patients does not amount to over two ounces a day , and for the past three or four days no flour has been issued . The corn-bread can not be eaten by many , for to do so would be to increase the diseases of the bowels , from which a large majority are suffering , and it is therefore thrown away . All their rations re ceived by way of sustenance is two ounces of boiled beef and half pint of rice soup per day . Under these circumstances , all the skill that can be brought to bear upon their cases by the medical officer will avail nothing . Another point to which I feel it my duty to call your attention is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than indigenous barks and roots with which to treat the numerous forms of disease to which our attention is daily called . For the treatment of wounds , ulcers , etc. , we have literally nothing except water . Our wardssome of them - were filled with gangrene , and we are compelled to fold our arms and look quietly upon its ravages , not even having stimulants to support the system under its depressing influences , this article being so limited in supply that it can only be issued for cases under the knife . I would respectfully call your attention to the above facts , in the hope that something may be done to alleviate the sufferings of the sick .
