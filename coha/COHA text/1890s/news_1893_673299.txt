txt The exigencies of electioneering are as well understood . in Great ? Britain , doubtless , as they are anywhere else in the world . It is true Lord SALISBURY pretended to be very much shocked by them when the British Minister at Washington had to be withdrawn ; but that was only a manifestation of the political hypocrisy with which it is the British fashion to cover political " dodges . " It is manifest enough , after Panama and all the rest , that M. CARROT is much in need of a diversion which will prevent the French people from fixing their attention on M. CONSTANS , who has been systematically and successfully suppressed in the recent changes of administration . but who , nevertheless , by sheer force of character and of services , has impressed himself upon the sober part of the public as a valuable and desirable public servant . A 1 little cheap glory is the most obvious of political diversions for a Government that is in trouble at home ; and perhaps such a diversion can be effected with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be , an exemplary and condign treatment of Siamese " insolence , " as exemplified in the killing of an official Frenchman and of several Annamese in French uniform , through the demand for an enormous indemnity , would probably not have greatly affected Downing Street . But when the French demand the virtual destruction of Siam upon historical claims of which one set is quite new and the other ? set has been formally renounced . by the French themselves , the case becomes very different , and certainly it behooves Great Britain to take some steps to prevent the execution of such a threat against her own interests . In the first place , it appears that the British trade with Siam is to the French as thirty to one . In the second place , the interposition of Siam between the French possessions and British India is of the utmost importance to the British , and in view of the probable relations between France and Russia may become as important as the preservation of Afghanistan . Great Britain certainly can not afford to look on unconcernedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things are as well understood . at the British Foreign Office as they are anywhere else . The deliberation with which the Government has acted . by no means indicates that it is not alive to its own interests , nor that it does not mean to protect the same . As we have before pointed out , the relation of this question to British domestic politics is not less direct than its relation to French domestic politics . Nothing could be more injurious to the prospects of the Home Rule bill than a rumor of war between France and Great Britain , and it is eminently to be desired that nothing shall be done to inflame the British Jingo . But none the less the question of delimitation concerns Great Britain so nearly that she is bound to have a hand in the settlement of it and to see that it is not settled by France alone , as France proposes to settle it , in the manner of a highwayman with a pistol at the head of his victim .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
