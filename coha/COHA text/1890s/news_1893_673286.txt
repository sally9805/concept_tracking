txt Mr. CARLISLE is represented as saying at Chicago yesterday that " there has been too much talk concerning financial affairs already , " and that " no small part of our present difficulties might be traced to that . " Possibly . If we go back far enough it would be very easy to find " talk " in the House and in the Senate that has bad much to do with our present difficulties , and . which it would have been much better to omit . It is not improbable that there has been " talk " in Washington , and even in executive departments , that may have had a like unfortunate influence . If that is what Mr. CARLISLE referred to we heartily agree with him , though it is a matter of regret that it is too late to do anything about it . lf , however , Mr. CARLISLE referred to the constant and urgent discussion of financial affairs by men engaged in them and responsible for them . we venture to think that he spoke hastily , and perhaps not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " talk , " has been inevitable . It has , on the whole , also been-very rational and in good spirit , and we trust that it will be found to have exerted au enlightening influence upon the minds of the men whose duty it is , in Congress or in other places of responsibility . to shape the legislation that i s imperatively required . If that influence is not yet sufficient , every one who should have felt it may rest assured that it will become more strenuous and may be less safely-ignored or resisted as time goes on . We take the liberty , further , of pointing out to the Secretary of the Treasury that unless he has been misreported , he does not clearly understand the logical and necessary effect upon the public mind of the condition of the United States Treasury . He is reported as follows : " A while ago the whole country was watching the $100 , - 000,000 gold reserve . Now that that has been broken into every one seems to have forgotten it , and we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is not quite an accurate statement of fact , because the fluctuations of the gold reserve are very closely watched , indeed , by all who have any desire to keep informed of the conditions affecting the financial situation . But the " $100,000,000 gold reserve " is not discussed , because it does not exist . What is left is a reserve which for some time has been below that amount , and because it is below that amount its variations , within reasonable limits , are not so important If . however , the " $100,000,000 gold reserve " had been maintained intact , if it could have been made plain that it could and would . be so maintained , " our present difficulties " would either have been avoided or greatly lessened . That was impossible because of the operations of the silver-purchase law of 1890 , the evils of which Mr. CARLISLE has very clearly stated heretofore . It would be a very great error to imagine that the impairment of the reserve has been of no consequence . It was the one distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to understand , that the law of 1890 made the permanent retention of any reserve , and the permanent gold payments for which the reserve was held impossible .
