txt It is pretty well understood that the power of the Bell Telephone Company to preserve its monopoly of the exchange telephone business depends chiefly upon the final decision of the Courts in the suit in which the Government asks that the Berliner patent shall be annulled . We have already referred to the condition of the Edison transmitter patents and the questions that have arisen concerning the validity of them . In its review of the situation The Electrical World holds that these patents are " void because they were issued after the death of a foreign patent for the same invention , " relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Huber &; Nelson Manufacturing Company . It also believes the assumption may safely be made that the Blake transmitter patents are now void , for the reason that the foreign patent covering the same inventions expired a year ago . The Electrical World directs attention to a matter which seems to have been overlooked , to wit , that the Blake application of Jan. 3 , 1379 , has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful record in the Berliner case may be repeated with respect to this application . We take the following remarks from The Electrical World 's article : " Had the ordinary course been followed in the Patent Office in relation to the Berliner patent , the principle of telephony by means of variable contact resistance would also soon be public property . If by proper means this patent was retained in the Patent Office for fourteen years , this process practically prolonging the life of an absolute monopoly to that extent , a monstrous state of affairs is admitted , which , if it can not be otherwise remedied , would almost justify the entire abolition of the patent system . " It is true that the Government has now a suit to anuul this patent , but a recent statement as to its condition does not give much encouragement for a speedy decision . With the wide knowledge of the subject which the Attorney General should have from his former connection with the telephone interests , it would seem that more haste might be made , particularly as , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 will result in gross injustice to the public through a continuation of the munovoly . " After that has occurred regarding the Berliner patent , we may expect anything front the Patent Oitice , and it would not be a matter of any great surprise if the Blake , or some other telephone patent now withheld . were to develop into a second Berliner case . " These are the opinions of a very prominent journal devoted to the electrical industries . We began several years ago to point out the shameful delay in the Patent Office with respect to this Berliner application , and we have since seen all the authorities slowly coming to an agreement with us on this point . We took up the matter three or four years before the Berliner patent was issued . We have seen it issued , in accordance with our predictions , and the Government undertaking to blot it out , for the reasons which we had repeatedly set forth . But there has been no attempt to apply a remedy in the Patent Office , or to prevent such jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the conditions prevailing in the Patent Office which permit such things to be done there ? For years the interests of the people have required that a searching investigation should be made .
