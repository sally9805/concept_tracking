txt The Spanish decree published by the Gaceta as to the attitude of that Government regarding privateering , and the question whether or not coal shall be held contraband of war , was discussed by the State Department officials to-day . In response to questions , Judge William L. Penfield , the Solicitor of the department , made the following unofficial statement , which he said was not to be regarded as indicating in any way the action and policy of this Government , but was given for the Information of merchants and shippers . " This Government has not yet officially presented a list of articles which it Was ' treat as contraband of war . If Spain has taken any such action , it is not yet made public . Each Government Is competent to prescribe its own list for the guidance of its own authorities . Such list is conclusive upon the Govei nment making it and upon all neutral nations , in the absence of any disregard of treaty engagement and of international law . Any gross disregard of such law or treaty obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Until such a list is prescribed , the question whether articles captured are contraband of war will be governed generally by the law of nations , and specifically by the treaty stipulations between the belligerent captor and the neutral state to whose subject the articles belong .

Many articles . such as provisions , coal , Soc. , are of an equivocal character , and if destined for the enemy 's use , are deemed contraband . " It follows that If such lists should be prepared by the United States and Spain , they may be identical or may be widely divergent . depending on the policy of each Government . The action of each Government will bind only itself and its own prize courts and neutrals . The question whether contraband or not might therefore depend on whether the captor was American or Spanish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the goods shipped , but whether destined for American or Spanish ports , and whether the goods are included in the list denounced as contraband by the one or the other State . " This Government has already announced that it will not resort to privateering . In the light of this declaration Spain 's announcement that she will treat our privateers as pirates is worthy of Don Quixote . The Spanish Government has published its Intention to exercise the right of search . The right to do so is undoubted . But the right can be lawfully exercised only for the purpose of determining the nationality of the ship and its destination , whether its goods are neutral or enemy , whether contraband or not , and whether its conduct Is unneutral or neutral . " If Spain adopts the policy announced by this Government , that the neutral flag protects the goods , if the vessel and its conduct are neutral , only contraband goods in such ships are subject to capture .
