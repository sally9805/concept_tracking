txt THE Constitution of the United States provides that the House of Representatives " shall choose their Speaker and other officers , " and that " each house may determine the rules of its // 391 proceedings . " The powers and duties of the Speaker are not defined in the Constitution or in any statute , but are to be ascertained from the general practice of parliamentary bodies and from such rules as the House of Representatives may , from time to time , see proper to adopt . The framers of the Constitution were familiar with the law and practice of the British Honse of Commons , the great legislative assembly of their mother-country , and it is not unreasonable to suppose that when they provided for the election of a Speaker , they had in contemplation a presiding officer with substantially the same powers , duties , and responsibilities as had belonged for many centuries to the presiding officer in that body . While the right to enlarge or restrict these powers , duties , and responsibilities by its own rules was expressly conferred upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the authors of the Constitution intended , by this clause , to authorize the exercise of a power which would destroy or impair the free representative character of the body itself . Like all other powers delegated by the Constitution , the authority to make rules must be construed and exercised in harmony with the general spirit and plan of our republican institutions ; and therefore any rule which confers upon the Speaker arbitrary power and allows him , at his own will and pleasure , to deprive members of the right to make ordinary parliamentary motions and have them voted on by the House is an inexcusable surrender of the privileges of a free constituency , and a gross perversion of a power which was conferred for the very purpose of promoting and preserving the independence of the representative . Members of the House do not *act for themselves , either in making rules or passing laws ; they act for the people whom they represent , and whenever they put fetters upon their own limbs or stifle their own voices , they inflict a grievous injury upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and if it be true , as now claimed , that the popular branch of the legislative department has been authorized to confer such power upon any one man , no matter what his official title may be , it is clear that there is a defect in our system not heretofore detected by the most careful and intelligent observers . The Constitution begins with the declaration that " all legislative power herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which // shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . " The power to legislate necessarily includes the right to hear and determine all such motions and propositions as are incidental to the consideration of bills and resolutions and the transaction of other legislative business ; and this power , given expressly to the Senate and House of Representatives , can not be delegated by either of them . It must be exercised by the members chosen by the people and the States to speak and act for them . If they can rightfully delegate to their presiding officers the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of legislative proceedings , it is difficult to see why they can not also confer upon those officers the power to decide in the same way upon the merits of all bills proposed . There is certainly nothing in the mere name or title of the presiding officer to qualify him for the constitutional exercise of such a power , and it could as well be conferred upon the clerk , or the sergeant-at .. arms , or the doorkeeper . From time immemorial the Speaker of the House of Commons has been , in theory and in fact , simply the servant of the body over which he presides , and the freemen of England would no more consent to see him control its proceedings by arbitrarily refusing to entertain motions or put questions than they would consent to see the Crown itself usurp the functions of the legislature . A standard American writer on parliamentary law says : " Thepresidingofficer , though entitled on alloccasions to be treated with the greatestattention and respect by the individual members , because the power , and dignity , and honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet but the servantof the House . todeclare its will and to obey implicitly all its commands . " It is the duty of the Speaker to obey the commands of the House , ' but the House can give no commands if he refuses to put the question on motions made by members . The only way in which the House can express its will is by a vote , and it can not vote unless its presiding officer entertains motions and gives it an oppor* tunity to consider and act upon them . The only justification that has been offered for the revolution that has been made in the practice of the House of Representatives , and for the extraordinary powers conferred upon the Speaker , is that certain motions and proceedings heretofore allowed have been misused for the purpose of obstructing or delaying legislation . This is true to a certain extent , and if a proper remedy for // this evil had been proposed ,  --  a remedy consistent with the Constitiftion and the freedom of parliamentary proceedings ,  --  there would have been little , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no necessity for such radical changes as have been made , and nothing but the most imperative necessity could furnish an excuse for them . It appears to be popularly supposed that the old rules afforded greater opportunities for obstructive proceedings than were afforded by the rules of legislative bodies generally ; but , in fact , such was not the case . In the British House of Commons the opportunities are now , and always have been , much greater than they ever were in our House of Representatives , and while much inconvenience has frequently resulted on account of dilatory proceedings in the CoLnmons , no English statesman has ever ventured to propose such radical and oppressive regulations as have just been adopted here . In our House , in addition to the usual parliamentary motions which are allowed in the Commons , we have always had the previous question ( which cuts off debate ) , and for a long time there has been a rule limiting speeches to one hour each . In the House of Commons there is no previous question , and no order limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1882 , the only limitation upon debate was an order made in 1604 that , " if any man speak impertinently , or beside the question in hand , it stands with the orders of the House for Mr. Speaker to interrupt him ; and to have the pleasure of the House whether they will further hear him . " But this was found insufficient to restrain members and prevent them from consuming the time of the House uselessly in discussing irrelevant questions and repeating the same arguments over and over ; and , consequently , on the 27th of November , 1882 , the following order was made " The Speaker , or the chairman of Ways and Means , may call the attention of the House , or of the committee , to continued irrelevance or tedious repetition on the part of a member and may direct thememl ? er to discontinue his speech . " This does not stop debate , but only compels the offending member to cease speaking out of order , and it is less restrictive than the rule which has for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every member , when speaking , to confine himself to the question under debate , and it is not necessary to wait until he has been guilty of " continued irrelevance , " but he may be called to order by the Speaker or any // other member , and compelled to suspend , on the instant that he departs from the subject under consideration . In England the Speaker can not refuse to entertain any motion unless it is actually out of order when made , but by one of the rules adopted in November , 1882 , it is provided that , " if the Speaker , or the chairman of a committee of the whole House . shall be of the opinion that a motion for the adjournment of a debate , or of the House , during any debate , or that the chairman do report progress , or do leave the chair , is an abuse of the rules of the House , he may forthwith put the question thereupon from the chair . " It will be seen that under this rule the Speaker or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may know it to be made for dilatory purposes , but he may prevent the consumption of time in debate upon it by putting the question at once ; and this applies only to motions to adjourn or that the committee rise , which are debatable there , though not so in the House of Representatives . Here the Speaker or chairman always puts the question at once , and not even an amendment is allowed . The nearest approach to the previous question in the House of Commons is the proceeding provided for in one of the standing orders made , after long debate , in 1882 . Under that order , when it appears to the Speaker , or to the chairman of Ways and Means in a committee of the whole House , that the subject under consideration has been " adequately discussed , " and that it " is the evident sense of the House , or the committee , that the question be now put , " he may so inform the House or committee ; and thereupon , if a motion be made and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote is immediately taken upon the main proposition without further debate . But this motion can not be agreed to unless it is supported by more than two hundred members , or unless it is opposed by less than forty members and supported by more than one hundred . In the House of Representatives the previous question may be ordered , not only before the subject under consideration has been " adequately discussed , " but before it has been discussed at all , in which case forty minutes only are allowed for debate . The order of the Commons authorizing the suspension , or partial suspension , of a member for the offence of " disregarding the authority of the chair , or of abusing the rules of the House by persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of the House , or otherwise , " is not more severe than the old rule of the House // of Representatives , which has been readopted , and by no means as severe as our constitutional provision which authorizes the actual expulsion of a member . The rules and orders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest a series of obstructive proceedings which had already produced the most alarming results , and which , if persisted in , threatened the peace of the empire ; and they are mentioned here for two purposes : one is to show that , notwithstanding these rules and orders , which by many were considered harsh and unreasonable , the opportunities for obstruction and delay are still greater in the Commons than they ever were in our House of Representatives ; and the other is to show that , even in the presence of so grave a crisis as then existed , it was not deemed consistent with the rights of individual members , or the freedom of the body collectively , to confer upon the Speaker such extraordinary authority as is now vested in the Speaker of the House of Representatives by the new rules just adopted here . These new rules go far beyond all precedent here or elsewhere , and confer upon the Speaker the absolute power to refuse to entertain any motion whatever if he chooses to consider it dilatory , although the motion itself may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which he is acting . For instance , when a motion is under debate , the following motions are expressly provided for : to adj ourn , to lay on the table , for the previous question , to postpone to a day certain , to refer , to amend , and to postpone indefinitely . These motions are always in order when any matter of legislation is under consideration , and yet by the new clause-inserted , it is understood , at the instance of the Speaker himself-he is authorized to refuse to entertain all or any one of them upon the ground that in his opinion it is made for the purpose of delay ; and there is no appeal to the House from his decision unless he may see proper to permit it , because he can hold that the appeal itself is a dilatory proceeding . One of the rules which has *xisted ever since Congress was organized provides that the Speaker shall " decide all questions of order , subject to an appeal by any member " ; but that officer is now clothed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make his own will the law of the House . No such power was ever before conferred upon a presiding officer in a deliberative body , and it is safe to say that the House of // Representatives of the United States is the only legislative assembly in the civilized world that would consent to part , even temporarily , with the right to construe its own rules of proceeding and protect itself against improper decisions affecting the rights of its members . " The ultimate authority upon all points is the House itself , " says Sir Thomas Erskine May , in his great work on the " Law , Privileges , Proceedings , and Usage of Parliament " but this is no longer true of our House of Representatives . This power , which is inherent in every free representative body , has been deliberately surrendered . That the House distinctly understood what it was doing is clearly shown by the fact that , during the consideration of the new rules , it rejected a proposed amendment that " the Speaker shall not , in any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This amendment was rejected by a strict party vote , every Democrat present voting for it and every Republican present voting against it . The Constitution provides that a majority of each House " shall constitute a quorum to do business , " and for more than a hundred years it has been uniformly held , whenever the question arose , that this required not merely that a majority should be present , but that such a majority must actually participate in the transaction of business , and that , when the yeas and nays are taken and entered upon the journal , that official record is the conclusive and exclusive evidence as to the number present and acting . During the present session of Congress , before rules had been adopted , and therefore before the House had conferred ugon the Speaker any authority over the journal , he held that when the yeas and nays were taken , and less than a quorum voted , he had a right to count members present and not voting , cause their names to be entered upon the journal , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do business " in the House . Now the new rules contain a clause authorizing the Speaker to direct the clerk to note the names of members who are present and not voting , sufficie** to make a quorum , and record them in the journal to be counted and announced in determining the result . The right of the House to authorize the Speaker to direct the clerk to enter the names of members on the journal is not disputed ; but the constitutional effect of such a proceeding is quite a different question . This is not the place to discuss the consti // tutional question ; but the practical effect of the rule , for the time being , will be that in a House consisting , when full , of 330 members , of whom 166 constitute a quorum , the Speaker may declare the most important bills passed when the record shows that they were voted for by one member only , if there are enough others present to make a quorum . Unless all previous presiding officers were wrong , this is a flagrant violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is certainly a most dangerous innovation upon the settled practice of the House , and , instead of being a reform , it is a movement in the direction of loose , unjust , and improvident legislation . The tendency in recent times is to require , by express constitutional provision , the affirmative vote of a majority of all the members elected to legislative assemblies in order to pass bills , and to make it imperative in every case that the yeas and nays shall be taken and entered upon the journal . In some of the States this provision applies only to bills appropriating money , or creating public liabilities , or imposing taxes , while in others it applies to all matters of legislation ; but to whatever extent it goes , it indicates clearly a growing disposition among the people to be more careful in the delegation of power to their representatives and to require the vote of actual majorities to enact laws . It is true that the power now conferred upon the Speaker has been exercised in some of the State legislatures in times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dispassionate judgment of the thoughtful and conservative people of the country condemns it , and no constitutional convention has ventured to declare in terms that a minOrity could pass laws even though the majority were absent or silent . Not only is the power of the Speaker increased by the changes in the rules already referred to , but in many other ways the con*trol of business is taken from the House and placed in his hands . Heretofore all public bills have been introduced in open session , and referred to their appropriate committees , their tites having been first read in order that every member might know to what subjects they related . The Speaker usually directed the reference , but always in the presence of the House , and if any member doubted the propriety of an order of reference indicated by him , sneY* member had the right to move to refer the bill to some other committee , and have it read in full , so that a vote // could be intelligently taken on his motion . All reports from committees were likewise made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and members had the same right to move to refer them to either of the calendars , and thus have the House decide where they should go for consideration . Under the old rules , also , it was the duty of the Speaker to lay before the House , for reference , all messages from the President , reports and communications from the heads of departments , and other communications addressed to the House , and such bills , resolutions , and other messages as had been received from the Senate . Now all this is changed . Under the new rules , bills must be handed to the Speaker to be by him referred to committees , and reports from committees are to be delivered to the clerk and referred to the calendars by him under the direction of the Speaker . All official communications from the heads of executive departments , except messages from the President , and all other communications addressed to the House , together with bills and resolutions , etc. , from the Senate , may now be referred to committees by the Speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being laid before the House , as heretofore . Under these rules , public bills and official communications from the heads of departments may be delivered to the Speaker , and reports of committees may be delivered to the clerk , at their private rooms or on the street , whether the House is in session or not ; but even if they are delivered in the hall while the House is sitting , no member cau know what bills have been introduced , or what reports have been made , or how they have been referred , until he hears the journal read or sees the official Record on some future day . This , besides being a loose and unsatisfactory method of transacting public business in a great legislative body , confers upon the Speaker an important power which has always heretofore been exercised by the House itself-that is , the power to determine in the first instance to what committees bills and official communications shall be referred , and on what calendars reports shall be placed for consideration . For a long time it has been held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill was privileged and could be made by any member at any time ; but under the new system , if the Speaker , by mistake or design , sends a bill to the wrong committee , the correction can not be made except by unanimous consent , or on the motion of a com // mittee claiming jurisdiction , or on the report of the committee to which it was erroneously referred . The privilege of the member is now taken away , and if he can not secure unanimous consent to send his bill where it really ought to have gone in the first instance , under the rules he must appeal to a committee for relief from the erroneous action of the Speaker . The adoption of the new rules is in many respects a long step in exactly the wrong direction . This is especially the case so far as they relate to the powers of the Speaker . Reform should have commenced by curtailing , instead of extending , the authority of that officer , and the control of the House itself over its own proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented unreasonable and factious obstruction and delay , but at the same time given ample opportunity for deliberate consideration and action . Under any system of rules that can be devised , the presiding officer in a body so numerous as the House of Representatives will necessarily have more power than ought to be intrusted to any man in this country ; and no matter how just and impartial he may be , there will be occasions when he can not escape the imputation , at least , of unfair and arbitrary action . In the conflict of opposing interests and opinions , he is often compelled to decide important questions without proper time for consideration ; and , even if he is guilty of no intentional abuse of his great authority , he may do an actual injustice which can not afterwards be repaired . The simple power to decide what member shall be recognized to speak or make a motion when more than one rises , appears to be necessary in order to prevent constant struggles and confusion on the floor , and yet it is a power which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up , and is therefore inconsistent with the absolute freedom and equality of members . When such results may follow the exercise of a power so simple and necessary as this , it is not strange that the advocates of equal rights in the House should look with some degree of alarm upon every proposition to confer additional authority upon its presiding officer.
