txt Gen. John 0 . New , United States Consul General at London , who arrived on the City of Chi ? cage on Saturday , spent a very quiet Sunday at the Gilsey House . The only person of any note who called upon him was Cornelius N. Bliss , and the two only talked together for fifteen minutes . Mr. New was asked by a TIMES reporter if he had seen Mr. Clarkson . " No , " he replied with an injured air , " I have not seen Clarkson . If Mr. Clarkson desires to see me , he knows where I am registered . I do n't think It is my place to go and see He is a very good friend of mine , however , ring his over-enthusiasm for Mr. Blaine . " " Is that a drawback 1 " was inquired . " Well , no  --  not personally , " replied Mr. New , " but politically it is . I do n't see where there is any warrant for enthusiasm for any Republican Presidential candidate except Harrison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes enemies . He has refused to allow himself to be used , and for that reason he is called ' cold , " clammy , ' and all that sort of thing . That 's unjust , I think . " Of course he is not so magnetic a man . aS Mr. Blaine , but he has made a good President , has n't he ' ? Well , then , I think all talk of Blaine should cease . I take it for granted that Blaine will not run and that Harrison will be the nominee . " " How about a compromise candidate ? " " Well , " replied Mr. New , " I have heard a good deal of talk since I 've been here about the conference in which Alger was selected , but I do n't take any stook in it . Alger is all right in some respects , but not in respect of being Prost dent . Nor do I place any faith in the success of the craze , which , though confined to the Western States , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 's issue , however , will be the para . mount issue of the campaign . He is not himsell , strong enough to bear the Darden of the issue , but Mr. Harrison , under whose Administration he issue became a fact , is sufficiently strong . " All of these compromise candidates are all right in their own seotions , but the issues of the campaign are to be national in their character , and local men ca n't uphold them throughout the country . We 've got to have national men to carry national issues . " I do n't think there is much significance in the considerable number of uninstructed delegates to the Republican Convention . It simply shows , in my opinion , that , owing to the jug ? glery for place in the race , the Republican leaders throughout the country are becoming cautions . " For instance , if all the candidates were instructed for Harrison , a very decided effeol might be produced upon the naming of a candidate by the Democrats . Bat it does not make a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is Republican year . " I think , however , that we should have more difficulty in defeating Mr. Cleveland than any other Democratic candidate . As the thing appears to a man who looks at it from the other side of the ocean , it appears to me that the Hill boom was born dead . Hill , of course , has lots 01 friends in New-York , but in my estimation hii strongest friends here are men who , for a chant to gain office , would throw him over veil quickly . " From what I have heard since yesterday . it appears that Hill 's friends are engaged eves now in feeling around for a better spot upon which to debark . " I do n't like to help the enemy , but I think it would be a humorous freak for the Denim:matt to put up a man like HilL The thing for tin enemy to do is to put an Eastern man of a fa i better stripe at the head of the ticket , and tail out with a western man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . Gray . " " Would he take the tail end 1 " " Did you ever know Gray to refuse any thing ' 1 " " Will free coinage form an issue of the can ? paign 1 " " No , it is yet too early for that . I was positively amused to read , shortly before I left England , that Senator Teller had threatened to withdraw the Electoral votes of the silver-producing States in ease an anti-free-coinage candidate was put up by the party . It sounds to me like a rotten borough threatening a nation . " Do you know , " continued Mr. New , " that ' Ben ' Harrison is a great man ? Well . a great man can afford to lose a whole lot of States that have a mania for local issues . Why not have free coinage 01 wool or free coinage of tobacco They are products and so is silver . " o , it 's not a question of free silver or any of those small-fry affairs , but the whole political question , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick out a man that can lick the Democratic Party , both men running on their merits - Well , I guess so . " One of the chief merits of the Democracy , according to themselves , has been their economical habits . But I think by the time both crowds get together and compare notes , it will be found that the present Congress will have pretty nearly equaled the ' Billion Congress , ' which was expected to be such great capital for the Democrats this year , and , if I am not mistaken , the thing has been nicely managed by the minority . " ? ? Supposing Mr. Harrison is put at the head of the Republican ticket , and Mr. Gray at the end of the Democratic ticket , what would De the probable result in Indiana ? " " Well , " replied the General , " it would probably cause more broken heads , more sudden deaths , and more white-cap outrages throughout Indiana than the Mollie Maguires ' uprisings did in Pennsylvania . It would be an awful thing to contemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more even distribution of political sentiment than in any other State in the Union . It seems as though almost every town and hamlet is divided ? politically . Then there 's iust enough lime in the soil to put bone in the men who vote . " With the Republicans of Indiana Harrison is a big name , because he comes from the cabin . With the Democrats Gray is worshipped because he is one of the gang . Consider the result of pitting the two.against each other ! " " What of the international silver conference 7 " " There 's a subject in which I have a pro ? found interest . I do n't think it is generally known on this side that the silver spirit has overspread England , though in an entirely different way . Over there they would like nothing better than to have this country pander to the silver States and make absolute free coinage , because they know that they would inevitably get our gold . But the English financiers have got too much respeot for the lawmakers of the States to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are anxious for the consummation of the international conference , for they believe , and I believe , that such a conference , in the hands of judicious men , would result in the adoption of a scheme whereby the parity of gold and silver would be established on a basis that would be enormously advantageous to both countries . " I do not know definitely myself of any plan whereby this end could be accomplished , but a body of intelligent men from both countries could solve the question . It is a fact that many of the leading financiers of England , whose interests are largely dependent upon the relative standing of the metals , are desirous that this conference should be held .
