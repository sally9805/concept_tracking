Place : Dublin Castle ; the state drawing-room . Main text The curtain , rising , discovers Lady Wyndham Lady Wyndham " The Marquis de la Valiere . " Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere ( Entering and bowing . ) Madame , your ladyship 's most humbly obedient . Your ladyship , it fears me , I am arrived  --  Je vous prie milles pardons  --  early , un peu . But one has informed me that this was the hour  --  Lady W. Lady Wyndham You are most welcome and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Merci , Madame , and your  --  your ladyship 's daughter  --  Lady W. Lady Wyndham Not my daughter , nor my anything , thank Heaven ! That wilful girl , who is my brother 's ward ! Lady Eileen will be with us in a moment . And this is for her ? Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere ( Who has been obsequiously proffering a small , silver-bound box . ) For Mademoiselle Eileen , Madame , with birthday gratulations . They are mere nothings , mere diamonds ; they can not speak my admirations ; but if your ladyship shall add one look to brighten them !  --  Ah , speak well for me to the young lady un seul mot , I  --  Pardieu ! Madame , I die in English , but I will live most gratefully in French ! Lady W. Lady Wyndham I should be too glad to speak in your behalf , if it were possible . But Lud ! Marquis , such a girl ! Like a firefly on the breeze , now a sparkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a fancy caught in the flesh . And fancy that nothing would do , but she must settle this most serious , most momentous question of the giving of her hand , on her birthday ; and she must give out that fate may decide it , according to the gifts her suitors bring  --  the romantic minx  --  and of those suitors you are but one , Marquis . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere But the worth of the giver  --  Mademoiselle , sans doute , you think  --  she will possibly consider that ? Lady W. Lady Wyndham Perhaps , yes ; but only as indicated by the worth of the gift . And her standards of worth  --  I warn you her standards are fantastic standards of her own foolish making ! Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere ( Sighing with relief . ) Ah ! for a moment let my hopes be bright as my diamonds ! And this decision  --  ? Lady W. Lady Wyndham Will be made within the hour ; the chit promises it ! And as it still lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to my brother 's library , where the presents are to be laid for the judging ? Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere I attend your Ladyship . Lord Cornwallis is most hospitable  --  most hospitable ! ( Exit Lady W. ) But  --  she is an Irish barbarian , this girl ! Down what roads must a gentleman travel  --  Pardieu !  --  when he seeks a fortune ! ( Exit . ) ( Enter , from door back , or right , the footman , who opens his mouth to make announcement , but is shoved aside by Sir Richard Wilde , who enters talking with Col. Morton . ) Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde You met her at London , eh ? Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Yes , when she was at school there , before this damnable rebellion broke out . I 've been here now two months under Cornwallis , since his Majesty appointed him Commander-in-Chief and Viceroy of Ireland ; it seems two centuries that I 've heard nothing but the brogue of " Blood ! " in my ears , yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're as mad as the French jackals that bark about the guillotine at Paris . But she  --  ah , Dick ! She  --  Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde Has been a Venus in thy midnight , a Beatrice in thy Inferno , an angel in thy Job 's torments , eh , man ?  --  eh ? Egad , Humphrey , thou art strong with the Romeo aroma . Great stuff , boy , but stuff to keep corked for the ladies . It 's more precious to them than attar of roses , I can tell you ! Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Look you , Dick  --  Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde Gad 's life ! and it seems only yesterday we were at fisticuffs at Eton , you and I , about the grocer 's daughter ; and now to think we are at sword 's points in an Irish castle , about the heiress of a hundred thousand . Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Damn the heiress , it 's the girl ! I tell you , she 's perfection . Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . You want the girl , I want the heiress . Well , let each have his desire . Brief and plain , Hump , my card bill has run high , and my seat in Parliament is likely to become a bench in jail , with a bailiff for a valet . So in this little contest for the hand of Mistress Fitzgerald , I 'll bet two to one on you  --  and call it five thousand pounds . Then if you win , you 'll have the girl and the lion 's share of the coin ; if I win , why , you 'll have some of the spoil , and , for a consideration , I think we could arrange about the girl . Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Damnation , Man ! Do you take me for a rake-hell like yourself ? ( Crosses in anger . Wilde lightly laughs , and takes snuff . After a slight pause  --  ) Well , and what chance have you , anyway , Dick ? Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde The girl is just eighteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cards , and they trump credulity and romance . Why , what do you think this is ? ( Shows a small box . ) Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Your bid , in this wooing bout ? Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde Ay ! and what , think you , is in it ? Rubies and ivory ? Folly ! I am playing Bassanio to my little Lady Portia . So in this casket , lo ! for sixpence , I bring  --  forget-me-nots , ' fore Gad , forget-me-nots ! ( The doors are thrown open . ) Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Hist ! Here comes his lordship . Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde Cornwallis ? Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Cornwallis . ( Enter Cornwallis and Valiere . ) Cornwallis . Cornwallis I hear they keep it so hot in Paris , Marquis , that all the town has the rabies . By the way , is it catching , that madness ? Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Indeed , I have not been bit , my lord . All the gentlemen have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bourgeoisie . Cornwallis . Cornwa llis What ! does not Monsieur le Raoul de la Valiere find his name his fortress ? Ah , Colonel , welcome to you ! So you are in these lists ? Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Entering them , my lord , in hope to be a guardian to your ward . Permit me to present you to an old friend and new rival of mine . Your lordship  --  Sir Richard Wilde . Cornwallis . Cornwallis You are very welcome , sir . I had the good fortune to know your father at the misfortune in America . He helped me jump rope with Washington in New Jersey . He was well-named and daring . Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde Egad , sir , his son is more so , to take a tilt in this tourney for Mistress Fitzgerald . ( Looking at Valiere . ) But I fear the odds are against us , Dick . The barber 's should have been our armoury ! Cornwallis . Cornwallis Your pardon , Marquis ; Sir Richard Wilde  --  the Marquis de la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you , Sir . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Your most obedient , monsieur . Ah , Monsieur le Colonel . ( Dick and Volire talk aside . Morton offers Cornwallis snuff . ) Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton ( Stiffly . ) We have met . ( To Cornwallis . ) Does your lordship consider the rebellion at an end ? Cornwallis . Cornwallis If hoping were believing , yes . The majority of the state prisoners have already offered to acknowledge their offences ; but the Irish parliament cries for Irish heads . Yet I think they blink , after all , the real mischief :  --  the deep-laid conspiracy to revolutionize Ireland on the principles of France . Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton The very point , my lord . Even now report says that the French are preparing two secret expeditions for the invasion of this country . Cornwallis . Cornwallis And that 's a secret bugled by the winds . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Ah , mais , Messieurs , those be French footmen , not French gentlemen . Cornwallis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their masters , who foot it across the seas ! But , my friends , I pray you have done with politics ; this is a time to settle gentler affairs , and at this moment there is more at stake than empty empires . Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde ( Aside to Morton . ) Now the old boy talks . Cornwallis . Cor nwallis The question pends  --  what gentleman in this room shall sway the heart of a lady ; and gentlemen , nothing  --  not even swords ' points  --  may avail in this contest ; only the decision of my dear ward 's lips . Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde ( To Morton . ) Gad , one would think his lordship included himself under " gentlemen . " ( Here Eileen starts to run in , but catching sight of the suitors , scurries back and peeps in from the edge of scene . ) Cornwallis . Cornwa his So we must have patience until the lady arrives . It can not be long ; for this is the appointed time . And Mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Probablement she is still dressing , my lord . The ladies are more careful of their beauties ; they are always different from the men . Cornwallis . Cornwallis God save us then , Marquis ; what Amazons your French ladies must be ! But , gentlemen , while we wait , permit that I show you where to lay your gifts . By this way is to the gallery . After you , Sir . Wilde . Sir Richard Wilde Amazingly fine lodgings , these , your lordship . ( Just as the last has passed through the door , and Cornwallis is about to follow , Eileen trips stealthily across the room , trying to call Cornwallis ' attention by whispering loudly  --  " My lord !  --  My lord ! " Failing , she runs and pulls him by the sleeve , just as he is slowly passing through the doorway . ) Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald My lord ! My lord ! Cornwallis . Cornwallis You , Eileen ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald What a shocking narrow escape ! Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cry . A French muff , a London walking stick , and a big British army-gun  --  all in pursuit of one poor maid ! Dear , my lord , what shall I do ? Cornwallis . Cornwallis I will return at once , and we will talk of this and much else ! But first I must usher these articles you mention where they may leave your gifts . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald The gifts  --  ay , to be sure ! Have they brought many ? Are they vastly fine ? Ah , my lord , is it permitted to me to take the gifts , and leave the gentlemen ? ( Enter Right , Lady Wyndham , hurriedly . ) Lady W. Lady Wyndham Eileen ! And so I 've tracked you at last , Maid Runaway ! Cornwallis . Cornwallis I will return within the moment . You will wait for me ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald In this room , my lord ; and wholly on your pleasure . ( Exit Cornwallis  --  Ladies curtsy . ) Lady W. Lady Wyndham ( Eyeing Eileen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen Fitzgerald ( Innocently . ) Well ? Lady W. Lady Wyndham And where have you been , Mistress Dalliance ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Up in the tower . Lady W. Lady Wyndham ( Throwing up her hands . ) The tower ! I 'll warrant me thou art a miracle of dust ! Lud , child ! Do you forget this is your birthday ? Do you forget that this very hour you have to decide the question of all your life  --  the question of your husband ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Well , for what was I up in the tower but to catch the earliest glimpse of them ? Lady W. Lady Wyndham Of whom ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Of my husbands , to be sure . Lady W. Lady Wyndham Madcap ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald I 've been watching hours for their arrival . ( Laughing merrily . ) Such wooers ! For all the world , they came like the procession in the fairy tale , that dangled after the golden goose . But they shall find me of another feather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , then , I wo n't tell them I 'm no goose ! How many are there ? Lady W. Lady Wyndham Why , there 's Monsieur de la Valiere , a gentleman of the highest manners  --  Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald De la Valiere ! He 's a fortune for a lady 's wig-maker , not a lady 's self ! But how many other guests are there for the dinner ? Is  --  I pray you  --  is Mr. O'Moirne arrived yet ? Lady W. Lady Wyndham Is who arrived ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald I said Desmond O'Moirne . Lady W. Lady Wyndham And what man is he ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald The manliest in Ireland . Lady W. Lady Wyndham Desmond O'Moirne  --  Preserve us ! Eileen , you never mean that singer in the opera  --  that hothead lad  --  that Irish rebel , whose father was hanged  --  ay , hanged in this very city  --  for high treason . Girl ! You have never been so mad as to bid such a guest to Dublin Castle ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there will sit at my birthday dinner no nobler guest than the lad with the voice in his heart and the heart in his voice  --  his sole leaving of a ruined fortune  --  and who with his voice brought Dublin to his feet , till the English murdered  --  ay , murdered his father , I say , and sent him over sea . But I have Desmond O'Moirne 's promise for my birthday night ; and Ireland knows what an O'Moirne means by a promise ! He  --  Lady W. Lady Wyndham Promised you ? O Lud ! Lud ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald We spoke of my birthday ; that birthday that was to bring my birthright . And he pledged me for that birthday the gift of a song ; and he will be here to sing it ! Lady W. Lady Wyndham Are you daft , child ? Why , the man 's an exile ; he 's in England . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald But he will come . Lady W. Lady Wyndham Travel a hundred miles and risk his neck for a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady W. Lady Wyndham Heavenly goodness ! but he must not ! You hear ! He must not ! What ! He sing for your birthday dinner ?  --  He ,  --  a beggar , an Irish beggar , his estates confiscated , he  --  you 're mad , child ! You 're mad ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald But he shall come . Lady W. Lady Wyndham O Heaven 's patience ! But he is not come ! and I believe you are frightening me to exasperation only for your wicked sport ! May God be thanked I am not a man with a hankering to be your husband ! He has not come !  --  And I 'll make his welcome sure , should he come ! ( Exit . ) Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald But he will come ! And the gift he brings shall be my gift , though my heart is the price that buys it ! ( Enter Cornwallis . ) Cornwallis . Cornwallis My thanks that you waited me  --  and alone ! I have been impatient to speak with you all day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lord ! Cornwallis . Cornwallis " My lord ? " Why must to the heavy burden of my state be added that word from your lips , Eileen ? Will you not call me  --  something else ? A thousand to whose ears I give commands have tongues that lisp " your lordship . " Where I would take commands , it is for me to say " my lady . " Then , my little Lady Eileen , will you not be she to fill an empty title ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald ( Evidently a bit startled at his manner . ) Ah , my  --  Sir , I 'll wager you could tutor those younger gentlemen in pretty speech . Ah , would you could ! Their compliments but woo to drowsiness ! Cornwallis . Cornwal lis I would that all my white hairs were but in my wig , as theirs are . Think you , you could like me better then , Eileen ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Faith , not I , my lord  --  I mean , I mean , dear guardian ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornwallis . Cornwallis My girl , there 's something in a soldier 's life that never lets youth 's fire go out . Powder and the flash of swords , the jostle of life and death , the fording of streams and ocean wanderings , and all that makes the rough romance of war  --  these things blow off the settling ashes from the living ember , and leave still a heart-leap at three-score . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald I am sure of it . There 's no calling so glorious as a soldier 's , unless  --  unless  --  Cornwallis . Cornwallis Unless ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Unless  --  maybe  --  a singer 's ! Cornwallis . Cornwallis A singer 's , child ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Ay , Sir , a singer 's ! For a singer may wake the fiery call to battle in a thousand hearts , and make a thousand soldiers ! Cornwallis . Cor nwallis When was a singer ever a soldier ? But , child , I did not ask this hour to talk of soldiers ; Eileen , hare you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a child ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Aye , indeed , dear guardian , I remember her ; a lovely lady . Cornwallis . Cornwallis A lovely lady ! I met her at your age ; she was much as you are ; you are like her : so like her that  --  ( Eileen turns away . ) Nay , child , do I weary you ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Believe me , no , my lord ; I but remembered how swift the hour was passing . Cornwallis . Cornwallis Before it passes , Eileen , will you not ask me what I bring you as a birthday gift ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Ah , Sir ! I can not fancy what there is left in your generosity for you to give me . Cornwallis . Cornwallis Yet without the gift I bring , how incomplete were any woman 's joy ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Riddles , my lord ! What is this gift ? Cornwallis . Cornwallis What every woman desires most in this world . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald And what is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give you for your birthday gift , Eileen , the promise of a soldier to grant to you this day , whatever you may ask of my power ; and this day it is my good fortune to command all temporal things in Ireland . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald ( Kisses his hand . ) Ah ! Thanks , my lord  --  a thousand , thousand thanks ! You have brought a far more splendid gift to my birthday than any of the three who call themselves my suitors . Cornwallis . Cornwallis Three suitors ? Eileen , what if there were four ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Four ! Has another ,  --  is any new guest come ? Cornwallis . Cornwallis A new suitor , so I am told . And he has already presented his gift , Eileen . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald You have seen him ? Ah , who is he , dear my lord ? Cornwallis . Cornwallis One whom you know nearly , and he hopes dearly . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald And you say he is here now ?  --  here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornwallis He is , from England . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Ah , where is he ? My lord , where is he ? Cornwallis . Cornwallis He has fears . He is not as your other suitors , in aspect or in nature . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Ah ! that he is not , indeed ! A thousand times more noble ! Cornwallis . Cornwallis Great Heaven ! You say that , child ? Dear child  --  Eileen  --  then you have guessed  --  his name ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Ah , Sir , it is  --  it is  --  Cornwallis . Cornwallis Your loving servant  --  Charles Cornwallis . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald My lord ! Cornwallis . Cor nwallis A time-scarred soldier , Eileen  --  Charles Cornwallis . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald O my lord ! My lord ! ( Covers her face with her hands . ) Cornwallis . Co rnwallis She did not guess his name  --  ' Sdeath ! I 'm old  --  I 'm old  --  and foolisher than old ! Poor child ! Poor little girl ! Eileen , that word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down the wind ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald O my lord  --  I never dreamed  --  I never dreamed  --  I who have ever honored and loved you as your child ! Cornwallis . Cornwallis Child of my heart forever ! It was I who dreamed ! Ah , child , the sweet spring fire of youth is in your eyes ; and there must have been just a bit of rubbish in my old breast that caught and burned one foolish instant . But it has blazed away and it has gone out forever ! There , there , lass ! That very old fool , your guardian , is a soldier again ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Ah , my dear , dear lord , you will have from me all the heart of a daughter now and always . That is better  --  ah , is it not better ? Cornwallis . Cornwallis Much better , child  --  for you ! Yes  --  go , child , go ! In a moment they will summon us to dinner . ( Kisses her forehead . ) And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my power 's limit ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald My whole heart 's gratitude to you , my lord  --  for all ! For all ! ( Exit . ) Cornwallis . Cornwallis That I should have yearned for her  --  impossible ! But to have hoped  --  worse ; worse ! But to have spoken  --  that was most utter madness of it all ! Ah , when , when will December learn that the width of the year stands betwixt him and May ! When will he learn that December must pass to give May room ! ( Exit Cornwallis . ) ( Enter the servant , showing in O'Moirne , who is travel-stained and tired . He comes in looking about him wistfully . ) Servant . Serva nt You said  --  you were expected , Sir ? Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne Ay ! I think I am expected ! Servant . Servant I will announce you , Sir ! ( Exit . ) Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne And this is the Queen 's palace  --  at last ! Eileen , is it near me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , speak with you  --  sing to you ? ' T is to your own castle I come , to say in one song  --  what  --  God ! Will they let me sing  --  me in Dublin castle ? Here , where the echoes of smothered liberty 's last cry are scarcely still ! Ah , Mary Virgin , for my love 's sake , teach me how to keep my love 's promise ! ( Enter Eileen hurriedly ; she starts on seeing Desmond . ) Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Desmond ? Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne Eileen ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald You  --  you took me unaware , Mr. O'Moirne . I had not heard that you were come , but you are welcome ; believe me , you are very welcome ! ( She extends her hand which he takes and kisses . ) Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne You had not heard , Mistress Fitzgerald ? But sure you had not forgot that I stood pledged to come ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald I had not forgot ; though indeed there has been time for forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer and a century of winters . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Have thoughts of me had such a cold reception , then ? Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne No , for they were ever doing as the birds do  --  migrating to a sunnier clime , over the Irish sea . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Mr. O'Moirne , I am disappointed ; I flattered myself the first place you would come to in Ireland would be this castle . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne Why , but so it was  --  the first and only ! You do n't believe me ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Yes , if you 'll give me word you 've not been climbing for a kiss at the stone of Blarney Castle . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne ( Smiling . ) Mistress Eileen is still herself , I see  --  still setting traps for runaway slaves . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Alack ! I 'd liefer my word should attract only freemen that come of their own brave will . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne What can one do ? Since you speak sceptres , my lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzgerald Your words are clever courtiers , Sir . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne Then would I could dismiss them , that so my heart might stand without retinue and speak in feeling . Ah , Mistress Eileen , then you might hear how deeply I wish you joy of this day  --  your birthday . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald And are you not pledged to tell me that in a song ? Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne Then you still care that I should tell it so ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald I think I never cared so much till to-night . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne And I may tell of my joy in coming , and you will listen ? Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald If it be not selfish for me to ask so much joy , as would be mine in listening . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne ( Walking back and forth . ) I must ! My heart is full  --  my throat aches  --  my thoughts they are prisoned eagles . Ah , but no ! If I sang , it would be strange joy , my lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is pain . For who am I to sing at your fine feasting , with British ears of stone to listen ? What can I bring out of my country 's dungeon to grace an English holiday ? What flowers out of her trampled fields ? What gift as a tribute to you , my lady ,  --  I , that come beggared , wrapt in a tattered title ? What indeed am I ?  --  An Irishman , alas ! An Irishman , thank God ! Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald Amen to that " thank God . " Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne And you say that ? O , then you will for one mad minute listen to an Irish heart that can not keep its head . My lady , you are here ; I am here ; we have been apart and it was long . I came but to say God prosper you and good-bye ; but now  --  now  --  now  --  I am come to say I love you , and  --  I love you  --  and I love you . No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has borne me here ; ' t is a power like the whirlwind that could carry me away before all 's said ! Eileen , far across the seas , your eyes called me  --  called me back through grief and shame and blood here to your feet , and here I lay the life of me . My being is no longer mine ; it is Love 's  --  and yours , Eileen !  --  Eileen ! ( She moves slowly toward him . He gazes at her with passionate tenderness . She is about to speak , when Lady Wyndham enters . ) Lady W. Lady Wyndham Heavenly powers ! Eileen , child  --  what  --  Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne ( Rising . ) Madame ,  --  I  --  Madame  --  Mistress Fitzgerald has been detained at my fault . You are in good time . I  --  I have much wronged her leisure . Lady W.

It is his dinner hour . Come , Eileen . Eileen . Eileen Fitzgerald And this gentleman is Lord Cornwallis ' dinner-guest  --  and mine ! ( To Desmond . ) Forgive me , Sir , for the moment I must attend my guardian 's summons ; but it is but for the moment . You will wait my return  --  Desmond ? You will wait ? Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne I will wait . ( Exit Eileen and Lady W. ) My God ! How can I stay ? But I have promised  --  and my song is still unsung ! I 'll wait ;  --  and waiting , dream a thousand different ways how she did call me Desmond . ( Enter Morton , Wilde and Valiere . ) Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a flame !

Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton A hot-head Irishman  --  You 're right . ' T is easy ! Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Marquis , it is growing late . Is that fateful dinner never to come off ? Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere I am no better informed than yourself , Monsieur le Colonel . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Well , I for one am tired of this and need refreshment .

Desmond O'Moirne You will now say quickly , Sir , that you can see your mistake . Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton I neither see it , nor solicit news of it from footmen . More wine and less words .

( Offers him a coin . ) Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne ( Disdainfully to Wilde . ) Sir , I speak to the one man I see ! ( With repressed anger , to Morton . ) You , Colonel Morton , have either lately grown short of sight , or have yet to learn that footmen do not carry swords ; either of which misfortunes I am your servant to alleviate . Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton O'Moirne ! Upon my soul , and so it is ! Your pardon , Mr. O'Moirne , but really you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked to meet you . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere O'Moirne  --  O'Moirne . Why , did n't I hear we were to have a song from one O'Moirne with the fiddling to-night ? Egad , singing ca n't be the most profitable trade in the world ! Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere The same , Monsieur , sans doute . He has the air of the stage  --  ah ? Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne If Colonel Morton finds me altered in estate since we last met , it is surely thanks in part to Colonel Morton and those who have brought alteration to my country . Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton Say rather those whose paternal care would not suffer your country to be maltreated by her children . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne Ireland 's sons have been taught to keep good guard of her . And when a meddling neighbor knocks at her door , they have but barred it fast , and died upon its sill to keep him out . Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton It is perhaps well for your neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Desmond O'Moirne For the caution , thanks ; I will eat patience . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere That 's food that gives an Irishman dyspepsia . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Ah , Monsieur O'Moirne , it is a happiness you are to sing to us . You sing in opera , yes ? But it seems you play no more the hero since  --  since your little rebellion here . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne I have heard the same of you , Marquis ; I believe you no longer play the hero in France , since your little rebellion there . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere Zounds ! There 's a clip for the French poodle . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere But there is one difference , Monsieur . In France , the gentlemen are obliged to flee ; in Ireland , it seems otherwise ; for here all gentlefolk are English . Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne Sir , you have an Irish hostess . Valiere . Marquis Raoul de la Valiere ( With a taunting smile . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chambermaid with a fortune , to whom lords came a-wooing ? Desmond . Desmond O'Moirne ( Striking him in the face with his glove . ) You damned scoundrel ! Now , by Heaven ! Patience spells cowardice here ! Bullies ! Because I am an Irishman , you think to risk your taunts and see me swallow them with smiles . You are three to one ; you think yourselves secure in the presence of the Viceroy and this roof 's hospitality . The very color on your backs is the red badge of conquering crime , the stained symbol of Irish hearts that bleed even now upon the withered shamrock . Take that truth , gentlemen , from an Irish heart , and disprove it on an Irish sword ! ( All draw their swords ; Desmond keeps Morton and Wilde at bay , while Valiere runs to the door . The chief bout is between Desmond and Morton , Desmond getting the upper hand , while Wilde aids Morton on the outskirts . ) Morton . Col. Humphrey Morton This is treason .
