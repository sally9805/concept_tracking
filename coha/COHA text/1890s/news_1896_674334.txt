txt There are certain parts of - the country in which the growth of trolley systems . urban , suburban , and interurban , has been exceptionally rapid , and where the character of the competition between such systems and the steam roads and the causes of the popularity of the new lines have been clearly disclosed . We have in mind Northern New-Jersey , Northern Ohio , and several districts in the southern part of New-England , as well as the systems which are centred in Chicago , Philadelphia , and St. Louis . The northeastern counties of New-Jersey are now covered with a network of electric roads ; Stretching out from Cleveland , Ohio , there are many lines of considerable length which compete with the steam roads for interurban traffic ; the cities of Southern New-England are the centres of comprehensive systems which serve the interests of suburban and rural residents , in all directions ; and with respect to the large cities mentioned the purely suburban business of the old steam roads has been very seriously affected by the new electric parallels . The causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the smaller cities , and especially with residents of adjacent suburban districts , are not clearly perceived by many who live in very large cities and rarely have occasion to use electric or cable roads except in the city streets . One of these causes is the great convenience of the trolley service as compared with that of the steam roads .. The steam service is not elastic , so to speak ; it can not adapt itself to the wants of either suburban or urban travelers where the conditions are competitive . For example , a person living in a village or small town within ten miles of the city , who can use either steam or trolley , will commonly choose the trolley . The service is more frequent ; the cars , as a rule , are more accessible , passing , it may be , by the door ; the cost is less ; the journey , for a large part of the year , is more enjoyable ; and the traveler , going to the city , is not set down at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the transfer tickets , may be carried without additional expense to any part of the city , or even , at small additional cost , to suburban villages beyond . There are other advantages which , with these , tend surely to attract travelers on competitive lines  --  whether they be residents of the city or dwellers in the villages and rural districts  --  to the electric roads rather than to the unbending and comparatively inconvenient and costly steam roads . Thus there is created in city and in adjacent agricultural regions a. personal interest and a preference which will become more and more formidable in Legislatures and elsewhere as opposed to the old steam companies whenever these undertake to prevent electric competition or to restrict the growth of electric lines in competitive territory . The influence of this interest and preference must be taken into account . It is powerful and will gain in force . Thus far the steam companies , with respect to such traffic as we have been considering , have not been able to offer new advantages on their side to offset those which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
