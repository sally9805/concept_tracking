txt There was little marked change in the railway situation yesterday . A good deal of rioting took place in scattered parts of Chicago , and there was some serious destruction of property . ? Gen. Miles is evidently not yet prepared to take entire control of the work of restoring order .. The Mayor has given orders for the prevention and dispersing of mobs by the Police , which , if carried out , will relieve the pressure on the roads . He has asked Gov . Altgeld to order out five regiments of militia . The Federal Administration adheres to its determination to use all necessary force , but if the United States force alone is insufficient , the events of to-day will determine to what extent and from wnat quarter it will be strengthened . The condition of things in California is bad . The State militia is useless and the Federal military force is inadequate . It looks now as if the riotous spirit could not be checked without at least one vigorous attack-by the military , and this , unwelcome as it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defer . Gov . Altgeld is much too thick-hided and anarchistic to feel the sting of the President 's reply to his second telegram . When Mr. Cleveland closes this singular correspondence by expressing the belief that in " this hour of danger and public distress discussion may well give way to active effort on the part of all in authority to restore obedience to law and to protect life and property " he indulges in sarcasm forcible enough to make a rhinoceros wince , yet it will doubtless leave Altgeld quite unmoved . The terms law and order do not mean the same thing to him that they mean to civilized persons , and with the President 's views as to the duty of those in authority he will not at all agree . One result of such treasonable outbreaks as this of Debs and his union would seem to be tolerably certain  --  either the States of this Union will cease to elect Yahoos like Altgeld and Lewelling and Waite as Governors , or else they will fully and frankly give themselves over to Government of Yahoos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since everybody else would flee . When the Farmers ' Alliances of the South were first formed , one of their most strenuous demands was for reform of the tariff and lower duties , and in its beginnings the Populist Party went further in this direction than the Democrats . When Rufus . Kolb first broke away from his party in Alabama because it would not gratify his ambition for the Governorship , he professed to be more Democratic than the Democrats , and arrogated to his followers and supporters the name of Jeffersonian Democracy . " Now Kolb is the candidate of a combination of Populists and Republicans , and has been collecting contributions from the protectionists of the North , with the countenance and encouragement of Senator Hoar of Massachusetts , for the conduct of his campaign against Oates . The interest of this lies chiefly in its illustration of the lack of principle and of scruple in combinations and candidates of this kind . The lack of scruple if not of principle , is as conspicuous ill Hoar and the Home Market Club as in Kolb and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Tribune , asserts that . " the Iron and Steel Trust " hits recently been lobbying in the Senate , and has made an " assault " upon the Senate Finance Committee in behalf of not only its own interests , but also those of the Sugar Trust . How long is it since our high-tariff neighbor discovered the existence of this " Iron and Steel Trust " ? We do not remember that The Tribune spoke so harshly of the iron and steel industry four years ago , when the Republicans were making the tariff , or that It has since , until now , pointed out the existence of and denounced the legislative lobbying of such a combination . We should like to have our neighbor explain why its attitude toward that industry has undergone so remarkable a change in these Summer days of 1894 . Let us have all the facts about this " Iron and Steel Trust . " Did it exist four years ago , or is it a new thing ? Does The Tribune think the iron and steel industry is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procured by joining the Sugar Trust in an " assault " upon the Democratic tariff makers in the Senate .
