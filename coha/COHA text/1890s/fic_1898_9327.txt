Palace Hall . Menelaus and Courtiers . Paris and Courtiers . Paris . Paris King Menelaus , we are of Ilion all , Turned from our errand . Not with men it lies , But with the gods , to reach the wished-for shore . Our baffled sails were set for Salamis ; Yonder they flap , down by the Spartan strand . Float whitherward we may , we hail from Thrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Apollo both his slaves For the strong work . Menelaus . Menelaus You are good Priam 's son . Come , let me take you by the hand . We know Your white-haired father well , fair spoken of fame ; Know Hecabe 's first-born , your brother , Hector ; And fortune now has added fair young Paris , Ay , given us leave to look him in the face . Most welcome ! Paris . Paris Menelaus locks my tongue , Which should declare the purpose of our journey . Menelaus . Menelaus Speak on ; but plain the look of these my friends , Intent on further service , bids me say You shall not go till we have faced the boar Together , and so tried the thews of Thrace . Paris . Paris Most willingly we bide a little time , At least till we have hunted , and have pledged Cups from the fragrant hills round Ismaron . Longer we may not stay ; for we are sent , As will be granted , on an urgent journey . When Heracles laid low Laomedon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And gave her to his friend , Prince Telamon Of Salamis . Prince Telamon , as all Men know , is dead , and in his place reigns Ajax . So now it stands that my old father 's sister Is pining captive in a stranger-land , Exiled and base dishonored . Wherefore we Are charged to go to Salamis and say , " Priam would have Hesione at home . " Menelaus . Menelaus ' T is a just mission . We will feast to-night , And hunt to-morrow . Rested from the hunt , As squares it with your pleasure you shall sail , Commissioned doubly strong : " Ilion and Sparta Demand of Salamis old Priam 's sister . " Banquet-Hall . Menelaus leads in Helen . Menelaus . Menelaus It were no banquet not set off with Helen . Our ways are freer , Prince , than they may be At Ilion . Ere we fall to baser joys , My Queen , receive our new friend Paris , who , If he but bide a week , when he departs Will take with him the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes can see , it will be so ; If my old hands can help , it shall be so . Paris . Paris Most gracious lady , light of Lacedmon , In honest Sparta none may hide his thought . thra. hera Aside . Tush , Paris ! Aphrodite 's thought , not yours . Paris . Paris It happened , once , on a slope of piny Ida , There came unto a shepherd lad , who fed The flocks of my old father , ladies three That walk the envied ways of blest Olympus . The Olympian gallants , gods although they are , High born as they themselves , could not , it seems , Be trusted to decide which was the fairest . They found the herdboy on Scamander 's bank  --  Scamander , yellow as his own wild locks , Stained with the sunshine . There he sat , and played As blithe a pipe as ever lifted foot Of faun or forest nymph , dancing to Pan . The first to speak was she that sits by Zeus , The Bride of Heaven : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than are the lovely things you live Among ,  --  the brooks , the blossoms , and the trees ,  --  Can truly tell of thousand beauteous shapes Which is most beautiful . Take you this apple , And , looking on us justly , give it her You find the fairest . " " Glossy boy , " spoke then She with the oval face and floating hair , The virgin ' gainst whose ivory side the lance Of love is shattered , she whose glowing shoulder Smote once poor mortal sight , and put it out Forever ,  --  " take it , boy , and with free hand Offer it her whose right it is . Decide ; We stand upon the choice . " Till now the lad stood gazing ; dazed , but bent To do his best with what few thoughts were left . He stood there , tapping with the reed his limbs Well plumped , yet trembling under him , he felt , When the other moved toward him , drew very close , And , silent , waited . He looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sleep , And reaches toward its waiting mother , so He waked , and put the apple in her hand . Could he do otherwise ? This last it was That rose from the pure foam by blossomy Cyprus , And slipt like summer morning down the shore , Which , printed soft with her immortal feet , Sent roses up and lilies as she went . thra. hera Aside . Let him step forth that had done otherwise . Helen . Helen It is a pretty tale ; but , Prince , your thought ? Paris . Paris Poor silly , silly lad ! Helen . Helen I think his elders had not hit it better . Paris . Paris He stopt not with the deed , but would stout hold , When ripe his years were grown , that he had looked Upon the fairest shape of man or god . So late he learns the cheat : I was that boy . Menelaus . Menelaus Dread Prince , see that you bide within my walls . thra. hera Aside . Fecks ! he will be obedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , I 'd not let you loose Among the listening girls . Had I your tongue , Though horrent bodied as the monster hewn To ' s death by blue-eyed Heracles at foot Of Ilion 's towers , I swear I could go forth And ravish all the darlings of mankind , Nor leave one love for him that followed me . Paris . Paris Your lord lets rise my raw , unordered words , With marshaled Spartan ranks to march them down . Pray , lady , take this gold , these jewels , worth A little kingdom , and , comparing them With what I gave to Aphrodite , know The man is so much wiser than the boy . And you , O King , who , by some art beyond Rude Ilion 's reach , have won this lady , take For badge of victory a suit of gold ,  --  This armor wrought to case a kingly shape , And with it grasp this fitting spear , to guard Your god 's possession ' gainst the emptied world . First Group of Courtiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Spartan Come , now , have Ilion 's meadows all the bees , And has your prince drained every hive ? First Trojan . First Trojan That ' s Paris . Second Trojan . Second Trojan Fear not for him that from his cradle mates With Cebren nymphs , and , fair as they themselves , Has many loves as he has sunny days . Second Group of Courtiers . First Spartan . First Spartan Oft as I 've blinked upon the shining queen , Always before I could half ope my eyes ; To-night I 'm blind as old Tiresias . Second Spartan . Second Spartan Take you his blindness ; I prefer his seership . Comes there not something of that parley such As men to furthest time will not forget , I am no prophet . First Spartan . First Spartan Much is settled now : Before this hour eye has not seen two mortals Together , bright as yonder pair . So soft As Argive Helen 's look was not her own That out of heaven leaned , and straight was lost To it in shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down knew sweeter dream Than folds , now , raptured Paris . Third Spartan . Third Spartan Menelaus , If you do sleep , to-night , in wonted peace , I 'll not believe you Agamemnon 's brother . First Group of Courtiers . Trojan . Trojan We jest ; the prince but plays a merry part , The queen but hears , and answers him in kind . Spartan . Spartan Nay , man , I think the queen much moved withal . And , I would ask once more , why is it women , Or high or low , so droop on dainty men , Falling in love , as ' t were , among themselves ? Trojan . Trojan You wrong the prince . His leopard 's lines , his head , So bright , and airy carried , work deceit ; His are the thews that , next to Hector 's , bend The necks of Thrace . Spartan . Spartan A thousand pardons , Thracian , But ' t is the very hardest thing of all For my belief . Trojan . Trojan To-morrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man Than he , there , dallying with the dreamy queen . Spartan . Spartan To-night thrive Ilion ,  --  feasting and fair women ; To-morrow Sparta ,  --  fasting and dumb valor . Trojan . Trojan But see , the queen retires , led lingering off In loveliness which , after all , goes not , But , like a summer day , disputes the dark . Another Spartan . Another Spartan Now to our cups , and pleasures meet for men , Then sleep , if time be left ; and when first snort The horses of the morning , for the hills , And Sparta 's joy , cropping the flower of Ilion . Another Trojan . Another Trojan The tenderest flower sometimes has hardy stem , And oft , too , from its softness sticks a thorn . So let it rest ; for yonder he returns Under whose royal roof no noise should break Save sounds of praise and honest revelry . Paris , alone on his couch , after the banquet . hera approaches him . thra. hera Young Prince , I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bank . Prince , I am old ; I was not always so . Years ere you breathed the air or charmed the hearts Of Ilion , I was young . The years change all , What is , to-day , shows nothing of what was ; You meet me here , silvered and bent , a slave , Shorn even of the honor due white hairs . Paris . Paris Woman , you have my pity . Is ' t for that You come , when age with youth should covet sleep ? thra. hera Sleep ! Had I your youth and what the gods Have given you with it , placed as you are , now , My eyes , instead of folding in blank lids , Would stare themselves from out their tortured sockets . Pity for my poor self ? Nay , but for her , The child-wife Helen . I have not forgot , Though't be so far behind , how sweet youth is . To Sphria , on the gulf of Saron , once I fared , fleet as the wind . Under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his palace , in the splendid deep By rocky Imbros , drave Poseidon forth His horses golden-hoofed and brazen-maned , And lashed them toward his palace on the shore . His fierce glance pierced to me ; he reached , and off His chariot whirled us . Ay , Poseidon ' t was . I tell you this that you may know how much It is I say , as on my knees I swear The water-god caught up a freckled wench Compared to her the prey of laggard Paris . Paris . Paris Woman , I am the guest of Menelaus. thra. hera Has love , in truth , become so poor ! Why , love , It owned the world when I was young ; ay , had There been a thousand worlds , it would have ranged ' Em all , and brought their haughty riches home To deck its pleasure-house and bridal bed . There was no king but love , no queen but beauty , In days when virgins closed with kings and gods , And sons were born were worth the weight and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's spear , And shake't in play as no man swings it now . Paris . Paris Did all the world turn robber , he 'd not fall With it , the guest of her so honest lord . thra. hera Honest , spotless Atreides ! Believe it , scorn the gods , and get you hence With two dead hearts for trophy , two dead lives , Two loves that might have been , sweeter than loves That make men pale to read of , vilely slain . Aphrodite appears , and vanishes . Paris . Paris Wild as my thought plunges no bolt of Jove , Driven , hissing , down the hollow of the night .  --  I do not sleep ; say on . thra. hera It is sound sleep to what't will turn ere long ; I have borne sons , and know the stuff of men . How came he by her , he , the blameless king ? When Helen yet was in her bud of beauty , Foreseeing the blossom of her summertime , Came up the suitors to old king Tyndareus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , As I in time will show you  --  till his gate Was full . Cretan Idomeneus came up , His chariot clogged with gold ; Meges was here , The son of Phyleus , brave as the battle-god ; Antilochus , the young and bold , pressed in , With melody stolen from his snowy sire , Who speaks , and charms the very winds of Pylos ; By him his rival , he of Ithaca , Odysseus , cunning as the serpents round Apollo 's shrine . Next him horseman Menestheus , Who rolled ' gainst Theseus his mad chariot wheels , And haled him basely from his father 's throne ; Here Diomedes strode , behind his shield , Ward of the bluest eyes that watch from heaven ; And to and fro among them all would pass Methone 's prince , the friend of Herakles , Who took from him his arrows as he died . Paris . Paris To himself . I know not why , I shuddered at that last . thra. hera As I have named them came they up that , side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in , to-night , shouldering toward Helen . You picture gentle , high-born gardeners , come To pluck , ere it should flower , the Spartan bud . I tell you , I , who faced them , man by man , They were so many bulls , Which locked their horns together , pawed the ground As they would plow away Eurota 's shore , Bellow strong Sparta down , till one of all Should lure the heavenly heifer from her hills . It thaws the winter in my veins to think o n't ; And your young blood , young summer blood , instead Of throbbing hot to valor 's fiery top , Does clot and scum in the dull ooze of sleep . Paris . Paris Mutters , his mind returning to the vision . It was the smile , the very smile , she gave When I looked up at her , shining on Ida . thra. hera The prize that felled all Greece at Sparta 's feet , Was't honorably won , at last ? ' T was tossed By lot into the lap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has her not . I say it over : I have been a girl , And for a girl I speak . Paris . Paris Rousing . Woman , I am his guest . And saw I not , A little hour ago , she loves the king ? She has waxed fond of him , wooed by sure worth , Than which a better lover never was . thra. hera With but a glance young Paris can see more Than hera with her years , with all her days And nights of watching , close as fondest mother To nestling Helen . Not a thought is hers But I can hear it . So , from childhood , has It been ; her little troubles all my own , Ay , all her bitter sorrows and her joys . Hence , well as I hate the blackened line of Atreus , So well I love the unsullied girl . I love Her , Paris , else I should not parley more , But leave you both to take the meed of them That scorn the guerdon of the eternal gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death . Paris . Paris Fiercely . She loves the king . thra. hera Ay , since who has her heart Is monarch of all men , the very king . Paris . Paris She loves her lord . thra. hera Ay , since who has her love Is so her lord .  --  Didst ever know a nurse So put to't she came off without her story ? You and your train had just come in the hall , And Menelaus gone to greet you , when , As wont , I went to bind young Helen 's hair . Upon her couch I found her , fallen asleep As soft and soon as babe upon the breast . Asleep she was , yet would she smile , yea , speak , At times , deep in most wondrous rapture . Then Did I divine ' t was not a common sleep , But a sweet spell laid on her . When she woke  --  It was not long  --  she yet stayed half in sleep , Nor spoke she more than , now and then , a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid-forest . So it happed As you approached the palace . While I robed The girl , to-night , she plied me ,  --  " hera , how May mortals tell when truly ' t is a god ; Whether it be a dream , or they in truth Look on a very god ? " I answered her , It was a thing to learn of one 's own self , Not to be taught . " I think , I think , " she said  --  Ah , Paris , had you heard her say it , seen The dreamy lids droop half-way down her eyes !  --  " I think the prince is followed by a goddess . " Paris . Paris Go , now , hoar hera ; I had rather dream Most frightful things that rack their souls in Hell Than let this lead me further . thra. hera ' T is enough . If so the goddess bring you sleep , fall off ; If so she bid you wake , stand to the watch ; I will not pit my wisdom ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my might Of prophet 's blood , and by my many years , And by the memory of my youth and beauty , And by my love , the guard of darling Helen , Hold stiff your spear , to-morrow . Exit . Paris . Paris ' T was an old woman 's tale , all known before , So straight the sight of love .  --  Benignant goddess , Oh , Aphrodite , thou hast kept thy word ! Could I be deaf to those two wailing voices , The voice of wild Oenone , my boyhood 's love , And the voice of her , my sister , wan Cassandra ; Could I shut out their cries ,  --  " Go not , go not ! " " O Paris , bring not back with thee a wife ! " Did not these cries torment me , I should sink To sleep soft as the lovely Helen slept , Dear Goddess , on thy breast . Man walks in darkness , none can see the way ; But thou wilt open it to me as I go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From me , to-morrow . Gods will watch my steps From this hour on , to make me slip . Ward off The gods . Against no mortal crave I aid . Helen . Helen Alone , weaving and singing . Softly , shepherd , watch your flock , They must let the baby rock ,  --  By-a-baby , by-a-by ; Keep the dreams back , every one , Till the journey is begun . By-a-baby , by-a-by . Not till baby floats away , Pretty shepherd , let them stray ,  --  By-a-baby , by-a-by ; Then around him let them play ; Hark , you , shepherd , what I say . By-a-baby , by-a-by . Careless shepherd , keep them back ; One is coming , white and black ,  --  By-a-baby , by-a-by ; Never , never let him go That has spot upon his snow ; By-a-baby , by-a-by . Softly , shepherd , soft , I say , Not till baby floats away ,  --  By-a-baby , by-a-by . Ah , the dreamkins , well they know ! Loose them , shepherd , let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returned from the hunt . Menelaus . Menelaus Fair as the dream the nimble thread shall fix , Slipping from those deft fingers , gliding on That wild-bird melody . Helen . Helen My lord come home ! Safe , and a full day sooner than he said . Menelaus . Menelaus Home , dearest , hardly safe ; mark you this mark . And lucky man I am it is no worse . Helen . Helen The king will have his war ; when there 's no war Will make it ; tusk of boar will take for spear Wielded by direst foe of mortal breed , And dash against it , and get grievous wounds , As he were battling for his queen and kingdom . Menelaus . Menelaus Sweet girl I forever finding precious fault  --  Helen . Helen Which halts yet far behind your true desert  --  Menelaus . Menelaus Which is more sweet to hear than song of nymphs , Tripping in grove and glen . Helen . Helen It is more praise Than blame , or Menelaus could not wake it . A palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do hate the boars ! Is ' t a bad hurt ? Menelaus . Menelaus The best hurt 's bad . For cure I 'll take a peep Into the fairy secret of your loom . Helen . Helen Holding him back . Not yet ; the charm 's at work . Menelaus . Menelaus Well , tell me , then , What song you sang . That may a little help me . Helen . Helen A sleep-song hera taught me long ago , A lullaby one hears at Athens , where Over the door the olive wreath has hung . It came to me as I thought on my childhood . But ' t is an ugly gash ! Now will I heal it , Do ' t sooner than the eldest of my women ; Here be my ointments and my bandages . I hope you wreaked upon the brute revenge So fierce , the news of it will spread till all Wild Theras howls at Menelaus ' name . Menelaus . Menelaus My loud war-cry was as a summer breath , Nor carried it more terror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingly ! Would I might gloat on him , a humble captive . Menelaus . Menelaus A joy , I question not , to every woman ; The tusk that dealt me this was grown in Thrace . Helen . Helen A Thracian monster did it ! Point him out , To-night , when I will drive him to the prince , And get his price , that we may keep him , cage Him up , against a merry hunt at home . Menelaus . Menelaus Keep him ! Nay , that were harder fortune yet ; Next would he wound my queen , work her such hurt As not her skill and mine , combined , could medicine ; ' T was Paris ' taper hand that dealt the blow . Helen . Helen The prince ! I 'd risk my naked arm ' gainst his . Menelaus . Menelaus The courage is too common ; boast not o n't . Helen . Helen The prince ! nay , say ' t was some one ' mong my maids . Paris , the soft , the silken ! Menelaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's wrist And ringlets . Never more misleading man Did ramp Taygetus ' lairs . To see him lilt Along the hills , swinging this way and that As though a zephyr steered him , then the change When ' t came to make a stand ! Four of us rushed Together to stop as huge a brute as scours The mountain . I was first ; but , in the nick , Before me leapt the prince , who drew , and gave Me one spear-end the while the brute took t ' other , Pricked to quick death . Beware o ' silken princes ! Helen . Helen Forthwith dispatch him ; Sparta is not safe . Menelaus . Menelaus Nay , hear me , girl : I have not met the man I 'd rather make my friend . He shall not go , But tarry with us long as pleasure holds him . To-morrow , I set out . Till my return Hold fast Prince Paris . Helen . Helen I had thought , perhaps , You would deny , for once , Idomeneus , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king will hunt one day too many . Enter hera . Menelaus . Menelaus ' T is one of haggard hera 's midnight mutterings . Play not the prophet , girl ; be a brave queen . One has his friends , and has one friend of all ; I never can refuse Idomeneus . However , I will cut my pleasure short ; Meanwhile be generous with our Thracian guests , Deal with free hand ; in nothing stint the prince , Make him to feel that all I have is his . thra. hera Aside . If he do feel ' t not , now , Olympus is Untopped , and all the gods are tumbled down . Helen at her loom , hera by her side . thra. hera Heyday ! the king is off ; it 's hunt again , And woman rules once more unsinewed Sparta . What said his kingship when you showed him that ? Helen . Helen ' T is but begun ; I could not show it so . thra. hera What is the name o ' ' t ? Helen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First have the thing , when it will speak , And name itself . thra. hera The posture is a god 's , Confronting , I may say , a Spartan palace ; And that above his head , which first I took For cloud , may grow into a goddess ' wings . Helen . Helen ' T is faithful if so quick you make it out . thra. hera A jump , and lo , your skill is at the pitch ; A wondrous sudden mount . One power , but one , My lass , can push so fast . You have the thing , And so , as you have taught me , have its name ; Therefore I need not speak it . Helen . Helen After all , It may not be the prince . thra. hera The king , perhaps , Hung round with hunter 's glory . Helen . Helen hera , how Can you love Helen so well , and hate so hard Helen 's honest husband ? What does help my heart , Give it a little play , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more room than mine . He wrongs you , truly , holding you in Sparta ; But it is for my sake . thra. hera I will requite His service yet . If he is king , know I Too , had , one time , a kingdom . You forget Who hera is ; what moves me more , forget Who Helen is . Is she the king 's or love 's ? Think back , my Queen , and prick the silly bubbles . In this same room where now you picture him That is the very king , striving to lift Him from your heart , and hold him for your eyes To see even as your heart sees ,  --  in this room , I say , forgetful Helen , love , long since , Enjoyed a queen , or you were not here , now . In at that window flew the sovereign swan That , shadowing your mother , quicked her with love That love might be again . You are that love ; And , sure as Zeus upholds his throne , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes . Enter Paris , while Helen hurriedly covers the loom . Paris . Paris And why should I not see how prospers art At Sparta ? Helen . Helen ' T is scarce swaddled yet ; the face , Of him whose rude arm well nigh overthrew My husband , wielded but in silly sport , Would fright my youngling past the hope of growth . thra. hera Aside . That 's lamer than Hephstus : he whose face , At the first flash o ' ' t , overwhelmed the queen , With her the king , and with the twain the kingdom . Exit hera . Paris . Paris Who is the woman with Queen Helen so much , This moment gone ? Helen . Helen Prince , I half shame to tell . For , once a queen , a queen , say I , forever . hera , a slave at Sparta , was a queen At home . The chance of battle lodged her here , And here she bides . Myself would set her free ; But since the king 's will runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . Paris Can you trust her , Queen ? Helen . Helen As surely as great Pittheus was her sire , The prophet-king . Paris . Paris A royal prophetess ! Helen . Helen Yet blind enough with love to serve too well . Paris . Paris Now first I learn that love may love too well . Helen . Helen In truth it may . Love is too greedy , fierce . Love must have all or nothing ; A furious path it takes , to follow it Through bloody seas and wastes ablaze with war . I think the poets praise love much too much , And with it that other , beauty . Yes , these two , So famed , I deem of doubtful worth . Could I Be born anew , and have my own poor making , I 'd be a man , a slow man and content , One not to move or to be moved on slight Occasion ; one would know the greatest is But small , that he is favored most whose place Is only large enough for him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that model man . Paris . Paris The gods be thanked they had their way , not yours ! Helen . Helen I would not blame the gods , though I must feel , At times , they work us wrong . To it I cling : Love is the very maddest might in all This stormy world ; and beauty , could it choose Twixt praise and pity , oft would take the pity . Paris . Paris Were I the king , I 'd send old hera home , And rid my queen of such philosophy As flies i ' the face of nature . Helen . Helen Lay it not At hera 's door ; hers are quite other thoughts . But now , enough ; we enter shadowy ways , Which none should ever walk in till he must . ' T was you , grave Prince , that led ; the fault is yours . Paris . Paris Queen Helen , do you play with me , or toward Your heart creeps the black shadow on mine own ? I question if again the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will burn one star , As gods and all men know , none sees your face And loves you not . I , that was born for love , And , as you say too truly , born likewise To fire and blood of war  --  I , Queen , so born , The last of men can look into your face , And be thereafter what I was . I came As light of life as any flower that nods In Ceres ' fields ; I take me hence as weighed As the pine that , blasted , hangs his pithless arms , Lone , on the windy cliff . ' T is not the time or place for me to speak ; But you will speak , for one thing must I know . Queen Helen , if you meant your life is now Happier than it would be held close in love Fixed as the star is fixed in the pure heavens ; If , verily , you meant that , tell me so . Tell me , and I 'll not speak another word . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant , again I pray you , tell me so ! The time is short : This night my sail shall fill for Salamis . Helen . Helen So soon ! My lord will not forgive me for it . Paris . Paris Yes , Queen , to-night . My men are in the boats . Helen . Helen The nights are many , many ; why to-night ? Paris . Paris My men await the signal ; I , your answer . Be open with me , that I may know if now I look my last on this eternal beauty , Or tear me from it , vowing to return , Prepared to speak my love , and make it good At point of Trojan swords . Helen . Helen You said to-night , and something after that . I have a dizziness , at times ; I hear , I hear , yet do not hear .  --  Was that good hera ? thra. hera Entering . Ay , little Helen Queen .  --  Aside . Out on the goddess ! She has flown again Before my darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling off the curtain . What is it , little Queen ? Helen . Helen I 'm over it , good hera ; you may go . She rouses , to find Paris gazing at the figures in the loom . As it has always been ! my will is naught . My heart is out , dropt , naked , in your hand , Where you may turn it , look it round and round . Paris . Paris Through the long hours I pleasured with the king My fancy , too , dwelt on the absent one , To call her up . Your task , to mine , was light ; My fancy flagged , most miserably failed . Helen . Helen If ever in my life I held resolve , Clung to it long as I could hold it , I Have done so now . I vowed to live love down , Or free it , as there , that it might fly away ; I meant , believe me , none should ever know it . Paris . Paris Dear Queen ! my soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lily , drooped in evening sleep , I swear , as on the altar of the gods , My will is weak as yours ; my will , ere this Stubborn as the grim stone in llion 's wall . We are as children , you and I ; both helpless . Helen . Helen A child am I ; alas ! have ever been A child , a cast leaf on the uncaring wind . I pray you , woo me not , but teach me , Paris ; Oh , tell me what I do , and why I do it ! Instruct me ; for you see I can not hide It longer . My love is but too plain . There is No need of wooing ; teach me , Paris , teach me ! Paris . Paris Know , then , I could not win you of myself ; The man was never born , nor shall the man Be born , that much a god . The Queen of Love Must win my queen . Helen . Helen I knew it was no dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her now I feel , her breath upon my face , Her heart against my own . I float between A waking and a sleep ; I swim in bliss . Paris . Paris My heart believes it , daughter of the gods . This much I know for truth : She promised me the fairest woman born , She promised I should have whom now I have , Of earth or Heaven the sweetest , sweetest Love . Helen . Helen Teach me it every hour , Love , while I live , Too sweet a lesson to be sooner learned . Paris . Paris The tale I told you when we met , was but Half told ; I 'll end it , now . The Queen of Love  --  A thing she needed not to do to make Me more her slave , for I was prostrate fallen Before her  --  she , I say , soft in my ear Whispered these haunting words : " For this fair gift Will I bestow a fairer . Love has bred ' Mong men the wonder of her kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear Of Heaven , peerless alike in seasons gone And in the unnumbered summers yet to come . She is my special charge , more dear to me Than dearest daughter to a mortal mother . Her will I lead you to ; her loveliness , Yea , all her love , is yours . " Helen . Helen Goddess , forgive me , unworthy of your care , My feeble blame ! You will forget it all ; For you know all my past . Now lift I praise Of a full heart , which thankfully would stop Were ' t not to throb beyond this perfect hour . Paris . Paris Nay , nay , our cup is not yet filled ; the future Shall pour it fuller yet . Turn to the past , My Love , my peerless Love , And briefly tell me what it was , that I May set against that night the day to be . Helen . Helen It seems so far away , now ; and so near But yesterday ! I 'll tell it as best I may . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is death , a plague fell on the land , And we must make our costliest offering . Thus early weighed on me the curse of beauty . They seized me ; yea , my father dragged me forth , The darling of his heart . They braided up My long , bright hair , the plaything of the winds That loved to chase me on the sunny hills ; They bound it up , and , there , among the flowers , Among my own wild flowers , they bared the knife To spill my blood into their pitying faces . Paris . Paris Horror unspeakable ! Say on , say on . Helen . Helen I closed my eyes to the clear blue above , And knew no more . When I awoke , I was At home again , and they were weeping round me ,  --  Weeping for joy that I was spared . It seems , The wicked knife , raised , glittering in the sun , Fierce swept an eagle down , and with her talons Tore it from the bad hand , and sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bled , The plague was stayed , and my poor life was saved . Paris . Paris O Aphrodite , if poor human might The least can aid your sovereign will , henceforth Take thou my all for this one precious deed ! Helen . Helen It is so far away . So close ' t was , once , So close and killing ! now almost forgot . Paris . Paris Feel me , my drowsy Love ; I do not say Awake . Sleep on , and sweeter be the sleep ; But know my arms are round you , and our bliss Is not a dream . This kiss , though you slept sound As any sleep in graves , this must you feel , And know it mine . I will not interrupt You save with kisses ; speak , say on , say on . Helen . Helen A child short-robed , and castanet in hand , I danced among the dancers in the Temple  --  To-morrow will I take you to the place  --  When on us broke resistless Theseus , with him His friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to a stranger-land . The gift most dangerous of the gifts of Heaven Again had cursed me ; and so young yet ! Oh , Take back poor beauty 's praise , and give it pity ! They hid me at Aphidnse , in her care Whose breast has been my pillow to this day ,  --  My faithful hera . Paris . Paris hera ! I know her , now ; She is great Theseus ' mother . Next our goddess And god-born Helen love I hoary hera . Helen . Helen Ay , she had screened me from Pirithos , Had held me safe against her son himself . As it befell , the test went not so far ; For , as the eagle swept to me , at home , Came rushing down into the stranger-land My noble brothers , they that sailed with Jason , Immortal Polydeuces and Castor , sons Of Zeus , on whose dear heads he set the stars , And gave them fame white as the steeds they rode To ravage Attica from end to end , And bring me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go by . If I should speak Of all , ' t would be with blame for those of whom I would speak well or nothing . Here I am , Despite the winds of fate ; Yes , Paris , I am here , the same cast leaf . But something says ' t will be a gentle gale That takes me next ; I pray for it , and think ' T will be . I think , next time , my heart will float With me , and we shall have a happy journey . My loving brothers , every other day Returning from the darkness into light , Guardians of all that wander to and fro , Will go with me ; and you , my King , will go With me , and I shall pass on ways of peace , Ways all unknown thus far , but opened , now , And smoothed for me , by her , the sovereign god dess , By her , dear Love , and you . Paris . Paris You , Oreades , who glide through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion ; You , Nereides , who gleam in the green sea , Who toll the bell swung in the coral tower , And trip the mossy round with Thetis ; you Whose hands unlatch the skyey windows , and loose The rain and sunshine ; ay , and you who wake The world from her white slumber , and sow her couch With blossoms , sweetest Hours and sweetest Airs ;  --  Come , fairest , all , of earth and sea and sky , And look upon yourselves , and see how small A part you are of her , my Spartan Helen . Helen . Helen Say on , sweet Paris ; let me not awake . Paris . Paris If , swallows , you lead hither soft-eyed Spring , Till Helen come comes never golden Summer ; Her dwelling 's here , here in this yellow hair . Should Helen , in Tethys ' place , receive the sun When he would slumber , there 'd be no more day ; Once on her breast , he would never rise again . O golden Queen , forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ushers in the years When men nor sowed nor reaped , yet all the world Was as a garden ; when the brooks ran milk , And up and down the air grew melody ,  --  The years men thought were gone , the golden years , Led back , glad captives , in this golden hair . Helen . Helen hera ! Paris ! oh ! oh ! where have I been , And am come back to this ? Paris . Paris Swift horror seams Across your smooth girl-brow . Sweet Queen , we are Beyond the reach of trouble , risen above it , As birds from the earth , ay , as the clouds that mate In the mid-azure . Ah , forgetful Helen ! Helen . Helen A file of ghosts went past me , glided by , Dim shapes of men yet dwelling in bright Hellas , Great in the land , their wrathful helmets blazing , Their corselets horrible with blood . I knew The spectres ; once before they came , no phantoms , Resolved , each one , to take me home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed them , And saw them launch their slender , vengeful boats , And speed along the gean northward . Fly , O precious Paris ! ere it be too late . Paris . Paris By all the might of mighty gods , if Paris Set forth , to-night , Charon will be his oarsman . There 's danger ? At a sign from me such men Will quit their boats , and dash up from the strand , As soon shall tame for us the haughty ghosts ; When , from among their tumbled bodies , Helen Will I lift up , and , with her in my arms , Walk over them , and point ship-beaks for llion . Helen . Helen Dumb Menelaus , groping through the house From room to room , holding in his great hands The things I wore  --  I see him ! Now , he turns From them to Agamemnon , whose huge breast Is heaving horribly , broad as Poseidon 's : I can not bear it longer . Enter thra. thra. hera Peace , silly children ! Let your elder speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poseidon , Nor feared him more than she fears now the ghosts You talk of . You have slept and waked . It is A way all children have , being but nature . I am a mother , children , Theseus ' mother ; Two golden heads make not this old white head . Peace , pretty babes , my hand will lead you home . Paris , my son , ' t is willed you should bear off My daughter , Helen . Whether alive or dead Is not declared ; that lies , my son , with you . Do you stir not , but wait to face the king , You put that gentle head in peril worse Than fate has woven for ' t yet . Take her , while now You may , unharmed ; house her in llion 's hold , Then , then return to tell what you have done . The journey back , forsooth , will not be long ; As you toward Greece , so Greece will move toward you . Ay , she may meet you so far north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thracian tower . Paris . Paris What say you ? Take her so ! take Helen so ! Helen . Helen If I be not most honorably won , Then love 's a liar , and there is no truth ; But if true love speak truth , know I am won Most fairly . And if my wish have any weight , And you would sometime take me , Paris , take Me now . Paris . Paris Hold that head up , a mark for scorn ! Helen . Helen If scorn do point at me , ' t will point because Of what has been before this honest hour . Go I or stay , I am not his , but yours ; I never was the king 's . The shame is hers that falsely stays , not hers That goes , bold only to be false no longer . And yet so dread the shapes that vex my thought , I pray you , go without me . If alone You go , or we set forth together , let It be to-night . thra. hera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other logic straight as love 's . The creature does not breathe who would pronounce Him wrong whose hand had snatched this miracle From her own mother 's arms ; No wind shall ever bring the voice of blame For Helen or the husband of her love . My own boy Theseus , Prince , pounced on her once , And haled her from the temple . That was robbery ; Yet all forgave it . I myself forgave it . But to forgive was not to make her his ; The high gods bred and held her for another . Love 's day is come ; and if you take her not This night from damned Sparta , I say , now , To your pale face , I will myself set out With her , alone , and go and stand with her Before old Priam ; nor tell him half the story Ere he shall shake his years off , and , the might Of youth once more upon him , brand his darling The very basest ' mong his Thracian slaves . Night . Paris and Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with Paris , hera watches them , herself unobserved . thra. hera Aside . The storm is past , no cloud in all the sky ; I can not think that ever tempest was , So fair the heaven of love , now .  --  Goddess , thine Indeed is might , yea , sovereign might and grace ! Helen . Helen Could I but learn how dull you are at learning , I should not try to teach you . You have lost A twenty kisses in as many minutes . Paris . Paris Is this the finger ? Helen . Helen That 's the very one You lost on last . Paris . Paris Then will I play it  --  so . Helen . Helen You kissed before you played . Paris . Paris Well , now I 've played . Helen . Helen And kissed me out of turn . Paris . Paris This takes it back . Helen . Helen You can not take it back . Paris . Paris No ? Then here ' t is . Helen . Helen I say again , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was that the watcher 's signal ? Paris . Paris I 'll look , for one more kiss . Helen . Helen I 'll look myself . Helen leaves the room , Paris following . Paris . Paris ' T is a kind service . I will kiss you for ' t. thra. hera Where now 's the king , and where is Salamis , Where aught my pretty ones so hung on once ? All clean forgot : the goddess has her way . So shone my girl 's soft eyes when , back at Athens , I used to tell her of Gorgo and Lamia . Oh , it is worth my woes , worth all my bonds , To look on this ! Antic as nimblest fawns , They frisk it to the chariot .  --  Dapple joys Of Aphrodite , she will tend you well . Soon as you mount , the waiting mist will fold , And shut you safely from the peeping Spartans . The very horses know their delicate errand ; The stallions , wont to neigh and prance as though They rolled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shiny sides for breath , And every hoof is fixed as it were nailed To the hard Spartan ground . And I 've helped , too ,  --  The king 's fool-slaves have I drugged well with wine ; They will not wake till we be far at sea . Boy Paris bade me go , and have my freedom ; I will not take it till I see my bird In her white cage , all safe in strong-walled llion . Farewell to Lacedmon ! When next a-hunting goes the hunter-king ' T will be a hunt with echoes will scud round The circuit of the seas . Farewell , once more , Farewell to Lacedmon ! Dark are the ways of men ; most brief are joys , And of brief joys , is love , alas ! the briefest . My dears , who dream so deep , must wake again ; Tempest shall drive , and the wild shock of war Shake down dream-builded bliss . So let it be . Love 's hour is brief , but oh , that hour ! that hour ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
