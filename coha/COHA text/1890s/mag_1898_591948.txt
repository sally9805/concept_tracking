THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY . THE only really democratic experiment , beside our own , going on in the world to-day , is that of the English Australian colonies . All others are more or less disturbed by the political or social traditions of an anterior regime . Nowhere else , therefore , can so much instruction be obtained as to the probable effect of popular government on laws and manners . There is no other democracy whose beginning so nearly resembles ours . We began , it is true , at a much earlier period , under the influence of aristocratic and religious ideas which have lost their force , and we began with a very different class of men . Our first settlers were a selected body , with strong prepossessions in favor of some sort of organization , which , whatever it was to be , was certainly not to be democratic . They sought to reproduce the monarchical or aristocratic world they had left , as far as circumstances would permit . It may fairly be said that the society they tried to establish on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old World , with some improvements , notably another kind of established church . By the time the Australian colonies were founded , however , - that is , about a century ago , - what was most antiquated in the American regime had fairly departed . The colonies here had sloughed off a good deal of the European incrustation , and had frankly entered on the democratic regime , but with social foundations such as the Australians could not claim . Australia originated with New South Wales . and was first settled as a convict station . Most of the earliest emigrants were men transported for crime , and long treated as slaves . The first step taken toward social organization was the bestowal of large tracts of land on Eng // lish capitalists , to be used as sheep-farms , with the convicts as herdsmen or laborers . Free emigrants came slowly to open up agriculture as a field of industry . As they increased , hostility to the large sheep-farmers was developed in a process somewhat similar to the extinction of the great manors in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century in getting rid of the defects of its foundation , in clarifying its social constitution , and in bringing itself into something like harmony with the other civilized societies of the world . In 1842 the colonies received a legislature , a large proportion of the members of which were nominees of the crown . During the previous half-century they were governed despotically by governors , often brokendown aristocrats , sent out from England . Their society was composed largely of the great sheep-farmers and of actual or emancipated convicts . Religion and morals were for a time at the lowest ebb . The institution of marriage hardly existed . The multitude of female convicts and the thinness of population in the interior rendered concubinage easy and general . The press had not begun to draw respectable talent from England , and the newspapers , such as they were , were largely in the hands of ex-convicts . There was nothing that could be called public opinion . The only appeal against any wrong-doing lay to the home government , which was then six months away ; and so deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community of convicts that any appeals received little attention . The first thing that could be called a political party in the colony consisted of Irish Catholic immigrants , who had gone out in large numbers in 1841 , under the stimulation of government grants and bounties . They acted rather as Catholics than as citizens , and , as usual , under the leadership of their clergy . A responsible legislature of two houses was not established until 1856 . The cobnies started with the English , or cabinet system ; that is , with ministries selected or approved by Parliament . This was the first great difference between us and them . Th framers of the American Constitution decided , for reasons which seemed to them good , to give the executive a definite term of office , independent of legislative approval . This they conceived to be necessary to the establishment of complete independence between the different departments of the government . The separation of the executive , judicial , and legislative branches held a very high place in the minds of all political speculators in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tlieref ore , the founders of the American republic made each branch independent in its own sphere , with its own term of office , which the others could neither lengthen nor abridge . This is what is called the presidential system . The cabinet system makes the executive not only part and parcel of the legislative branch , but dependent on it for existence . A vote of the majority can change the executive , while the executive can order a renewal of the legislative branch ; that is , dissolve it . The presidential system is undoubtedly the best defense that could be devised against democratic changeableness , or the influence on the government of sudden bursts of popular feeling . But it almost goes to the other extreme . It is very difficult to make any change in public policy or legislation in the United States in less than five years . In Australia , under the cabinet system , six changes may be made in a year . In New South Wales , there have been forty-one ministries , doubtless with entirely different views on important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change each year . The same phenomena exhibit themselves in all the countries which have adopted the British system , or in which the royal prerogative still remains a legislative force . Unhappily , in the colonies as in // France , these frequent changes do not always mean changes of policy . Ministries are too often overthrown simply to satisfy personal rancor , or disappointment , or jealousy . Another point of difference between our beginning and that of the Australians was that they had no constitution , as we call it ; that is , no organic law , paramount to all other laws , and which all legislators were bound to respect in legislating . Every government was organized under an English act of Parliament , but this simply provided a framework , and placed almost no restrictions on the subjects of legislation , because there are no restrictions on the action of the English Parliament itself . The will of Parliament is the British constitution , and the will of the Australian legislatures is the constitution of the colonies , provided they make no attack on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may do anything they please which Parliament may do , provided they obey the imperial law which sets them up . This has some good effects , and some bad ones . It decidedly increases the sense of responsibility , in which our legislatures are so often wanting . The Australians know that any act they pass will be executed , that no intervention of the courts on constitutional grounds can be looked for , and that if the law works badly the action of public sentiment will be immediate , and may lead to the overthrow of the ministry for the time being . In fact , a law paramount , drawn up by picked men , assembling for the purpose at stated intervals of twenty years or less , and safeguarding all the primary social rights against popular passion or impulse or legislative corruption , and interpreted by the courts , is a device peculiar to certain of the United States . It is the only really valid check on democracy ever devised , but it is doubtful whether it could now be set up anywhere else with effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it would be difficult to give any court created in our day and gainsaying the popular will . On the other hand , this absence of constitution gives legislatures a freedom in trying social experiments greater than ours enjoy , though they enjoy a good deal . There is hardly any mode of dealing with private property or private rights which an Australian legislature may not attempt , hardly any experiment in taxation which it may not try . Its sole restraint lies in the quick action of popular reprobation . These two facts - the adoption of the cabinet system from England , and the absence of a constitution containing restraints on legislation - are the main differences between our democracy and that of Australia . But every Australian colony , however strong its aspirations to political independence , is influenced in what may be called its manners by the mother country . Australia began its political life with as close an approach to an aristocracy as a new country can make , in the existence of the " squatters , " most of whom were capitalists or scions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land from the government for sheep-farming , which in the beginning they managed with convicts whom they hired from the state , and whom they were permitted to flog in case of misbehavior . Their life , in short , was very nearly that of the old cotton - planter in the South , with the * element wanting . The first work of the new democracy was to overthrow them , and take their large tracts of land away from them . But the democracy did not succeed , and has not succeeded , in preventing the formation of an upper class of the " English gentleman " type . This is what the successful Australian still strives to be . He does not become " a man of the people , " in our sense , and does not boast of his humble origin and early struggles as much as our millionaire is apt to do . The influence of this type was prolonged // and strengthened by the large emigration to Australia of university graduates from England , during the fifties and sixties , after the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career at the bar and in public life had become possible . These , again , were reinforced by a still larger emigration of broken-down men of good family , who , if they added but little to the wealth or morality of the colonies , did a good deal to preserve the predominance of English conventional ideas . For instance , one of the very strong English traditions is the right of men of education and prominence to public offices ; that is , men previously raised above the crowd by wealth or rank or education , or by some outward sign of distinction . This was perpetuated in the colonies by their connection with England in the way I have mentioned . It made the careers of such men as Robert Low and Gavan Duffy and Dr. Pensores and many others easy and natural , and made the breaking away from English ideas on social questions more difficult . Perhaps as important was the fact that it preserved the English* way of living as the thing for the " self-made man " to aspire to . How strong this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulty of keeping English influence in these matters in due subordination in this country . Nearly all our rich people , and people who have enjoyed any social success in England , are apt to revert to English life , and have to be ridiculed and denounced in the press in order to make them continue " good Americans. ** In democracies which still look to England as " home , " and which receive large bodies of immigrants educated in England , it can be easily understood how great must be the English influence on the colonial way of looking at both politics and society . In later days , when the democracy has fairly broken loose from the control of the Foreign Office , gifted men of the earlier American kind - that is , good speakers or writers - have in a large degree preserved their sway . The multiplicity of new questions , and the possibility of getting into power at any time by overthrowing the existing ministry , have naturally kept alive the art of discussion as the art which leads to political power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any system like our caucus , which attaches little importance to eloquence or power of persuasion . In Australia a man can hardly get high office without a general election . He has to produce a change of opinion in the legislature , or so great a change of opinion out of doors as to intimidate the legislature , either in order to see his policy adopted by the men actually in power , or to be charged himself with the formation of a new ministry . That is , the man most successful in exposition , who identifies himself by speech most prominently with some pending question , becomes , under the cabinet system , the man entitled to power , and no caucus nomination could either give it to him or deprive him of it . This more than aught else has made easy individual prominence by means of parliamentary arts . Of course , there is behind all talk a good deal of intrigue and chicanery , but talk there has to be . The cabinet system - or the possibility of changing majorities in the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it absolutely necessary that a successful politician should be able to express himself . He may be uneducated , in the technical sense of the term , but he must be master of his own subject , and be able to give a good account of it . He has to propose something energetically , in order to hold his place . Thus , Sir Charles Cowper and Robert Low had to connect themselves with the educational system , Sir Henry Parkes with the land system , and so on . The minister , whoever he is , is in constant danger of losing his place ; the " outs " are constantly eager to displace // him , and they displace him , as in England , by bringing up new questions , or new aspects of old ones . The system , as I have already said , has the well-known defect of instability in the executive . It means in Australia , as it means in France and Italy , incessant change or frequent changes . It is what our founders dreaded when they put the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and made each independent of the other . But it has the effect of preventing the formation of strict party ties , controlled by a manager who has not to render any public account of his management . In other words , the caucus ruled by the boss is hardly possible under it . The boss is hardly possible , if he has to explain the reasons of his actions , and to say what he thinks the party policy ought to be . Whether this system would survive the formation of a confederacy like ours , and the necessity of more potent machinery to get a larger multitude to take part in elections , is something which may reasonably be doubted . In large democracies the future probably belongs to the presidential system , with its better arrangements for the formation and preservation of strong parties , working under stricter discipline and with less discussion . The cabinet system , however , has had one excellent effect : it compels every minister who appeals to the constituencies for power to state at length and with minuteness his claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans with a fullness and an amount of argumentation which are never met with nowadays in our party platforms . He makes a real plea for confidence in him personally , and he issues his programme immediately before the election which is to decide his fate . His opponent , or rival , issues a counter one , and the two together place before the constituencies such an explanation of the political situation as our voters rarely get . Each not only explains and argues in defense of his programme , but makes promises , which , if he succeeds , he may he almost immediately called on to fulfill . These two documents are , in fact , much more businesslike than anything which our political men lay before us . In our presidential system , no one in particular is responsible for legislation , and the Congress elected one year does not meet till the next . The effect of these two circumstances has given our party platform a vagueness and a sonorousness , a sort of detachment from actual affairs , which make it somewhat resemble a Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is , in fact , no person competent to make one , because no person , or set of persons , is charged with fulfilling it . It is " the party " which the voter supports , and the party is a body too indeterminate to be held to any sort of accountability . The platform , therefore , confines itself to expressing views , instead of making promises . It reveals the hopes , the fears , the dislikes , and the admirations of the party rather than its intentions . It expresses sympathy with nationalities struggling for freedom , affection for workingmen and a strong desire that people who hire them shall pay them a " fair wage , " detestation of various forms of wrong-doing on the part of their opponents , and denunciation of the mischiefs to the country which these opponents have wrought . But it gives little inkling of what the party will really do if it gets into power . If it does nothing at all , it can not be called to account except in the same vague and indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because all its members are responsible in the same degree . Take as an illustration of my meaning what has occurred in this country with regard to the existing currency difficulties . Both the Republican and Democratic platforms have declared in favor of having a good currency , but the Dcmocratic // platform simply demanded the coinage of silver at a certain ratio to gold , and ascribed a long list of evils to the failure of the nation to furnish such a coinage ; it described these evils in terms of philanthropy rather than of finance . It did not offer any explanation , in detail , of the way free coinage of silver at the fifteen to one ratio would work ; how it would affect foreign exchange , or domestic investments , or creditors , or savings-banks . It simply recommended the plan passionately , as a just and humane thing , and treated its opponents as sharks and tyrants . No business man could learn anything from it as to the prospects of his ventures under a silver regime . The Republican platform , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the various kinds of United States currency ( ten in number ) should be of equal value . But it abstained from saying precisely in what manner this equality of value would be preserved , and what steps would be taken for the purpose ; in spite of the fact that it was dealing with a business matter , it made no proposal which a business man could weigh or even understand . The result was that although Congress met within four months of the election , and the election had turned on the currency question , nothing whatever was said or done about it . No one in Congress felt any particular responsibility about it , or could be called to account for not bringing it up or trying to settle it . Yet every one could , or would , express cordial agreement with the platform . Under the Australian system things would have gone differently . Mr. McKinley would have issued an address to the electors , saying distinctly that he stood for the gold standard , setting forth the precise manner in which he meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case he were elected , and promising to do it immediately on his election . Mr. Bryan would have issued a counter manifesto , stating not simply his objections to the gold standard , but the exact way in which he meant to get rid of it , and the probable effect of this action on trade and industry . Consequently , after the election , one or other of them would have met a Parliament which would have demanded of him immediate legislation ; and if he had failed to produce it promptly , he would have been denounced as a traitor or an incompetent , and a vote of want of confidence would have turned him out of office . In short , the winning man would have had to produce at once something like the plan which our monetary commission , composed *f men not in political life at all , has laboriously formed . There occurred in Queensland , when Sir George Bowen was governor , in 1867 , a financial crisis which makes clear the difference between the Australian system and ours . The ministry had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spent in public works . The works had been begun , and ? 50,000 of the money had been received and a large number of men employed , when the bank failed . The ministers in office instantly proposed to issue inconvertible government notes , " like our greenbacks during the war , and make them legal tender in the colony . The governor informed them that he should have to veto such a bill , as his instructions required him to " reserve for the Queen 's pleasure " every bill whereby any paper or other currency might be made a legal tender , " except the coin of the realni , or other gold or silver coin . But the ministers persisted . The populace of Brisbane were told by a few stump orators that " an issue of unlimited greenbacks would create unlimited funds for their employment on public works , while at the same time it would ruin the bankers , squatters great sheepfarmers , and other capitalists . " A socalled indignation meeting was held , at which the governor and a majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading members of Parliament were ill-treated in the streets , and threats were even uttered of burning down Government House . ' The governor held firm , and insisted on meeting the crisis by the issue of exchequer bills ; so the ministry resigned , and was succeeded by another , which did issue the exchequer bills . Had the governor not held his ground , the colony would have been launched on a sea of irredeemable paper , from which escape would probably have been difficult . In fact , there is little doubt that it is the necessity of making their loans in England , and thus getting the approval of British capitalists for their financial expedients , which has saved the colonies from even worse excesses in currency matters . The immediate responsibility of the minister for legislation must make all crises short , if sharp . No abnormal financial situation in any of the Australian colonies could last as long as ours has done , and while they retain their connection with the British crown they will be preserved from the very tempting device of irredeemable paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies to get rid of changefulness in the executive by electing the ministers by popular suffrage , instead of having them elected by Parliament ; but this attempt to depart from the cabinet system has apparently been made only by the " labor party , " or workingmau 's party , which exists and grows , without having as yet been successful in getting hold of office . Its main strength seems to lie , as in this country , in influence ; that is , in alarming members of Parliament about its vote . It hangs over the heads of the legislators in terrorem , in closely divided constituencies , but does not often make its way into Parliament itself , though those of its members who have been elected seem to acquit themselves very creditably . Thirty Years of Colonial Government . From the Official Papers of Sir G. F. Bowen . The first strong resemblance between our experience and that of the Australians is to be found in the educational system . The first attempts at popular education , as might have been expected , were made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had official recognition in the early days of the colonies . All money voted by the government for this purpose was given to the clergy and distributed by them . The instruction was mainly religious , and the catechism and reading of the Scriptures in the Protestant version played a prominent part in it . From the beginning , the opposition to this , on the part of all the other denominations , was very strong . As in America , the opposition of the Catholics was not directed against denominational teaching . They were willing to have the state money equally divided among the clergy , so that each denomination might control the instruction given to its own children . To this plan all the other denominations , except the Anglicans , were violently hostile ; so that on this question the Protestant Episcopalians and the Catholics were united . Their clergy wanted the state money for their own kind of education , while those of other denominations were in favor of secular education , or common schools , paid for largely by the state , though not wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the history of the struggle which resulted in the establishment of state schools , with secular teaching . It bore a close resemblance to our own struggle , but differed in having for the efforts of the Protestant Episcopalians powerful support from the home government , which then , as now , sympathized with denominational teaching . It ended , finally , in the triumph of the secular schools . Secular education seems to be the established democratic method of teaching the young , though the desire of the clergy to keep control of education is giving it an anti-religious trend in some countries , - // France , for instance . The agitation of this subject in Australia has brought out the interesting fact that the Catholic population , almost wholly Irish and very large , sides with the priests on nearly every public question , the educational question among others . This is exactly what has occurred in England . In the late conflict over the schools in England , the Irish voted with the Tories in favor of denominational teaching . Like most national oddities , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Irish gentry , beginning in Elizabeth 's time , and ending with the Revolution of 1688 , deprived the Irish of their natural political leaders . The new gentry were foreigners in race and religion , and in political sympathies . This threw the people back on the priests , who became their only advisers possessing any education or knowledge of the world , and assumed without difficulty a political leadership which has never been shaken to this day , in spite of the growing activity of the lay element in Irish politics . No Irish layman has , as yet , proved a very successful politician , in the long run , who has not managed to keep the clergy at his back . It may be said that , on the whole , the educational movement in Australia has been controlled by influences common to the rest of the civilized world . In nearly all countries there is a struggle going on - which ended with us many years ago - to wrest the control of the popular schools , wherever they exist , from the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years . No characteristic of the old regime in politics is more prominent than the belief that the priests or ministers only should have charge of the training of youth . Almost the whole history of the educational movement in this century is the history of the efforts of the " Liberals " or " Radicals " to oust them . The Australians resemble us also in having an immense tract of land at the disposition of the state . They came into possession much later , when waste lands were more accessible , before they were covered by traditions of any sort , and when the air had become charged with the spirit of experimentation . They have accordingly tried to do various things with the land , which we never thought of . South Australia , for instance , had the plan of giving grants of land to small coiperative associations , to be managed by trustees , and supplied with capital by a loan from the state of not more than $250 a head . The state , in short , agreed to do what our Populists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmers at a low rate of interest . Some of these associations were plainly communistic , and the members were often brought together simply by poverty . As a whole , they have not succeeded . Some have broken up ; others remain and pay the government its interest , but no one expects that it will ever get back the principal . In New South Wales , the state became a landlord on an extensive scale omi the Henry George plan , and the question of rents then grew into a great political question . Political " pressure " is brought to bear on the fixing of the rents , and the management , of course , gives a very large field for " pulls " and " influence . " In Queensland , which has a tropical sugar region , not only have lands been rented by the state , but cheap carriage has been provided for farm and dairy produce on the state railway , bonuses have been paid on the export of dairy produce , advances have been made to the proprietors of works for freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depots in London for the receipt and distribution of frozen meat . One act makes provision , under certain conditions , for a state guarantee for loans contracted to build sugar-works . In New Zealand , there is a graduated tax intended to crush out large landholders ; but any landholder who is dissatisfied with his assessment can require the government // to purchase at its own valuation , and land is rented in small holdings . The government has also borrowed large sums of money to lend to farmers on mortgage . It sends lecturers on buttermaking and fruit - growing around the country . It pays wages to labor associations who choose to settle on state lands and clear or improve them , and then allows them to take up the holdings thus improved . It keeps a " state farm , " on which it gives work to the unemployed . All these things , of course , give it a great number of favors to bestow or withhold , and open a wide field for political intrigue . As a general rule , the suffrage is adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters for the upper houses of the legislatures , answering to our Senates . Members of both houses are paid a small salary . At first they all served voluntarily , as in England , and the payment of members was not brought about without a good deal of agitation . But the argument which carried the day for payment was , not , as might be supposed , the justice of giving poor men a chance of seats , but the necessity , in a busy community , of securing for the work of government the services of many competent men who could not afford to give their time without pay . The " plum " idea of a seat in the legislature can hardly be said to have made its appearance yet . The necessity of doing something for " labor " very soon became prominent in colonial policy , and one of its first triumphs was the contraction of very large loans in England for the construction of public works , mainly railroads and common roads , the creation of village settlements and the advance of money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , was tremendous financial collapse , and the discharge of large bodies of the very laborers for whose benefit the works were undertaken . This calamity seems to have stimulated the tendency to tax the rich heavily , and to fos ter the policy of protection . Trade is promoted not simply by duties on imports , but by state aid to exports . A depot in London , which does not pay its own expenses , takes charge of Australian goods and guarantees their quality ; bonuses are given to particular classes of producers , and there is even talk of a " produce export department " of the government . The protectionist policy has taken possession of the Australian mind even more firmly than it has taken possession of the mind of the Republican party here . A free-trader comes nearer being looked upon as a " crank " in most of the colonies than be does here . But the " infant industry " there has solid claims to nurture which it does not possess in this country . In fact , the dominance of the protectionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles in the promotion of the proposed Australian confederation , as no colony is quite willing to give up its right to tax imports from all the others , and still less is it willing to join Mr. Chamberlain 's followers and let in free the goods of the mother country . We may conjecture from this what obstacles the policy of free internal trade between our states would have met with at the foundation of our government , bad America been more of a manufacturing community , and had intercommunication been easier . The difficulty of carriage a hundred years ago formed a natural tariff , which made the competition of foreigners seem comparatively unimportant . From the bestowal of responsible government in the fifties , down to 1893 , nearly all the colonies reveled in the ease with which they could borrow money in England . There was a great rush to make state railroads , in order to open up the lands of the great landholders to projects favored by labor , and to give employment to workinginen ; and , after the railroads were made , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came an enormous development of // the civil service , somewhat like our increase of pensions . New South Wales alone had 200,000 persons in government offices , at a salary of $13,000,000 , and 10,000 railroad employees to boot . This gave the ministries for the time being great influence , which was increased by the fact that the state was the owner of large tracts of land , which it rented on favorable terms to favored tenants . The excitement of apparent prosperity , too , brought into the legislature large numbers of men to whom salary was important , and the result was perhaps the first serious decline in the character of the Australian governments . The colonies were founded between 1788 and 1855 . Up to this time they have spent $800,000,000 on public works . They have made 80,000 miles of telegraph , and 10,000 miles of railway . Though they have a revenue of only $117,500,000 they have already a debt of $875,000,000 . These " good times " came to their natural end . By 1893 the money was all spent , the taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalists refused further advances , the banks failed on all sides , and the colonies were left with large numbers of unemployed on their hands . There was nothing for it but to spend more money on " relief works , " and to keep almost permanently in the employment of the state large bodies of men , who liked it simply because it was easy , and because hard times were a sufficient excuse for seeking it . What one learns from the experience of the colonies in the matter of expenditure is the difficulty , in a democratic government , of moderation of any description , if it once abandons the policy of laisse*faire , and undertakes to be a providence for the masses . There is no limit to the human appetite for unearned or easily earned money . No class is exempt from it . Under the old regime , the aristocrats got all the sinecures , the pensions , and the light jobs of every description . One of the results of the triumph of democracy has been to throw open this source of gratification to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitude , in this field , has failed . When the French opened the national workshops in Paris in 1848 , the government speedily found that it was likely to have the whole working class of Paris on its hands ; when we started our pension list , we found that peace soon became nearly as expensive as war ; and when the Australians undertook to develop the country on money borrowed by the state , there was no restraint on their expenditure , except the inability to find any more lenders . The Australian financial crisis was brought about , not by any popular perception that the day of reckoning was at hand , but by the refusal of the British capitalists to make further loans . Australian experience seems in many ways to prove the value of our system of written constitutions , to be construed and enforced by the courts . The effect on the minds of ill-informed legislators of the knowledge that they can do anything for which they can get a majority , is naturally to beget extravagance and an overweening sense of power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister can do as he pleases has a tendency to increase the exactions of the extremists of every party . The Henry George system of taxation , for instance , could be put into execution in any Australian colony , at any moment , by a mere act of the legislature . The right to vote could be given to women , and has been given in New Zealand . The state can make any number of lines of railroad it pleases , pay for them out of the taxes , and carry poor men on them free . In fact , it can promote any scheme , however speculative , that may take hold of the popular fancy . It is in devices for the protection of labor that most of this experimentation occurs . New Zealand affords the best example of it . It provides elaborate legal // protection for the eight-hour day . A workman can not consent to work overtime without extra pay . The state sees that he gets the extra pay . Jt looks closely after the condition of women and children in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the registry offices for getting them places . It prescribes one half-holiday a week for all persons employed in stores and offices , and sees that they take it . It will not allow even a shopkeeper who has no employees to dispense with his half-holiday ; because if he does not take it , his competition will injure those who do . The " labor department " of the government has au army of inspectors , who keep a close watch on stores and factories , and prosecute violations of the law which they themselves discover . They do not wait for complaints ; they ferret out infractions , so that the laborer may not have to prejudice himself by making charges . The department publishes a " journal " once a month , which gives detailed reports of the condition of the labor market in all parts of the colony , and of the prosecutions which have taken place anywhere of employers who have violated the law . It provides insurance for old age and early death , and guarantees every policy . It gives larger policies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depreciates the private offices in its documents . It distributes the profits of its business as bonuses among the policyholders , and keeps a separate account for teetotalers , so that they may get special advantages from their abstinence . The " journal " is , in fact , in a certain sense a labor manual , in which everything pertaining to the comfort of labor is freely discussed . The poor accommodation provided for servants in hotels and restaurants is deplored , and so is the difficulty which middle-aged men have of employers are exposed and punished . If they keep the factory door fastened , they are fined . If housekeepers pretend that their servants are lodgers , and therefore not liable to a compulsory half-holiday , they are fined . If manufacturers are caught allowing girls to take their meals in a workshop , they are fined . As far as I can make out , too , without visiting the country , there is as yet no sign of reaction against this minute paternal care of the laborer . The tendency to use the powers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working classes , whether in the matter of land settlement , education , or employment , seems to undergo no diminution . The only thing which has ceased , or slackened , is the borrowing of money for improvements . The results of this borrowing have been so disastrous that the present generation , at least , will hardly try that experiment again . Every new country possessing a great body of undeveloped resources , like those of the North American continent and of Australia , must rely largely on foreign capital for the working of its mines and the making of its railroads . In this country all that work has been left to private enterprise , or , in other words , to the activity of individuals and corporations . Apart from some recent landgrants to railroads and the sale of public lands at low rates , it may be said that our government has done nothing whatever to promote the growth of the national wealth and population . The battle with nature , on this continent , has been fought mainly by individuals . The state in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying education and security . Down to a very recent period the American was distinguished from the men of all other countries for looking to the government for nothing but protection to life and property . Tocqueville remarked strongly on this , when he visited the United States in the thirties . This habit has been a good deal broken up by the growth of the wage-earning class // since the war , by the greatly increased reliance on the tariff , and by the government issue of paper money during the rebellion . In the eyes of many , these things have worked a change in the national character . But we are still a great distance from the Australian policy . The development of the country by the state , in the Australian sense , has only recently entered into the heads of our labor and socialist agitators . The American plan has hitherto been to facilitate private activity , to make rising in the world easy for the energetic individual , and to load him with praise and influence after he has risen . This policy has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the individual has become too powerful , and the government too subservient to private interests . There are , in fact , few , if any states in the Union which are not said to he dominated by rich men or rich corporations . This is a not unnatural result of two things . One is , as I have said , our having left the development of the country almost wholly to private enterprises . It is individual capitalists who have worked the mines , made the railroads , invited the immigrants and lent them money to improve their farms . The other is the restrictions which the state constitutions , and the courts construing them , place on the use of the taxes . There are very few things the state in America can constitutionally do with its revenue , coinpared with what European governments can do . Aids to education are tolerated , because education is supposed to equip men more thoroughly for the battle of life , but the American public shrinks from any other use of the public funds for private benefit . We give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or charity , or hospitals . We lend no money . We issued legal tender paper under many protests and in a time of great national trial , have never ceased to regret it , and shall probably never issue any more . We are angry when we find that any one enjoys comforts or luxury at the expense of the state . We can not bear sinecures . But our plunge into pensions since the war shows that there now exists among us the same strong tendency to get things out of the state , and to rely on its bounty , which prevails in Australia . It is difficult to resist the conclusion that at present we owe a good deal of what remains of laissez faire in our policy to our constitutions and courts . We owe the constitutions and the courts to the habits formed in an earlier stage of American history . It was the bad or good fortune of the Australian colonies to enter on political life just as the let-alone policy was declining under the influence of the humanitarian feeling which the rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than was supplied by the enabling acts of the British Parliament was never thought of , and the British Parliament did not think of imposing any restraints on legislation except those which long custom or British opinion imposed on Parliament itself . The result is that Australia is absolutely free to democratic experimentation under extremely favorable circumstances . In each colony the state has apparently existed for the benefit of the working classes , who must always constitute the majority of the people in every community , and the masses have been provided with work and protection , in complete disregard of European traditions . The experiment has turned out pretty well , owing to the abundance of land , the natural wealtl*m of the country , and the fineness of the climate . But each colony is forming its political habits , and I can not resist the conclusion that some of them are habits which are likely to plague the originators hereafter . For instance , the task of finding work for the unemployed , and borrowing money for the purpose , though this generation has seen it fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to again , with no more fortunate results . Nor can I believe // that the growing paternalism , the sedulous care of the business interests of the masses , will not end by diminishing self-reliance , and increasing dependence on the state . The worst effects of these two agencies , of course , in a country of such wonderful resources as Australia , must be long postponed . There are hindrances to progress in the direction of pure " collectivism " yet in existence , many problems to be solved , Old World influences to be got rid of , before Australia finds herself perfectly free from the trammels which the regime of competition still throws around every modern society . But so far as I can judge from the accounts of even the most impartial observers , every tendency which is causing us anxiety or alarm here is at work there , without any hindrance from constitutions ; though there is great comfort among the people , and there is a hopefulness which can not but exist in any new country with immense areas of vacant land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies is the extremely strong hold which the competitive system has taken of the Anglo-Saxon race . There is no other race in which there is still so much of the rude energy of the earlier world , in which men have such joy in rivalry and find it so hard to surrender personal advantages . This renders communal life of any kind , or any species of enforced equality , exceedingly difficult . It will probably endanger the permanence of all the social experimentation in Australia , as soon as this experimentation plainly gives evidence of bestowing special advantages on the weak , or lazy , or unenterprising . There is not in Australia the same extravagant admiration of wealth as a sign of success that there is here , but there are signs of its coming . The state has undertaken to do so many things , however , through which individuals make fortunes here , that its coming may be slow . The wealthy Australian , who dis likes rude colonial ways , and prefers to live in England , is already a prominent figure in London society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an object of great reprobation to the plain Australian , who has not yet " made his pile " and can not go abroad . Then there is a steady growth of national pride , which is displaying itself in all sorts of ways , - in literature , art , and above all athletics , as well as in trade and commerce . The development of athletic and sporting tastes generally is greater than elsewhere , and competition is the life of athletics . An athlete is of little account until he has beaten somebody in something . " The record " is the record of superiority of somebody in something over other people . The " duffer " is the man who can never win anything . The climate helps to foster these tastes , and the abundance of everything makes the cultivation of them easy ; but they are tastes which must always make the sinking of superiority - or , in other words , any communal system - difficult . Australia may develop a higher type of character or better equipment for the battle of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to develop any new form of society . When the struggle grows keener , we are not likely to see a corresponding growth of state aid . The very rapidity of the experimentation now going on promises to bring about illuminating crises earlier there than here . Probably we shall not get our currency experience here for many years to come . Were the Australians engaged in trying our problem , they would reach a solution in one or two years . We are likely in the next hundred years to see a great many new social ventures tried , something which the wreck of authority makes almost inevitable ; but there seems no reason to believe that the desire of the Anglo-Saxon variety of human nature to profit by superiority in any quality will disappear . The cabmet // system of government is in itself a strong support to individuality , for reasons I have already given . Another steadying influence in Australia , perhaps one of the most powerful in a democratic community , is the press . The press , from all I can learn , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large space to athletics and similar amusements , but seems to have retained a high and potent position in the discussions of the day . The love of triviality which has descended on the American press like a flood , since the war , has apparently passed by that of Australia . Why this should be I confess I have not been able to discover , and can hardly conjecture . If we judge by what has happened in America , it would be easy to conclude that the press in all democracies is sure to become somewhat puerile , easily occupied with small things , and prone to flippant treatment of great subjects . This is true of the French press , in a way ; but in that case something of the tendency may be ascribed to temperament , and something to want of practice in self-government . I can not see any signs of it in the country press in England . That , so far as I have been able to observe , continues grave , decorous , and mature . There is nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weight which still attaches to the tastes and opinions of an educated upper class may account for this in some degree , but the fact is that Australian journals have preserved these very characteristics , although the beginnings of Australian journalism were as bad as possible . Its earliest editing was done by ex-convicts , and the journals which these men set on foot were very like those that have the worst reputation among us for venality and triviality . Strange to say , the community did not sit down under them . There was an immediate rising against this sort of editors in New South Wales . Their control of leading newspapers was treated as a scandal too great to be borne , and they were driven out of the profession . The newspapers then passed largely into the hands of young university men who had come out from England to seek their fortunes ; they gave journalism a tone which has lasted till now . The opinions of the press still count in politics . It can still discredit or overthrow a ministry , because the duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that , in turn , depends on the opinion of the public . There can be no defiant boss , indifferent to what the public thinks , provided he has " got the delegates . " In fact , the Australian system seems better adapted to the maintenance of really independent and influential journals than ours . The fixed terms of executive officers and the boss system of nomination are almost fatal to newspaper power . So long as results can not be achieved quickly , the influence of the press must be feeble . Of course , in speaking of a country which one does not know personally , one must speak very cautiously . All impressions one gets from books need correction by actual observation , particularly in the case of a country in which changes are so rapid as in Australia . Of this rapidity every traveler and writer I have consulted makes mention , and every traveler soon finds his book out of date . Sir Charles Dilke visited Australia about 1870 , but writing in 1890 lie dwells on the enormous differences of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on Australia , Mr. Walker 's Australasian Democracy , gives as an illustration of this transientness of everything the fact that the three colonies of New South Wales , South Australia , and Victoria have had respectively twenty-eight , forty-two , and twenty-six ministries in forty years . One can readily imagine how many changes of policy on all sorts of subjects , and how many changes of men , these figures represent . All travelers , // too , bear testimony to the optimism of the people in every colony . Nothing is more depressing in a new country than officialism , or management of public affairs by irresponsible rulers . From this the Anglo-Saxons have always enjoyed freedom in their new countries . The result has always been free play for individual energy and initiative ; and with boundless resources , as in America and Australia , these qualities are sure to bring cheerfulness of temperament . The mass of men are better off each year , NOTE . As I have endeavored to give in This article impressions rather than facts , I have not thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will simply say that I have formed these inipressions from perusal of the following works : The Australian Colonies in 1896 , E. A. Petherick , 1897 ; New Zealand Rulers and Statesmen , 1840-97 , William Gisborne ; Oceana , J. A. Froude , 1886 ; Queensland , Rev. John D. Lang , D. D. , 1864 ; The Coming Commonwealth , R. R. Garlan , 1897 ; The Aus mistakes are not serious , mutual helpfulness is the leading note of the community , nobody is looked down on by anybody , and public opinion is all powerful . In Australia there is more reason for this , as yet , than with us . The Australians are not tormented by a race question , they have never had any civil strife , and they have not yet come into contact with that greatest difficulty of large democracies , the difficulty of coinmunicating to the mass common ideas and impulses.
