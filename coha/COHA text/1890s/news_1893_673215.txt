txt Wall Street 's interest in the gold situation was not suffered to flag yesterday . In fact , it was rather increased by a report from Washington that Secretary Carlisle had . secured promises of enough gold to restore the reserve to the hundred-million mark and by a meeting of bank Presidents in this city which approached the dignity of a conference on the financial problems . of the Nation . Conrad N. Jordan . the new Assistant Treasurer in this city , was sworn in yesterday , but ho did not assume charge of the Sub-Treasury . As he had just returned from Washington , and was believed to be well posted on the intentions of the Administration , there was much speculation early in the , day on the probability of his trying to stir up the New-York banks to do something to assist the Treasury in meeting the exporters ' calls for gold . In the afternoon he met the heads of some of the biggest of the banks . It was not a formal assembly , but was brought about by invitations sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rooms of the Clearing House . Among those to whom invitations were sent were George G. Williams of the Chemical National , Chairman of the Clearing House Association ; George S. Coe of the American Exchange National , Ebenezer K. Wright of the Park National , George F. Baker of the First National , Brayton Ives of the Western National , James Stillman of the National City Bank , James T. Woodward of the Hanover National , J. Edward Simmons of the Fourth National , William A. Nash of the Corn Exchange , R. M. Gallaway of the Merchants ? National , and E. H. Perkins , Jr. , of the Importers and . Traders ' National . Mr. Stillman was not there and Mr. Coe was not in the city . The meeting , according to the best information obtainable , resulted in a general discussion of the situation . The bankers believed that the Government should meet its obligations in gold at all hazards , a view with which Mr. Jordan is believed to coincide . First of all , however . the Presidents wanted to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to have it make a decided statement of its policy , on the ground that without a clear understanding of what plan was to he followed the banks could do very little : Secretary Carlisle is now expected to come to this city to see the naval parade . While ho is here , the hankers hope to get light on matters now in darkness . The Washington dispatches . which said that the Secretary bad been able to restore the reserve , added that he declined to tell what banks had helped him . To put the fund ' at $100,000,000 again , it was estimated , four or five millions in gold would be needed . Such an amount would naturally be sought in this city , outside of which Chicago was regarded as the place most likely to be able to furnish it . brit the New-York bankers were not believed to have come forward with the coin . At the Sub-Treasury the gold received from banks was given as $100,000 . That was the amount which was offered on Friday by the German Exchange Bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exporters again did business with the . Sub-Treasury . Although Saturday withdrawals are rare , they took out $1.100,000 of its gold , in exchange for which they paid in $800,000 in legal tenders ; and $300.000 in Treasury notes . The Sub-Treasury , as usual , made no discrimination against Treasury notes . Heidelbach. lekelhehner Co. took $700,000. the other $400,000 being withdrawn by the Canadian banks , which , in the last three days , have developed a great , craving for American gold , and have taken a great deal of it from the Sub-Treasury . As was expected , all the coin withdrawn for export yesterday did not go out on the Saturday fleet of European steamers . Some of it was held over until Tuesday , but about $4,250,000 , it was estimated , was shipped . The precious freight was divided among three steamers , the French liner La Champagne , on this basis , carrying over $2.000,000 , the Elbe over $1,500,000 , and the New-York about $500,000 . These figures may , however , be increased by supplementary returns at the Custon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impaired reserve , the Treasury was paying gold for Treasury notes in some degree lessened European anxiety to get coin , all the indications pointed to heavy exports on Tuesday . Besides the amount left over from yesterday . there will be over $2,000 , - 000 sent out of the country that day , unless there is a material change in the Wens of the shipping houses . In one or two cases yesterday , arrangements which had been made to withdraw gold on Monday were canceled . In these instances , halfmillion lots were to have been taken . In these times the proportion of gold in the Government 's income is watched closely . The report of the customs receipts for the ten days ending April 20 was made up yesterday . It showed that only one-tenth of 1 per cent . was in gold coin ; 4 per cent . was in gold certificates , 20.1 per cent . in silver certificates , 47.0 per cent . in United States notes , and 28.2 per cent . in Treasury notes . On their face these figures do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for the scare and the rash of the last three days to put them in , the Treasury notes would have formed a much smaller percentage of the total . As it was , they came in large amounts in the last half of the week , persons withdrawing gold naturally preferring to use them before offering greenbacks , and thus offering another evidence of the prevailing nervousness . Regarding the Treasury 's gains of gold beyond the Alleghanies , various reports are current . In one instance , at least , according to a story told in the Street yesterday , " patriotism " was made profitable . Secretary Carlisle , the gossip ran , being anxious to add to his stock of gold in the South and West , received among other offers of assistance , one to deposit yellow metal in San Francisco . It was accepted , gold was turned into the San Francisco Sub-Treasurv , and payment for it in this city was authorized by telegram .

Mr. Jordan will take charge of the SubTreasury on Monday , and then the count of the stock of money in the establishment will begin . It will probably keep the experts busy for three weeks . Their force is directed by G. C. Bartz. receiving teller of the Treasurer 's office in Washington , and is made up of James A. Sample , Albert Relyea , Sherman Platt , Robert H. Forsyth , Isaac N.
