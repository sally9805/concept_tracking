txt The repeal bill was the occasion yesterday of a blow to the " courtesy of the Senate " which to the venerable adorers of that venerable idol must have seemed shocking . Mr. MORGAN had submitted to the Senate a series of resolutions providing for the practical dismissal of the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Banking and Currency Committee of the House and their replacement by a joint committee with instructions thoroughly to investigate about everything relating to money , and with authority to add to anything that might have been overlooked by the Senator . When he had finished a long , long speech on this subject . or these subjects , Mr. VooRanzs rudely moved to take up the repeal bill , and the Senate , by a vote of 37 to 21 , adopted the motion . Mr. MoaGa.N protested in vain against this as " unfair , " but while it may seem so to biro , pretty nearly all the rest of the Amerlean people will approve of it . Mayor BOODY has addressed an open letter , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an expression of temper rather than of thought , and reviews at much length many facts not involved in Mr. SHEPAlas recent article inthe Forum , to the exclusion of nearly all that were there referred to . This deprives the communication of much interest that the Mayor might otherwise have given it . One matter , however , the Mayor does allude to , and that is the general opinion that he had abandoned the notion of an independent policy in the Mayor 's office . He denies that he ever entertained such a notion . Alluding to the fact that he was elected in the year before s President , and in " a square contest between the two parties , " he says : " After Atoll an election for me to have attempted to administer the Government on the line of an independent policy would have been as much a violation of honor as for a Presidential Elector to ignore the implied obligation to vote for a certain candidate for President . " After such an admission the rest of Mr. BOOM 'S letter is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a libel suit should set forth in his complaint that he had no reputation to be damaged . Thu success , from a military point of view , of the manomvres in Lorraine emboldened the German Emperor to make a very " cock-a-hoop " and a not very judicious speech at a banquet given by the German officials of the province . Lorraine , he remarked , " would remain forever German . protected by God and the German sword , " which is as much as to say thatthe German sword would prevent Lorraine from relapsing to France , according to the desires of the population . This is very possibly the German sentiment , though it is certain that a German Alsace and Lorraine will be a standing menace to the peace of Europe for years , if not for generations yet to come . But , nevertheless , the proclamation of the sentiment by a responsible ruler was a nagging and defiant performance which might much better have been omitted by an Emperor who professes him ; self to be , and who doubtless is , averse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pleasant to find that , in spite of the evil presages of former Newfoundland rumors , PEARY is well established in his Winter quarters at the head of Bowdoin Bay , whence he will make his great overlandjourney next Spring . There was plenty of discouragement in those St. John 's stories ? his donkeys were dead ; he could get no dogs ; he had delayed until Melville Sound might be closed against him , thus risking a whole season . But we pow learn that he got dogs in Labrador and plenty more in Greenland ; that he made the quickest passage on record across Melville Sound , and that he reached his destination as early as Aug. 3 , or several weeks sooner than was necessary , since the Falcon did not start on her return trip until Aug. 20 , and appears to have had no trouble .
