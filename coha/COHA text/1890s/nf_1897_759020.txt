Nations that have owned our Soil. %  --  Before the United States became a nation , six European powers owned , or claimed to own , various portions of the territory now contained within its boundary . England claimed the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida . Spain once held Florida , Texas , California , and all the territory south and west of Colorado . France in days gone by ruled the Mississippi valley . Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hudson in New York , and claimed as far eastward as the Connecticut river . The Swedes had settlements on the Delaware . Alaska was a Russian possession . Before attempting to narrate the history of our country , it is necessary , therefore , to tell 1 . How European nations came into possession of parts of it . 2 . How these parts passed from them to us. 3 . What effect the ownership of parts of our country by Europeans had on our history and institutions before 1776. %2 . European Trade with the East ; the Old Routes. %  --  For two hundred years before North and South America were known to exist , a splendid trade had been going on between Europe and the East Indies . Ships loaded with metals , woods , and pitch went from European seaports to Alexandria and Constantinople , and brought back silks and cashmeres , muslins , dyewoods , spices , perfumes , ivory , precious stones , and pearls . This trade in course of time had come to be controlled by the two Italian cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ships to Constantinople and the ports of the Black Sea , where they took on board the rich fabrics and spices which by boats and by caravans had come up the valley of the Euphrates and the Tigris from the Persian Gulf . The men of Venice , on the other hand , sent their vessels to Alexandria , and carried on their trade with the East through the Red Sea . Illustration : Routes to India %3 . New Routes wanted. %  --  Splendid as this trade was , however , it was doomed to destruction . Slowly , but surely , the Turks thrust themselves across the caravan routes , cutting off one by one the great feeders of the Oriental trade , till , with the capture of Constantinople in 1453 , they destroyed the commercial career of Genoa . As their power was spreading rapidly over Syria and toward Egypt , the prosperity of Venice , in turn , was threatened . The day seemed near when all trade between the Indies and Europe would be ended , and men began to ask if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , it happened that just at this time the Portuguese were hard at work on the discovery of such a route , and were slowly pushing their way down the western coast of Africa . But as league after league of that coast was discovered , it was thought that the route to India by way of Africa was too long for the purposes of commerce. 1 Then came the question , Is there not a shorter route ? and this Columbus tried to answer . Footnote 1 : Read the account of Portuguese exploration in search of a way to India , in Fiske 's Discovery of America , Vol . I. , pp. 274-334. %4 . Columbus seeks the East and finds America. %2  --  Columbus was a native of Genoa , in Italy . He began a seafaring life at fourteen , and in the intervals between his voyages made maps and globes . As Portugal was then the center of nautical enterprise , he wandered there about 1470 , and probably went on one or two voyages down the coast of Africa . In 1473 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the King of Portugal 's famous navigators , and had left behind him at his death a quantity of charts and notes ; and it was while Columbus was studying them that the idea of seeking the Indies by sailing due westward seems to have first started in his mind . But many a year went by , and many a hardship had to be borne , and many an insult patiently endured in poverty and distress , before the Friday morning in August , 1492 , when his three caravels , the Santa Maria ( sahn ' - tah mah-ree ' - ah ) , the Pinta ( peen ' - tah ) , and the Nina ( neen ' - yah ) , sailed from the port of Palos ( pah ' - los ) , in Spain . Footnote 2 : There is reason to believe that about the year 1000 A.D. the northeast coast of America was discovered by a Norse voyager named Leif Ericsson . The records are very meager ; but the discovery of our country by such a people is possible and not improbable . For an account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vol . I. , pp. 148-255 . Illustration : Santa Maria His course led first to the Canary Islands , where he turned and went directly westward . The earth was not then generally believed to be round . Men supposed it to be flat , and the only parts of it known to Europeans were Iceland , the British Isles , the continent of Europe , a small part of Asia , and a strip along the coast of the northern part of Africa . The ocean on which Columbus was now embarked , and which in our time is crossed in less than a week , was then utterly unknown , and was well named " The Sea of Darkness . " Little wonder , then , that as the shores of the last of the Canaries sank out of sight on the 9th of September , many of the sailors wept , wailed , and loudly bemoaned their cruel fate . After sailing for what seemed a very long time , they saw signs of land . But when no land appeared , their hopes gave way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force him to return . Illustration : Nina But he calmed their fears , explained the sights they could not understand , hid from them the true distance sailed , and kept steadily on westward till October 7 , when a flock of land birds were seen flying to the southwest . Pinzon ( peen-thon ' ) , who commanded one of the vessels , begged Columbus to follow the birds , as they seemed to be going toward land . Had the little fleet kept on its way , it would have brought up on the coast of Florida . But Columbus yielded to Pinzon . The ships were headed southwestward , and about ten o'clock on the night of October 11 , Columbus saw a light moving in the distance . It was made by the inhabitants going from hut to hut on a neighboring coast . At dawn the shore itself was seen by a sailor , and Columbus , followed by many of his men , hastened to the beach , where , October 12 , 1492 , he raised a huge cross , and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella , King and Queen of Spain , who had supplied him with caravels and men. 1 He had landed on one of a group of islands which we call the Bahamas. 2 Footnote 1 : Columbus called the new land San Salvador ( sahn sahl-vah-dor ' , Holy Savior ) , because October 12 , the day on which it was discovered , was so named in the Spanish calendar . Footnote 2 : Three islands of this group , Cat , Turks , and Watlings , have rival claims as the landing place of Columbus . At present , Watlings Island is believed to be the one on which he first set foot . Read an account of the voyage in Fiske 's Discovery of America , Vol . I. , pp. 408-442 ; Irving 's Life and Voyages of Columbus , Vol . I. , Book III . Illustration : Coat of arms of Columbus During ten days he sailed among these islands . Then , turning southward , he coasted along Cuba to the eastern end , and so to Haiti , which he named Hispaniola , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Pinta had by this time deserted him , and , as the Nina could not carry all the men , forty were left at Hispaniola , to found the first colony of Europeans in the New World . Giving the men food enough to last a year , Columbus set sail for Spain on the 3d of January , 1493 , and on March 15 was safe at Palos . Of the greatness of his discovery , Columbus had not the faintest idea . That he had found a new world ; that a continent was blocking his way to the East , never entered his mind . He supposed he had landed on some islands off the east coast of Asia , and as that coast was called the Indies , and as the islands were reached by sailing westward , they came to be called the West Indies , and their inhabitants Indians ; and the native races of the New World have ever since been called Indians . Although Columbus in after years made three more voyages to the New World , he never found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had discovered a direct route to Asia. 1 Footnote 1 : Columbus began his second voyage in September , 1493 , and discovered Jamaica , Porto Rico ( por ' - to ree ' - co ) , and the islands of the Caribbean Sea . On his third voyage , in 1498 , he discovered the island of Trinidad , off the coast of Venezuela , and saw South America at the mouth of the Orinoco River . During his fourth and last voyage , 1502-1504 , he explored the shores of Honduras and the Isthmus of Panama in search of a strait leading to the Indian Ocean . Of course he did not find it , and , going back to Spain , he died poor and broken-hearted on May 20 , 1506. %5 . The Atlantic Coast explored. %  --  And now that Columbus had shown the way , others were quick to follow . In 1497 and 1498 came John and Sebastian Cabot ( cab ' - ot ) , sailing under the flag of England , and exploring our coast from Labrador to Cape Cod ; and Pinzon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag of Spain along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , around the peninsula of Florida , and northward to Chesapeake Bay . Between 1500 and 1502 two Portuguese navigators named Cortereal ( cor-ta-ra-ahl ' ) went over much the same ground as the Cabots . For the time being , however , these voyages were fruitless . It was not a new world , but China and Japan , the Indian Ocean , and the spice islands , that Europe was seeking . When , therefore , in 1497 , Vasco da Gama sailed from Lisbon , passed around the end of Africa , reached India , and came back to Portugal in 1499 with his ship laden with the silks and spices of the East , all explorers turned southward , and for eleven years after the visit of the Cortereals no voyages were made to North America . Footnote 2 : As this man was an Italian , his name was really Amerigo Vespucci ( ah-ma ' - ree- go ves-poot ' - chee ) , but it is usually given in its Latinized form , Americus Vespucius ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why the Continent was called America. %  --  But some great voyages meantime were made to South America . In 1500 a Portuguese fleet of thirteen vessels , commanded by Cabral , started from Portugal for the East . In place of following the usual route and hugging the west coast of Africa , Cabral went off so far to the westward that one day in April , 1500 , he was amazed to see land . It proved to be what is now Brazil , and after sailing along a little way he sent one of his vessels home to Portugal with the news . Illustration : %DISCOVERY% ON THE EAST COAST OF %AMERICA% He did this because six years before , in June , 1494 , Spain and Portugal made a treaty and agreed that a meridian should be drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands and be known as " The Line of Demarcation " All heathen lands discovered , no matter by whom , to the east of this line , were to belong to Portugal ; all to the west of it were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange coast seemed to be east of the line of demarcation , and therefore the property of Portugal , Cabral sent word to the King that he might explore it . Accordingly , in May , 1501 , the King sent out three ships in charge of Americus Vespucius . Vespucius sighted the coast somewhere about Cape St. Roque , and , finding that it was east of the line of demarcation , explored it southward as far as the mouth of the river La Plata . As he was then west of the line , and off a coast which belonged to Spain , he turned and sailed southeastward till he struck the island of South Georgia , where the Antarctic cold and the fields of floating ice stopped him and sent him back to Lisbon . The results of this great voyage were many . In the first place , it secured Brazil for Portugal . In the second place , it changed the geographical ideas of the time . The great length of coast line explored proved that the land was not a mere island , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  off the coast of Asia , as was then supposed . This for a time was called the " Fourth Part " of the world ,  --  the other three parts being Europe , Asia , and Africa . But in 1507 a German professor published a little book on geography , in which he suggested that the new part of the world discovered by Americus , the part which we call Brazil , should be called America . As Columbus was not supposed to have discovered a new world , but merely a new route to Asia , this suggestion seemed very proper , and soon the word " America " began to appear on maps as the name of Brazil . After a while it was applied to all South America , and finally to North America also . %7 . The Pacific discovered ; the Mexican Gulf Coast explored. %  --  A few years after the publication of the little book which gave the New World the name of America , a Spaniard named Balboa landed on the Isthmus of Panama , crossed it ( 1513 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless expanse of blue water , which he called the South Sea , because when he first saw it he was looking south . Meantime another Spaniard , named Ponce de Leon ( pon'tha da la-on ' ) , sailed with three ships from Porto Rico , in March , 1513 , and on the 27th of that month came in sight of the mainland . As the day was Easter Sunday , which the Spaniards call Pascua ( pas ' - coo- ah ) Florida , he called the country Florida . Illustration : Map of 15151 Footnote 1 : Showing what was then supposed to be the shape and position of the newly discovered lands . Six years later ( 1519 ) Pineda ( pe-na ' - da ) skirted the shores of the Gulf from Florida to Mexico . %8 . Spaniards sail round the World. %  --  In the same year ( 1519 ) that Pineda explored the Gulf coast , a Portuguese named Magellan ( ma-jel ' - an ) led a Spanish fleet across the Atlantic . He coasted along South America to Tierra del Fuego , entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western coast , and turning westward sailed toward India . He was then on the ocean which Balboa had discovered and named the South Sea . But Magellan found it so much smoother than the Atlantic that he called it the Pacific . Five ships and 254 men left Spain ; but only one ship and fifteen men returned to Spain by way of India and Cape of Good Hope . Magellan himself was among the dead. 1 Footnote 1 : Magellan was killed by the natives of one of the Philippine Islands . The captain of the ship which made the voyage was greatly honored . The King of Spain ennobled him , and on his coat of arms was a globe representing the earth , and on it the motto " You first sailed round me. " %9 .

Search for a Northwest Passage ; our North Atlantic Coast explored. %  --  All eyes , therefore , turned northward ; the quest for a northwest passage began , and in that quest the Atlantic coast of the United States was examined most thoroughly . SUMMARY 1 . Towards the close of the fifteenth century the Turks cut off the old route of trade between Asia and Europe . 2 . In attempting to find a new way to Asia , the Portuguese then began to explore the west coast of Africa . 3 . When at last they got well down the African coast it was thought that such a route was too long . 4 .

The Spaniards explore the Southwest. %  --  Now it must be noticed that up to 1513 no European had explored the interior of either North or South America . They had merely touched the shores . In 1513 the work of exploration began . Balboa then crossed the Isthmus of Panama . In 1519 Cortes ( cor ' - tez ) landed on the coast of Mexico with a body of men , and marched boldly into the heart of the country to the city where lived the great Indian chief or king , Montezuma . Cortes took the city and made himself master of Mexico . This was most important ; for the conquest of Mexico turned the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally led to the exploration of the Southwest . But the first explorers of what is now the United States came from Cuba in 1528 . Illustration : Map of 1530 , Sloane MS. 1 Footnote 1 : Notice that the two continents begin to take shape , and that as the result of Magellan 's voyage is not generally known , North America is placed very near to Java . In that year Narvaez ( nar-vah-eth ) , excited by Pineda 's accounts of the Mississippi Indians and their golden ornaments , set forth with 400 men to conquer the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico . At Apalachee Bay he landed , and made a raid inland . On returning to the shore , he missed his ships , and after traveling westward on foot for a month , built five rude vessels , and once more put to sea . For six weeks the little fleet hugged the shore , till it came to the mouth of the Mississippi , where two of the boats were upset and Narvaez was drowned . The rest reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomahawk soon reduced the number of the survivors to four . These were captured by bands of wandering Indians , were carried over eastern Texas and western Louisiana , till , after many strange adventures and vicissitudes , they met beyond the Sabine River. 1 Protected by the fame they had won for sorcery , and led by one Cabeza de Vaca , they now wandered westward to the Rio Grande2 ( ree ' -o grahn ' - da ) and on by Chihuahua ( chee-wah ' - wah ) and Sonora to the Gulf of California , and by this to Culiacan , a town near the west coast of Mexico , which they reached in 1536 . They had crossed the continent . Footnote 1 : Now the western boundary of Louisiana . Footnote 2 : Rio Grande del Norte  --  - Great River of the North. %12 . " The Seven Cities of Cibola. " %  --  The story these men told of the strange country through which they had passed , aroused a strong desire in the Spaniards to explore it , for somewhere in that direction they believed were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Arabs invaded the Spanish peninsula , a bishop of Lisbon with many followers fled to a group of islands in the Sea of Darkness , and on them founded seven cities . As one of the Indian tribes had preserved a story of Seven Caves in which their ancestors had once lived , the credulous and romantic Spaniards easily confounded the two legends . Firmly believing that the seven cities must exist in the north country traversed by Vaca , Mendoza , the Spanish governor of Mexico , selected Fray Marcos , a monk of great ability , and sent him forth with a few followers to search for them . Directed by the Indians through whose villages he passed , he came at last in sight of the seven Zuni ( zoo ' - nyee ) pueblos ( pweb ' - loz ) of New Mexico , all of which were inhabited in his time . But he came no nearer than just within sight of them . For one of the party , who went on in advance , having been killed by the Zuni , Fray Marcos hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen to be Cibola ( see ' - bo- la ) , he called the pueblos the " Seven Cities of Cibola , " and against them the next year ( 1540 ) Coronado marched with 1100 men .

Lummis . In it the story of these great journeys is told on pp. 77-88 , 101-143 . Illustration : The kind of cities found by Marcos and Coronado in the Rio Grande valley .

The Spaniards on the Mississippi. %  --  In 1537 De Soto was appointed governor of Cuba , with instructions to conquer and hold all the country discovered by Narvaez .

His followers then built rude boats , floated down the river to the Gulf , steered along the coast of Texas , and in September , 1543 , reached Tampico , in Mexico . More than half a century had now gone by since the first voyage of Columbus . Yet not a settlement , great or small , had been established by Spain within our boundary . Between 1546 and 1561 missionaries twice attempted to found missions and convert the Indians in Florida , and twice were driven away .

Illustration : A Spanish mission %14 . St. Augustine. %  --  St. Augustine was founded by the Spaniards in order to keep out the French , who made two attempts to occupy the south Atlantic coast . The first was that of John Ribault ( ree-bo ' ) . He led a colony of Frenchmen , in 1562 , to what is now South Carolina , built a small fort on a spot which he called Port Royal , and left it in charge of thirty men while he went back to France for more colonists . The men were a shiftless set , depended on the Indians till the Indians would feed them no longer , and when famine set in , they mutinied , slew their commander , built a crazy ship and went to sea , where an English vessel found them in a starving condition , and took them to London . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , landed at the St. Johns River in Florida , and built a fort called Fort Caroline in honor of Charles IX . of France . But the King of Spain , hearing that the French were trespassing , sent an expedition under Menendez ( ma-nen ' - deth ) , who founded St. Augustine in 1565 . There Ribault , who had returned and joined Laudonniere , attempted to attack the Spaniards . But a hurricane scattered his ships , and while it was still raging , Menendez fell suddenly on Fort Caroline and massacred men , women , and children . A few days later , falling in with Ribault and his men , who had been driven ashore south of St. Augustine , Menendez massacred 150 more. 1 For this foul deed a Frenchman named Gourgues ( goorg ) exacted a fearful penalty . With three small ships and 200 men , he sailed to the St. Johns River , took and destroyed the fort which the Spaniards had built on the site of Fort Caroline , and put to death every human being within it .

From 1492 to 1513 the Europeans who came to America explored the coasts of North and South America , but did not go inland . 2 . In 1513 exploration of the interior of the two continents began . Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama , 1513 , and Cortes conquered Mexico , 1519-21. 3 . In 1528 Narvaez made the first serious attempt to enter the Mississippi valley .

The English Claim to the Seaboard. %  --  After the Spaniards had thus explored the coast of the Gulf of Mexico , and what is now Arizona , New Mexico , and Texas , the English attempted to take possession of the Atlantic coast . The voyages of John and Sebastian Cabot in 1497 and 1498 were not followed up in the same way that Spain followed up those of Columbus , and for nearly eighty years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters. 1 At last , in 1576 , Sir Martin Frobisher set out to find a northwest passage to Asia . Of course he failed ; but in that and two later voyages he cruised about the shores of our continent and gave his name to Frobisher 's Bay. 2 Next came Sir Francis Drake , the greatest seaman of his age . He left England in 1577 , crossed the Atlantic , sailed down the South American coast , passed through the Strait of Magellan , and turning northward coasted along South America , Mexico , and California , in search of a northeast passage to the Atlantic . When he had gone as far north as Oregon the weather grew so cold that his men began to murmur , and putting his ship about , he sailed southward along our Pacific coast in search of a harbor , which in June , 1579 , he found near the present city of San Francisco . There he landed , and putting up a post nailed to it a brass plate on which was the name of Queen Elizabeth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short passage to England , Drake finally crossed the Pacific and reached home by way of the Cape of Good Hope . He had sailed around the globe. 4 Footnote 1 : For Cabot 's voyages read Fiske 's Discovery of America , Vol . II. , pp. 2-15 . Footnote 2 : See map of 1515 . Footnote 3 : The white cliffs reminded Drake strongly of the cliffs of Dover , and as one of the old names of England was Albion ( the country of the white cliffs ) , he called the land New Albion . Footnote 4 : For Drake read E.T . Payne 's Voyages of Elizabethan Seamen. %16 . Gilbert and Ralegh attempt to found a Colony. %  --  While Drake was making his voyage , another gallant seaman , Sir Humphrey Gilbert , was given ( by Queen Elizabeth ) any new land he might discover in America .

The explorers landed on Roanoke Island , off the coast of what is now North Carolina , and came home with such a glowing description of the " good land " they had found that the Virgin Queen called it " Virginia , " in honor of herself , and Ralegh determined to colonize it. 1 Footnote 1 : For Ralegh read E. Gosse 's Raleigh ( in English Worthies Series ) ; Louise Creighton 's Sir W. Ralegh ( Historical Biographies Series ) . %17 . Roanoke Colony ; the Potato and Tobacco. %  --  In 1585 , accordingly , 108 emigrants under Ralph Lane left England and began to build a town on Roanoke Island . They were ill suited for this kind of pioneer life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Drake in one of his voyages happened to touch at Roanoke , they would have starved to death . Drake , seeing their helplessness , carried them home to England . Yet their life on the island was not without results , for they took back with them the potato , and some dried tobacco leaves which the Indians had taught them to smoke . Ralegh , of course , was greatly disappointed to see his colonists again in England . But he was not discouraged , and in 1587 sent forth a second band . The first had consisted entirely of men . The second band was composed of both men and women with their families , for it seemed likely that if the men took their wives and children along they would be more likely to remain than if they went alone . John White was the leader , and with a charter and instructions to build the city of Ralegh somewhere on the shores of Chesapeake Bay he set off with his colonists and landed on Roanoke Island . Here a little granddaughter was born ( August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the child of Eleanor Dare , and was the first child born of English parents in America . Illustration : Roanoke Island and vicinity Governor White soon found it necessary to go back to England for supplies , and , in consequence of the Spanish war , three years slipped by before he was able to return to the colony . He was then too late . Every soul had perished , and to this day nobody knows how or where . Ralegh could do no more , and in 1589 made over all his rights to a joint-stock company of merchants . This company did nothing , and the sixteenth century came to an end with no English colony in America. 1 Footnote 1 : Doyle 's English Colonies in America , Virginia , pp. 56-74 ; Bancroft 's History of the United States , Vol .

Instead of following the old route to America by way of the Canary Islands , the West Indies , and Florida , he sailed due west across the Atlantic , 2 and brought up on the shore of a cape which he named Cape Cod. 3 Following the shore southward , he passed through Nantucket Sound and Vineyard Sound , till he came to Cuttyhunk Island , at the entrance of Buzzards Bay . On this he landed , and built a house for the use of colonists he intended to leave there . But when he had filled his ship with sassafras roots and cedar logs , nobody would remain , and the whole company went back to England. 4 Footnote 2 : By thus shortening the journey 3000 miles , he practically brought America 3000 miles nearer to Europe .

The Two Virginia Companies. %  --  As a result of this voyage , Gosnold was more eager than ever to plant a colony in Virginia , and this enthusiasm he communicated so fully to others that , in 1606 , King James I. created two companies to settle in Virginia , which was then the name for all the territory from what is now Maine to Florida . 1 . Each company was to own a block of land 100 miles square ; that is , 100 miles along the coast ,  --  50 miles each way from its first settlement ,  --  and 100 miles into the interior . 2 . The First Company , a band of London merchants , might establish its first settlement anywhere between 34 deg. and 41 deg. north latitude . 3 . The Second Company , a band of Plymouth merchants , might establish its first settlement anywhere between 38 deg. and 45 deg .. 4 . These settlements were to be on the seacoast. 5 .

Each company might coin money , raise a revenue by taxing foreign vessels trading at its ports , punish crime , and make laws which , if bad , could be set aside by the King . All property was to be owned in common , and all the products of the soil deposited in a public magazine from which the needs of the settlers were to be supplied . The surplus was to be sold for the good of the company . The charter is given in full in Poore 's Charters and Constitutions , pp. 1888-1893. %20 . The Jamestown Colony. %  --  Thus empowered , the two companies made all haste to gather funds , collect stores and settlers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to get ready , and on the 19th of December , 1606 , 143 colonists set sail in three ships for America with their charter , and a list of the council sealed up in a strong box . The Plymouth Company soon followed , and before the year 1607 was far advanced , two settlements were planted in our country : the one at Jamestown , in Virginia , the other near the mouth of the Kennebec , in Maine . The latter , however , was abandoned the following year ( see Chapter IV ) . The three ships which carried the Virginia colony reached the coast in the spring of 1607 , and entering Chesapeake Bay sailed up a river which the colonists called the James , in honor of the King . When about thirty miles from its mouth , a landing was made on a little peninsula , where a settlement was begun and named Jamestown. 1 It was the month of May , and as the weather was warm , the colonists did not build houses , but , inside of some rude fortifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till huts could be built . But their food gave out , the Indians were hostile , and before September half of the party had died of fever . Had it not been for the energy and courage of John Smith , every one of them would have perished . He practically assumed command , set the men to building huts , persuaded the Indians to give them food , explored the bays and rivers of Virginia , and for two dreary years held the colony together . When we consider the worthless men he had to deal with , and the hardships and difficulties that beset him , his work is wonderful . The history which he wrote , however , is not to be trusted. 2 Footnote 1 : Nothing now remains of Jamestown but the ruined tower of the church shown in the picture . Much of the land on which the town stood has been washed away by the river , so that its site is now an island .

Illustration : All that is left of Jamestown Bad as matters were , they became worse when a little fleet arrived with many new settlers , making the whole number about 500 . The newcomers were a worthless set picked up in the streets of London or taken from the jails , and utterly unfit to become the founders of a state in the wilderness of the New World . Out of such material Smith in time might have made something , but he was forced by a wound to return to England , and the colony went rapidly to ruin . Sickness and famine did their work so quickly that after six months there were but sixty of the 500 men alive . Then two small ships , under Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers , arrived at Jamestown with more settlers ; but all decided to flee , and had actually sailed a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1610 , they met Lord Delaware with three ships full of men and supplies coming up the river .

Illustration : Vicinity of Jamestown %21 . The Virginia Charter of 1609% made a great change in the boundary of the company 's property . By the 1606 charter the colony was limited to 100 miles along the seaboard and 100 miles west from the coast . In 1609 the company was given an immense domain reaching 400 miles along the coast ,  --  200 miles each way from Old Point Comfort ,  --  and extending " up into the land throughout from sea to sea , west and northwest . " This description is very important , for it was afterwards claimed by Virginia to mean a grant of land of the shape shown on the map. 1 Footnote 1 : Read Hinsdale 's Old Northwest , pp. 74 , 75 . Illustration %22 . The First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new governors Virginia began to thrive . More work and less grumbling were done , and a few wise reforms were introduced . One governor , however , Argall , ruled the colony so badly that the people turned against him and sent such reports to England that immigration almost ceased . The company , in consequence , removed Argall , and gave Virginia a better form of government . In future , the governor 's power was to be limited , and the people were to have a share in the making of laws and the management of affairs . As the colonists , now numbering 4000 men , were living in eleven settlements , or " boroughs , " it was ordered that each borough should elect two men to sit in a legislature to be called the House of Burgesses . This house , the first representative assembly ever held by white men in America , met on July 30 , 1619 , in the church at Jamestown , and there began " government of the people , by the people , for the people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is interesting to note that at the very time the men of Virginia thus planted free representative government in America , another institution was planted beside it , which , in the course of two hundred and fifty years , almost destroyed free government . The Burgesses met in July , and a few weeks later , on an August day , a Dutch ship entered the James and before it sailed away sold twenty negroes into slavery . The slaves increased in numbers ( there were 2000 in Virginia in 1671 ) , and slavery spread to the other colonies as they were started , till , in time , it existed in every one of them . %24 .

As Virginia was now a royal colony , the land belonged to the King ; and as he was at liberty to do what he pleased with it , he cut off a piece and gave it to Lord Baltimore . George Calvert , Lord Baltimore , was a Roman Catholic nobleman who for years past had been interested in the colonization of America , and had tried to plant a colony in Newfoundland . The severity of the climate caused failure , and in 1629 he turned his attention to Virginia and visited Jamestown . But religious feeling ran as high there as it did anywhere . The colonists were intolerantly Protestant , and Baltimore was ordered back to England . Undeterred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plant a colony , and in 1632 obtained his grant of a piece of Virginia . The tract lay between the Potomac River and the fortieth degree of north latitude , and extended from the Atlantic Ocean to a north and south line through the source of the Potomac. 1 It was called Maryland in honor of the Queen , Henrietta Maria . Footnote 1 : It thus included what is now Delaware , and pieces of Pennsylvania and West Virginia . Illustration : ORIGINAL BOUNDARY OF MARYLAND The area of the colony was not large ; but the authority of Lord Baltimore over it was almost boundless . He was to bring to the King each year , in token of homage , two Indian arrowheads , and pay as rent one fifth of all the gold and silver mined . This done , the " lord proprietary , " as he was called , was to all intents and purposes a king . He might coin money , make war and peace , grant titles of nobility , establish courts , appoint judges , and pardon criminals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their consent . He must summon the freemen to assist him in making the laws ; but when made , they need not be sent to the King for approval , but went into force as soon as the lord proprietary signed them . Of course they must not be contrary to the laws of England . %26 . Treatment of Catholics. %  --  The deed for Maryland had not been issued when Lord Baltimore died . It was therefore made out in the name of his son , Cecilius Calvert , the second Lord Baltimore , who , like the first , was a Roman Catholic , and was influenced in his attempts at colonization by a desire to found a refuge for people of his own faith . At that time in England no Roman Catholic was permitted to educate his children in a foreign land , or to employ a schoolmaster of his religious belief ; or keep a weapon ; or have Catholic books in his house ; or sit in Parliament ; or when he died be buried in a parish churchyard . If he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . But it is needless to mention the ways in which he suffered for his religion . It is enough to know that the persecution was bitter , and that the purpose of Lord Baltimore was to make Maryland a Roman Catholic colony . Yet he set a noble example to other founders of colonies by freely granting to all sects full freedom of conscience . As long as the Catholics remained in control , toleration worked well . But in the year 1691 Lord Baltimore was deprived of his colony because he had supported King James II. , and in 1692 sharp laws were made in Maryland against Catholics by the Protestants . In 1716 the colony was restored to the proprietor . The first settlement was made in 1634 at St. Marys . Annapolis was founded about 1683 ; and Baltimore in 1729. 1 Footnote 1 : Read Scharf 's History of Maryland ; Doyle 's Virginia ; Lodge 's English Colonies ; Eggleston 's Beginners of a Nation , . %27 .

He reached our coast not far from Portland , Maine , and abandoning all idea of finding a passage , he sailed alongshore to the southward as far as Cape Cod . Here he put to sea , and when he again sighted land was off Delaware Bay . In attempting to sail up it , his ship , the Half-Moon , grounded , and Hudson turned about . Running along the Jersey coast , he entered New York Bay , and sailed up the river which the Dutch called the North River , but which we know as the Hudson . Hudson 's voyage gave the Dutch a claim to all the country drained by the Delaware or South River and the Hudson River , and some Dutch traders at once sent out vessels , and were soon trading actively with the Indians . By 1614 a rude fort had been erected near the site of Albany , and some trading huts had been put up on Manhattan Island . These ventures proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade , whereupon those already in it , in order to shut out others , organized a company , and in 1615 obtained a trading charter for three years from the States General of Holland , and carried on their operations from Albany to the Delaware River . Illustration : View of New Amsterdam in 1656 %28 . Dutch West India Company. %  --  On the expiration of the charter ( in 1618 ) it was not renewed , but a new corporation , the Dutch West India Company ( 1621 ) , was created with almost absolute political and commercial power over all the Dutch domains in North America , which were called New Netherland . In 1623 the company began to send out settlers . Some went to Albany , or , as they called it , Fort Orange . Others were sent to the South or Delaware River , where a trading post , Fort Nassau , was built on the site of Gloucester in New Jersey . A few went to the Connecticut River ; some settled on Long Island ; and others on Manhattan Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York city . All these little settlements were merely fur-trading posts . Nobody was engaged as yet in farming . To encourage this , the company ( in 1629 ) took another step , and offered a great tract of land , on any navigable river or bay , to anybody who would establish a colony of fifty persons above the age of fifteen . If on a river , the domain was to be sixteen miles along one bank or eight miles along each bank , and run back into the country as far " as the situation of the occupiers will admit . " The proprietor of the land was to be called a " patroon , " 1 and was absolute ruler of whatever colonies he might plant , for he was at once owner , ruler , and judge . It may well be supposed that such a tempting offer did not go a-begging , and a number of patroons were soon settled along the Hudson and on the banks of the Delaware ( 1631 ) , where they founded a town near Lewes . The settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Indians , who in revenge massacred them and drove off the garrison at Fort Nassau ; whereupon the patroons sold their rights to the Dutch West India Company. 2 Footnote 1 : The patroon bound himself to ( 1 ) transport the fifty settlers to New Netherland at his own expense ; ( 2 ) provide each of them with a farm stocked with horses , cattle , and farming implements , and charge a low rent ; ( 3 ) employ a schoolmaster and a minister of the Gospel . In return for this the emigrant bound himself ( 1 ) to stay and cultivate the land of the patroon for ten years ; ( 2 ) to bring his grain to the patroon 's mill and pay for grinding ; ( 3 ) to use no cloth not made in Holland ; ( 4 ) to sell no grain or produce till the patroon had been given a chance to buy it .

The Struggle for the Delaware ; the Swedes on the Delaware. %  --  And now began a bitter contest for the ownership of the country bordering the Delaware . A few leading officials of the Dutch Company , disgusted at the way its affairs were managed , formed a new company under the lead of William Usselinx . As they could not get a charter from Holland , for she would not create a rival to the Dutch Company , they sought and obtained one from Sweden as the South Company , and ( 1638 ) sent out a colony to settle on the Delaware River. 1 The spot chosen was on the site of Wilmington . The country was named New Sweden , though it belonged to Maryland . The Dutch West India Company protested and rebuilt Fort Nassau .

SUMMARY 1 . After the discovery of the North American coast by the Cabots , England made no attempt to settle it for nearly eighty years ; and even then the colonies planted by Gilbert and Ralegh were failures . 2 . Successful settlement by the English began under the London Company in 1607. 3 . In 1609 the London Company obtained a grant of land from sea to sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its charter was annulled , and in 1632 the King carved the proprietary colony of Maryland out of Virginia . 4 . Meantime Henry Hudson , in the employ of the Dutch , discovered the Delaware and Hudson rivers ( 1609 ) , and the Dutch , ignoring the claims of England , planted colonies on these rivers and called the country New Netherland. 5 . Then a Swedish company began to colonize the Delaware Bay and River coast of Virginia , which they called New Sweden . 6 . Conflicts between the Dutch and the Swedes followed , and in 1655 New Sweden was made a part of New Netherland . CHAPTER IV THE PLANTING OF NEW ENGLAND %30 . The Beginnings of New England. %  --  When the Dutch put up their trading posts where New York and Albany now stand , all the country east of New York , all of what is now New England , was a wilderness . As early as 1607 an attempt was made to settle it and a colony was planted on the coast of Maine by two members of the Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and Sir Ferdinando Gorges , governor of Plymouth . But the colonists were half starved and frozen , and in the spring of 1608 gladly went home to England . Six years later John Smith , the hero of Virginia , explored and mapped the coast from the Penobscot to Cape Cod . He called the country New England ; one of the rivers , the Charles ; and two of the promontories , Cape Elizabeth and Cape Ann . Three times he attempted to lead out a colony ; but that work was reserved for other men . %31 . The Separatists. %  --  The reign of Queen Elizabeth had witnessed in England the rise of a religious sect which insisted that certain changes should be made in the government and ceremonials of the Established or State Church of England . This they called purifying the Church , and in consequence they were themselves called Puritans. 1 At first they did not intend to form a new sect ; but in 1580 one of their ministers , named Robert Brown , urged them to separate from the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of followers , who were called Separatists or Brownists . They boldly asserted their right to worship as they pleased , and put their doctrines into practice . So hot a persecution followed , that in 1608 a party , led by William Brewster and John Robinson , fled from Scrooby , a little village in northern England , to Amsterdam , in Holland ; but soon went on to Leyden , where they dwelt eleven years. 2 Footnote 1 : Read Fiske 's Beginnings of New England , pp. 50-71 .

I. , pp. 176-232. %32 . Why the Separatists went to New England%.  --  They had come to Holland as an organized community , practicing English manners and customs . For a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's children after them were to remain and prosper , they must break up their organization , forget their native land , their native speech , their national traditions , and to all intents and purposes become Dutch . This they could not bring themselves to do , and by 1617 they had fully determined to remove to some land where they might still continue to be Englishmen , and where they might lay the foundations of a Christian state . But one such land could then be found , and that was America . To America , therefore , they turned their attention , and after innumerable delays formed a company and obtained leave from the London Company to settle on the coast of what is now New Jersey. 1 Footnote 1 : Eggleston 's Beginners of a Nation , pp. 159-176 . This done , Brewster and Bradford and Miles Standish , with a little band , sent out as an advance guard , set sail from the Dutch port of Delft Haven in July , 1620 , in the ship Speedwell . The first run was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the Mayflower , and whence , August 5 , they sailed for America . But the Speedwell proved so unseaworthy that the two ships put back to Plymouth , where twenty people gave up the voyage . September 6 , 1620 , such as remained steadfast , just 102 in number , reembarked on the Mayflower and began the most memorable of voyages . The weather was so foul , and the wind and sea so boisterous , that nine weeks passed before they beheld the sandy shores of Cape Cod . Having no right to settle there , as the cape lay far to the northward of the lands owned by the London Company , they turned their ship southward and attempted to go on . But head winds drove them back and forced them to seek shelter in Provincetown harbor , at the end of Cape Cod .

The Mayflower Compact%.  --  Since it was then the 11th of November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to get permission from the Plymouth Company to remain permanently . But certain members of the party , when they heard this , became unruly , and declared that as they were not to land in Virginia , they were no longer bound by the contracts they had made in England regarding their emigration to Virginia . To put an end to this , a meeting was held , November 21 , 1620 , in the cabin of the Mayflower , and a compact was drawn up and signed. 1 It declared 1 . That they were loyal subjects of the King . 2 . That they had undertaken to found a colony in the northern parts of Virginia , and now bound themselves to form a " civil body politic. " 3 . That they would frame such just and equal laws , from time to time , as might be for the general good . 4 . And to these laws they promised " all due submission and obedience .

The Founding of Plymouth%.  --  The selection of a site for their home was now necessary , and five weeks were passed in exploring the coast before Captain Standish with a boatload of men entered the harbor which John Smith had noted on his map and named Plymouth . On the sandy shore of that harbor , close to the water 's edge , was a little granite bowlder , and on this , according to tradition , the Pilgrims stepped as they came ashore , December 21 , 1620 . To this harbor the Mayflower was brought , and the work of founding Plymouth was begun . The winter was a dreadful one , and before spring fifty-one of the colonists had died. 1 But the Pilgrims stood fast , and in 1621 obtained a grant of land2 from the Council for New England , which had just succeeded the Plymouth Company , under a charter giving it control between latitudes 40 deg. and 48 deg. , from sea to sea. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to come all other settlers in New England obtained their rights to the soil . Footnote 1 : In the trying times which followed , William Bradford was chosen governor and many times reelected . He wrote the so-called " Log of the Mayflower , "  --  really a manuscript History of the Plymouth Plantation from 1602 to 1647 ,  --  a fragment of which is reproduced on the opposite page . Footnote 2 : This grant had no boundary . Each settler might have 100 acres . Fifteen hundred acres were set aside for public buildings .

Illustration : Fragment of History of the Plymouth Plantation. %35 . A Puritan Colony proposed. %  --  Among those who obtained such rights was a company of Dorchester merchants who planted a town on Cape Ann . The enterprise failed , and the colonists went off and settled at a place they called Naumkeag . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was John White , a Puritan rector . What had been done by the Separatists in a small way might be done , it seemed to White , on a great scale by an association of wealthy and influential Puritans . The matter was discussed by them in London , and in 1628 an association was formed , and a tract of land was bought from the Council for New England . %36 . The " Sea to Sea " Grant%.  --  Concerning the interior of our continent absolutely nothing was known . Nobody supposed it was more than half as wide as it really is . The grant to the association , therefore , stretched from three miles north of the Merrimac River to three miles south of the Charles River , along these rivers to their sources , and then westward across the continent from sea to sea. 1 Footnote 1 : You will notice that when this grant was made in 1628 the Dutch had discovered the Hudson , and had begun to settle Albany . To this region ( the Hudson and Mohawk valleys ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grant was obtained , John Endicott came out with a company of sixty persons , and took up his abode at Naumkeag , which , being an Indian and therefore a pagan name , he changed to Salem , the Hebrew word for " peace . " %37 . The Massachusetts Charter , 1629%.  --  The next step was to obtain the right of self-government , which was secured by a royal charter creating a corporation known as the Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay in New England . Over the affairs of the company were to preside a governor , deputy governor , and a council of eighteen to be elected annually by the members of the company. 2 Footnote 2 : The charter is printed in Poore 's Charters and Constitutions , pp. 932-942 , and in Preston 's Documents , pp. 36-61 . Six ships were now fitted out , and in them 406 men , women , and children , with 140 head of cattle , set sail for Massachusetts . They reached Salem in safety and made it the largest colony in New England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  It was in 1625 that Charles I. ascended the throne of England . Under him the quarrel with the Puritans grew worse each year . He violated his promises , he collected illegal taxes , he quartered troops on the people , he threw those into prison who would not contribute to his forced loans , or pressed them into the army or the navy . His Archbishop Laud persecuted the Puritans with shameful cruelty . Little wonder then that in 1629 twelve leading Puritans met in consultation and agreed to head a great migration to the New World , provided the charter and the government of the Massachusetts Bay Company were both removed to New England . This was agreed to , and in April , 1630 , John Winthrop sailed with nearly one thousand Puritans for Salem . From Salem he moved to Charlestown , and later in the year ( 1630 ) to a little three-hilled peninsula , which the English called Tri-mountain or Tremont . There a town was founded and called Boston . The departure of Winthrop was the signal , and before the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reached Massachusetts . The newcomers settled Charlestown , Boston , Roxbury , Dorchester , Watertown , and Newtown ( now Cambridge ) . New England was planted. 1 Footnote 1 : Read Fiske 's Beginnings of New England , pp. 75-105 . Eggleston 's Beginners of a Nation , pp. 188-219. %39 . New Hampshire and Maine. %  --  When it became apparent that the Plymouth colony was permanently settled , Sir Ferdinando Gorges , whose interest in New England had never lagged , together with John Mason obtained ( 1622 ) from the Council for New England a grant of Laconia , as they called the territory between the Merrimac and the Kennebec rivers , and from the Atlantic " to the great river of Canada . " Seven years later ( 1629 ) they divided their property . Mason , taking the territory between the Merrimac and Piscataqua rivers , called it New Hampshire because he was Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire in England . Gorges took the region between the Piscataqua and the Kennebec , and called it Maine . After the death of Mason ( 1635 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annexed to Massachusetts . The King separated them in 1679 , joined them again in 1688 , and finally parted them in 1691 , making New Hampshire a royal colony . Gorges took better care of his part and ( in 1639 ) was given a charter with the title of Lord Proprietor of the Province or County of Maine , which extended , as before , from the Piscataqua to the Kennebec , and backward 120 miles from the ocean . But after his death the province fell into neglect , and the towns were gradually absorbed by Massachusetts , which , in 1677 , bought the claims of the heir of Gorges for L1250 and governed Maine as lord proprietor under the Gorges charter . %40 . Church and State in Massachusetts. %  --  Down to the moment of their arrival in America the Puritans had not been Separatists . They were still members of the Church of England who desired to see her form of worship purified . But the party under Endicott had no sooner reached Salem than they seceded , and the first Congregational Church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for so radical a step , and attempted to establish a church on the episcopal model ; but Endicott promptly sent two of the leaders back to England . Thus were established two facts : 1 . The separation or secession of the Colonial Church from that of England . 2 . That the episcopal form of worship would not be tolerated in the colony . In 1631 another step was taken which united church and state , for it was then ordered that " no man shall be admitted to the freedom of this body politic , but such as are members of some of the churches within the limits of the same . " This was intolerance of the grossest kind , and soon became the cause of troubles which led to the founding of Rhode Island and Connecticut . %41 . The Planting of Rhode Island. %  --  There came to Salem ( from Plymouth ) , in 1633 , a young minister named Roger Williams . He dissented heartily from the intolerance of the people of Massachusetts , and , though a minister of the Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state . 2 . On the toleration of all religious beliefs . 3 . On the repeal of all laws requiring attendance on religious worship . To us , in this century , the justice of each of these principles is self-evident . But in the seventeenth century there was no country in the world where it was safe to declare them . For doing so in some parts of Europe , a man would most certainly have been burned at the stake . For doing so in England , he would have been put in the pillory , or had his ears cut off , or been sent to jail . That Williams 's teachings should seem rank heresy in New England was quite natural . But , to make matters worse , he wrote a pamphlet in which he boldly stated 1 . That the soil belonged to the Indians . 2 . That the settlers could obtain a valid title only by purchase from the Indians . 3 . That accepting a deed for the land from a mere intruder like the King of England was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of New England such doctrine could not fail to bring down on Massachusetts the wrath of the King . When , therefore , a little later , Endicott cut the red cross of St. George out of the colors of the Salem militia , the people considered his act a defiance of royal authority , attributed it to the teachings of Williams , and proceeded to punish both . Endicott was rebuked by the General Court ( or legislature ) and forbidden to hold office for a year . Williams was ordered to go back to England . But he fled to the woods , and made his way through the snow to the wigwam of the Indian chief , Massasoit , on Narragansett Bay , and there in the summer of 1636 he founded Providence . About the same time another teacher of what was then thought heresy , Anne Hutchinson , was driven from Massachusetts , and with some of her followers went southward and founded Portsmouth and Newport , on the island of Rhode Island . For a while each of these settlements was independent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Parliament which united them under the name of " The Incorporation of Providence Plantations on the Narragansett Bay in New England . " %42 . Connecticut begun. %  --  In the same year that Roger Williams began his settlement at Providence , several hundred people from the towns near Boston went off and settled in the Connecticut valley . For a long time past there had been growing up in Massachusetts a strong feeling that the law that none but church members should vote or hold office was oppressive . This feeling became so strong that in 1635 some hardy pioneers from Dorchester pushed through the wilderness and settled at Windsor . A party from Watertown went further and settled Wethersfield . These were small movements . But in 1636 the Newtown congregation , led by its pastor , Thomas Hooker , walked to the Connecticut valley and founded Hartford . The congregations of the Dorchester and Watertown churches soon followed , while a party from Roxbury settled at Springfield . During three years these four towns were part of Massachusetts . But in 1639 , Windsor , Hartford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in time was called Connecticut . Their " Fundamental Orders of Connecticut " was the first written constitution made in America . Their republic was the first in the history of the world to be founded by a written constitution , and marks the beginning of democratic government in our country . %43 . The New Haven Colony. %  --  Just at the time these things were happening in the Connecticut valley , the beginnings of another little republic were made on the shores of Long Island Sound . One day in the summer of 1637 there came to Boston a company of rich London merchants under the lead of an eloquent preacher named John Davenport . The people of Boston would gladly have kept the newcomers at that town . But the strangers desired to found a state of their own , and so , after spending some months in seeking for a spot with a good harbor , they left Boston in 1638 and founded New Haven . In 1639 Milford and Guilford were laid out , and Stamford was started in 1640 . Three years later these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the name of the New Haven colony. 1 Footnote 1 : Fiske 's Beginnings of New England , pp. 134-137 . Illustration : NEW ENGLAND AND NEW NETHERLAND %44 . " The United Colonies of New England . " %  --  There were now five colonies in New England ; namely , Plymouth , or the " Old Colony , " Massachusetts Bay , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and New Haven . Geographically , they were near each other . But each was weak in numbers , and if left without the aid of its neighbors , might easily have fallen a prey to some enemy . Of this the settlers were well aware , and in 1643 four of the colonies , Plymouth , Massachusetts Bay , Connecticut , and New Haven1 united for defense against the Indians and the Dutch , who claimed the Connecticut valley and so threatened the English colonies on the west . Footnote 1 : Rhode Island was not allowed to come in , for the feeling against the followers of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson was still very strong . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , " and it was the first attempt in America at federal government . All its affairs were managed by a board of eight commissioners ,  --  two from each colony ,  --  who must be church members . They had no power to lay taxes or to meddle with the internal concerns of the colonies , but they had entire control over all dealings with Indians or with foreign powers . %45 . The Year 1643. %  --  The year 1643 is thus an important one in colonial history . It was in that year that the New Haven colony was founded ; that the league of The United Colonies of New England was formed ; and that Roger Williams obtained the first charter of Rhode Island . %46 . New Charters. %  --  During the next twenty years no changes took place in the boundaries of the colonies . This was the period of the Civil War in England , of the Commonwealth , of the rule of Cromwell and the Puritans ; and affairs in New England were left to take care of themselves . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and a new era opens in colonial history . In 1661 the little colony of Connecticut promptly acknowledged the restoration of Charles II . and applied for a charter . The application was more than granted ; for to Connecticut ( 1662 ) was given not only a charter and an immense tract of land , but also the colony of New Haven. 1 The land grant was comprised in a strip that stretched across the continent from Rhode Island to the Pacific and was as wide as the present state. 2 In 1663 Rhode Island was given a new charter . Footnote 1 : In 1660 , after the restoration of Charles II. , Edward Whalley and William Goffe ( the regicides , " king-killers , " as they were called ) , two of the judges who had condemned Charles I. to be beheaded , fled to New Haven and were protected by the people . This act had much to do with the annexation of New Haven to Connecticut . Footnote 2 : Read Fiske 's Beginnings of New England , pp. 192-196 . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their colony with Connecticut , and in June , 1667 , migrated to New Jersey , where they founded " New-Ark " or Newark . In 1684 the King 's judges declared the Massachusetts charter void , and James II . was about to make New England one royal colony , when the English people drove him from the throne . William and Mary in 1691 granted a new charter and united the Plymouth colony , Massachusetts , Maine , and Nova Scotia , in one colony called Massachusetts Bay . This charter was in force when the Revolution opened . SUMMARY 1 . The first colony established by the Plymouth Company ( 1607 , on the coast of Maine ) was a failure . 2 . Captain John Smith explored the New England coast and mapped it ( 1613 ) , but did not succeed in planting any colonies . 3 . The permanent settlement of New England began with the arrival of a body of Separatists in the Mayflower ( 1620 ) , who founded the colony of Plymouth . 4 . The Separatist migration from England was followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who planted towns along the coast to the north of Plymouth , and obtained a charter of government and a great strip of land , and founded the colony of Massachusetts Bay . 5 . Religious disputes drove Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson out of Massachusetts , and led to the founding of Rhode Island ( 1636 ) . 6 . Other church wrangles led to an emigration from Massachusetts to the Connecticut valley , where a little confederacy of towns was created and called Connecticut . 7 . Some settlers from England went to Long Island Sound and there founded four towns which , in their turn , joined in a federal union called the New Haven Colony . 8 . In time , New Haven was joined to Connecticut , and Plymouth and Maine to Massachusetts ; New Hampshire was made a royal colony ; and the four New England colonies  --  Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Connecticut  --  were definitely established . 9 . The territory of Massachusetts and Connecticut stretched across the continent to the " South Sea , " or Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . North and South Carolina. %  --  You remember that away back in the sixteenth century the French under Jean Ribault and the English under Ralegh undertook to plant colonies on what is now the Carolina coast . They failed , and the country remained a wilderness till 1653 , when a band of emigrants from Virginia made the first permanent settlement on the banks of the Chowan and the Roanoke . In 1663 some Englishmen from Barbados began to settle on the Cape Fear River , just at the time when Charles II . of England gave the region to eight English noblemen , who , out of compliment to the King , allowed the name of Carolina given it by Ribault to remain . In 1665 the bounds were enlarged , and Carolina then extended from latitude 29 deg. 00 ' to 36 deg. 30 ' , the present south boundary of Virginia , and from the Atlantic to the Pacific . Illustration : CAROLINA AS GRANTED BY King Charles II There was at first no intention of dividing the territory , although , after Charleston was founded ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate governors . But in 1729 the proprietors sold Carolina to the King , and it was then divided into two distinct and separate royal provinces . %48 . New York. %  --  An event of far greater importance than the chartering of Carolina was the seizure of New Netherland . After the conquest of New Sweden , in 1655 , the possessions and claims of the Dutch in our country extended from the Connecticut River to the Delaware River , and from the Mohawk to Delaware Bay . Geographically , they cut the English colonies in two , and hampered communication between New England and the South . To own this region was therefore of the utmost importance to the English ; and to get it , King Charles II. , in 1664 , revived the old claim that the English had discovered the country before the Dutch , and he sent a little fleet and army , which appeared off New Amsterdam and demanded its surrender . The demand was complied with ; and in 1664 Dutch rule in our country ended , and England owned the seaboard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted New Netherland to his brother the Duke of York , in honor of whom the town of New Amsterdam was now renamed New York . %49 . New Jersey. %  --  The Duke of York no sooner received his province than he gave so much of it as lay between the Delaware and the ocean to his friends Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret , and called it New Jersey , in honor of Sir George Carteret , who had been governor of the island of Jersey in the English Channel . The two proprietors divided it between them by the line shown on the map ( p. 56 ) . In 1674 Berkeley sold West Jersey to a company of Quakers , who settled near Burlington . A little later , 1676 , William Penn and some other Quakers bought East Jersey . There were then two colonies till 1702 , when the proprietors surrendered their rights , and New Jersey became one royal province . %50 . The Beginnings of Pennsylvania. %  --  The part which Penn took in the settlement of New Jersey suggested to him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the persecuted of all lands and of all religions . Illustration Now it so happened that Penn was the son of a distinguished admiral to whom King Charles II . owed L16,000 , and seeing no chance of its ever being paid , he proposed to the King , in 1680 , that the debt be paid with a tract of land in America . The King gladly agreed , and in 1681 Penn received a grant west of the Delaware . Against Penn 's wish , the King called it Pennsylvania , or Penn 's Woodland . It was given almost precisely the bounds of the present state. 1 In 1683 Penn made a famous treaty with the Indians , and laid out the city of Philadelphia . Footnote 1 : There was a long dispute , however , with Lord Baltimore , over the south boundary line , which was not settled till 1763-67 , when two surveyors , Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon , came over from England and located it as at present . In later years , when all the Atlantic seaboard states north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dixon 's Line " became famous as the dividing line between the slave and the free Atlantic states. %51 . The Three Lower Counties : Delaware. %  --  If you look at the map of the British Colonies in 1764 , you will see that Pennsylvania was the only English colony which did not have a seacoast . This was a cause of some anxiety to Penn , who was afraid that the settlers in Delaware and New Jersey might try to prevent his colonists from going in and out of Delaware Bay . To avoid this , he bought what is now Delaware from the Duke of York . The three lower counties on the Delaware , as the tract was called , had no boundary . Lawfully it belonged to Lord Baltimore . But neither the Dutch patroons who settled on the Delaware in 1631 , nor the Swedes who came later , nor the Dutch who annexed New Sweden to New Netherland , nor the English who conquered the Dutch , paid any regard to Baltimore 's rights . At last , after the purchase of Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) agreed on what is the present boundary line . After 1703 the people of the three lower counties were allowed to have an assembly or legislature of their own ; but they had the same governor as Pennsylvania and were a part of that colony till the Revolution. 1 Footnote 1 : For Pennsylvania read Janney 's Life of William Penn or Dixon 's History of William Penn ; Proud 's or Gordon 's Pennsylvania ; Lodge 's Colonies , pp. 213-226. %52 . Georgia. %  --  The return of the Carolinas to the King in 1729 was very soon followed by the establishment of the last colony ever planted by England in the United States . The founder was James Oglethorpe , an English soldier and member of Parliament . Filled with pity for the poor debtors with whom the English jails were then crowded , he formed a plan to pay the debts of the most deserving , send them to America , and give them what hundreds of thousands of men have since found in our country ,  --  a chance to begin life anew . Illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally twenty-two persons under Oglethorpe 's lead formed an association and secured a charter from King George II . for a colony , which they called Georgia . The territory granted lay between the Savannah and the Altamaha rivers , and extended from their mouths to their sources and then across the country to the Pacific Ocean . Oglethorpe had selected this tract in order that his colonists might serve the patriotic purpose of protecting Charleston from the Spanish attacks to which it was then exposed . Money for the colony was easily raised , 1 and in November , 1732 , Oglethorpe , with 130 persons , set out for Charleston , and after a short stay there passed southward and founded the city of Savannah ( 1733 ) . It must not be supposed that all the colonists were poor debtors . In time , Italians from Piedmont , Moravians and Lutherans from Germany , and Scotchmen from the Highlands , all made settlements in Georgia . Footnote 1 : The House of Commons gave L10,000. %53 .

Connecticut , with a great tract of land extending to the Pacific ; 5 . New York , with undefined bounds ; 6 . New Jersey ; 7 . Pennsylvania and 8 . Delaware , the property of the Penn family ; 9 .

The Early French Possessions% on our continent may be arranged in three great areas : 1 . Acadia , 2 . New France , 3 . Louisiana , or the basin of the Mississippi River . ACADIA comprised what is now New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and a part of Maine . It was settled in the early years of the seventeenth century at Port Royal ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , and on the St. Croix River . NEW FRANCE was the drainage basin of the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes . As far back as 1535 Jacques Cartier explored the St. Lawrence River to the site of Montreal . But it was not till 1608 that a party under Champlain made the first permanent settlement on the river , at Quebec . The French settlers at once entered into an alliance with the Huron and Algonquin Indians , who lived along the St. Lawrence River . But these tribes were the bitter enemies of the Iroquois , who dwelt in what is now central New York , and when , in consequence of this alliance , the French were summoned to take the warpath , Champlain , with a few followers , went , and on the shore of the lake which now bears his name , not far from the site of Ticonderoga , he met and defeated the Iroquois tribe of Mohawks in July , 1609 . The battle was a small affair ; but its consequences were serious and lasting , for the Iroquois were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ever coming southward and taking possession of the Hudson and the Mohawk valleys . When , therefore , the French merchants began to engage in the fur trade with the Indians , and the French priests began their efforts to convert the Indians to Christianity , they were forced to go westward further and further into the interior . Illustration : EUROPEAN CLAIMS AND EXPLORATIONS 1650 Their route , instead of being up the St. Lawrence , was up the Ottawa River to its head waters , over the portage to Lake Nipissing , and down its outlet to Georgian Bay , where the waters of the Great Lakes lay before them ( see map on p. 63 ) . They explored these lakes , dotted their shores here and there with mission and fur-trading stations , and took possession of the country . %55 . The French on the Mississippi. %  --  In the course of these explorations the French heard accounts from the Indians of a great river to the westward , and in 1672 Father Marquette ( mar-ket ' ) and Louis Joliet ( zho-le-a ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . They set out , in May , 1673 , from Michilimackinac , a French trading post and mission at the foot of Lake Michigan . With five companions , in two birch-bark canoes , they paddled up the lake to Green Bay , entered Fox River , and , dragging the boats through its boiling rapids , came to a village where lived the Miamis and the Kickapoos . These Indians tried to dissuade them from going on ; but Marquette was resolute , and on the 10th of June , 1673 , he led his followers over the swamps and marshes that separated Fox River from a river which the Indian guides assured him flowed into the Mississippi . This westward-flowing river he called the Wisconsin , and there the guides left him , as he says , " alone , amid that unknown country , in the hands of God . " The little band shoved their canoes boldly out upon the river , and for seven days floated slowly downward into the unknown . At last , on the 17th of June , they paddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning their canoes to the south , followed the bends and twists of the river , past the mouth of the Missouri , past the Ohio , to a point not far from the mouth of the Arkansas . There the voyage ended , and the party went slowly back to the Lakes. 1 Footnote 1 : Read Parkman 's La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West. %56 . La Salle finishes the Work of Marquette and Joliet. %  --  The discovery of Marquette and Joliet was the greatest of the age . Yet five years went by before Robert de la Salle ( lah sahl ' ) set forth with authority from the French King " to labor at the discovery of the western part of New France , " and began the attempt to follow the river to the sea . In 1678 La Salle and his companions left Canada , and made their way to the shore of Lake Erie , where during the winter they built and launched the Griffin , the first ship that ever floated on those waters . In this they sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed on to the Illinois River , to an Indian camp not far from the site of Peoria , Ill . Just below this camp La Salle built Fort Crevecoeur ( cra'v-ker , a word meaning heart-break , vexation ) . Illustration : %FRENCH CLAIMS% MISSIONS AND TRADING POSTS IN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY %in 1700% Leaving the party there in charge of Henri de Tonty to construct another ship , he with five companions went back to Canada . On his return he found that Fort Crevecoeur was in ruins , and that Tonty and the few men who had been faithful were gone , he knew not where . In the hope of meeting them he pushed on down the Illinois to the Mississippi . To go on would have been easy , but he turned back to find Tonty , and passed the winter on the St. Joseph River . From there in November , 1681 , he once more set forth , crossed the lake to the place where Chicago now is , went up the Chicago River and over the portage to the Illinois , and early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that day , a surging torrent full of trees and floating ice ; but the explorers kept on their way and came at last to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico . There La Salle took formal possession of all the regions drained by the Mississippi , the Ohio , and their tributaries , claiming them in the name of France , and naming the country thus claimed " Louisiana . " The iron will , the splendid courage , of La Salle had triumphed over every obstacle and made him one of the grandest characters in history . But his work was far from ended . The valley he had explored , the territory he had added to France , must be occupied , and to occupy it two things were necessary : 1 . A colony must be planted at the mouth of the Mississippi , to control its navigation and shut out the Spaniards . 2 . A strong fort must be built on the Illinois , to overawe the Indians . In order to overawe the Indians , La Salle now hurried back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the present town of Ottawa , on the summit of a cliff now known as " Starved Rock , " he built a stockade which he called Fort St. Louis . In 1684 , while on a voyage from France to plant a colony on the Mississippi , he missed the mouth and brought up on the coast of Texas ; and , landing on the sands of Matagorda Bay , the colonists built another Fort St. Louis . But death rapidly reduced their numbers , and , in their distress , they parted . Some remained at the fort and were killed by the Indians . Others , led by La Salle , started for the Illinois River and reached it ; but without their leader , whom they had murdered on the way . SUMMARY 1 .

Illustration : Starved Rock CHAPTER VII THE INDIANS Illustration : A typical Indian %57% . When Europeans first set foot on our shores , they found the country already inhabited , and , adopting the name given to the men of the New World by Columbus , they called these people " Indians . " They were not " Indians , " or natives of Asia , but a race by themselves , which ages before the time of Columbus was spread over all North and South America . Like their descendants in the West to-day , they had red or copper-colored skins , their eyes and long straight hair were jet black , their faces beardless , and their cheek bones high . %58 . The Villages. %  --  - East of the Rocky Mountains the Indians lived in villages , often covering several acres in area , and surrounded by stockades of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced with loopholes , and provided with platforms on which were piles of stones for the defenders to hurl on the heads of their enemies . Sometimes the structures which formed the village were wigwams  --  rude structures made by driving poles into the ground in a circle , drawing their tops near together , and then covering them with bark or skins . Sometimes the dwellings had rudely framed sides and roofs covered with layers of elm bark . Usually these structures were fifteen or twenty feet wide by 100 feet long . At each end was a door . Along each side were ten or twelve stalls , in each of which lived a family , so that one house held twenty or more families . Down the middle at regular intervals were fire pits where the food was cooked , the smoke escaping through holes in the roof. 1 Footnote 1 : Read Parkman 's Conspiracy of Pontiac , Vol . I. , pp. 17 , 18 . Illustration : Buffalo-skin lodge %59 . Clans and Tribes. %  --  All the families living in such a house traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clan . Each clan had its own name ,  --  usually that of some animal , as the Wolf , the Bear , or the Turtle ,  --  its own sachem or civil magistrate , and its own war chiefs , and owned all the food and all the property , except weapons and ornaments , in common . A number of such clans made a tribe , which had one language and was governed by a council of the clan sachems . Illustration : Seneca long house %60 . The Three Indian Races. %  --  With slight exceptions , the tribes living east of the Mississippi are divided , by those who have studied their languages , into three great groups : 1 . The Muskhogees , who lived south of the Tennessee River and comprised the Creek , the Seminole , the Choctaw , and the Chickasaw tribes . 2 . The Iroquoian group , which occupied the country from the Delaware and the Hudson to and beyond the St. Lawrence and Lakes Ontario and Erie , besides isolated tracts in North Carolina and Tennessee . The chief tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central New York known as the Five Nations ( Senecas , Cayugas , Onondagas , Oneidas , and Mohawks ) ,  --  the Hurons , the Eries , the Cherokees , and the Tuscaroras . Illustration : Moccasin 3 . The Algonquian group , which occupied the rest of what is now the United States east of the Mississippi , besides the larger part of Canada . In this group were the Mohegans , Pequots , and Narragansetts of New England ; the Delawares ; the Powhatans of Virginia ; the Shawnees of the Ohio valley , and many others living around the Great Lakes . Illustration : Flint Hatchet %61 . Weapons and Implements and Clothing. %  --  All of these tribes had made some progress towards civilization . They used pottery and ornamental pipes of clay . They raised beans and squashes , pumpkins , tobacco , and maize , or Indian corn , which they ground to meal by rubbing between two stones . For hunting they had bows , arrows with stone heads , hatchets of flint , and spears . In summer they went almost naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fur-bearing animals and the hides of buffalo and deer . For navigating streams and rivers , lakes and bays , they constructed canoes of birch bark sewed together with thongs of deerskin and smeared at the joints with spruce-tree gum . %62 . Traits of Character. %  --  Living an outdoor life , and depending for daily food not so much on the maize they raised as on the fish they caught and the animals they killed , the Indians were most expert woodsmen . They were swift of foot , quick-witted , keen-sighted , and most patient of hunger , fatigue , and cold . White men were amazed at the rapidity with which the Indian followed the most obscure trail over the most difficult ground , at the perfection with which he imitated the bark of the wolf , the hoot of the owl , the call of the moose , and at the catlike tread with which he walked over beds of autumn leaves the side of the grazing deer . Illustration : Ornamental pipe Illustration : Quiver , with bows and arrows Courage and fortitude he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were associated all the vices , all the dark and crooked ways , which are the resort of the cowardly and the weak . He was treacherous , revengeful , and cruel beyond description . Much as he loved war ( and war was his chief occupation ) , the fair and open fight had no charm for him . To his mind it was madness to take the scalp of an enemy at the risk of his own , when he might waylay him in an ambush or shoot him with an arrow from behind a tree . He was never so happy as when , at the dead of night , he roused his sleeping victims with an unearthly yell and massacred them by the light of their burning home . %63 . The French and the Indians. %  --  The ways in which French and English colonists acted towards the Indian are highly characteristic , and account for much in our history . From the day when Champlain , in 1609 , joined his Huron-Algonquin neighbors and went with them on the warpath against the Iroquois , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians . No pains were spared to win them to the cause of France . They were flattered , petted , treated with ceremonial respect , and became the companions , as the women often became the wives , of the Frenchmen . Much was expected of this mingling of races . It was supposed that the Indian would be won over to civilization and Christianity . But the Frenchmen were won over to the Indians , and adopted Indian ways of life . They lived in wigwams , wore Indian dress , decorated their long hair with eagle feathers , and made their faces hideous with vermilion , ocher , and soot . %64 . Coureurs de Bois. %  --  There soon grew up in this way a class of half-civilized vagrants , who ranged the woods in true Indian style , and gained a living by guiding the canoes of fur traders along the rivers and lakes of the interior . Stimulated by the profits of the fur trade , these men pushed their traffic to the most distant tribes , spreading French guns , French hatchets , beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the whole Northwest . Where the trader and the coureur de bois went , the priest and the soldier followed , and soon mission houses and forts were established at all the chief passes and places suited to control the Indian trade . %65 . The English and the Indians. %  --  How , meantime , did the English act toward the Indians ? In the first place , nothing led them to form close relationship with the tribes . The fur trade  --  the source of Canadian prosperity  --  and the zeal of priests eager for the conversion of the heathen , which sent the traders , the coureurs de bois , and the priests from tribe to tribe and from the Atlantic halfway to the Pacific , did not appeal to the English colonists . Farming and commerce were the sources of their wealth . Their priests and missionaries were content to labor with the Indians near at hand . In the second place , the policy of the French towards the Indians , while founded on trade , was directed by one central government . The policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of as many kinds as there were colonies . No English frontier exhibited such a mingling of white men and red as was common wherever the French went . Among the English there were fur traders , but no coureurs de bois . Scorn on the one side and hatred on the other generally marked the intercourse between the English and the Indians . One bright exception must indeed be made . Penn was a broad-minded lover of his kind , a man of most enlightened views on government and human rights ; and in the colony planted by him there was made a serious effort to treat the Indian as an equal . But the day came when men not of his faith dealt with the Indians in true English fashion . Remembering this difference of treatment , we shall the better understand how it happened that the French could sprinkle the West with little posts far from Quebec and surrounded by the fiercest of tribes , while the English could only with difficulty defend their frontier. 1 Footnote 1 : A fine account of the Indians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in Parkman 's Conspiracy of Pontiac , Vol .

In 1636 the Pequots , who dwelt along the Thames River in Connecticut , made war on the settlers in the Connecticut River valley towns . Men were waylaid and scalped , or taken prisoners and burned at the stake . Determined to put an end to this , ninety men from the Connecticut towns , with twenty from Massachusetts and some Mohegan Indians , in 1637 marched against the marauders . They found the Pequots within a circular stockade near the present town of Stonington , where of 400 warriors all save five were killed . %67 . King Philip 's War. %  --  During nearly forty years not a tribe in all New England dared rise against the white men . But in 1675 trouble began again .

A dreadful war followed . When it ended , in 1678 , the three tribes were annihilated . Hardly any Indians save the friendly Mohawks were left in New England . But of ninety English towns , forty had been the scene of fire and slaughter , and twelve had been destroyed utterly . %68 . The Iroquois. %  --  Elsewhere on the frontier a happier relation existed with the Indians . The Iroquois of central New York were the fiercest and most warlike Indians of the Atlantic coast . But the fight with Champlain , in 1609 , by turning them into implacable enemies of the French , had rendered them all the more tolerant of the Dutch and the English , while their complete conquest and subjugation of the Delawares , or Lenni Lenape , prepared the way for the easy settlement of New Jersey and Pennsylvania . %69 .

When the Dutch and Swedes began their settlements on the South River , and when Penn , in 1683 , made a treaty with the Delawares , the settlers had to deal with peaceful Indians . No horrid wars mark the early history of Pennsylvania . %70 . The Powhatans in Virginia. %  --  Much the same may be said of the Virginia tribes . They were far from friendly , and had they been as fierce and warlike as the northern tribes , neither the skill of John Smith , nor the marriage of Pocahontas ( the daughter of Powhatan ) with John Rolfe , nor fear of the English muskets , would have saved Jamestown .

For the time had now come for the opening of the long struggle between the French and the English for the ownership of the continent . SUMMARY 1 . The inhabitants of the New World at the time of its discovery , by mistake called Indians , were barbarians , lived in rude , frail houses , and used weapons and implements inferior to those of the whites . 2 . The Indian tribes of eastern North America are mostly divided into three great groups : Muskhogean , Iroquoian , and Algonquian. 3 . In general , the French made the Indians their friends , while the English drove them westward and treated them as an inferior race . Illustration : THE BRITISH COLONIES AND EUROPEAN POSSESSIONS 1733 CHAPTER VIII THE STRUGGLE FOR NEW FRANCE AND LOUISIANA %71 . Louisiana , or the Mississippi Basin. %  --  The landing of La Salle on the coast of Texas , and the building of Fort St. Louis of Texas , gave the French a claim to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort and the nearest Spanish settlement , in Mexico . At that point was the Rio Grande , a good natural boundary . On the French maps , therefore , Louisiana extended from the Rocky Mountains and the Rio Grande on the west , to the Alleghany Mountains on the east , and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south , to New France on the north . This confined the English colonies to a narrow strip between the Alleghany Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean . As the colonies were growing in population , and as the charters of Massachusetts , Connecticut , Virginia , and Carolina gave them great stretches of territory in the Mississippi valley , it was inevitable that , sooner or later , a bitter contest for possession of the country should take place between the French and the English in America . The contest began in 1689 , and ended in 1763 , and may easily be divided into two periods : 1 . That from 1689 to 1748 , when the struggle was for Acadia and New France . 2 . That from 1754 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New France , but for Louisiana also . %72 . The Struggle for Acadia and New France ; " King William 's War . " %  --  In 1688-89 there was a revolution in England , in the course of which James II . was driven from his throne , and William and Mary , his nephew and daughter , were seated on it . James took refuge in France , and when Louis XIV . attempted to restore him , a great European war followed , and of course the colonists of the two countries were very soon fighting each other . As the quarrel did not arise on this side of the ocean , the English colonists called it " King William 's War " ; but on our continent it was really the beginning of a long struggle to determine whether France or England should rule North America . The French recognized this at once , and sent over a very able soldier  --  Count Frontenac  --  with orders to conquer New York ; but the colony was saved by the Iroquois , who in the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laid siege to Montreal , and roasted French captives under its walls . Frontenac was compelled to put off his attack till 1690 , when in the dead of winter a band of French and Indians burned Schenectady , N.Y . Salmon Falls in New Hampshire was next laid waste ( 1690 ) , and Fort Loyal , where Portland , Me. , is , was taken and destroyed . A little later Exeter , N.H. , was attacked . The boldness and suddenness of these fearful massacres so alarmed the people exposed to them that in May , 1690 , delegates from Massachusetts , Plymouth , Connecticut , and New York met at New York city to devise a plan of attack on the French . Now , at the opening of the war , there were three French strongholds in America . These were Montreal and Quebec in Canada , and Port Royal in Acadia . In 1690 a Massachusetts fleet led by Sir William Phips destroyed Port Royal . It was decided , therefore , to send another fleet under Phips to take Quebec , while troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expeditions were failures , and for seven years the French and Indians ravaged the frontier . In 1692 York , in Maine , was visited and a third of the inhabitants killed . In 1694 Castine was taken and a hundred persons scalped and tomahawked . At Durham , in New Hampshire , prisoners were burned alive . Groton , in Massachusetts , was next visited ; but the boldest of all was the massacre , in 1697 , at Haverhill , a town not thirty-five miles from Boston . In 1696 , Frontenac , at the head of a great array of Canadians , coureurs de bois , and Indians , invaded the country of the Onondagas , and leveled their fortified town to the earth . Illustration : MAP OF PART OF ACADIA %73 . The Struggle for Acadia and New France ; " Queen Anne 's War . " %  --  In 1697 the war ended with the treaty of Ryswick , and " King William 's War " came to a close in America with nothing gained and much lost on each side . The peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and France were again fighting . As William died in 1702 , and was succeeded by his sister-in-law Anne , the struggle which followed in America was called " Queen Anne 's War . " Again Port Royal was captured ( 1710 ) ; again an expedition went against Quebec and failed ( 1711 ) ; and again , year after year , the French and Indians swept along the frontier of New England , burning towns and slaughtering and torturing the inhabitants . At last the treaty of Utrecht , in 1713 , ended the strife , and the first signs of English conquest in America were visible , for the French gave up Acadia and acknowledged the claims of the English to Newfoundland and the country around Hudson Bay . The name Acadia was changed by the conquerors to Nova Scotia . Port Royal , never again to be parted with , they called Annapolis , in honor of the Queen. 1 Footnote 1 : Read Parkman 's A Half-century of Conflict , Vol . I. , pp. 1-149. %74 . The French take Possession of the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made at Utrecht was unbroken for thirty years . But this long period was , on the part of the French in America , at least , a time of careful preparation for the coming struggle for possession of the valleys of the Mississippi , the Ohio , and the Lakes . In the Mississippi valley most elaborate preparations for defense were already under way . No sooner did the treaty of Ryswick end the first French war than a young naval officer named Iberville applied to the King for leave to take out an expedition and found a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi , just as La Salle had attempted to do . Permission was readily given , and in 1698 Iberville sailed with two ships from France , and in February , 1699 , entered Mobile Bay . Leaving his fleet at anchor , he set off with a party in small boats in search of the great river . He coasted along the shore , entered the Mississippi through one of its three mouths , and went up the river till he came to an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonty , thirteen years before , when in search of La Salle , had written and left in the crotch of a tree . Iberville now knew that he was on the Mississippi ; but having seen no spot along its low banks suitable for the site of a city , he went back and led his colony to Biloxi Bay , and there settled it . Thus when the eighteenth century opened there were in all Louisiana but two French settlements  --  that founded on the Illinois River by La Salle , and that begun by Iberville at Biloxi . But the occupation of Louisiana was now the established policy of France , and hardly a year went by without one or more forts appearing somewhere in the valley . Before 1725 came , Mobile Bay was occupied , New Orleans was founded , and Forts Rosalie , Toulouse , Tombeckbee , Natchitoches , Assumption , and Chartres were erected . Along the Lakes , Detroit had been founded , Niagara was built in 1726 , and in 1731 a band of Frenchmen , entering New York , put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Conflict , Vol . I. , pp. 288-314 . For the French posts see map on pp. 74 , 75 . The meaning of this chain of forts stretching from New Orleans and Mobile to Lake Champlain and Montreal , was that the French were determined to shut the English out of the valley of the Mississippi , and to keep them away from the shores of the Great Lakes . But they were also determined at the first chance to reconquer Annapolis and Nova Scotia , which they had lost by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . As a very important step towards the accomplishment of this purpose , the French selected a harbor on the southeast coast of Cape Breton Island , and there built Louisburg , a fortress so strong that the French officers boasted that it could be defended by a garrison of women . %75 . The Struggle for New France ; " King George 's War . " %  --  Such was the situation in America when ( in March , 1744 ) France declared war on England and began what in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but in our country it was known as " King George 's War , " because George II . was then King of England . The French , with their usual promptness , rushed down and burned the little English post of Canso , in Nova Scotia , carried off the garrison , and attacked Annapolis , where they were driven off . That Nova Scotia could be saved , seemed hopeless . Nevertheless , Governor Shirley of Massachusetts determined to make the attempt , and that the King might know the exact situation he sent to London , with a dispatch , an officer named Captain Ryal , who had been taken prisoner at Canso and afterwards released on parole. 2 Footnote 2 : The reception of that officer well illustrates the gross ignorance of America and American affairs which then existed in England . When the Duke of Newcastle , who was prime minister , read the dispatch , he exclaimed : " Oh , yes  --  yes  --  to be sure . Annapolis must be defended  --  troops must be sent to Annapolis . Pray where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it me on the map . So it is , sure enough . My dear sir to Captain Ryal , you always bring us good news . I must go and tell the King that Cape Breton is an island . " Although Shirley applied to the King for help with which to defend Nova Scotia , he knew full well that the burden of defense would fall on the colonies . And with that determination and persistence which always brings success he labored hard to persuade New Hampshire , Connecticut , and Rhode Island to join with Massachusetts in an effort to capture Louisburg . It would be delightful to tell how he overcame all difficulties ; how the young men rallied on the call for troops ; how at the end of March , 1745 , 4000 of them in a hundred transports and accompanied by fourteen armed ships set sail , followed by the prayers of all New England , and after a siege of six weeks took the fortress on the 17th of June , 1745 . But the story is too long. 1 It is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of the Atlantic , but that when peace came , in 1748 , the British government was still so blind to the struggle for North America which had been going on for fifty years , that Louisburg was restored to the French .

The French on the Allegheny River ; the Buried Plates. %  --  With Louisburg back in their possession and no territory lost , the French went on more vigorously than ever with their preparations to shut the British out of the Mississippi valley ; and as but one highway to the valley , the Ohio River , was still unguarded , the governor of Canada , in 1749 , dispatched Celoron de Bienville with a band of men in twenty-three birch-bark canoes to take formal possession of the valley . Paddling up the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario , they carried their canoes across to Lake Erie , and , skirting the southeastern shore , they landed and crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated to the Allegheny River . Once on the Allegheny , the ceremony of taking possession began . The men were drawn up , and Louis XV . was proclaimed king of all the region drained by the Ohio . The arms of France stamped on a sheet of tin were nailed to a tree , at the foot of which a lead plate was buried in the ground . On the plate was an inscription claiming the Ohio , and all the streams that run into it , in the name of the King of France . Illustration : 1Half of one of the lead plates Footnote 1 : Now owned by the American Antiquarian Society , Worcester , Mass. * * * * * TRANSLATION OF THE ENTIRE INSCRIPTION In the year 1749 , during the reign of Louis XV. , King of France , we , Celeron , commander of a detachment sent by the Marquis de la Gallissoniere , commander in chief of New France , to restore tranquillity in some savage villages of these districts , have buried this plate at the confluence of the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful River , as a monument of our having retaken possession of the said river Ohio and of those that fall into the same , and of all the lands on both sides as far as the sources of the said rivers , as well as of those of which preceding kings have enjoyed possession , partly by the force of arms , partly by treaties , especially by those of Ryswick , Utrecht , and Aix-la-Chapelle. * * * * * A second plate was buried below the mouth of French Creek ; a third near the mouth of Wheeling Creek ; and a fourth at the mouth of the Muskingum , where half a century later it was found protruding from the river bank by a party of boys while bathing . Yet another was unearthed at the mouth of the Great Kanawha by a freshet , and was likewise found by a boy while playing at the water 's edge .

The French build Forts on the Allegheny. %  --  This formal taking possession of the valleys of the Allegheny and the Ohio was all well enough in its way ; but the French knew that if they really intended to keep out the British they must depend on forts and troops , and not on lead plates . To convince the French King of this , required time ; so that it was not till 1752 that orders were given to fortify the route taken by Celoron in 1749 . The party charged with this duty repaired to the little peninsula where is now the city of Erie , and there built a log fort which they called Presque Isle . Having done this , they cut a road twenty miles long , to the site of Waterford , Pa. , and built Fort Le Boeuf , and later one at Venango , the present site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Public Service. %  --  The arrival of the French in western Pennsylvania alarmed and excited no one so much as Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia . He had two good reasons for his excitement . In the first place , Virginia , because of the interpretation she placed on her charter of 1609 , claimed to own the Allegheny valley ( see p. 33 ) . In the second place , the governor and a number of Virginia planters were deeply interested in a great land company called the Ohio Company , to which the King of England had given 500,000 acres lying along the Ohio River between the Monongahela and the Kanawha rivers , a region which the French claimed , and toward which they were moving . As soon , therefore , as Dinwiddie heard that the French were really building forts in the upper Allegheny valley , he determined to make a formal demand for their withdrawal , and chose as his messenger George Washington , then a young man of twenty-one , and adjutant general of the Virginia militia . Washington 's instructions bade him go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could as to the whereabouts of the French , and then proceed to the commanding officer , deliver the letter of Dinwiddie , and demand an answer . He was especially charged to ascertain how many French forts had been erected , how many soldiers there were in each , how far apart the posts were , and if they were to be supported from Quebec. 1 Footnote 1 : Read T.J. Chapman 's The , French in the Allegheny Valley , pp. 23-47 ; Parkman 's Montcalm and Wolfe , Vol . I. , pp. 128-161 ; Lodge 's George Washington , pp. 62-69 . With that promptness which distinguished him during his whole life , Washington set out on his perilous journey the very day he received his instructions , and made his way first to Logstown , and then to Fort Le Boeuf , where he delivered Governor Dinwiddie 's letter to the French commandant . The reply of Saint-Pierre  --  for that was the name of the French commandant  --  was that he would send the letter of Dinwiddie to the governor of Canada , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the meantime , he would hold the fort . Illustration : The French and the English Forts %79 . Fort Duquesne. %  --  When Dinwiddie read the answer of Saint-Pierre , he saw clearly that the time had come to act . The French were in force on the upper Allegheny . Unless something was done to drive them out , they would soon be at the forks of the Ohio , and once they were there , the splendid tract of the Ohio Company would be lost forever . Without a moment 's delay he decided to take possession of the forks of the Ohio , and raised two companies of militia of 100 men each . A trader named William Trent was in command of one of the companies , and that no time should be lost , he , with forty men , hurried forward , and , February 17 , 1754 , drove the first stake of a stockade that was to surround a fort on the site of the city of Pittsburg . While the English were still at work on their fort , April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down from Le Boeuf , and bade them leave the valley . Trent was away , and the working party was in command of an ensign named Ward , who , as resistance was useless , surrendered , and was allowed to march off with his men . The French then finished the fort Trent had begun , and called it Fort Duquesne , after the governor of Canada . %80 . " Join or Die . " %  --  Meantime the legislature of Virginia voted L10,000 for the defense of the Ohio valley , and promised a land bounty to every man who would volunteer to fight the French and Indians . Joshua Frye was made colonel , and Washington lieutenant colonel of the troops thus to be raised . As some time must elapse before the ranks could be filled , Washington took seventy-five men and ( in March , 1754 ) set off to help Trent ; but he had not gone far on his way when Ensign Ward met him ( where Cumberland , Md. , now is ) and told him all about the surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governors of Maryland , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . Illustration : JOIN , or DIE . In publishing one of these in the Pennsylvania Gazette , Franklin inserted the above picture at the top of the account. 1 Footnote 1 : There is an old superstition , then very generally believed , that if one cuts a snake in pieces and allows the pieces to touch , the snake will not die , but will live and become whole again . By this picture Franklin meant that unless the colonies joined for defense against the French they would die ; that is , be conquered. %81 . Albany Plan of Union. %  --  The picture was apt for the following reason . The Lords of Trade in London had ordered the colonies to send delegates to Albany to make a treaty with the Iroquois Indians , and to this congress Franklin purposed to submit a plan for union against the French . The plan drawn up by the congress was not approved by the colonies , so the scheme of union came to naught . %82 . Washington 's Expedition. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Washington met Ensign Ward at Cumberland and heard the story of the surrender , he was at a loss just what to do ; but knowing that he was expected to do something , he decided to go to a storehouse which the Ohio Company had built at the mouth of a stream called Redstone Creek in southwestern Pennsylvania . Pushing along , cutting as he went the first road that ever led down to the valley of the Mississippi from the Atlantic slope , he reached a narrow glade called the Great Meadows and there began to put up a breastwork which he named Fort Necessity . While so engaged news came that the French were near . Washington thereupon took a few men , and , coming suddenly on the French , killed or captured them all save one . Among the dead was Jumonville , the leader of the party . Well satisfied with this exploit , Washington pushed on with his entire force towards the Ohio . But , hearing that the French were advancing , he fell back to Fort Necessity , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French and Indians came down in great force , and on July 4 , 1754 , forced him , after a brave resistance , to surrender . He was allowed to march out with drums beating and flags flying. 1 Footnote 1 : Lodge 's George Washington , pp. 69-74 ; Winsor 's The Mississippi Basin , pp. 294-315. %83 . The French and Indian War. %  --  Thus was begun what the colonists called the French and Indian War , but what was really a struggle between the French and the British for the possession of America . Knowing it to be such , both sides made great preparations for the contest . The French stood on the defensive . The British made the attack , and early in 1755 sent over one of their ablest officers , Major General Edward Braddock , to be commander in chief in America . He summoned the colonial governors to meet him at Alexandria , Va. , where a plan for a campaign was agreed on . %84 .

One was to go north from New York to Lake Champlain , take the French fort at Crown Point , and move against Quebec . 2 . Another was to sail from New England and make such a demonstration against the French towns to the northeast , as would prevent the French in that quarter going off to defend Quebec and Crown Point . 3 . The third was to start from Albany , go up the Mohawk , and down the Oswego River to Lake Ontario , and along its shores to the Niagara River . 4 . The fourth was to go from Fort Cumberland across Pennsylvania to Fort Duquesne. %85 . Braddock 's Defeat , July 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made Washington one of his aids . For a while he found it impossible to move his army , for in Virginia horses and wagons were very scarce , and without them he could not carry his baggage or drag his cannon . At last Benjamin Franklin , then deputy postmaster-general of the colonies , persuaded the farmers of Pennsylvania , who had plenty , to rent the wagons and horses to the general . All this took time , so that it was June before the army left Fort Cumberland and literally began to cut its way through the woods to Fort Duquesne . The march was slow , but all went well till the troops had crossed the Monongahela River and were but eight miles from the fort , when suddenly the advance guard came face to face with an army of Indians and French . The Indians and French instantly hid in the bushes and behind trees , and poured an incessant fire into the ranks of the British . They , too , would gladly have fought in Indian fashion . But Braddock thought this cowardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they stood huddled in groups , a fine mark for the Indians , till so many were killed that a retreat had to be ordered . Then they fled , and had it not been for Washington and his Virginians , who covered their flight , they would probably have been killed to a man. 1 Footnote 1 : Read Parkman 's Montcalm and Wolfe , Vol . I. , Chap . 7 , pp. 162-187 ; T.J. Chapman 's The French in the Allegheny Valley , pp. 60-72 ; Sargeant 's History of Braddock 's Expedition . Braddock was wounded just as the retreat began , and died a few days later . %86 . The Other Expeditions. %  --  The expedition against Niagara was a failure . The officer in command did not take his army further than Oswego on Lake Ontario . The expedition against Crown Point was partially successful , and a stubborn battle was fought and a victory won over the French on the shores of that beautiful sheet of water which the English ever after called Lake George in honor of the King . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the fighting had been done along the frontier in America . But in May , 1756 , Great Britain formally declared war against France . The French at once sent over Montcalm , 1 the very ablest Frenchman that ever commanded on this continent , and there followed two years of warfare disastrous to the British . Montcalm took and burned Oswego , won over the Indians to the cause of France , and was about to send a strong fleet to attack New England , when , toward the end of 1757 , William Pitt was made virtually ( though not in name ) Prime Minister of England . Footnote 1 : Read Parkman 's Montcalm and Wolfe , Vol . I. , pp. 318-380 . William Pitt was one of the greatest Englishmen that ever lived .

In that same year Washington captured Fort Duquesne , which , in honor of the great Prime Minister , was called Fort Pitt . A provincial officer named Bradstreet destroyed Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario . This was a heavy blow to the French ; for with Fort Frontenac gone and Fort Duquesne in English hands , the Ohio was cut off from Quebec . An attack on Ticonderoga , however , was repulsed by Montcalm with dreadful loss to the English . %89 . The Victories of 1759 ; Wolfe. %  --  But the defeat was only temporary . At the siege of Louisburg a young officer named James Wolfe had greatly distinguished himself , and in return for this was selected by Pitt to command an expedition to Quebec .

But the resolution of Wolfe overcame every obstacle : on the night of September 12 , 1759 , he led his troops to the foot of the cliff , climbed the heights , and early in the morning had his army drawn up in battle array on the Plains of Abraham , as the plateau behind the city was called . There a great battle was fought between the French , led by Montcalm , and the British , led by Wolfe . The British triumphed , and Quebec fell ; but Wolfe and Montcalm were among the dead. 1 Footnote 1 : Parkman 's Montcalm and Wolfe , Chaps . 25-27 ; A.

It is enough for us to know that France divided her possessions on this continent between Great Britain and Spain . To Great Britain she gave Canada and Cape Breton , and all the islands save two in the Gulf of St. Lawrence . Entering what is now the United States , she drew a line down the middle of the Mississippi River from its source to a point just north of New Orleans . To Great Britain she surrendered all her territory east of this line . To Spain she gave all her possessions to the west of this line , together with the city of New Orleans . But Great Britain , during the war , had taken Havana from Spain . To get this back , Spain now gave up Florida in exchange .

The second was Holland when New Netherland was captured by the English . The third was France . 1 . The struggle for the French possessions in America may be divided into two periods : A.

When they refused , troops were sent to build a fort on the site of what is now Pittsburg ; but these men , under Trent and Ward , were driven away , as were also the reinforcements under Washington ( 1764 ) . 7 . Braddock ( with Washington ) was next sent against the French , who had built Fort Duquesne . He was surprised by the Indians ( July 9 , 1755 ) , defeated , and killed . 8 . The " French and Indian War " thus opened was fought with varying success till 1760 , when the British held Quebec , Montreal , Fort Duquesne , and all the other French strongholds in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French possessions east of the Mississippi River were surrendered to the British . * * * * * THE FRENCH DRIVEN FROM AMERICA : THE STRUGGLE FOR NEW FRANCE AND ACADIA : King William 's War : 1690 .

Things unknown in 1763. %  --  Had a traveler landed on our shores in 1763 and made a journey through the English colonies in America , he would have seen a country utterly unlike the United States of to-day . The entire population , white man and black , freeman and slave , was not so great as that of New York or Philadelphia or Chicago in our time . If we were to write a list of all the things we now consider as real necessaries of daily life and mark off those unknown to the men of 1763 , not one quarter would remain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a furnace , or a friction match , or an envelope , or a piece of mineral coal . From the farmer we should have to take the reaper , the drill , the mowing machine , and every kind of improved rake and plow , and give him back the scythe , the cradle , and the flail . From our houses would go the sewing machine , the daily newspaper , gas , running water ; and from our tables , the tomato , the cauliflower , the eggplant , and many varieties of summer fruits . We should have to destroy every railroad , every steamboat , every factory and mill , pull down every line of telegraph , silence every telephone , put out every electric light , and tear up every telegraphic cable from the beds of innumerable rivers and seas . We should have to take ether and chloroform from the surgeon , and galvanized iron and India rubber from the arts , and give up every sort of machine moved by steam . Illustration : Lamp and sadiron Illustration : Postrider ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . State of the Arts , Sciences , and Industry. %  --  The appliances left on the list , because in some form they were known to the men of 1763 , would now be thought crude and clumsy . There were printing presses in those days ,  --  perhaps fifty in all the colonies . But they were small , were worked by hand , and were so slow that the most expert pressman using one of them could not have printed so much in three working days as a modern steam press can run off in five minutes . There was a general post , and Benjamin Franklin was deputy postmaster-general for the northern district of the colonies . But the letters were carried thirty miles a day by postriders on horseback , and there were never more than three mails a week between even the great towns . Every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday a postrider left New York city for Philadelphia . Every Monday and Thursday another left New York for Boston . Once each week a rider left for Albany on his way to Quebec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat sailed from New York for Falmouth , England , with the mail , and this was the only mail between Great Britain and her American colonies . We put electricity to a thousand uses ; but in 1763 it was a scientific toy . Franklin had just proved by his experiment with the kite that lightning and electricity were one and the same , and several other men were amusing themselves and their hearers by ringing bells , exploding powder , and making colored sparks . But it was put to no other use . If we take up a daily newspaper published in one of our great cities and read the column of wants , we find in them twenty occupations now giving a comfortable living to millions of men . Yet not one of these twenty existed in 1763 . The district messenger , the telegraph operator , the typewriter , the stenographer , the bookkeeper , the canvasser , the salesman , the commercial traveler , the engineer , the car driver , the hackman , the conductor , the gripman , the brakeman , the electrician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of others , follow trades and occupations which had no existence in the middle of the eighteenth century .

Labor. %  --  On the other hand , if we take up a newspaper of that day and read the advertisements , we find that a great deal of what existed then does not exist now . The newspapers were published in a few of the large towns , and appeared not every day , but once a week . In the largest of them would be from seventy-five to eighty advertisements , setting forth that such a merchant had just received from England or the West Indies a stock of new goods which he would sell for cash ; that the Charming Nancy would sail in a few weeks for Londonderry in Ireland , or for Barbados , or for Amsterdam in Holland , and wanted a cargo ; that a tract of land or a plantation would be sold " at vendue , " or , as we say , at auction ; that a reward of five pistoles would be paid for the arrest of " a lusty negroe man " or an " indented servant " or an " apprentice lad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very rarely is a call made for a mechanic or a workman of any sort . Illustration : From a Philadelphia newspaper The reason for this was two fold . In the first place , negro slavery existed in all the thirteen colonies . In the second place , there were thousands of whites in many of the colonies in a state of temporary servitude , which was sometimes voluntary and sometimes involuntary . Those who served against their will were convicts and felons , not only men and women who had been guilty of stealing , cheating , and the like , but also forgers , counterfeiters , and murderers , who were transported by thousands from the English prisons to the colonies and sold into slavery or service for seven or fourteen years. 1 Advertisements are extant in which the masters from whom such servants have run away warn the people to beware of them . Footnote 1 : One act of Parliament , for instance , provided that persons sentenced to be whipped or branded might , if they wished , escape the punishment by serving seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another allowed convicts sentenced to death to commute the sentence by serving fourteen years . But all " indented " or bond servants were not criminals . Many were reputable persons who sold themselves into service for a term of years in return for transportation to America . Others , generally boys and young women , had been kidnaped and sold by the persons who stole them . %94 . Indentured Servants. %  --  In the case of such as came voluntarily , carefully drawn agreements called indentures would be made in writing . The captain of the ship would agree to bring the emigrant to America . The emigrant would agree in return to serve the captain three or five years . When the ship reached port , the captain would advertise the fact that he had carpenters , tailors , farmers , shoemakers , etc. , for sale , and whoever wanted such labor would go on board the ship and for perhaps fifty dollars buy a man bound to serve him for several years in return for food , clothes , and lodging . Not only men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and were known as " indented servants , " or " redemptioners , " because they redeemed their time of service with labor . Their lot seems to have been a hard one ; for the young men were constantly running away , and the newspapers are full of advertisements offering rewards for their arrest . What we call the workingman , the day laborer , the mechanic , the mill hand , had no existence as classes . The great corporations , railroads , express companies , mills , factories of every sort , which now cover our land and give employment to five times as many men and women as lived in all the colonies in 1763 , are the creatures of our own time . Illustration : Wigs and wig bag Illustration : Flax wheel %95 . No Manufacturers. %  --  For this state of things England was largely to blame . For one hundred years past every kind of manufacture that could compete with the manufactures of the mother country had been crushed by law . In order to help her iron makers , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills . That her cloth manufacturers might flourish , she forbade the colonists to send their woolen goods to any country whatever , or even from one colony to another . Under this law it was a crime to knit a pair of mittens or a pair of socks and send them from Boston to Providence or from New York to Newark , or from Philadelphia across the Delaware to New Jersey . In the interest of English hatters the colonists were not allowed to send hats to any foreign country , nor from one colony to another , and a serious effort was made to prevent the manufacture of hats in America . People in this country were obliged to wear English-made hats . Taking the country through , every saw , every ax , every hammer , every needle , pin , tack , piece of tape , and a hundred other articles of daily use came from Great Britain . Every farmhouse , however , was a little factory , and every farmer a jack-of-all-trades . He and his sons made their own shoes , beat out nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and constructed much of the household furniture . The wife and her daughters manufactured the clothing , from dressing the flax and carding the wool to cutting the cloth ; knit the mittens and socks ; and during the winter made straw bonnets to sell in the towns in the spring . Even in such towns as were large enough to support a few artisans , each made , with the help of an apprentice , and perhaps a journeyman , all the articles he sold . Illustration : Hand loom1 %96 . The Cities. %  --  If we take a map of our country and run over the great cities of to-day , we find that except along the seacoast hardly one existed , in 1765 , even in name . Detroit was a little French settlement surrounded with a high stockade . New Orleans existed , and St. Louis had just been founded , but they both belonged to Spain . Mobile and Pensacola and Natchez and Vincennes consisted of a few huts gathered about old French forts . There was no city , no town worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alleghany Mountains . Along the Atlantic coast we find Portsmouth , Boston , Providence , New Haven , New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Alexandria , Williamsburg , Charleston , Savannah , and others of less note . But the largest of these were mere collections of a few hundred houses ranged along streets , none of which were sewered and few of which were paved or lighted . The watchman went his rounds at night with rattle and lantern , called out the hours and the state of the weather , and stopped and demanded the name of every person found walking the streets after nine o'clock . To travel on Sunday was a serious and punishable offense , as it was on any day to smoke in the streets , or run from house to house with hot coals , which in those days , when there were no matches , were often used instead of flint and steel to light fires .

The first stagecoach-and-four in New England began its trips in 1744 . The first stage between New York and Philadelphia was not set up till 1756 , and spent three days on the road . %97 . The Three Groups of Colonies. %  --  It has always been usual to arrange the colonies in three groups : 1 . The Eastern or New England Colonies ( New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Connecticut ) . 2 . The Middle Colonies ( New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Delaware ) . 3 . The Southern Colonies ( Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia ) . Now , this arrangement is good not only from a geographical point of view , but also because the people , the customs , the manners , the occupations , in each of these groups were very unlike the people and the ways of living in the others . Illustration : New England mansion %98 . Occupations in New England. %  --  In New England the colonists were almost entirely English , though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees from France , and , in Rhode Island , a few Portuguese Jews . As the climate and soil did not admit of raising any great staple , such as rice or tobacco , the people " took to the sea . " They cut down trees , with which the land was covered , built ships , and sailed away to the Grand Banks off Newfoundland for cod , and to the whale fisheries for oil . They went to the English , Dutch , and Spanish West Indian Islands , with flour , salt meat , horses , oxen ; with salted salmon , cod , and mackerel ; with staves for barrels ; with onions and salted oysters . In return , they came back with sugar , molasses , cotton , wool , logwood , and Spanish dollars with which the New England Colonies paid for the goods they took from England . They went to Spain , where their ships were often sold , the captains chartering English vessels and coming home with cargoes of goods made in England . Six hundred ships are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more than a thousand in the fisheries and the trade along the coast . Illustration : Dutch House at Albany1 Footnote 1 : From an old print . Farming , outside of Connecticut , yielded little more than a bare subsistence . Manufactures in general were forbidden by English law . Paper and hats were made in small quantities , leather was tanned , lumber was sawed , and rum was distilled from molasses ; but it was on homemade manufactures that the people depended . %99 . Occupations in the Middle Colonies. %  --  In the Middle Colonies the population was a mixture of people from many European countries . The line of little villages which began at the west end of Long Island and stretched up the Hudson to Albany , and out the Mohawk to Schenectady  --  - the settled part of New York  --  contained Englishmen , Irishmen , Dutchmen , French Huguenots , Germans from the Rhine countries , and negroes from Africa . The chief occupations of those people were farming , making flour , and carrying on an extensive commerce with England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoes worn by Palatines in Pennsylvania In New Jersey the population was almost entirely English , but in Pennsylvania it was as mixed as in New York . Around Philadelphia the English predominated , but with them were mingled Swedes , Dutch , Welsh , Germans , and Scotch-Irish . Taken together , the Germans and the Scotch-Irish far outnumbered the English , and made up the mass of the population between the Schuylkill and the Susquehanna rivers . Both were self-willed and stubborn , and they were utterly unable to get along together peaceably , so that their settlements ran across the state in two parallel bands , in one of which whole regions could be found in which not a word of English was spoken . Indeed , then , and long after the nineteenth century began , the laws of Pennsylvania were printed both in English and in German . The chief occupation of the people was farming ; and it is safe to say that no such farms , no such cattle , no such grain , flour , provisions , could be found in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and sold in great quantities ; and along the frontier there was a lively fur trade with the Indians . At Philadelphia was centered a fine trade with Europe and the West Indies . Had it not been for the action of the mother country , manufactures would have flourished greatly ; even as it was , iron and paper were manufactured in considerable quantities . %100 . Occupations in the Southern Colonies. %  --  South of Pennsylvania , and especially south of the Potomac River , lay a region utterly unlike anything to the north of it . In Virginia , there were no cities , no large towns , no centers of population . At an early day in the history of the colony the legislature had attempted to remedy this , and had ordered towns to be built at certain places , had made them the only ports where ships from abroad could be entered , had established tobacco warehouses in them , had offered special privileges to tradesmen who would settle in them , and had provided that each should have a market and a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria and Petersburg were straggling villages . Jamestown , the old capital , had by this time ceased to exist . Williamsburg , the new capital , was a village of 200 houses . There was no business , no incentive in Virginia to build towns . The planters owned immense plantations along the river banks , and raised tobacco , which , when gathered , cured , and packed into hogsheads , was rolled away to the nearest wharf for inspection and shipment to London . In those early days , when good roads were unknown and wagons few , shafts were attached to each hogshead by iron bolts driven into the heads , and the cask was thus turned into a huge roller . With each year 's crop would go a long list of articles of every sort ,  --  hardware , glass , crockery , clothing , furniture , household utensils , wines ,  --  which the agent was instructed to buy with the proceeds of the tobacco and send back to the planter when the ships came a year later for another crop . The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cart wheels , bowls , birch brooms , all came from the mother country . The wood used for building houses was actually cut , sent to England as logs to be dressed , and then taken back to Virginia for use . Illustration : Tobacco rolling1 Footnote 1 : From a model in the National Museum , Washington . Maryland was in the same condition . Her people raised tobacco , and with it bought their clothing , household goods , brass and copper wares , and iron utensils in Great Britain . In South Carolina rice was the great staple , just as tobacco was the staple of Virginia , and there too were large plantations and no towns . All the social , commercial , legal , and political life of the colony centered in Charleston , from which a direct trade was carried on with London . Illustration : %An old Maryland manor house% Labor on the plantations of Virginia , the two Carolinas , and Georgia was performed exclusively by negro slaves and redemptioners. %101 . Civil Government in the English Colonies. %  --  If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in each , we find that they fall into three classes : 1 . The charter colonies ( Connecticut , Massachusetts , and Rhode Island ) . 2 . The proprietary colonies ( Pennsylvania , Delaware , and Maryland ) . 3 . The royal , or provincial , colonies ( New Hampshire , New York , New Jersey , Virginia , North and South Carolina , and Georgia ) . The charters of the first group were written contracts between the King and the colonists , defined the share each should have in the government , and were not to be changed without the consent of both parties . In colonies of the second group some individual , called the proprietary , was granted a great tract of land by the King , and , under a royal charter , was given power to sell the land to settlers , establish government , and appoint the governors of his colony . In the third group , the King appointed the governors and instructed them as to the way in which he wished his colonies to be ruled . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government . In each there was a legislature elected by the people ; in each the right to vote was limited to men who owned land , paid taxes , had a certain yearly income , and were members of some Christian church . The legislature consisted of two branches : the lower house , to which the people elected delegates ; and the upper house , or council , appointed by the governor . These legislatures could do many things , but their powers were limited and their acts were subject to review : 1 . They could do nothing contrary to the laws of England . 2 . Whatever they did could be vetoed by the governors , and no bill could be passed over the veto . 3 . All laws passed by a colonial legislature ( except in the case of Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Maryland ) , and approved by a governor , must even then be sent to England to be examined by the King in Council , and could be " disallowed " or vetoed by the King at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the colonial legislatures , in time , would pass laws to run for two years , and when that time expired would reenact them for two years more , and so on in order to avoid the veto . In this way the colonists became used to three political institutions which were afterwards embodied in what is now the American system of state and national government : 1 . The written constitution defining the powers of government . 2 . The exercise of the veto power by the governor . 3 . The setting aside of laws by a judicial body from whose decision there is no appeal . %102 . The Colonial Governors. %  --  The governor of a royal province was the personal representative of the King , and as such had vast power . The legislature could meet only when he called it . He could at any moment prorogue it ( that is , command it to adjourn to a certain day ) or dissolve it , and , if the King approved , he need never call it together again . He was the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judges , and , as commander in chief of the militia , appointed all important officers . Yet even he was subject to some control , for his salary was paid by the colony over which he ruled , and , by refusing to pay this salary , the legislature could , and over and over again did , force him to approve acts he would not otherwise have sanctioned . In Connecticut and Rhode Island the people elected the governors . This right once existed also in Massachusetts ; but when the old charter was swept away in 1684 , and replaced by a new one in 1691 , the King was given power to appoint the governor , who could summon , the King should give personal attention to all the details of government in his colonies in America , was not to be expected . In 1696 , therefore , a body called the Lords of the Board of Trade and Plantations was commissioned by the King to do this work for him . These Lords of Trade corresponded with the governors , made recommendations , bade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that class of laws , examined all the laws sent over by the legislatures , and advised the King as to which should be disallowed , or vetoed . In the early years of our colonial history the Parliament of England had no share in the direction of colonial affairs . It was the King who owned all the land , made all the grants , gave all the charters , created all the colonies , governed many of them , and stoutly denied the right of Parliament to meddle . But when Charles I. was beheaded , the Long Parliament took charge of the management of affairs in this country , and although much of it went back to the King at the Restoration in 1660 , Parliament still continued to legislate for the colonies in a few matters . Thus , for instance , Parliament by one act established the postal service , and fixed the rates of postage ; by another it regulated the currency , and by another required the colonists to change from the Old Style to the New Style  --  that is , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future by the Gregorian calendar ; by another it established a uniform law of naturalization ; and from time to time it passed acts for the purpose of regulating colonial trade . %104 . Acts of Trade and Navigation. %  --  The number of these acts is very large ; but their purpose was four fold : 1 . They required that colonial trade should be carried on in ships built and owned in England or in the colonies , and manned to the extent of two thirds of the crew by English subjects . 2 . They provided a long list of colonial products that should not be sent to any foreign ports other than a port of England . Goods or products not in the list might be sent to any other part of the world . Thus tobacco , sugar , indigo , copper , furs , rice ( if the rice was for a port north of Cape Finisterre ) , must go to England ; but lumber , salt fish , and provisions might go ( in English or colonial ships ) to France , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When trade began to spring up between the colonies , and the New England merchants were competing in the colonial markets with English merchants , an act was passed providing that if a product which went from one colony to another was of a kind that might have been supplied from England , it must either go to the mother country and then to the purchasing colony , or pay an export duty at the port where it was shipped , equal to the import duty it would have to pay in England . 4 . No goods were allowed to be carried from any place in Europe to America unless they were first landed at a port in England. 1 Footnote 1 : Edward Eggleston 's papers in the Century Magazine , 1884 ; Scudder 's Men and Manners One Hundred Years Ago ; Lodge 's English Colonies .

Taking the colonies in geographical groups , the Eastern were engaged in fishing , in commerce , and in farming ; the Middle Colonies were agricultural and commercial ; the Southern were wholly agricultural , and raised two great , staples  --  rice and tobacco . 5 .

Over the colonies , as a great governing body to aid the King , were the Lords of Trade and Plantations in London .

The New Provinces. %  --  The acquisition of Canada and the Mississippi valley made it necessary for England to provide for their defense and government . To do this she began by establishing three new provinces . In Canada she marked out the province of Quebec , part of the south boundary of which is now the north boundary of New York , Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine . In the South , out of the territory given by Spain , she made two provinces , East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ( 1764 ) a parallel of latitude through the junction of the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers . The north boundary of East Florida was part of the boundary of the present state . The territory between the Altamaha and the St. Marys rivers was " annexed to Georgia . " %106 . The Proclamation Line. %  --  By the same proclamation which established these provinces , a line was drawn around the head waters of all the rivers in the United States which flow into the Atlantic Ocean , and the colonists were forbidden to settle to the west of it . All the valley from the Great Lakes to West Florida , and from the proclamation line to the Mississippi , was set apart for the Indians . %107 . The Country to be defended. %  --  Having thus provided for the government of the newly acquired territory , it next became necessary to provide for its defense ; for nobody doubted that both France and Spain would some day attempt to regain their lost possessions . Arrangements were therefore made to bring over an army of 10,000 regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , and maintain them partly at the expense of the colonies and partly at the expense of the crown . Illustration : THE BRITISH COLONIES IN 1764 The share to be paid by the colonies was to be raised 1 . By enforcing the old trade and navigation laws . 2 . By a tax on sugar and molasses brought into the country . 3 . By a stamp tax . %108 . Trial without Jury. %  --  In order to enforce the old laws , naval vessels were sent to sail up and down the coast and catch smugglers . Offenders when seized were to be tried in some vice-admiralty court , where they could not have trial by jury. 1 Footnote 1 : This is one of the things complained of in the Declaration of Independence. %109 . The Sugar Act and Stamp Tax. %  --  The Sugar Act was not a new grievance . In 1733 Parliament laid a tax of 6d. a gallon on molasses and 5s. per hundredweight on sugar brought into this country from any other place than the British West Indies . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molasses from nobody but British sugar planters . After having expired five times and been five times reenacted , the Sugar Act expired for the sixth time in 1763 , and the colonies begged that it might not be renewed . But Parliament merely reduced the molasses duty to 3d. and laid new duties on coffee , French and East Indian goods , indigo , white sugar , and Spanish and Portuguese wines . It then resolved that " for further defraying the expense of protecting the colonists it would be necessary to charge certain stamp duties in the colonies . " At that time , 1764 , no such thing as an internal tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue existed , or ever had existed , in America . Money for the use of the King had always been raised by taxes imposed by the legislatures of the colonies . The moment , therefore , the people heard that this money was to be raised in future by parliamentary taxation , they became much alarmed , and the legislatures instructed their business agents in London to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Grenville , the Prime Minister , was not to be persuaded , and on March 22 , 1765 , Parliament passed the Stamp Act1 . Footnote 1 : The exact text of the Stamp Act has been reprinted in American History Leaflets , No. 21 . For an excellent account of the causes and consequences of the Stamp Act , read Lecky 's England in the Eighteenth Century , Vol . III. , Chap . 12 ; Frothingham 's Rise of the Republic of the United States , Chap . 5 ; Channing 's The United States of America , 1765-1865 , pp. 41-50. %110 . The Stamp Distributors. %  --  That the collection of the new duty might give as little offense to the colonists as possible , Grenville desired that the stamps and the stamped paper should be sold by Americans , and invited the agents of the colonies to name men to be " stamp distributors " in their colonies . The law was to go into effect on the 1st of November , 1765 . After that day every piece of vellum , every piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use in any court , was to be charged with a stamp duty of from three pence to ten pounds sterling . After that day , every license , bond , deed , warrant , bill of lading , indenture , every pamphlet , almanac , newspaper , pack of cards , must be written or printed on stamped paper to be made in England and sold at prices fixed by law . If any dispute arose under the law , the case might be tried in the vice-admiralty courts without a jury. 2 Footnote : The stamps were not the adhesive kind we are now accustomed to fasten on letters . Those used for newspapers and pamphlets and printed documents consisted of a crown surmounting a circle in which were the words , " One Penny Sheet " or " Nine Pence per Quire , " and were stamped on each sheet in red ink by a hand stamp not unlike those used at the present day to cancel stamps on letters . Others , used on vellum and parchment , consisted of a square piece of blue paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little piece of brass . A design was then impressed on the blue paper by means of a little machine like that used by magistrates and notaries public to impress their seals on legal documents . When this was done , the parchment was turned over , and a little piece of white paper was pasted on the back of the stamp . On this white piece was engraved , in black , the design shown in the second picture on p. 113 , the monogram " G. R. " meaning Georgius Rex , or King George . Illustration : Stamps used in 1765 The money raised by this tax was not to be taken to England , but was to be spent in America for the defense of the colonies . Nevertheless , the colonists were determined that none should be raised . The question was not , Shall America support an army ? but , Shall Parliament tax America ? %111 . The Virginia Resolutions. %  --  In opposition to this , Virginia now led the way with a set of resolutions . In the House of Burgesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Patrick Henry , the greatest orator in the colonies . By dint of his fiery words , he forced through a set of resolutions setting forth 1 . That the first settlers in Virginia brought with them " all the privileges and immunities that have at any time been held " by " the people of Great Britain . " 2 . That their descendants held these rights . 3 . That by two royal charters the people of Virginia had been declared entitled to all the rights of Englishmen " born within the realm of England . " 4 . That one of these rights was that of being taxed " by their own Assembly . " 5 . That they were not bound to obey any law taxing them without consent of their Assembly. 1 Footnote 1 : These resolutions , printed in full from Henry 's manuscript copy , are in Channing 's The United States of America , 1765-1865 , pp. 51 , 52 . They were passed May 29 , 1765 . Massachusetts followed with a call for a congress to meet at New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress thus called came delegates from all the colonies except New Hampshire , Virginia , North Carolina , and Georgia . The session began at New York , on the 5th of October , 1765 ; and after sitting in secret for twenty days , the delegates from six of the nine colonies present ( Massachusetts , New York , Rhode Island , Pennsylvania , Delaware , and Maryland ) signed a " Declaration of Rights and Grievances . " 1 Footnote 1 : This declaration is printed in full in Preston 's Documents Illustrative of American History , pp. 188-191. %113 . Declaration of Rights. %  --  The ground taken in the declaration was : 1 . That the Americans were subjects of the British crown . 2 . That it was the natural right of a British subject to pay no taxes unless he had a voice in laying them . 3 . That the Americans were not represented in Parliament . 4 . That Parliament , therefore , could not tax them , and that an attempt to do so was an attack on the rights of Englishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The grievances complained of were : 1 . Taxation without representation . 2 . Trial without jury ( in the vice-admiralty courts ) . 3 . The Sugar Act . 4 . The Stamp Act . 5 . Restrictions on trade . %115 . The English View of Representation. %  --  We , in this country , do not consider a person represented in a legislature unless he can cast a vote for a member of that legislature . In Great Britain , not individuals but classes were represented . Thus , the clergy were represented by the bishops who sat in the House of Lords ; the nobility , by the nobles who had seats in the House of Lords ; and the mass of the people , the commons , by the members of the House of Commons . At that time , very few Englishmen could vote for a member of the House of Commons . Great cities like Liverpool , Leeds , Manchester , did not send even one member . When the colonists held that they were not represented in Parliament because they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were represented , because they were commoners. %116 . Sons of Liberty. %  --  Meantime , the colonists had not been idle . Taking the name of " Sons of Liberty , " a name given to them in a speech by a member of Parliament ( named Barre ) friendly to their cause , they began to associate for resistance to the Stamp Act . At first , they were content to demand that the stamp distributors named by the colonial agents in London should resign . But when these officers refused , the people became violent ; and at Boston , Newark , N.J. , New Haven , New London , Conn. , at Providence , at Newport , R.I. , at Dover , N.H. , at Annapolis , Md. , serious riots took place . Buildings were torn down , and more than one unhappy distributor was dragged from his home , and forced to stand before the people and shout , " Liberty , property , and no stamps . " %117 . November 1 , 1765. %  --  As the 1st of November , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , approached , the newspapers appeared decorated with death's-heads , black borders , coffins , and obituary notices . The Pennsylvania Journal dropped its usual heading , and in place of it put an arch with a skull and crossbones underneath , and this motto , " Expiring in the hopes of a resurrection to life again . " In one corner was a coffin , and the words , " The last remains of the Pennsylvania Journal , which departed this life the 31st of October , 1765 , of a stamp in her vitals . Aged 23 years . " The Pennsylvania Gazette , on November 7 , the day of its first issue after the Stamp Act became law , published a half sheet , printed on one side , without any heading , and in its place the words , " No stamped paper to be had . " During the next six months , every scrap of stamped paper that was heard of was hunted up and given to the flames . Thus , when a vessel from Barbados , with a stamped newspaper published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized and burned , one evening , at the coffeehouse , in the presence of a great crowd . A vessel having put in from Halifax , a rumor spread that the captain had brought stamped paper with him , and was going to use it for his Philadelphia clearance . This so enraged the people that the vessel was searched , and a sheet of paper with three stamps on it was found , and burned at the coffee-house . %118 . Non-importation Agreements. %  --  Meantime , the merchants in the larger towns , and the people all over the country , had been making written agreements not to import any goods from England for some months to come . The effect of this measure was immense . Not a merchant nor a manufacturer in Great Britain , engaged in the colonial trade , but found his American orders canceled and his goods left on his hands . Not a ship returned from this country but carried back English wares which it had brought here to sell , but for which no purchaser could be found . %119 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1765 , such a cry of distress came up from the manufacturing cities of England , that Parliament was forced to yield , and in March , 1766 , the Stamp Act was repealed . In the outburst of joy which followed in America , the intent and meaning of another act passed at the same time was little heeded . In it was the declaration that Parliament did have the right to tax the colonies " in all cases whatsoever . " %120 . The Townshend Acts. %  --  If the people thought this declaration had no meaning , they were much mistaken , for next year ( 1767 ) Parliament passed what have since been called the Townshend Acts . There were three of them . One forbade the legislature of New York to pass any more laws till it had provided the royal troops in the city with beds , candles , fire , vinegar , and salt , as required by what was called the Mutiny Act . The second established at Boston a Board of Commissioners of the Customs to enforce the laws relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white lead , painter 's colors , paper , and tea . None of these taxes was heavy . But again the right of Parliament to tax people not represented in it had been asserted , and again the colonists rose in resistance . The legislature of Massachusetts sent a letter to each of the other colonial legislatures , urging them to unite and consult for the protection of their rights . Pennsylvania sent protests to the King and to Parliament . The merchants all over the country renewed their old agreements not to import British goods , and many a shipload was sent back to England . %121 . Colonial Legislatures dissolved. %1  --  The letter of Massachusetts to the colonial legislatures having given great offense to the King , the governors were ordered to see to it that the legislatures did not approve it . But the order came too late . Many had already done so , and as a punishment the assemblies of Maryland and Georgia were dismissed and the members sent home . To dissolve assemblies became of frequent occurrence . The legislature of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That of New York was repeatedly dissolved for refusing to provide the royal troops with provisions . That of Virginia was dismissed for complaining of the treatment of New York . Footnote 1 : One of the charges against the King in the Declaration of Independence. %122 . Boston Riot of 1770. %  --  And now the troops intended for the defense of the colonies began to arrive . But Massachusetts , North Carolina , and South Carolina followed the example of New York , and refused to find them quarters . For this the legislature of North Carolina was dissolved . Everywhere the presence of the soldiers gave great offense ; but in Boston the people were less patient than elsewhere . They accused the soldiers of corrupting the morals of the town ; of desecrating the Sabbath with fife and drum ; of striking citizens who insulted them ; and of using language violent , threatening , and profane . In this state of feeling , an alarm of fire called the people into the streets on the night of March 5 , 1770 . The alarm was false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do , amused themselves by annoying a sentinel on guard at one of the public buildings . He called for help , and a corporal and six men were soon on the scene . But the crowd would not give way . Forty or fifty men came armed with sticks and pressed around the soldiers , shouting , " Rascals ! Lobsters ! Bloody-backs ! " throwing snowballs and occasionally a stone , till in the excitement of the moment a soldier fired his gun . The rest followed his example , and when the reports died away , five of the rioters lay on the ground dead or dying , and six more dangerously wounded. 1 Footnote 1 : The soldiers were tried for murder and were defended by John Adams and Josiah Quincy . Two were found guilty of manslaughter . The rest were acquitted . On the massacre read Frothingham 's Life of Warren , Chaps . 6 , 7 ; Kidder 's The Boston Massacre ; Joseph Warren 's Oration on March 6 , 1775 , in Library of American Literature , Vol . III. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massacre , " or , as the colonists delighted to call it , " the bloody massacre , " excited and aroused the whole land , forced the government to remove the soldiers from Boston to an island in the bay , and did more than anything else which had yet happened , to help on the Revolution . %123 . Tea sent to America and not received. %  --  While these things were taking place in America  --  indeed , on the very day of the Boston riot  --  a motion was made in Parliament for the repeal of all the taxes laid by the Townshend Acts except that on tea . The tea tax of 3d. a pound , payable in the colonies , was retained in order that the right of Parliament to tax America might be vindicated . But the people held fast to their agreements not to consume articles taxed by Great Britain . No tea was drunk , save such as was smuggled from Holland , and at the end of three years ' time the East India Company had 17,000,000 pounds of tea stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company was not permitted to send tea out of England . It might only bring tea to London and there sell it at public sale to merchants and shippers , who exported it to America . But now when the merchants could not find anybody to buy tea in the colonies , they bought less from the company , and the tea lay stored in its warehouses . To relieve the company , and if possible tempt the people to use the tea , the exportation tax was taken off and the company was given leave to export tea to America consigned to commissioners chosen by itself . Taking off the shilling a pound export tax in England , and charging but 3d. import tax in America , made it possible for the company to sell tea cheaper than could the merchants who smuggled it . Yet even this failed . The people forced the tea commissioners to resign or send the tea ships back to England . In Charleston , S.C. , the tea was landed and stored for three years , when it was sold by South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tea should not be landed , they stopped the ship as it came up the Delaware , and sent it back to London . %124 . The Boston Tea Party. %  --  At Boston also the people tried to send the tea ships to England , but the authorities would not allow them to leave , whereupon a band of young men disguised as Indians boarded the vessels , broke open the boxes , and threw the tea into the water . %125 . The Five Intolerable Acts. %  --  When Parliament heard of these events , it at once determined to punish Massachusetts , and in order to do this passed five laws which were so severe that the colonists called them the " Intolerable Acts . " They are generally known as 1 . The Boston Port Bill , which shut the port of Boston to trade and commerce , forbade ships to come in or go out , and moved the customhouse to Marblehead. 2 . The Transportation Bill , which gave the governor power to send anybody accused of murder in resisting the laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Massachusetts Bill , which changed the old charter of Massachusetts , provided for a military governor , and forbade the people to hold public meetings for any other purpose than the election of town officers , without permission from the governor . 4 . The Quartering Act , which legalized the quartering of troops on the people . 5 . The Quebec Act , which enlarged the province of Quebec ( pp. 111 , 124 ) to include all the territory between the Great Lakes , the Ohio River , the Mississippi River , and Pennsylvania . This territory was claimed by Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Virginia under their " sea to sea " charters ( pp. 33 , 46 , 52 , 156 ) . %126 . A Congress called. %  --  When the Virginia legislature in May , 1774 , heard of the passage of the Boston Port Bill , it passed a resolution that the day on which the law went into effect in Boston should be a day of " fasting , humiliation , and prayer " in Virginia . For this the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instructed a committee to correspond with the other colonies on the expediency of holding another general congress of delegates . All the colonies approved , and New York requested Massachusetts to name the time and place of meeting . This she did , selecting Philadelphia as the place , and September 1 , 1774 , as the time . %127 . The First Continental Congress. %  --  From September 5 to October 26 , accordingly , fifty-five delegates , representing every colony except Georgia , held meetings in Carpenter 's Hall at Philadelphia , and issued : 1 . An address to the people of the colonies . 2 . An address to the Canadians . 3 . An address to the people of Great Britain . 4 . An address to the King . 5 . A declaration of rights . %128 . The Declaration of Rights. %1  --  In this declaration the rights of the colonists were asserted to be : 1 . Life , liberty , and property . 2 . To tax themselves . 3 . To assemble peaceably to petition for the redress of grievances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rights granted by the colonial charters . Footnote 1 : Printed in Preston 's Documents , pp. 192-198 . The best account of the coming of the Revolution is Frothingham 's Rise of the Republic of the United States , Chaps . 5-11 . These rights it was declared had been violated : 1 . By taxing the people without their consent . 2 . By dissolving assemblies . 3 . By quartering troops on the people in time of peace . 4 . By trying men without a jury . 5 . By passing the five Intolerable Acts . Before the Congress adjourned it was ordered that another Congress should meet on May 10 , 1775 , in order to take action on the result of the petition to the King . SUMMARY 1 . As soon as Great Britain acquired Canada and the eastern part of the Mississippi valley from France , and Florida from Spain , she did three things : A. She established the provinces of Quebec , East Florida , West Florida , and the Indian country . B. She drew a line round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the west and northwest , and commanded the colonial governors to grant no land and to allow no settlements to be made west of this line . C. She decided to send a standing or permanent army to America to take possession of the new territory and defend the colonies . 2 . A part of the cost of keeping up this army she decided to meet by taxing the colonists . This she had never done before . 3 . The chief tax was the stamp duty on paper , vellum , etc . This the colonists refused to pay , and Parliament repealed it . 4 . The colonists having denied the right of Parliament to tax them , that body determined to establish its right and passed the " Townshend Acts . " But the colonists refused to buy British goods , and Parliament repealed all the Townshend duties except that on tea . 5 . As the Americans would not order tea from London , the East India Company was allowed to send it . But the people in the five cities to which the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parliament thereupon attempted to punish Massachusetts and passed the Intolerable Acts . 7 .

When the 10th of May , 1775 , came , the colonists had ceased to petition and had begun to fight . In accordance with the Massachusetts Bill , General Thomas Gage had been appointed military governor of Massachusetts . He reached Boston in May , 1774 , and summoned an assembly to meet him at Salem in October . But , alarmed at the angry state of the people , he fortified Boston Neck ,  --  the only land approach to the city , and countermanded the meeting . The members , claiming that an assembly could not be dismissed before it met , gave no heed to the proclamation , but gathered at Salem and adjourned to Concord and then to Cambridge . At Cambridge a Committee of Safety was chosen and given power to call out the troops , and steps were taken to collect ammunition and military stores . A month later at another meeting , 12,000 " minute men " were ordered to be enrolled . These minute men were volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice , and lest 12,000 should not be enough , the neighboring colonies were asked to raise the number to 20,000 . Illustration : Map of Country around Boston %130 . Concord and Lexington. %  --  Meantime the arming and drilling went actively on , and powder was procured , and magazines of provisions and military stores were collected at Concord , at Worcester , at Salem , and at many other towns . Aware of this , Gage , on the night of April 18 , 1775 , sent off 800 regulars to destroy the stores at Concord , a town some twenty miles from Boston . Gage wished to keep this expedition secret , but he could not . The fact that the troops were to march became known to the patriots in Boston , who determined to warn the minute men in the neighborhood . Messengers were accordingly stationed at Charlestown and told to ride in every direction and rouse the people , the moment they saw lights displayed from the tower of the Old North Church in Boston . The instant the British began to march , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messengers sped away to do their work. 1 Footnote 1 : The ride of one of these men , that of Paul Revere , has become best known because of Longfellow 's poem , Paul Revere 's Ride . Read it . The road taken by the British lay through the little village of Lexington , and there ( so well had the messengers done their work ) , about sunrise , on the morning of the 19th , the British came suddenly on a little band of minute men drawn up on the green before the meeting house . A call to disperse was not obeyed ; whereupon the British fired a volley , killing or wounding sixteen minute men , and passed on to Concord . There they spiked three cannon , threw some cannon balls and powder into the river , destroyed some flour , set fire to the courthouse , and started back toward Boston . But " the shot heard round the world " had indeed been fired. 2 The news had spread far and wide . The minute men came hurrying in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind trees and stone fences , they poured a deadly fire on the retreating British . The retreat soon became a flight , and the flight would have ended in capture had they not been reenforced by 900 men at Lexington . With the help of these they reached Charlestown Neck by sundown and entered Boston. 3 All night long minute men came in from every quarter , so that by the morning of April 20th great crowds were gathered outside of Charlestown and at Roxbury , and shut the British in Boston .

II. ; Hudson 's History of Lexington , Chaps . 6 , 7 ; Phinney 's Battle of Lexington ; Shattuck 's History of Concord , Chap . 7 . When the news of Concord and Lexington reached the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont , they too took up arms , and , under Ethan Allen , captured Fort Ticonderoga on May 10 , 1775. %131 . Congress becomes a Governing Body. % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies in 1774 , to set forth the views of the people , and remonstrate against the conduct of the King and Parliament . This Congress , it will be remembered , having done so , fixed May 10 , 1775 , as the day whereon a second Congress should meet to consider the results of their remonstrance . But when the day came , Lexington and Concord had been fought , all New England was in arms , and Congress was asked to adopt the army gathered around Boston , and assume the conduct of the war . Congress thus unexpectedly became a governing body , and began to do such things as each colony could not do by itself . %132 . Origin of the Continental Army. %  --  After a month 's delay it did adopt the little band of patriots gathered about Boston , made it the Continental Army , and elected George Washington , then a delegate in Congress , commander in chief . He was chosen because of the military skill he had displayed in the French and Indian War , and because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being then the most populous of the colonies . Washington accepted the trust on June 16 , and set out for Boston on June 21 ; but he had not ridden twenty miles from Philadelphia when he was met by the news of Bunker Hill . %133 . Bunker Hill , June 17 , 1775. %  --  On a narrow peninsula to the north of Boston , and separated from it by a sheet of water half a mile wide , was the village of Charlestown ; behind it were two small hills . The nearer of the two to Charlestown was Breeds Hill . Just beyond it was Bunker Hill , and as the two overlooked Boston and the harbor where the British ships lay at anchor , the possession of them was of much importance . The Americans , learning of Gage 's intention to fortify the hills , sent a force of 1200 men , under Colonel Prescott , on the night of June 16 , to take possession of Bunker Hill . By some mistake Prescott passed Bunker Hill , reached Breeds Hill , and before dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled it to be seen , the British opened fire from their ships . But the Americans worked steadily on in spite of cannon shot , and by noon had constructed a line of intrenchments extending from the earthwork down the hill toward the water . Gage might easily have landed men and taken this intrenchment in the rear . He instead sent Howe1 and 2500 men over in boats from Boston , to land at the foot of the hill and charge straight up its steep side toward the Americans on its summit . The Americans were bidden not to fire till they saw the whites of the enemy 's eyes , and obeyed . Not a shot came from their line till the British were within a few feet . Then a sheet of flames ran along the breastworks , and when the smoke blew away , the British were running down the hill in confusion . With great effort the officers rallied their men and led them up the hill a second time , to be again driven back to the landing place . This fire exhausted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brought up for the third attack , the Americans fell back , fighting desperately with gunstocks and stones . The results of this battle were two fold . It proved to the Americans that the British regulars were not invincible , and it proved to the British that the American militia would fight . Footnote 1 : General William Howe had come to Boston with more British troops not long before . In October , 1775 , he was given chief command . Illustration : BOSTON , CHARLESTOWN , ETC. %134 . Washington takes Command. %  --  Two weeks after this battle Washington reached the army , and on July 3 , 1775 , took command beneath an elm still standing in Cambridge . Never was an army in so sorry a plight . There was no discipline , and not much more than a third as many men as there had been a few weeks before . But the indomitable will and sublime patience of Washington triumphed over all difficulties , and for eight months he kept the British shut up in Boston , while he trained and disciplined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Montreal taken. %  --  Meanwhile Congress , fearing that Sir Guy Carleton , who was governor of Canada , would invade New York by way of Lake Champlain , sent two expeditions against him . One , under Richard Montgomery , went down Lake Champlain , and captured Montreal . Another , under Benedict Arnold , forced its way through the dense woods of Maine , and after dreadful sufferings reached Quebec . There Montgomery joined Arnold , and on the night of December 31 , 1775 , the two armies assaulted Quebec , the most strongly fortified city in America , and actually entered it . But Montgomery was killed , Arnold was wounded , the attack failed , and , six months later , the Americans were driven from Canada . Illustration : Bunker Hill Monument %136 . The British driven from Boston , March 17 , 1776. %  --  After eight months of seeming idleness , Washington , early in March , 1776 , seized Dorchester Heights on the south side of Boston , fortified them , and so gave Howe his choice of fighting or retreating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering the dreadful day at Bunker Hill , were afraid to attack intrenched Americans . Howe thereupon evacuated Boston and sailed with his army for Halifax , March 17 , 1776 . Washington felt sure that the British would next attack New York , so he moved his army there in April , 1776 , and placed it on the Brooklyn hills . %137 . Independence resolved on. %  --  Just one year had now passed since the memorable fights at Concord and Lexington . During this year the colonies had been solemnly protesting that they had no thought of independence and desired nothing so much as reconciliation with the King . But the King meantime had done things which prevented any reconciliation : 1 . He had issued a proclamation declaring the Americans to be rebels . 2 . He had closed their ports and warned foreign nations not to trade with them . 3 . He had hired 17,000 Hessians1 with whom to subdue them . Footnote 1 : The Hessians were soldiers from Hesse and other small German states . These things made further obedience to the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was " necessary to suppress every kind of authority under the crown , " and asked the colonies to form governments of their own and so become states . On the 7th of June , Richard Henry Lee , acting under instructions from Virginia , offered this resolution : Resolved That these United Colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent states , that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown , and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is , and ought to be , totally dissolved . Prompt action in so serious a matter was not to be expected , and Congress put it off till July 1 . Meanwhile Thomas Jefferson , Benjamin Franklin , John Adams , Roger Sherman , and Robert R. Livingston were appointed to write a declaration of independence and have it ready in case it was wanted . As Jefferson happened to be the chairman of the committee , the duty of writing the declaration was given to him . July 2 , Congress passed Lee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and independent states .

Independence declared. %  --  Independence having thus been decreed , the next step was to announce the fact to the world . As Jefferson says in the opening of his declaration , " When , in the course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another ... a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation . " It was this " decent respect to the opinions of mankind , " therefore , which now led Congress , on July 4 , 1776 , to adopt the Declaration of Independence , and to send copies to the states . Pennsylvania got her copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to a vast crowd of citizens in the Statehouse yard. 1 When the reading was finished , the people went off to pull down the royal arms in the court room , while the great bell in the tower , the bell which had been cast twenty-four years before with the prophetic words upon its side , " Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof , " rang out a joyful peal , for then were announced to the world the new political truths , " that all men are created equal , " and " that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , " and " that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .

Howe followed , drove him foot by foot up the Hudson from New York to White Plains ; carried Fort Washington , on the New York shore , by storm ( November 16 , 1776 ) ; and sent a force across the Hudson under cover of darkness and storm to capture Fort Lee . But the British were detected in the very nick of time , and the Americans , leaving their fires burning and their tents standing , fled towards Newark , N. J. %140 . The Retreat across the Jerseys. %  --  Washington , meanwhile , had gone from White Plains to Hackensack in New Jersey , leaving 7000 men under Charles Lee in New York state at North Castle . These men he now ordered Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutinous Lee refused to obey . This forced Washington to begin his famous retreat across the Jerseys , going first to Newark , then to New Brunswick , then to Trenton , and then over the Delaware into Pennsylvania , with the British under Cornwallis in hot pursuit . Illustration %141 . The Surprise at Trenton. %  --  Lee crossed the Hudson and went to Morristown , where a just punishment for his disobedience speedily overtook him . One night while he was at an inn outside of his lines , some British dragoons made him a prisoner of war . The capture of Lee left Sullivan in command , and by him the troops were hurried off to join Washington . Thus reenforced , Washington turned on the enemy , and on Christmas night in a blinding snowstorm he recrossed the Delaware , marched nine miles to Trenton , surprised a force of Hessians , took 1000 prisoners , and went back to Pennsylvania . The effect of this victory was tremendous . At first the people could not believe it , and , to convince them , the Hessians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of their flags was sent to Baltimore ( whither Congress had fled from Philadelphia ) , and hung up in the hall of Congress . When the people were convinced of the truth of the report , their joy was unbounded ; militia was hurried forward , the Jerseymen gathered at Morristown , money was raised ; the New England troops , whose time of service was out , were persuaded to stay six weeks longer , and , December 30 , 1776 , Washington again entered Trenton . Meantime Cornwallis , who had heard of the capture of the Hessians , came thundering down from New Brunswick with 8000 men and hemmed in the Americans between his army and the Delaware . But on the night of January 2 , 1777 , Washington slipped away , passed around Cornwallis , hurried to Princeton , and there , on the morning of January 3 , put to rout three regiments of British regulars . Cornwallis , who was not aware that the Americans had left his front till he heard the firing in his rear , fell back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he spent the rest of the winter . %142 . The Capture of Philadelphia. %  --  Late in May , 1777 , Washington entered New York state . But Howe paid little attention to this movement , for he had fully determined to attack and capture Philadelphia , and on July 23 set sail from New York . As the fleet moved southward , its progress was marked by signal fires along the Jersey coast , and the news of its position was carried inland by messengers . At the end of a week the fleet was off the entrance of Delaware Bay . But Lord Howe fearing to sail up the river , the fleet went to sea and was lost to sight . Washington , who had hurried southward to Philadelphia , was now at a loss what to do , and was just about to go back to New York when he heard that the British were coming up Chesapeake Bay , and at once marched to Wilmington , Del .

But public opinion demanded that another battle should be fought before the city was given up , and after a few days he recrossed the Schuylkill , and again faced the enemy . A violent storm ruined the ammunition of both armies and prevented a battle , and the Americans retreated across the Schuylkill at a point farther up the stream . Footnote : 1 Among the wounded in this battle was a brilliant young Frenchman , the Marquis de Lafayette , who , early in 1777 , came to America and offered his services to Congress as a volunteer without pay . Congress , which had returned to Philadelphia from Baltimore , now fled to Lancaster and later to York , Pa. , and ( September 26 , 1777 ) Howe entered Philadelphia in triumph . October 4 , Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into winter quarters at Valley Forge . Illustration %143 . New York invaded. %  --  Though Washington had been defeated in the battles around Philadelphia , and had been forced to give that city to the British , his campaign made it possible for the Americans to win another glorious victory in the north . At the beginning of 1777 the British had planned to conquer New York and so cut the Eastern States off from the Middle States . To accomplish this , a great army under John Burgoyne was to come up to Albany by way of Lake Champlain . Another , under Colonel St. Leger , was to go up the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario to Oswego and come down to Mohawk valley to Albany ; while the third army , under Howe , was to go up the Hudson from New York and meet Burgoyne at Albany . True to this plan , Burgoyne came up Lake Champlain , took Ticonderoga ( July 5 ) , and , driving General Schuyler before him , reached Fort Edward late in July . There he heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little village in the southwestern corner of Vermont , whither he sent 1000 men . But Colonel John Stark met and utterly destroyed them on August 16 . Meanwhile St. Leger , as planned , had landed at Oswego , and on August 3 laid siege to Fort Stanwix , which then stood on the site of the present city of Rome , N.Y . On the 6th the garrison sallied forth , attacked a part of St. Leger 's camp , and carried off five British flags . These they hoisted upside down on their ramparts , and high above them raised a new flag which Congress had adopted in June , and which was then for the first time flung to the breeze . Illustration : Flag of the East India Company %144 . Our National Flag. %  --  It was our national flag , the stars and stripes , and was made of a piece of a blue jacket , some strips of a white shirt , and some scraps of old red flannel. 1 Footnote 1 : The flags used by the continental troops between 1775 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A colored plate showing most of them is given in Treble 's Our Flag , p. 142 . In 1776 , in January , Washington used one at Cambridge which seems to have been suggested by the ensign of the East India Company . That of this company was a combination of thirteen horizontal red and white stripes ( seven red and six white ) and the red cross of St. George . That of Washington was the same , with the British Union Jack substituted for the cross of St. George . After the Declaration of Independence , the British Jack was out of place on our flag ; and in June , 1777 , Congress adopted a union of thirteen white stars in a circle , on a blue ground , in place of the British Union . After Vermont and Kentucky were admitted , in 1791 and 1792 , the stars and stripes were each increased to fifteen . In 1818 , the original number of stripes was restored , and since that time each new state , when admitted , is represented by a star and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonies Illustration : British Union Jack %145 . Capture of Burgoyne. %  --  When Schuyler heard of the siege of Fort Stanwix , he sent Benedict Arnold to relieve it , and St. Leger fled to Oswego . Then was the time for the expedition from New York to have hurried to Burgoyne 's aid . But Howe and his army were then at sea . No help was given to Burgoyne , who , after suffering defeats at Bemis Heights ( September 19 ) and at Stillwater ( October 7 ) , retreated to Saratoga , where ( October 17 , 1777 ) he surrendered his army of 6000 men to General Horatio Gates , whom Congress , to its shame , had just put in the place of Schuyler . Gates deserves no credit for the capture . Arnold and Daniel Morgan deserve it , and deserve much ; for , judged by its results , Saratoga was one of the great battles of the world . The results of the surrender were four fold : 1 . It saved New York state . 2 . It destroyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King to offer us peace with representation in Parliament , or anything else we wanted except independence . 4 . It secured for us the aid of France . Illustration : %Flag of the United States , 1777% %146 . Valley Forge. %  --  The winter at Valley Forge marks the darkest period of the war . It was a season of discouragement , when mean spirits grew bold . Some officers of the army formed a plot , called from one of them the " Conway cabal , " to displace Washington and put Gates in command . The country people , tempted by British gold , sent their provisions into Philadelphia and not to Valley Forge . There the suffering of the half-clad , half-fed , ill-housed patriots surpasses description . But the darkest hour is just before the dawn . Then it was that an able Prussian soldier , Baron Steuben , joined the army , turned the camp into a school , drilled the soldiers , and made the army better than ever . Then it was that France acknowledged our independence , and joined us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  In October , 1776 , Congress sent Benjamin Franklin to Paris to try to persuade the French King to help us in the war . Till Burgoyne surrendered and Great Britain offered peace , Franklin found all his efforts vain. 1 But now , when it seemed likely that the states might again be brought under the British crown , the French King promptly acknowledged us to be an independent nation , made a treaty of alliance and a treaty of commerce ( February 6 , 1778 ) , and soon had a fleet on its way to help us . Footnote 1 : For an account of Franklin in France , see McMaster 's With the Fathers , pp. 253-270. %148 . The British leave Philadelphia. %  --  Hearing of the approach of the French fleet , Sir Henry Clinton , who in May had succeeded Howe in command , left Philadelphia and hurried to the defense of New York . Washington followed , and , coming up with the rear guard of the enemy at Monmouth in New Jersey , fought a battle ( June 28 , 1778 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the traitor , Charles Lee , been in command. 2 Without any reason he suddenly ordered a retreat , which was fortunately prevented from becoming a rout by Washington , who came on the field in time to stop it . Footnote 2 : After remaining a prisoner in the hands of the British from December , 1776 , to April , 1778 , Lee had been exchanged for a British officer . After the battle the British hurried on to New York , where Washington partially surrounded them by stretching out his army from Morristown in New Jersey to West Point on the Hudson . %149 . Stony Point. %  --  In hope of drawing Washington away from New York , Clinton in 1779 sent a marauding party to plunder and ravage the farms and towns of Connecticut . But Washington soon brought it back by dispatching Anthony Wayne to capture Stony Point , which he did ( July , 1779 ) by one of the most brilliant assaults in military history . %150 .

Those who remained loyal to the King were called Tories . Footnote 2 : By this time the Five Nations had admitted the Tuscaroras to their confederacy and had thus become the Six Nations. %151 . George Rogers Clark%.  --  Meantime the British commander at Detroit tried hard to stir up the Indians of the West to attack the whole frontier at the same moment . Hearing of this , George Rogers Clark of Virginia marched into the enemy 's country , and in two fine campaigns in 1778-1779 beat the British , and conquered the country from the Ohio to the Great Lakes and from Pennsylvania to the Mississippi . %152 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punish the Indians for the Wyoming and Cherry Valley massacres that General Sullivan with an army invaded the territory of the Six Nations , in central New York , burned some forty Indian villages , and utterly destroyed the Indian power in that state . %153 . The South invaded%.  --  For a year and more there had been a lull in military operations on the part of the British . But they now began an attack in a new quarter . Having failed to conquer New England in 1775-1776 , having failed to conquer the Middle States in 1776-1777 , they sent an expedition against the South in December , 1778 . Success attended it . Savannah was captured , Georgia was conquered , and the royal governor reinstated . Later , in 1779 , General Lincoln , with a French fleet to help him , attempted to recapture Savannah , but was driven off with dreadful loss of life . These successes in Georgia so greatly encouraged the British that in the spring of 1780 Clinton led an expedition against South Carolina , and ( May 12 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By dint of great exertions another army was quickly raised in North Carolina , and the command given to Gates by Congress . He was utterly unfit for it , and ( August 16 , 1780 ) was defeated and his army almost destroyed at Camden by Lord Cornwallis . Never in the whole course of the war had the American army suffered such a crushing defeat . All military resistance in South Carolina was at an end , save such as was offered by gallant bands of patriots led by Marion , Sumter , and Pickens. %154 . The Treason of Arnold. %  --  The outlook was now dark enough ; but it was made darker still by the treachery of Benedict Arnold . No officer in the Revolutionary army was more trusted . His splendid march through the wilderness to Quebec , his bravery in the attack on that city , the skill and courage he displayed at Saratoga , had marked him out as a man full of promise . But he lacked that moral courage without which great abilities count for nothing . In 1778 he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused his office that he was sentenced to be reprimanded by Washington . This aroused a thirst for revenge , and led him to form a scheme to give up the Hudson River to the enemy . With this end in view , he asked Washington in July , 1780 , for the command of West Point , the great stronghold on the Hudson , obtained it , and at once made arrangements to surrender it to Clinton . The British agent in the negotiation was Major John Andre , who one day in September met Arnold near Stony Point . But most happily , as he was going back to New York , three Americans1 stopped him near Tarrytown , searched him , and in his stockings found some papers in the handwriting of Arnold . News of the arrest of Andre reached Arnold in time to enable him to escape to the British ; he served with them till the end of the war , and then sought a refuge in England . Andre was tried as a spy , found guilty , and hanged . Footnote 1 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Van Wart. %155 . Victory at Kings Mountain. %  --  After the defeat of Gates at Camden , the British overran South Carolina , and in the course of their marauding a band of 1100 Tories marched to Kings Mountain , on the border line between the two Carolinas . There the hardy mountaineers attacked them ( Oct. 7 , 1780 ) and killed , wounded , or captured the entire band . Map : %CAMPAIGNS IN THE SOUTH 1778-1781% %156 . Victory at the Cowpens%.  --  Meantime a third army was raised for use in the South and placed under the command of Nathanael Greene , than whom there was no abler general in the American army . With Greene was Daniel Morgan , who had distinguished himself at Saratoga , and by him a British force under Tarleton was attacked January 17 , 1781 , at a place called the Cowpens , and not only defeated , but almost destroyed . Enraged at these reverses , Cornwallis took the field and hurried to attack Greene , who , too weak to fight him , began a masterly retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned about and fought . He was defeated , but Cornwallis was unable to go further , and retreated to Wilmington , N.C. , with Greene in hot pursuit . Leaving the enemy at Wilmington , Greene went back to South Carolina , and by September , 1781 , had driven the British into Charleston and Savannah . Cornwallis , as soon as Greene left him , hurried to Petersburg , Va . A British force during the winter and spring had been plundering and ravaging in Virginia , under the traitor Arnold . Cornwallis took command of this , sent Arnold to New York , and had begun a campaign against Lafayette , when orders reached him to seize and fortify some Virginian seaport . %157 . Surrender of Cornwallis. %  --  Thus instructed , Cornwallis selected Yorktown , and began to fortify it strongly . This was early in August , 1781 .

Clinton then sent Arnold on a raid into Connecticut to burn New London , in the hope of forcing Washington to return . But Washington kept straight on , hemmed Cornwallis in by land and sea , and October 19 , 1781 , forced the British general to surrender . %158 . The War on the Sea. %  --  The first step towards the foundation of an American navy was taken on October 13 , 1775 . Congress , hearing that two British ships laden with powder and guns were on their way from England to Quebec , ordered two swift sailing vessels to be fitted out for the purpose of capturing them . Two months later Congress ordered thirteen cruisers to be built , and named the officers to command them . Meantime some merchant ships were purchased and collected at Philadelphia , from which city , one morning in January , 1776 , a fleet of eight vessels set sail . As they were about to weigh anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flung to the breeze a yellow silk flag on which were a pine tree and a coiled rattlesnake , with this motto : " Do n't tread on me . " This was the first flag ever hoisted on an American man-of-war . Ice in the Delaware kept the fleet in the river till the middle of February , when it went to sea , sailed southward to New Providence in the Bahamas , captured the town , brought off the governor , some powder and cannon , and after taking several prizes got safely back to New London . Soon after the squadron had left the Delaware , the Lexington , Captain John Barry in command , while cruising off the Virginia coast , fell in with the Edward , a British vessel , and after a spirited action captured her . This was the first prize brought in by a commissioned officer of the American navy. 1 Footnote 1 : John Barry was a native of Ireland ; he came to America at thirteen , entered the merchant marine , and at twenty-five was captain of a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services to Congress , and in February , 1776 , was put in command of the Lexington . After his victory he was transferred to the twenty-eight-gun frigate Effingham , and in 1777 ( while blockaded in the Delaware ) with twenty-seven men in four boats captured and destroyed a ten-gun schooner and four transports . When the British captured Philadelphia , Barry took the Effingham up the river ; but she was burned by the enemy . In 1778 , in command of the thirty-two-gun frigate Raleigh , he sailed from Boston , fell in with two British frigates , and after a fight was forced to run ashore in Penobscot Bay . Barry and his crew escaped , and in 1781 carried Laurens to France in the frigate Alliance . On the way out he took a privateer , and while cruising on the way home captured the Atalanta and the Trepassey after a hard fight . As Barry brought in the first capture by a commissioned officer of the United States navy , so he fought the last action of the war in 1782 ; but the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry was made senior captain , with the title of Commodore . In 1798 he commanded the frigate United States in the war with France . He died in 1803 . In March , 1776 , Congress began to issue letters of marque , or licenses to citizens to engage in war against the enemy ; and then the sea fairly swarmed with privateers . In 1777 the American flag was seen for the first time in European waters , when a little squadron of three ships set sail from Nantes in France , and after cruising on the Bay of Biscay went twice around Ireland and came back to France with fifteen prizes . As France had not then acknowledged our independence , they were ordered to depart . Two did so ; but one of them , the Lexington , was captured by the British , and the other , the Reprisal , was wrecked at sea . %159 . Paul Jones. %  --  Meanwhile our commissioners in France , Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane , fitted out a cruiser called the Surprise . She sailed from Dunkirk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with a British packet as a prize . For this violation of French neutrality she was seized . But another ship , the Revenge , was quickly secured , which scoured the British waters , and actually entered two British ports before she sailed for America . The exploits of these and a score of other ships are cast into the shade , however , by the fights of John Paul Jones , the great naval hero of the Revolution . He sailed from Portsmouth , N.H. , November 1 , 1777 , refitted his ship in the harbor of Brest , and in 1778 began one of the most memorable cruises in our naval history . In the short space of twenty-eight days he sailed into the Irish Channel , destroyed four vessels , set fire to the shipping in the port of Whitehaven , fought and captured the British armed schooner Drake , sailed around Ireland with his prize , and reached France in safety . For a year he was forced to be idle . But at last , in 1779 , he was given command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from France . Passing along the west coast of Ireland , the fleet went around the north end of Scotland and down the east coast , capturing and destroying vessel after vessel on the way . On the night of September 23 , 1779 , Jones ( in his ship , named Bonhomme Richard in honor of Franklin 's famous Poor Richard 's Almanac ) fell in with the Serapis , a British frigate . The two ships grappled , and , lashed side by side in the moonlight , fought one of the most desperate battles in naval annals . At the end of three hours the Serapis surrendered , but the Bonhomme Richard was a wreck , and next morning , giving a sudden roll , she filled and plunged bow first to the bottom of the North Sea . Jones sailed away in the Serapis . Illustration : Benjamin Franklin In the Revolution the British lost 102 vessels of war , while the Americans lost 24  --  most of their navy . %160 .

The Treaty of Peace. %  --  The story is told that when Lord North , the Prime Minister of England , heard of the surrender of Yorktown , he threw up his hands and said , " It is all over . " He was right ; it was all over , and on September 3 , 1783 , a treaty of peace ( negotiated by Benjamin Franklin , John Adams , and John Jay ) was signed at Paris .

Bounds of the United States. %  --  By the treaty of 1783 the boundary of the United States was declared to be about what is the present northern boundary from the mouth of the St. Croix River in Maine to the Lake of the Woods , and then due west to the Mississippi ( which was , of course , an impossible line , for that river does not rise in Canada ) ; then down the Mississippi to 31 deg. north latitude ; then eastward along that parallel of latitude to the Apalachicola River , and then by what is the present north boundary of Florida to the Atlantic . But these bounds were not secured without a diplomatic struggle . As soon as France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow her example . Very little persuasion was needed , for the opportunity to regain the two Floridas ( which Spain had been forced to give to England in 1763 ) was too good to be lost . In June , 1779 , therefore , Spain declared war on England , and sent the governor of Lower Louisiana into West Florida , where he captured Pensacola , Mobile , Baton Rouge , and Natchez . Made bold by this success , Spain , which cared nothing for the United States , next determined to conquer the region north of Florida and east of the Mississippi , the Indian country of the proclamation of 1763 . ( See map of The British Colonies in 1764 . ) The commandant at St. Louis2 was , therefore , sent to seize the post at St. Joseph on Lake Michigan , built by La Salle in 1679 . He succeeded , and taking possession of the country in the name of Spain , carried off the English flags as evidence of conquest . Now when the time came to make the treaty of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida and the country west of the Alleghany Mountains , because she had conquered it .

The area of the territory thus acquired by the United States was 827,844 square miles , and the population not far from 3,250,000 . Apparently an era of great prosperity and happiness was before the people . But unhappily the government they had established in time of war was quite unfit to unite them and bring them prosperity in time of peace . Illustration : Washington 's sword SUMMARY 1 .

Similar advice was given the same year to New Hampshire and South Carolina , for it was not then supposed that the quarrel with the mother country would end in separation . But by the spring of 1776 all the governors of the thirteen colonies had either fled or been thrown into prison . This put an end to colonial government , and Congress , seeing that reconciliation was impossible , ( May 15 , 1776 ) advised all the colonies to form governments for themselves ( p. 132 ) . Thereupon they adopted constitutions , and by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states. 1 Footnote 1 : All but two made new constitutions ; but Connecticut and Rhode Island used their old charters , the one till 1818 , the other till 1842 . Vermont also formed a constitution , but she was not admitted to the Congress ( p. 243 ) .

Articles of Confederation. %  --  While the colonies were thus gradually turning themselves into the states , the Continental Congress was trying to bind them into a union by means of a sort of general constitution called " Articles of Confederation . " By order of Congress , Articles had been prepared and presented by a committee in July , 1776 , but it was not till November 17 , 1777 , that they were sent out to the states for adoption . Now it must be remembered that six states , Massachusetts , Connecticut , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia , claimed that their " from sea to sea " charters gave them lands between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , had bought the Indian title to land in the Ohio valley . It must also be remembered that the other six states did not have " from sea to sea " charters , and so had no claims to western lands . As three of them , New Jersey , Delaware , and Maryland , held that the claims of their sister states were invalid , they now refused to adopt the Articles unless the land so claimed was given to Congress to be used to pay for the cost of the Revolution . For this action they gave four reasons : 1 . The Mississippi valley had been discovered , explored , settled , and owned by France . 2 . England had never owned any land there till France ceded the country in 1763. 3 . When at last England had got it , in 1763 , the King drew the " proclamation line , " turned the Mississippi valley into the Indian country , and so cut off any claim of the colonies in consequence of English ownership . 4 . The western lands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states were in arms against him , his lands ought to be seized by Congress and used for the benefit of all the states . For three years the land-claiming states refused to be convinced by these arguments . But at length , finding that Maryland was determined not to adopt the Articles till her demands were complied with , they began to yield . In February , 1780 , New York ceded her claims to Congress , and in January , 1781 , Virginia gave up her claim to the country north of the Ohio River . Maryland had now carried her point , and on March 1 , 1781 , her delegates signed the Articles of Confederation . As all the other states had ratified the Articles , this act on the part of Maryland made them law , and March 2 , 1781 , Congress met for the first time under a form of government the states were pledged to obey . %165 . Government under the Articles of Confederation. %  --  The form of government that went into effect on that day was bad from beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the laws , no court or judge to settle disputed points of law , and only a very feeble legislature . Congress consisted of one house , presided over by a president elected each year by the members from among their own number . The delegates to Congress could not be more than seven , nor less than two from each state , were elected yearly , could not serve for more than three years out of six , and might be recalled at any time by the states that sent them . Once assembled on the floor of Congress , the delegates became members of a secret body . The doors were shut ; no spectators were allowed to hear what was said ; no reports of the debates were taken down ; but under a strict injunction to secrecy the members went on deliberating day after day . All voting was done by states , each casting but one vote , no matter how many delegates it had . The affirmative votes of nine states were necessary to pass any important act , or , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Articles gave but few powers . Congress could declare war , make peace , issue money , keep up an army and a navy , contract debts , enter into treaties of commerce , and settle disputes between states . But it could not enforce a treaty or a law when made , nor lay any tax for any purpose . %166 . Origin of the Public Domain%.  --  In 1784 Massachusetts ceded her strip of land in the west , following the example set by New York ( 1780 ) , and Virginia ( 1781 ) . As three states claiming western territory had thus by 1784 given their land to Congress , that body came into possession of the greater part of the vast domain stretching from the Lakes to the Ohio and from the Mississippi to Pennsylvania. 1 Now this public domain , as it was called , was given on certain conditions : 1 . That it should be cut up into states . 2 . That these states should be admitted into the Union ( when they had a certain population ) on the same footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land should be sold and the money used to pay the debts of the United States . Footnote 1 : The strip owned by Connecticut had been offered to Congress in October , 1789 , but not accepted . It still belonged to Connecticut in 1785 . In 1786 it was again ceded , with certain reservations , and accepted . Congress , therefore , as soon as it had received the deeds to the tracts ceded , trusting that the other land-owning states would cede their western territory in time , passed a law ( in 1785 ) to prepare the land for sale by surveying it and marking it out into sections , townships , and ranges , and fixed the price per acre . %167 . Virginia and Connecticut Reserves. %  --  When Virginia made her cession in 1781 , she expressly reserved two tracts of land north of the Ohio . One , called the Military Lands , lay between the Scioto and Miami rivers , and was held to pay bounties promised to the Virginia Revolutionary soldiers . The other ( in the present state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soldiers . A third piece was reserved by Connecticut when she ceded her strip in 1786 . This , called the Western Reserve of Connecticut , stretched along the shore of Lake Erie ( map , p. 175 ) . In 1800 Connecticut gave up her jurisdiction , or right of government , over this reserve in return for the confirmation of land titles she had granted . Illustration : TERRITORY OF THE %UNITED STATES% NORTHWEST OF THE OHIO RIVER %1787% %168 . Ordinance of 1787 ; Origin of the Territories. %  --  Hardly had Congress provided for the sale of the land , when a number of Revolutionary soldiers formed the Ohio Land Company , and sent an agent to New York , where Congress was in session , and offered to buy 5,000,000 acres on the Ohio River : 1,500,000 acres were for themselves , and 3,500,000 for another company called the Scioto Company . The land was gladly sold , and as the purchasers were really going to send out settlers , it became necessary to establish some kind of government for them . On the 13th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very famous law , called the Ordinance of 1787 , which ordered : 1 . That the whole region from the Lakes to the Ohio , and from Pennsylvania to the Mississippi , should be called " The Territory of the United States northwest of the river Ohio . " 2 . That it should be cut up into not less than three nor more than five states , each of which might be admitted into the Union when it had 60,000 free inhabitants . 3 . That within it there was to be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except in punishment for crime . 4 . That until such time as there were 5000 free male inhabitants twenty-one years old in the territory , it was to be governed by a governor and three judges . They could not make laws , but might adopt such as they pleased from among the laws in force in the states . After there were 5000 free male inhabitants in the territory the people were to elect a house of representatives , which in its turn was to elect ten men from whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house and the council were then to elect a territorial delegate to sit in Congress with the right of debating , not of voting . The governor , the judges , and the secretary were to be elected by Congress . The council and house of representatives could make laws , but must send them to Congress for approval . Thus were created two more American institutions , the territory and the state formed out of the public domain . The ordinance was but a few months old when South Carolina ceded ( 1787 ) her little strip of country west of the mountains ( see map on p. 157 ) with the express condition that it should be slave soil . In 1789 North Carolina ceded what is now Tennessee on the same condition . Congress accepted both and out of them made the " Territory southwest of the Ohio River . " In that slavery was allowed. 1 Footnote 1 : The only remaining land-holding state , Georgia , ceded her claim in 1802 ( p. 246 ) . %169 . Defects of the Articles of Confederation. % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1787 , a convention of delegates from the states was framing the Constitution at Philadelphia . A very little experience under the Articles of Confederation showed them to have serious defects . No Taxing Power .  --  In the first place , Congress could not lay a tax of any kind , and as it could not tax it could not get money with which to pay its expenses and the debt incurred during the Revolution . Each of the states was in duty bound to pay its share . But this duty was so disregarded that although Congress between 1782 and 1786 called on the states for $6,000,000 , only $1,000.000 was paid . No Power to regulate Trade .  --  In the second place , Congress had no power to regulate trade with foreign nations , or between the states . This proved a most serious evil . The people of the United States at that time had few manufactures , because in colonial days Parliament would not allow them . All the china , glass , hardware , cutlery , woolen goods , linen , muslin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the war the Americans had paid for these goods with dried fish , lumber , whale oil , flour , tobacco , rice , and indigo , and with money made by trading in the West Indies . Now Great Britain forbade Americans to trade with her West Indies . Spain would not make a trade treaty with us , so we had no trade with her islands , and what was worse , Great Britain taxed everything that came to her from the United States unless it came in British ships . As a consequence , very little lumber , fish , rice , and other of our products went abroad to pay for the immense quantity of foreign-made goods that came to us . These goods therefore had to be paid for in money , which about 1785 began to be boxed up and shipped to London . When the people found that specie was being carried out of the country , they began to hoard it , so that by 1786 none was in circulation . %170 . Paper Money issued. %  --  This left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or buy food and clothing , and led at once to a demand that the states should print paper money and loan it to their citizens . Rhode Island , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , North and South Carolina , and Georgia did so . But the money was no sooner issued than the merchants and others who had goods to sell refused to take it , whereupon in some of the states laws called " tender acts " were passed to compel people to use the paper . This merely put an end to business , for nobody would sell . In Massachusetts , when the legislature refused to issue paper money , many of the persons who owed debts assembled , and , during 1786-87 , under the lead of Daniel Shays , a Revolutionary soldier , prevented the courts from trying suits for the recovery of money owed or loaned. 1 Footnote 1 : Read McMaster 's History of the People of the United States , Vol . I. , pp. 281-295 , 304-329 , 331-340 ; Fiske 's Critical Period of American History , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many defects in the Articles , the Continental Congress was fully aware , and it had many a time asked the states to make amendments . One proposed that Congress should have power for twenty-five years to lay a tax of five per cent on all goods imported , and use the money to pay the Continental debts . Another was to require each state to raise by special tax a sum sufficient to pay its yearly share of the current expenses of Congress . A third was to bestow on Congress for fifteen years the sole power to regulate trade and commerce . A fourth provided that in future the share each state was to bear of the current expenses should be in proportion to its population . But the Articles of Confederation could not be amended unless all thirteen states consented , and , as all thirteen never did consent , none of these amendments were ever made . %172 . The States attempt to regulate Trade and fail. %  --  In the meantime the states attempted to regulate trade for themselves . New York laid double duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign goods . Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and Rhode Island passed acts imposing heavy duties on articles unless they came in American vessels . But these laws were not uniform , and as many states took no action , very little good was accomplished. 1 Footnote 1 : McMaster 's History of the People of the United States , Vol . I. , pp. 246-259 , 266-280 ; Fiske 's Critical Period of American History , 134-137 , 145-147. %173 . A Trade Convention called to meet at Annapolis , 1786. %2  --  Under these conditions , the business of the whole country was at a standstill , and as Congress had no power to do anything to relieve the distress , the state of Virginia sent out a circular letter to her sister states . She asked them to appoint delegates to meet and " take into consideration the trade and commerce of the United States . " Four ( New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Delaware ) responded , and their delegates , with those from Virginia , met at Annapolis in September , 1786 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is printed in Bulletin of Bureau of Rolls and Library of the Department of State , No. 1 , Appendix , pp. 1-5 . CHAPTER XIII MAKING THE CONSTITUTION %174 . Call for the Constitutional Convention. %  --  Finding that it could do nothing , because so few states were represented , and because the powers of the delegates were so limited , the convention recommended that all the states in the Union be asked by Congress to send delegates to a new convention , to meet at Philadelphia in May , 1787 , " to take into consideration the situation of the United States , " and " to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal government adequate to the exigencies of the Union . " %175 . The Philadelphia Convention. %1  --  Early in 1787 Congress approved this movement , and during the summer of 1787 ( May to September ) delegates from twelve states ( Rhode Island sent none ) , sitting in secret session at Philadelphia , made the Constitution of the United States . Footnote 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is derived from the journals of the convention , the notes taken down by James Madison , the notes of Yates of New York , and a speech by Luther Martin of Maryland . They may be found in Elliot 's Debates , Vol . IV . Illustration : Independence Chamber2 Footnote 2 : The room where the Constitution was framed. %176 . The Virginia and New Jersey Plans%.  --  The story of that convention is too long and too complicated to be told in full. 1 But some of its proceedings must be noticed . While the delegates were assembling , a few men , under the lead of Madison , met and drew up the outline of a constitution , which was presented by the chairman of the Virginia delegation , and was called the " Virginia plan . " A little later , delegates from the small states met and drew up a second plan , which was the old Articles of Confederation with amendments . As the chairman of the New Jersey delegation offered this , it was called the " New Jersey plan . " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia plan as the basis of the Constitution . Footnote 1 : For short accounts , read " The Framers and the Framing of the Constitution " in the Century Magazine , September , 1887 , or " Framing the Constitution , " in McMaster 's With the Fathers , pp. 106-149 , or Thorpe 's Story of the Constitution , Chautauqua Course , 1891-92 , pp. 111-148. %177 . The Three Compromises. %  --  This plan called , among other things , for a national legislature of two branches : a Senate and a House of Representatives . The populous states insisted that the number of representatives sent by each state to Congress should be in proportion to her population . The small states insisted that each should send the same number of representatives . For a time neither party would yield ; but at length the Connecticut delegates suggested that the states be given an equal vote and an equal representation in the Senate , and an unequal representation , based on population , in the House . The contending parties agreed , and so made the first compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once raised the question , Shall slaves be counted as population ? This divided the convention into slave states and free ( see p. 186 ) , and led to a second compromise , by which it was agreed that three fifths of all slaves should be counted as population , for the purpose of apportioning representation . A third compromise sprang from the conflicting interests of the commercial and the planting states . The planting states wanted a provision forbidding Congress to pass navigation acts , except by a two-thirds vote , and forbidding any tax on exports ; three states also wished to import slaves for use on their plantations . The free commercial states wanted Congress to pass navigation laws , and also wanted the slave trade stopped , because of the three-fifths rule . The result was an agreement that the importation of slaves should not be forbidden by Congress before 1808 , and that Congress might pass navigation acts , and that exports should never be taxed . %178 . The Election of President. %  --  Another feature of the Virginia plan was the provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the acts of Congress were duly enforced or executed . But when the question arose , How shall he be chosen ? all manner of suggestions were made . Some said by the governors of the states ; some , by the United States Senate ; some , by the state legislatures ; some , by a body of electors chosen for that purpose . When at last it was decided to have a body of electors , the difficulty was to determine the manner of electing the electors . On this no agreement could be reached ; so the convention ordered that the legislature of each state should have as many electors of the President as it had senators and representatives in Congress , and that these men should be appointed in such way as the legislatures of the states saw fit to prescribe . %179 . Sources of the Constitution. %  --  An examination of the Constitution shows that some of its features were new ; that some were drawn from the experience of the states under the Confederation ; and that others were borrowed from the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such names as President , Senate , House of Representatives , and such provisions as that for a census , for the veto , for the retirement of one third of the Senate every two years , that money bills shall originate in the House , for impeachment , and for what we call the annual message. 1 Footnote 1 : On the sources of the Constitution , read " The First Century of the Constitution " in New Princeton Review , September , 1887 , pp. 175-190 . The features based directly on experience under the Articles of Confederation are the provisions that the acts of Congress must be uniform throughout the Union ; that the President may call out the militia to repel invasion , to put down insurrection , and to maintain the laws of the Union ; that Congress shall have sole power to regulate foreign trade and trade between the states . No state can now coin money or print paper money , or make anything but gold or silver legal tender . Congress now has power to lay taxes , duties , and excises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department ( Senate and House of Representatives ) ; the executive department ( the President , who sees that laws and treaties are obeyed ) ; and the judicial department ( Supreme Court and other United States courts , which interpret the Constitution , the acts of Congress , and the treaties ) . The new features are the definition of treason and the limitation of its punishment ; the guarantee to every state of a republican form of government ; the swearing of state officials to support the Federal Constitution ; and the provision for amendment . Among other noteworthy features are the creation of a United States citizenship as distinct from a state citizenship , the limitation of the powers of the states ; and the provision that the Constitution , the acts of Congress , and the treaties are " the supreme law of the land . " %180 . Constitution submitted to the People. %  --  The convention ended its work , and such members as were willing signed the Constitution on September 17 , 1787 . Washington , as president of the convention , then sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked it to transmit copies to the states for ratification . This was done , and during the next few months the legislatures of most of the states called on the people to elect delegates to conventions which should accept or reject the Constitution . %181 . Ratification by the States. %  --  In many of these conventions great objection was made because the new plan of federal government was so unlike the Articles of Confederation , and certain changes were insisted on . The only states that accepted it just as it was framed were Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Georgia , Connecticut , and Maryland . Massachusetts , South Carolina , New Hampshire , New York , and Virginia ratified with amendments . ( For dates , see p. 176. ) %182 . " The New Roof . " %  --  The Constitution provided that when nine states had ratified , it should go into effect " between the states so ratifying . " While it was under discussion the Federalists , as the friends of the Constitution were named , had called it " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states and protect them from political storms . They now represented it as completed and supported by eleven pillars or states . Two states , Rhode Island and North Carolina , had not ratified , and so were not under the New Roof , and were not members of the new Union . Eleven states having approved , nothing remained but to fix the particular day on which the electors of President should be chosen , and the time and place for the meeting of the new Congress . This the Continental Congress did in September , 1788 , by ordering that the electors should be chosen on the first Wednesday in January , 1789 , that they should meet and vote for President on the first Wednesday in February , and that the new Congress should meet at New York on the first Wednesday in March , which happened to be the fourth day of the month . Later , Congress by law fixed March 4 as the day on which the terms of the Presidents begin and end. 1 Footnote 1 : The question is often asked , When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " The ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the states so ratifying the same . " New Hampshire , the ninth state , ratified June 21 , 1788 , and on that day , therefore , the constitution was " established " between the nine. %183 . How Presidents were elected%.  --  It must not be supposed that our first presidents were elected just as presidents are now . In our time electors are everywhere chosen by popular vote . In 1788 there was no uniformity . In Pennsylvania , Maryland , and Virginia the people had a complete , and in Massachusetts and New Hampshire a partial , choice . In Connecticut , Delaware , New Jersey , South Carolina , and Georgia the electors were appointed by the legislatures . In New York the two branches of the legislature quarreled , and no electors were chosen . As the Constitution required that the electors should vote by ballot for two persons , such as had been appointed met at their state capitals on the first Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted for , and sent them signed and certified under seal to the president of the Senate . But when March 4 , 1789 , came , there was no Senate . Less than a majority of that body had arrived in New York , so no business could be done . When at length the Senate secured a majority , the House was still without one , and remained so till April . Then , in the presence of the House and Senate , the votes on the lists were counted , and it was found that every elector had given one of his votes for George Washington , who was thus elected President . No separate ballot was then required for Vice President . Each elector merely wrote on his ballot the names of two men . He who received the greatest number of votes , if , in the words of the Constitution , " such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed , " was elected President . He who received the next highest , even if less than a majority , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams of Massachusetts .

The First Inauguration. %  --  As soon as Washington received the news of his election , he left Mount Vernon and started for New York . His journey was one continuous triumphal march . The population of every town through which he passed turned out to meet him . Men , women , and children stood for hours by the roadside waiting for him to go by . At New York his reception was most imposing , and there , on April 30 , 1789 , standing on the balcony in front of Federal Hall ( p. 171 ) , he took the oath of office in the presence of Congress and a great multitude of people that filled the streets , and crowded the windows , and sat on the roofs of the neighboring houses. 1 Footnote 1 : Full accounts of the inauguration of Washington may be found in Harper 's Magazine , and also in the Century Magazine , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about decided on , Congress appointed a committee to draft a general plan of federal government . 2 . This plan , called Articles of Confederation , Maryland absolutely refused to ratify till the states claiming land west of the Alleghany Mountains ceded their claims to Congress . 3 . New York and Virginia having ceded their claims , Maryland ratified in March , 1781. 4 . These cessions were followed by others from Massachusetts and Connecticut ; and from them all , Congress formed the public domain to be sold to pay the debt . 5 . The sale of this land led to the land ordinance of 1785 and the ordinance of 1787 , for the government of the domain and the new political organism called the territory . 6 . The defects of the Articles made revision necessary , and produced such distress that two conventions were called to consider the state of the country . That at Annapolis attempted nothing .

Had a line been drawn along what was then the frontier , it would ( as the map on p. 177 shows ) have run along the shore of Maine , across New Hampshire and Vermont to Lake Champlain , then south to the Mohawk valley , then down the Hudson River , and southwestward across Pennsylvania to Pittsburg , then south along the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Altamaha River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many people lived here was never known till 1790 .

It then appeared that , excluding Indians , there were living in the eleven United States 3,380,000 human beings , or less than half the number of people who now live in the single state of New York . %187 . How the People were scattered. %  --  More were in the Southern than in the Eastern States . Virginia , then the most populous , contained one fifth . Pennsylvania had a ninth , while in the five states of Maryland , Virginia , the two Carolinas , and Georgia were almost one half of the English-speaking people of the United States .

Newspapers and Magazines. %  --  A boy enters the car with half a dozen daily newspapers all printed in the same city . In Washington 's day there were but four daily papers in the United States ! On the news counter of a hotel , one sees twenty illustrated papers , and fifty monthly magazines . In his day there was no illustrated paper , no scientific periodical , no trade journal , and no such illustrated magazines as Harper 's , Scribner 's , the Century , St. Nicholas . All the printing done in the country was done on presses worked by hand . To-day the Hoe octuple press can print 96,000 eight-page newspapers an hour . To print this number on the hand press shown in the picture would have taken so long that when the last newspaper was printed the first would have been three months old ! Illustration : A Franklin press Illustration : A fire bucket 1 Footnote 1 : Original in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambulance , the steam fire engine , the hose cart , the hook and ladder company , the police patrol , the police officer on the street corner , the letter carrier gathering the mail , the district messenger boy , the express company , the delivery wagon of the stores , have all come in since Washington died . In his day the law required every householder in the city to be a fireman . His name might not appear on the rolls of any of the fire companies , he might not help to drag through the streets the lumbering tank which served as a fire engine , but he must have in his hall , or beneath the stairs , or hanging up behind his shop door , at least one leathern bucket inscribed with his name , and a huge bag of canvas or of duck . Then , if he were aroused at the dead of night by the cry of fire and the clanging of every church bell in the town , he seized this bucket and his bag , and , while his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , set off for the fire . The smoke or the flame was his guide , for the custom of indicating the place by a number of strokes on a bell had not yet come in . When at last he arrived at the scene he found there no idle spectators . Every one was busy . Some hurried into the building and filled their sacks with such movable goods as came nearest to hand . Some joined the line that stretched away to the water , and helped to pass the full buckets to those who stood by the fire . Others took posts in a second line , down which the empty buckets were hastened to the pump . The house would often be half consumed when the shouting made known that the engine had come . It was merely a pump mounted over a tank . Into the tank the water from the buckets was poured , and it was pumped thence by the efforts of a dozen men . Illustration : Fire engine of 18001 Footnote 1 : From an old cut %191 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white trolley car marked United States Mail , and on inquiry is told that the money now spent by the government each year for the support of the post offices would have more than paid the national debt when he was President . He hears with amazement that there are now 75,000 post offices , and recalls that in 1790 there were but seventy-five . He picks up from the sidewalk a piece of paper with a little pink something on the corner . He is told that the portrait on it is his own , that it is a postage stamp , that it costs two cents , and will carry a letter to San Francisco , a city he never heard of , and , if the person to whom it is addressed can not be found , will bring the letter back to the sender , a distance of over 5000 miles . In his day a letter was a single sheet of paper , no matter how large or small , and the postage on it was determined not by weight , but by distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time postage must always be prepaid , and as the post office must support itself , letters were not sent from the country towns till enough postage had been deposited at the post office to pay the expense of sending them . Newspapers and books could not be sent by mail . %192 . The Franchise. %  --  Taking the country through , the condition of the people was by no means so happy as ours . They had government of the people , but it was not by the people nor for the people . Everywhere the right to vote and to hold office was greatly restricted . The voter must have an estate worth a certain sum , or a specified number of acres , or an annual income of so many dollars . But the right to vote did not carry with it the right to hold office . More property was required for office holding than for voting , and there were besides certain religious restrictions . In New Hampshire , New Jersey , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia , the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers of state must be Protestants . In Massachusetts and Maryland they must be Christians . All these restrictions were long since swept away . %193 . Cruel Punishments. %  --  The humane spirit of our times was largely wanting . The debtor was cast into prison . The pauper might be sold to the highest bidder . The criminal was dragged out into open day and flogged or branded . From ten to nineteen crimes were punishable with death . No such thing as a lunatic asylum , or a deaf and dumb asylum , or a penitentiary existed . The prisons were dreadful places . Men came out of them worse than they went in. %194 . The Condition of the Laborer ; of the well to do. %  --  Men worked harder and for less money then than now . A regular working day was from sunrise to sunset , with an hour for breakfast and an hour for dinner . Sometimes the laborer was fed and lodged by the employer , in which case he was paid four dollars a month in winter and six in summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unskilled labor was thought high wages . Illustration : %Washington 's flute and Miss Custis 's harpsichord at Mount Vernon% Even the houses of the well to do were much less comfortable places than are such abodes in our day . There were no furnaces , no gas , no bathrooms , no plumbing . Wood was the universal fuel . Coal from Virginia and Rhode Island was little used . All cooking was done in " Dutch ovens , " or in " out ovens , " or in the enormous fireplaces to be found in every household . Wood fuel made sooty chimneys , and sooty chimneys took fire . In every city , therefore , were men known as " sweeps , " whose business it was to clean chimneys .

Illustration : A plow used in 1776 His land was plowed with a wooden plow partly shod with iron . His seed was sown by hand ; his hay was cut with scythes ; his grain was reaped with sickles , and threshed on the barn floor with flails in the hands of his slaves . %195 . Negro Slavery. %  --  No living person under thirty years of age has ever seen a negro slave in our country . When Washington was President there were 700,000 slaves . When the Revolution opened , slavery was permitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the North had always been strong , and when the war ended , the people began the work of abolition . In Massachusetts and New Hampshire the constitutions of the states declared that " all men are born free and equal , " and that " all men are born equally free , " and this was understood to abolish slavery . In Pennsylvania , slavery was abolished in 1780 . In Rhode Island and Connecticut gradual abolition laws were passed which provided that all children born of slave parents after a certain day should be free at a certain age , and that their children should never be slaves . The Ordinance of 1787 had prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory . But in 1790 New York , New Jersey , Delaware , Maryland , and all the states south of these were slave states . ( See map on the next page . ) Though slaves were men and women and children , they had no civil rights whatever . They could be bought and sold , leased , seized for a debt , bequeathed by will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , or earned anything , it belonged not to them , but to their owners . They were property just as oxen or horses were in the North . It was unlawful to teach them to read or write . They were not allowed to give evidence against a white man , nor to travel in bands of more than seven unless a white man was with them , nor to quit the plantation without leave . If a planter provided coarse food , coarse clothes , and a rude shelter for his slaves , if he did not work them more than fifteen hours out of twenty-four in summer , nor more than fourteen in winter , and if he gave them every Sunday to themselves , he did quite as much for their comfort as the law required he should .

Old advertisements are still extant in which runaway blacks are described by the scars left upon their bodies by the lash . When such lashings were not prescribed by the court , they were commonly given under the eye of the overseer , or inflicted by the owner himself . %196 . Six Days from Boston to New York. %  --  Our country was small when Washington was President . The people lived on the seaboard . The towns and cities were not actually very far apart ; but the means of travel were so poor , the time consumed in going even fifty miles was so great , that the country was practically immense in extent . Now we step into a beautifully fitted car , heated by steam , lighted by electricity , richly carpeted , and provided with most comfortable seats and beds , and are whirled across the continent from Philadelphia to San Francisco in less time than it took Washington to go from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Falmouth , Mass. 1 Footnote 1 : In many parts of the country where there was no water power , as Cape Cod , Long Island , Nantucket , etc. , flour was ground at windmills . The windmill shown in the picture was built in 1787 , and is still in use . If you had lived in 1791 and started , say , from Boston , to go to Philadelphia to see the President and the great city where independence had been declared , you would very likely have begun by making your will , and bidding good-by to your friends . You would then have gone down to the office of the proprietor of the stagecoach , and secured a seat to New York . As the coach left but twice a week , you would have waited till the day came and would then have presented yourself , at three o'clock in the morning , at the tavern whence the coach started . The stagecoach was little better than a huge covered box mounted on springs . It had neither glass windows , nor door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheld by ten posts which rose from the body of the vehicle , and the body was commonly breast high . From the top were hung curtains of leather , to be rolled up when the day was fine , and let down and buttoned when it was rainy and cold . Within were four seats . Without was the baggage . Fourteen pounds of luggage were allowed to be carried free by each passenger . But if your portmanteau or your brass-nail-studded hair trunk weighed more , you would have paid for it at the rate per mile that you paid for yourself . Under no circumstances , however , would you be permitted to take on the journey more than 150 pounds . When the baggage had all been weighed and strapped on the coach , when the horses had been attached , and the waybill , containing the names of the passengers , made out , the passengers would clamber to their seats through the front of the stage and sit down with their faces toward the driver 's seat . One pair of horses usually dragged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached , and if all went well , you would be put down about ten at night at some wayside inn or tavern after a journey of forty miles . Cramped and weary , you would eat a frugal supper and hurry off to bed with a notice from the landlord to be ready to start at three the next morning . Then , no matter if it rained or snowed , you would be forced to make ready by the dim light of a horn lantern , unknown now , for another ride of eighteen hours . If no mishaps occurred , if the coach was not upset by the ruts , if storm or flood did not delay you at Springfield , where the road met the Connecticut , or at Stratford , where it met the Housatonic , each of which had to be crossed on clumsy flatboats , the stage would roll into New York at the end of the sixth day . %197 . Two Days from New York to Philadelphia. %  --  And here a serious delay was almost certain to occur , for even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the Hudson to New Jersey . When the wind was high and the water rough , or the river full of ice , the boldest did not dare to risk a crossing . Once over the river , you would again go on by coach , and at the end of two more days would reach Philadelphia . In our time one can travel in eight hours the entire distance between Boston and Philadelphia , a distance which Washington could not have traversed in less than eight days . Illustration : Stagecoach and inn1 Footnote 1 : From a print of 1798. %198 . The Roads and the Inns. %  --  The newspapers and the travelers of those days complained bitterly of the roads and the inns . On the best roads the ruts were deep , the descents precipitous , and the passengers were often forced to get out and help the driver pull the wheels out of the mud . Breakdowns and upsets were of everyday occurrence . Yet bad as the roads were , the travel was so considerable that very often the inns and taverns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied unless they slept five or six in a room . %199 . A Steamboat on the Delaware. %  --  Rude as this means of travel seems to us , the men of 1790 were quite satisfied with it , and absolutely refused to make use of a better one . Had you been in Philadelphia during the summer of 1790 and taken up a copy of The Pennsylvania Packet , you could not have failed to notice this advertisement of the first successful steamboat in the world : %The Steam-Boat Is now ready to take Passengers , and is intended to set off from Arch Street Ferry in Philadelphia every Monday , Wednesday and Friday , for Burlington , Bristol , Bordentown and Trenton , to return on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays  --  Price for Passengers , 2/6 to Burlington and Bristol , 3/9 to Bordentown , 5/. to Trenton . June 14. tu.th ftf. % This boat was the invention of John Fitch , and from June to September ran up and down the Delaware ; but so few people went on it that he could not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the Great West. %  --  From Philadelphia went out one of the great highways to what was then the far West , but to what we now know as the valley of the Ohio . The traveler who to-day makes the journey from Philadelphia to Pittsburg is whisked on a railroad car through an endless succession of cities and villages and rich farms , and by great factories and mills and iron works , which in the days of Washington had no existence . He makes the journey easily between sunrise and sunset . In 1790 he could not have made it in twelve days . %201 . Towns beyond the Alleghany Mountains. %  --  Though the country between the Alleghany Mountains and the Mississippi had been closed to settlement from 1763 to 1776 by the King 's proclamation , it was by no means without population in 1790 . At Detroit and Kaskaskia and Vincennes were old French settlements , made long before France was driven out of Louisiana . But there were others of later date . The hardy frontiersman of 1763 cared no more for the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf at his cabin door . The ink with which the document was written had not dried before emigrants from Maryland and Virginia and Pennsylvania were hurrying into the valley of the Monongahela . In 1769 William Bean crossed the mountains from North Carolina , and , building a cabin on the banks of Watauga Creek , began the settlement of Tennessee . James Robertson and a host of others followed in 1770 , and soon the valleys of the Clinch and the Holston were dotted with cabins . In 1769 Daniel Boone , one of the grandest figures in frontier history , began his exploits in what is now Kentucky , and before 1777 Boonesboro , Harrodsburg , and Lexington were founded . Illustration : %Model of Fitch 's steamboat%l Footnote 1 : Now in the National Museum , Washington. %202 . State of Franklin. %  --  Before the Revolution closed , emigrants under James Robertson and John Donelson planted Nashville and half a dozen other settlements on the Cumberland , in middle Tennessee . After the Revolution ended , so many settlers were in eastern Tennessee that they tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the example of her Northern sisters , ceded to Congress her claim to what is now Tennessee in 1784 . But the people on the Watauga no sooner heard , of it than under the lead of John Sevier they organized the state of Franklin , whereupon North Carolina repealed the act of cession and absorbed the new state by making the Franklin officials her officials for the district of Tennessee . In 1789 she again ceded the district , and in May of that year Tennessee became part of the public domain . %203 . Squatters in Ohio. %  --  The cession to Congress of the land north of the Ohio led to an emigration from Virginia and Kentucky to what is now the state of Ohio . As this territory was to be sold to pay the national debt , Congress was forced to order the squatters away , and when they refused to go , sent troops to burn their cabins , destroy their crops , and drive them across the Ohio . The lawful settlement of the territory began after the Ohio and Scioto companies bought their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1788. %204 . Pittsburg in 1790. %  --  At Pittsburg , then the greatest town in the United States west of the Alleghany Mountains , were some 200 houses , mostly of logs , and 2000 people , a newspaper , and a few rude manufactories . The life of the town was its river trade . Pittsburg was the place where emigrants " fitted out " for the West . A settler intending to go down the Ohio valley with his family and his goods would lay in a stock of powder and ball , buy flour and ham enough to last him for a month , and secure two rude structures which passed under the name of boats . Illustration : %The first millstones and salt kettle in Ohio% %205 . A Trip down the Ohio in 1790. %  --  In the long keel boat he would put his wife , his children , and such travelers as had been waiting at Pittsburg for a chance to go down the river . In the flatboat would be his cattle or his stores . Two dangers beset the voyager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branches of the trees that overhung the river , or be fired into by the Indians who lurked in the woods . The cabin of the keel boat , therefore , was low , that it might glide under the trees , and the roof and sides were made as nearly bullet-proof as possible . The whole craft was steered by a huge oar mounted on a pivot at the stern. 1 Footnote 1 : See the boats in the pictures on next page . Illustration : Map of Ohio %206 . Towns along the Ohio. %  --  As the emigrant in such an ark floated down the river , he would come first to Wheeling , a town of fifty log cabins , and then to Marietta , a town planted in Ohio in 1788 by settlers sent by the Ohio Company . Below Marietta were Belpre and Gallipolis , a settlement made by Frenchmen brought there by the Scioto Company . Yet farther down , on the Kentucky side , were Limestone ( now Maysville ) and Newport , opposite which some settlers were founding the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till one reached Louisville in Kentucky , beyond which few emigrants had yet ventured to go . Illustration : %Cincinnati in 1802 ( Fort Washington ) % %207 . Cotton Planting. %  --  The South , in 1790 , was on the eve of a great industrial revolution . The products of the states south of Virginia had been tar , pitch , resin , lumber , rice , and indigo . But in the years following the peace the indigo plants had been destroyed year after year by an insect . As the plant was not a native of our country , but was brought from the West Indies , it became necessary either to import more seed plants , or to raise some other staple . Many chose the latter course , and about 1787 began to grow cotton . Illustration : %Farmers ' Castle ( Belpre ) in 1791% %208 . Whitney and the Cotton Gin. %  --  The experiment succeeded , but a serious difficulty arose . The cotton plant has pods which when ripe split open and show a white woolly substance attached to seeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be picked out , and as the labor of cleaning was very great , only a small quantity could be sent to market . It happened , however , that a young man from Massachusetts , named Eli Whitney , was then living in Georgia , and he , seeing the need of a machine to clean cotton , invented the cotton gin. 1 Till then , a negro slave could not clean two pounds of cotton in a day . With the gin the same slave in the same time could remove the seeds from a hundred pounds . This solved the difficulty , and gave to the United States another staple even greater in value than tobacco . In 1792 one hundred and ninety-two thousand pounds of cotton were exported to Europe ; in 1795 , after the gin was invented , six million pounds were sent out of the country . In 1894 no less than 4275 million pounds were raised and either consumed or exported . Of all the marvelous inventions of our countrymen , this produced the very greatest consequences . It made cotton planting profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South every year ; it covered New England with cotton mills ; and by making slave labor profitable it did more than anything else to fasten slavery on the United States for seventy years , and finally to bring on the Civil War , the most terrible struggle of modern times .

When Washington was inaugurated , the United States consisted of eleven states , with a population of about 3,380,000. 2 . These people lived not far from the Atlantic coast . Few cities existed ; not one had 50,000 inhabitants . Even the largest was without many conveniences which we consider necessaries. 3 . Travel was slow and difficult , and though a steamboat had been invented and used , it was too far ahead of the times to succeed . 4 .

Organizing the New Government. %  --  he President having been inaugurated , and the new government fairly established , it became the duty of Congress to enact such laws as were needed immediately . The first act passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties on goods , wares , and merchandise imported into the United States . Customhouses were then established and customs districts marked out , and ports of entry and ports of delivery designated ; provision was made for the support of lighthouses and beacons ; the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the territories was slightly changed and reenacted ; the departments of State , War , and Treasury were established ; and a call was made on the Secretary of the Treasury to report a plan for payment of the old Continental debt . %210 . The United States Courts. %  --  The Constitution declares that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish . Acting under this power , Congress made provision for a Supreme Court , consisting of a Chief Justice and five Associate Justices , and marked out the United States into circuits and districts . The circuits were three in number . In the first were the Eastern States ; in the second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern States . To each were assigned two Justices of the Supreme Court , whose business it was to go to some city in each state in the circuit , and there , with the district judge of that state , hold a circuit court . The district courts were thirteen in number , one being established in each state. 1 Washington appointed John Jay the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . Footnote 1 : For later changes , see Andrews 's Manual of the Constitution , p. 183. %211 . The Secretaries. %  --  During the management of affairs by the Continental Congress three great executive departments had gradually grown up and been placed in charge of three men , called the " Superintendent of Finance , " the " Secretary of the United States for the Department of Foreign Affairs , " and the " Secretary of War . " These the Constitution recognized in the expression " principal officer in each of the executive departments . " Congress by law now continued the departments and placed them in charge of a Secretary of the Treasury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Washington filled the offices promptly , making Alexander Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury , Thomas Jefferson Secretary of State , and General Henry Knox Secretary of War . %212 . The " Cabinet . " %  --  It has long been the custom for the President to gather his secretaries about him on certain days in each week for the purpose of discussing public measures . To these gatherings has been given the name " Cabinet meetings , " while the secretaries have come to be called " Cabinet officers . " The Constitution , however , never intended to give the President a body of advisers . Indeed , a proposition to provide him with a council was voted down in the constitutional convention . But Washington at once began to consult the Chief Justice , the Vice President , his three secretaries , and the Attorney-general on matters of importance . At first he asked their opinions individually and in writing , but toward the end of his first term he convened a general meeting of the heads of departments , and by so doing set a custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has grown . %213 . The Origin of the National Debt. %  --  As soon as Hamilton was made Secretary of the Treasury , it became his duty , in accordance with an order from Congress , to prepare a plan for the payment of the debts contracted by the Continental Congress . When that body was unexpectedly called on , in May , 1775 , to conduct the war , it had nothing with which to pay expenses , and was forced to use all sorts of means to raise money . Illustrations : Continental money %214 . Paper Money. %  --  The first resort was the issue , during 1775 and 1776 , of six batches of Continental " bills of credit , " amounting in all to $36,000,000 . These " bills " were rudely engraved bits of paper , stating on their face that " This bill entitles the bearer to receive  --   --  Spanish milled dollars , or the value thereof in gold or silver . " They were issued in sums of various denominations , from one sixth of a dollar up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned each state for redemption was in proportion to the supposed number of its inhabitants . %215 . Loan-office Certificates. %  --  In 1776 Congress tried another means . It opened a loan office in each state and called on patriotic people to come forward and loan it money , receiving in return pieces of paper called " loan-office certificates . " Interest was to be paid on these ; but after a while Congress , having no money with which to pay interest , was forced to resort to another form of paper , called " interest indents. " %216 . The Congress Lottery. %  --  The loan office having failed to bring in as much money as was needed , Congress , toward the close of 1776 , was driven to seek some other way , and resorted to a lottery . A certain number of tickets were sold , after which a drawing took place , and all who drew prizes were given certificates payable at the end of five years . %217 . More Bills of Credit. %  --  But the sale of tickets went off so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bills of credit . In 1777 , therefore , the printing press was again put to work , and issues were made in rapid succession , till more than $200,000,000 in Continental paper were in circulation . %218 . The " New Tenor " . %  --  Then the Continental bills ceased to circulate , and in March , 1780 , Congress called in the old money and offered to exchange it for a new issue , giving one dollar of the new paper money , or " new tenor , " for forty dollars of the old . But the attempt to restore credit by such means was a failure , and by the end of the year 1781 all paper money ceased to circulate . %219 . Certificates. %  --  Long before this time officials had been forced to pay debts contracted in the name of Congress with other kinds of paper , called certificates , and known as treasury , commissary , quartermaster , marine , and hospital certificates , according to the department issuing them . To these must be added the " final settlements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war in payment of their services . %220 . Foreign Debt. %  --  Besides the debt thus contracted at home , Congress had borrowed a great sum in Europe . %221 . The National Debt in 1790. %  --  Thus the debt contracted by the Continental Congress consisted of two parts . 1 . The foreign debt , due to France , Holland , and Spain , and amounting , Hamilton found , to $11,700,000. 2 . The domestic or home debt , of $42,000,000 . But the states had also fallen into debt because of their exertions in the war . Just how great the state debts were could not be determined , but they were estimated to be $21,500,000. %222 . Assumption and Funding. %  --  For the redemption of this debt Hamilton prepared two measures ,  --  the funding , or , as we should say , the bonding , of the foreign and Continental debt , and the assuming and funding of the state debts . This was done , and Congress ordered stock bearing interest to be issued in exchange for the old debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1790 amounted to $75,000,000. %223 . The National Capital. %  --  Funding the state debts was strongly opposed by many congressmen , and was not carried till a bargain was made by which it was agreed that if enough members from Virginia and Pennsylvania would support the measure to secure its passage through the House of Representatives , the national government should be removed from New York to Philadelphia for ten years , and after that to a city to be built on the Potomac . This was faithfully carried out , and in the summer of 1790 the government offices were removed to Philadelphia , where they remained till the summer of 1800 , when they were removed to Washington in the District of Columbia . %224 . The Bank of the United States. %  --  The troublesome questions of funding and assumption thus disposed of , Congress called on Hamilton for a report on the further support of public credit , and when it met in the session of 1790-91 , received a plan for a great National Bank , with a capital of $10,000,000 . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribed for by the people . The bank was to keep the public revenues , was to aid the government in making payments all over the country . To do this , power was given to the parent bank ( which must be at Philadelphia ) to establish branches in the chief cities and towns , and to issue bank bills which should be received all over the United States for public lands , taxes , duties , postage , and in payment of any debt due the government . Great opposition was made ; but the charter was granted for twenty years , and in 1791 the Bank of the United States began business . The effect of these two measures , funding the debt and establishing a bank , was immediate . Confidence and credit were restored . Money that the people had long been hiding away was brought out and invested in all sorts of new enterprises , such as banks , canal companies , manufacturing companies , and turnpike companies . Illustration : The first Bank of the United States %225 . " Federalists " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people for acceptance or rejection in 1788 , they were divided into two bodies . Those who wanted a strong and vigorous federal government , who wanted Congress to have plenty of power to regulate trade , pay the debts of the country , and raise revenue , supported the Constitution just as it was and were called " Federalists . " Others , who wanted the old Articles of Confederation preserved and amended so as to give Congress a revenue and only a little more power , opposed the Constitution and wanted it altered . To please these " Anti-Federalists , " as they were a large part of the people , Congress , in 1789 , drew up twelve amendments to the Constitution and sent them to the states . With the ratification of ten of these amendments , opposition to the Constitution ceased . But as soon as Congress began to pass laws , difference of opinion as to the expediency of them , and even as to the right of Congress to pass them , divided the people again into two parties , and sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of men , for instance , opposed the funding of the Continental Congress debt at its face value , because the people never had taken a bill at the value expressed on its face , but at a very much less value ; some opposed the assumption of the state debts , because Congress , they said , had power to pay the debt of the United States , but not state debts ; others opposed the National Bank because the Constitution did not give Congress express power in so many words to charter a bank . Others complained that the interest on the national debt and the great salary of the President ( $25,000 a year ) and the pay of Congressmen ( $6 a day ) and the hundreds of tax collectors made taxes too heavy . They complained again that men in office showed an undemocratic fondness for aristocratic customs . The President , they said , was too exclusive , and owned too fine a coach . The Justices of the Supreme Court must have black silk gowns , with red , white , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held its daily session in secret ; not even a newspaper reporter was allowed to be present . As early as 1792 there were thus a very great number of men in all parts of the country who were much opposed to the measures of Congress and the President , and who accused the Federalists of wishing to set up a monarchy . A great national debt , they said , a funding system , a national bank , and heavy internal taxes are all monarchical institutions , and if you have the institutions , it will not be long before you have the monarchy . They began therefore in 1792 to organize for election purposes , and as they were opposed to a monarchy , they called themselves " Republicans . " 1 Their great leaders were Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , John Randolph , and Albert Gallatin . Footnote 1 : This party was the forerunner of the present Democratic party. %226 .

Instead , therefore , of making flour , they grew rye and made whisky on their own farms . This found a ready sale .

An appeal was then made to the courts ; but when the marshal came to make arrests he , too , was driven away . Under the Articles of Confederation this would have been submitted to .

Trouble with Great Britain and France. %  --  From the congressional election in 1792 we may date the beginning of organized political parties in the United States . They sprang from differences of opinion as to domestic matters . But on a sudden in 1793 Federalists and Republicans became divided on questions of foreign affairs . Ever since 1789 France had been in a state of revolution , and at last ( in 1792 ) the people established the French Republic , cut off the heads of the King and Queen ( in 1793 ) , and declared war on England and sent a minister , Genet , to the United States . At that time we had no treaty with Great Britain except the treaty of peace . With France , however , we had two treaties ,  --  one of alliance , and one of amity and commerce . The treaty of alliance bound us to guarantee to France " the possessions of the crown of France in America , " by which were meant the French West Indian Islands . When Washington heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French minister was on his way to America , he became alarmed lest this minister should call on him to make good the guarantee by sending a fleet to the Indies . On consulting his secretaries , they advised him that the guarantee applied only when France was attacked , and not when she was the attacking party . The President thereupon issued a proclamation of neutrality ; that is , declared that the United States would not side with either party in the war , but would treat both alike . %228 . Sympathy for France ; the French Craze. %  --  Then began a long struggle for neutrality . The Republicans were very angry at Washington and denounced him violently . France , they said , had been our old friend ; Great Britain had been our old enemy . We had a treaty with France ; we had none with Great Britain . To treat her on the same footing with France was therefore a piece of base ingratitude to France . A wave of sympathy for France swept over the country . The French dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address each other as Mr. Smith , Mr. Jones , Sir , or " Your Honor , " and used Citizen Smith and Citizen Jones . The French tricolor with the red liberty cap was hung up in taverns and coffeehouses , which were the clubhouses of that day . Every French victory was made the occasion of a " civic feast , " while the anniversaries of the fall of the Bastile and of the founding of the Republic were kept in every great city. 1 Footnote 1 : Read McMaster 's History of the People of the United States , Vol . II. , pp. 89-96 ; Harpers Magazine , April , 1897. %229 . England seizes our Ships ; the Rule of 1756%.  --  To preserve neutrality in the face of such a public sentiment was hard enough ; but Great Britain made it more difficult yet . When war was declared , France opened the ports of her West Indian Islands and invited neutral nations to trade with them . This she did because she knew that the British navy could drive her merchantmen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies must be carried on in the ships of neutral nations . Now the merchants of the United States had never been allowed to trade with the French Indies to an unlimited extent . The moment , therefore , they were allowed to do so , they gladly began to trade , and during the summer of 1793 hundreds of ships went to the islands . There were at that time four questions of dispute between us and Great Britain : 1 . Great Britain held that she might seize any kind of food going to a French port in our ships . We held that only military stores might be so seized . 2 . Great Britain held that when a port had been declared to be blockaded , a ship bound to that port might be seized even on the high seas . We held that no port was blockaded unless there was a fleet actually stationed at it to prevent ships from entering or leaving it . 3 . Great Britain held that our ships might be captured if they had French goods on board . We held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our ships were not subject to capture , no matter whose goods they had on board . 4 . Great Britain in 1756 had adopted a rule that no neutral should have in time of war a trade she did not have in time of peace . The United States was now enjoying a trade in time of war she did not have in time of peace , and Great Britain began to enforce her rule . British ships were ordered to stop American vessels going to or coming from the French West Indies , and if they contained provisions , to seize them . This was done , and in the autumn of 1793 great numbers of American ships were captured . %230 . Our Sailors impressed. %  --  All this was bad enough and excited the people against our old enemy , who made matters a thousand times worse by a course of action to which we could not possibly submit . She claimed the right to stop any of our ships on the sea , send an officer on board , force the captain to muster the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . If one was found , he was seized and carried away . If none were found , and the British ships wanted men , native-born Americans were taken off under the pretext that one could not tell an American from an English sailor . Our fathers could stand a great deal , but this was too much , and a cry for war went up from all parts of the country . But Washington did not want war , and took two measures to prevent it . He persuaded Congress to lay an embargo for thirty days , that is , forbid all ships to leave our ports , and induced the Senate to let him send John Jay , the Chief Justice , to London to make a treaty of amity and commerce with Great Britain . %231 . Jay 's Treaty , 1794. %  --  In this mission Jay succeeded ; and though the treaty was far from what Washington wanted , it was the best that could be had , and he approved it. 1 At this the Republicans grew furious . They burned copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the treaty had some good features . By it the King agreed to withdraw his troops from Oswego and Detroit and Mackinaw , which really belonged to us but were still occupied by the English . By it our merchants were allowed for the first time to trade with the British West Indies , and some compensation was made for the damage done by the capture of ships in the West Indies . Footnote 1 : The Senate ratified this treaty in the summer of 1795. %232 . Treaty with Spain. %  --  About the same time ( October , 1795 ) we made our first treaty with Spain , and induced her to accept the thirty-first degree of latitude as the south boundary of our country , and to consent to open the Mississippi to trade . As Spain owned both banks at the mouth of the river , she claimed that American ships had no right to go in or out without her consent , and so prevented the people of Kentucky and Tennessee from trading in foreign markets . She now agreed that they might float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then ship it wherever they pleased . %233 . The Election of Adams and Jefferson , 1796%.  --  Washington had been reelected President in 1792 , but he was now tired of office , and in September , 1796 , issued his " Farewell Address , " in which he declined to be the candidate for a third presidential term . In those days there were no national conventions to nominate candidates , yet it was well understood that John Adams , the Vice President , was the candidate of the Federalists , and Thomas Jefferson , of the Republicans . When the votes were counted in Congress , it was found that Adams had 71 electoral votes , and Jefferson 68 ; so they became President and Vice President . Illustration : John Adams %234 . Trouble with France. %  --  Adams was inaugurated on March 4 , 1797 , and three days later heard that C. C. Pinckney , our minister to the French Republic , had been driven from France . Pinckney had been sent to France by Washington in 1796 , but the French Directory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called ) had taken great offense at Jay 's treaty : first because it was favorable to Great Britain , and in the second place because it put an end for the present to all hope of war between her and the United States . The Directory , therefore , refused to receive Pinckney until the French grievances were redressed . The President was very angry at the insult , and summoned Congress to meet and take such action as , said he , " shall convince France and the whole world that we are not a degraded people humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority . " But the Republicans declared so vigorously that if a special mission were sent to France all would be made right , that Adams yielded , and sent John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry to join Pinckney as envoys extraordinary . On reaching Paris , three men acting as agents for the Directory met them , and declared that before they could be received as ministers they must do three things : 1 . Apologize for Adams 's denunciation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Pay tribute to France . When the President reported this demand to Congress , the names of the three French agents were suppressed , and instead they were called Mr. X , Mr. Y , Mr. Z. This gave the mission the nickname " X , Y , Z mission . " %235 . " Millions for Defense , not a Cent for Tribute . " %  --  As the newspapers published these dispatches , a roar of indignation , in which the Federalists and Republicans alike joined , went up from the whole country . " Millions for defense , not a cent for tribute , " became the watchword of the hour . Opposition in Congress ceased , and preparations were at once made for war . The French treaties were suspended . The Navy Department was created , and a Secretary of the Navy appointed . Frigates were ordered to be built , money was voted for arms , a provisional army was formed , and Washington was again made commander in chief , with the rank of lieutenant general . The young men associated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloops of war , and gave their services to erect forts and earthworks . Every French flag was now pulled down from the coffeehouses , and the black cockade of our own Revolutionary days was once more worn as the badge of patriotism . Then was written , by Joseph Hopkinson of Philadelphia , 1 and sung for the first time , our national song Hail , Columbia ! Footnote 1 : The music to which we sing Hail , Columbia ! was called The President 's March , and was played for the first time when the people of Trenton were welcoming Washington on his way to be inaugurated President in 1789 . For an account of the trouble with France read McMaster 's History of the People of the United States , Vol . II , pp. 207-416 , 427-476. %236 . The Alien and Sedition Acts. %  --  Carried away by the excitement of the hour , the Federalists now passed two most unwise laws . Many of the active leaders and very many of the members of the Republican party were men born abroad and naturalized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as such had good reason to hate England , and therefore hated the Federalists , who they believed were too friendly to her . To prevent such becoming voters , and so taking an active part in politics , the Federalists passed a new naturalization law , which forbade any foreigner to become an American citizen until he had lived fourteen years in our country . Lest this should not be enough to keep them quiet , a second law was passed by which the President had power for two years to send any alien ( any of these men who for fourteen years could not become citizens ) out of the country whenever he thought it proper . This law Adams never used . For five years past the Republican newspapers had been abusing Washington , Adams , the acts of Congress , the members of Congress , and the whole foreign policy of the Federalists . The Federalist newspapers , of course , had retaliated and had been just as abusive of the Republicans . But as the Federalists now had the power , they determined to punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act . This provided that any man who acted seditiously ( that is , interfered with the execution of a law of Congress ) or spoke or wrote seditiously ( that is , abused the President , or Congress , or any member of the Federal government ) should be tried , and if found guilty , be fined and imprisoned . This law was used , and used vigorously , and Republican editors all over the country were fined and sometimes imprisoned. 1 Footnote 1 : The Alien and Sedition acts are in Preston 's Documents , pp. 277-282. %237 . Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions. %  --  The passage of these Alien and Sedition laws greatly excited the Republicans , and led Jefferson to use his influence to have them condemned by the states . For this purpose he wrote a set of resolutions and sent them to a friend in Kentucky who was to try to have the legislature adopt them. 2 Jefferson next asked Madison to write a like set of resolutions for the Virginia legislature to adopt . Madison became so interested that he gave up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in December , 1798 , induced it to adopt what have since been known as the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 . Footnote 2 : Kentucky had been admitted to the Union in 1792 ( see p. 213 ) . Meantime the legislature of Kentucky , November , 1798 , had adopted the resolutions of Jefferson. 3 Footnote 3 : E. D. Warfield 's Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions . The Resolutions are printed in Preston 's Documents , pp. 283-298 ; Jefferson 's Works , Vol . IX. , p. 494 . Both sets declare 1 . That the Constitution of the United States is a compact or contract . 2 . That to this contract each state is a party ; that is , the united states are equal partners in a great political firm . So far they agree ; but at this point they differ . The Kentucky Resolutions assert that when any question arises as to the right of Congress to pass any law , each state may decide this question for itself and apply any remedy it likes . The Virginia Resolutions declare that the states may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alien and Sedition laws were wholly unconstitutional . Seven states answered by declaring that the laws were constitutional , whereupon Kentucky in 1799 framed another set of resolutions in which she said that when a state thought a law to be illegal she had the right to nullify it ; that is , forbid her citizens to obey it . This doctrine of nullification , as we shall see , afterwards became of very serious importance. 1 Footnote 1 : The answers of the states are printed in Elliot 's Debates , Vol . IV. , pp. 532-539. %238 . The Naval War with France. %  --  Meantime war opened with France . The Navy Department was created in April , 1798 , and before the year ended , a gallant little navy of thirty-four frigates , corvettes , and gun sloops of war had been collected and sent with a host of privateers to scour the sea around the French West Indies , destroy French commerce , and capture French ships of war. 1 One of our frigates , the Constellation , Captain Thomas Truxton in command , captured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another occasion , Truxton , in the Constellation , fought the Vengeance and would have taken her , but the Frenchman , finding he was getting much the worst of it , spread his sails and fled . Yet another of our frigates , the Boston , took the Berceau , whose flag is now in the Naval Institute Building at Annapolis . In six months the little American twelve-gun schooner Enterprise took eight French privateers , and recaptured and set free four American merchantmen . These and a hundred other actions just as gallant made good the patriotic words of John Adams , " that we are not a degraded people humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority . " So impressed was France with this fact that the war had scarcely begun when the Directory meekly sent word that if another set of ministers came they would be received . They ought to have been told that they must send a mission to us . But Adams in this respect was weak , and in 1800 , the Chief Justice , Oliver Ellsworth , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . The Directory had then fallen from power , Napoleon was ruling France as First Consul , and with him in September , 1800 , a convention was concluded . Footnote 2 : For an account of this war , read Maclay 's History of the United States Navy , Vol . I. , pp. 155-213. %239 . The Stamp Tax ; the Direct Tax and Fries 's Rebellion , 1798. %  --  The heavy cost of the preparations for war made new taxes necessary . Two of these , a stamp tax very similar to the famous one of 1765 , and a direct tax , greatly excited the people . The direct tax was the first of its kind in our history , and was laid on lands , houses , and negro slaves . In certain counties of eastern Pennsylvania , where the population was chiefly German , the purpose of the tax was not understood , and the people refused to make returns of the value of their farms and houses . When the assessors came to measure the houses and count the windows as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people drove them off . For this some of the leaders were arrested . But the people under John Fries rose and rescued the prisoners . At this stage President Adams called out the militia , and marched it against the rebels . They yielded . But Fries was tried for treason , was sentenced to be hanged , and was then pardoned . Thus a second time was it proved that the people of the United States were determined to support the Constitution and the laws and put down rebellion . %240 . Washington the National Capital. %  --  In accordance with the bargain made in 1790 , Washington selected a site for the Federal city on both banks of the Potomac . This great square tract of land was ten miles long on each side , and was given to the government partly by Maryland and partly by Virginia. 1 It was called the District of Columbia , and in it were marked out the streets of Washington city . Footnote 1 : In 1846 so much of the District as had belonged to Virginia was given back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's house was still unfinished , the Capitol but partly built , and the streets nothing but roads cut through the woods , when , in the summer of 1800 , the secretaries , the clerks , the books and papers of the government left Philadelphia for Washington . With the opening of the new century , and the occupation of the new Capitol , came a new President , and a new party in control of the government . Illustration : The National Capitol as it was in 1825 %241 . The Election of Thomas Jefferson. %  --  The year 1800 was a presidential year , and though no formal nomination was made , a caucus of Republican leaders selected as candidates Thomas Jefferson for President , and Aaron Burr for Vice President . A caucus or meeting of Federalist leaders selected John Adams and C. C. Pinckney as their candidates . When the returns were all in , it appeared that Jefferson had received seventy-three votes , Burr seventy-three votes , Adams sixty-five votes , Pinckney sixty-four votes . The Constitution provided that the man who received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of the electors , should be President . But as Jefferson and Burr had each seventy-three , neither had the highest , and neither was President . The duty of electing a President then devolved on the House of Representatives , which after a long and bitter struggle elected Jefferson President ; Burr then became Vice President . To prevent such a contest ever arising again , the twelfth amendment was added to the Constitution . This provides for a separate ballot for Vice President . March 4 , 1801 , Jefferson , escorted by the militia of Georgetown and Alexandria , walked from his lodgings to the Senate chamber and took the oath of office. 1 He and his party had been placed in power in order to make certain reforms , and this , when Congress met in the winter of 1801 , they began to do .

The Annual Message. %  --  While Washington and Adams were presidents , it was their custom when Congress met each year to go in state to the House of Representatives , and in the presence of the House and Senate read a speech . The two branches of Congress would then separate and appoint committees to answer the President 's speech , and when the answers were ready , each would march through the streets to the President 's house , where the Vice President or the Speaker would read the answer to the President . When Congress met in 1801 , Jefferson dropped this custom and sent a written message to both houses  --  a practice which every President since that time has followed . %243 . Republican Reforms. %  --  True to their promises , the Republicans now proceeded to repeal the hated laws of the Federalists . They sold all the ships of the navy except thirteen , they ordered prosecutions under the Sedition law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid by the Federalists , they cut down the army to 2500 men , and reduced the expenses of government to $3,700,000 per year  --  a sum which would not now pay the cost of running the government for three days . As the annual revenue collected at the customhouses , the post office , and from the sale of land was $10,800,000 , the treasury had some $7,000,000 of surplus each year . This was used to pay the national debt , which fell from $88,000,000 in 1801 to $45,000,000 in 1812 , and this in spite of the purchase of Louisiana . Illustration : Thomas Jefferson %244 . The Purchase of Louisiana. %  --  When France was driven out of America , it will be remembered , she gave to Spain all of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River , together with a large tract on the east bank , at the river 's mouth . Spain then owned Louisiana till 1800 , when by a secret treaty she gave the province back to France. 1 Footnote 1 : Adams 's History of the United States , Vol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really kept secret ; but in April , 1802 , news that Louisiana had been given to France and that Napoleon was going to send out troops to hold it , reached this country and produced two consequences . In the first place , it led the Spanish intendant ( as the man who had charge of all commercial matters was called ) to withdraw the " right of deposit " at New Orleans , and so prevent citizens of the United States sending their produce out of the Mississippi River . In the second place , this act of the intendant excited the rage of all the settlers in the valley from Pittsburg to Natchez , and made them demand the instant seizure of New Orleans by American troops . To prevent this , Jefferson obtained the consent of Congress to make an effort to buy New Orleans and West Florida , and sent Monroe to aid our minister in France in making the purchase . When the offer was made , Napoleon was about going to war with England , and , wanting money very much , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States  --  an offer that was gladly accepted . The price paid was $15,000,000 , and in December , 1803 , Louisiana was formally delivered to us. %245 . Louisiana. %  --  Concerning this splendid domain hardly anything was known . No boundaries were given to it either on the north , or on the west , or on the south . What the country was like nobody could tell. 1 Where the source of the Mississippi was no white man knew . In the time of La Salle a priest named Hennepin had gone up to the spot where Minneapolis now stands , and had seen the Falls of St. Anthony ( p. 63 ) . But the country above the falls was still unknown . Footnote 1 : In a description of it which Jefferson sent to Congress in 1804 , he actually stated that " there exists about one thousand miles up the Missouri , and not far from that river , a salt mountain . This mountain is said to be one hundred and eighty miles long and forty-five in width , composed of solid rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " %246 . Explorations of Lewis and Clark. %  --  That this great region ought to be explored had been a favorite idea of Jefferson for twenty years past , and he had tried to persuade learned men and learned societies to organize an expedition to cross the continent . Failing in this , he turned to Congress , which in 1803 ( before the purchase of Louisiana ) voted a sum of money for sending an exploring party from the mouth of the Missouri to the Pacific . The party was in charge of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark . Early in May , 1804 , they left St. Louis , then a frontier town of log cabins , and worked their way up the Missouri River to a spot not far from the present city of Bismarck , North Dakota , where they passed the winter with the Indians . Resuming their journey in the spring of 1805 , they followed the Missouri to its source in the mountains , after crossing which they came to the Clear Water River ; and down this they went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in November , 1805 , they " saw the waves like small mountains rolling out in the sea . " They were on the shores of the Pacific Ocean . After spending the winter at the mouth of the Columbia , the party made its way back to St. Louis in 1806. %247 . The Oregon Country. %  --  Lewis and Clark were not the first of our countrymen to see the Columbia River . In 1792 a Boston ship captain named Gray was trading with the Pacific coast Indians . He was collecting furs to take to China and exchange for tea to be carried to Boston , and while so engaged he discovered the mouth of a great river , which he entered , and named the Columbia in honor of his ship . By right of this discovery by Gray the United States was entitled to all the country drained by the Columbia River . By the exploration of this country by Lewis and Clark our title was made stronger still , and it was finally perfected a few years later when the trappers and settlers went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote 1 : Barrows 's Oregon ; McMaster 's History , Vol .

In this he was mistaken , but supposing his work done , he was dispatched on another expedition in 1806 . Traveling up the Missouri River to the Osage , and up the Osage nearly to its source , he struck across Kansas to the Arkansas River , which he followed to its head waters , wandering in the neighborhood of that fine mountain which in honor of him bears the name of Pikes Peak . Then he crossed the mountains and began a search for the Red River . The march was a terrible one . It was winter ; the cold was intense . The snow lay waist deep on the plains . Often the little band was without food for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of hunger , cold , and suffering , and at last saw , through a gap in the mountains , the waters of the Rio Grande . Believing that it was the Red , he hurried to its banks , only to be seized by the Spaniards ( for he was on Spanish soil ) , who carried him a prisoner to Santa Fe , from which city he and his men wandered back to the United States by way of Mexico and Texas . Illustration : %EXPLORATION OF THE SOUTHWEST% BY ZEBULON M. PIKE %1806-1807% %249 . Astoria founded. %  --  The immediate effect of these explorations was greatly to stimulate the fur trade . One great fur trader , John Jacob Astor of New York , now founded the Pacific Fur Company and made preparations to establish a line of posts from the upper Missouri to the Columbia , and along it to the Pacific , and supply them from St. Louis by way of the Missouri , or from the mouth of the Columbia , where in 1811 a little trading post was begun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Gray had discovered the river ; Lewis and Clark had explored the territory drained by the river ; the Pacific Fur Company planted the first lasting settlement . SUMMARY 1 . In 1793 France made war on Great Britain . The United States was bound by the treaty of alliance of 1778 to " guarantee " the French possessions in America . 2 . This treaty , and the coming of the French minister , forced Washington to declare the United States neutral in the war . 3 . His proclamation of neutrality was resented by the Republicans , who now became sympathizers with France . The Federalists , who were strongest in the commercial states , became the anti-French or English party . 4 . When France declared war on England , she opened her ports in the West Indies to the merchant trade of the United States . 5 . England held that we should not have a trade with France when at war , for we had not had it when France was at peace . This was an application of the " Rule of 1756 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize our ships coming from the French ports . 6 . This so excited the Republicans that they attempted to force the country into war with England . 7 . To prevent war , Washington sent Jay to London , where he made our first commercial treaty with Great Britain . 8 . This offended the French Directory , who refused to receive our new minister and sent him out of France . 9 . War with France now seemed likely . But Adams , in the interest of peace , sent three commissioners to Paris to make a new treaty . They were met with demands for tribute and came home . 10 . The greatest excitement now prevailed in the country . The Navy Department was created , a navy was built by the people , and a provisional army raised . The old French treaties were suspended , and a naval war began . 11 . The popular anger against the Republicans ( the French party ) gave the Federalists control of Congress , whereupon they passed the Alien and Sedition laws . 12 . Against these Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the election of 1800 the Federalists were defeated , and the Republicans secured control of the Federal government . 14 . In 1800 Spain ceded Louisiana to France , whereupon the Spanish official at New Orleans shut the Mississippi to American commerce . 15 . The whole West cried out against this and demanded war . But Jefferson offered to buy West Florida from France . Napoleon thereupon offered to sell all Louisiana , and we bought it ( 1803 ) . 16 . The new territory as yet had no boundaries ; but it was explored in the northwest by Lewis and Clark , and in the southwest by Pike . 17 . The discovery of the Columbia River in 1792 , the exploration of the country by Lewis and Clark , and the founding of Astoria established our claim to the Oregon country .

France and Great Britain renew the War. %  --  The war between France and Great Britain , which had been the cause of the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States became again a neutral power , but , as in 1793 , was soon once more involved in the disputes of France . Towards the end of the previous war , Great Britain had so changed her ideas of neutrality that the merchants of the United States , according to her rules , 1 . Could trade directly between a port of the United States and the ports of the French West Indies . 2 . Could trade directly between the United States and ports in France or Europe . 3 . But could not trade directly between a French West India island and France , or a Spanish West India island and Spain , or a Dutch colony and Holland . To evade this last restriction , by combining the voyages allowed in numbers 1 and 2 , was easy . A merchant had but to load his ship at New York or Philadelphia , go to some port in the French West Indies , take on a new cargo and bring it to Savannah , enter it at the customhouse and pay the import duties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , without disturbing his cargo in the least , clear his vessel for France , and get back from the collector of customs all the duty he had paid except three per cent . He was now exporting goods from the United States and was protected by number 2 . This was called " the broken voyage , " and by using it thousands of shipowners were enabled to carry goods back and forth between France and her colonies , by merely stopping a few hours at an American port to clear for Europe . So universal was this practice that in 1804 the customs revenue rose from $16,000,000 to $20,000,000 . In May , 1805 , however , the British High Court of Admiralty decided that goods which started from the French colonies in American ships and were on their way to France could be captured even if they had been landed and reshipped in the United States . The moment that decision was made , the old trouble began again . British frigates were stationed off the ports of New York and Hampton Roads , and vessels coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sailors impressed . Before 1805 ended , 116 of our ships had been seized and 1000 of our sailors impressed . %251 . Orders in Council , 1806. %  --  In 1806 matters grew worse . Napoleon was master of Europe , and in order to injure Great Britain he cut off her trade with the continent . For this she retaliated by issuing , in May , 1806 , an Order in Council , which declared the whole coast of Europe , from Brest to the mouth of the river Elbe , to be blockaded . This was a mere " paper blockade " ; that is , no fleets were off the coast to keep neutrals from running into the blockaded ports . Yet American vessels were captured at sea because they were going to those ports . %252 . The Berlin Decree. %  --  Napoleon waited to retaliate till November , 1806 , when he issued the Berlin Decree , 1 declaring the British Islands to be blockaded . Footnote 1 : So called because he was at Berlin when he issued it. %253 . Orders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Napoleon struck at her she must strike back at him , and in January , 1807 , a new Order in Council forbade neutrals to trade from one European port to another , if both were in the possession of France or her allies . Finding it had no effect , she followed it up with another Order in Council in November , 1807 , which declared that every port on the face of the earth from which for any reason British ships were excluded was shut to neutrals , unless they first stopped at some British port and obtained a license to trade . %254 . The Milan Decree , 1807. %  --  It was now Napoleon 's turn to strike , which he did in December , 1807 , by issuing the Milan Decree. 1 Thenceforth any ship that submitted to be searched by British cruisers or took out a British license , or entered any port from which French ships were excluded , was to be captured wherever found . Footnote 1 : So called because he was in Milan at the time , and dated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French Decrees and British Orders in Council , 2 the English took 194 of our ships , and the French almost as many . Footnote 2 : On the Orders in Council and French Decrees , read Adams 's History of the United States , Vol . III. , Chap . 16 ; Vol . IV. , Chaps . 4 , 5 , and 6 ; McMaster 's History , Vol . III. , pp. 219-223 ; 249-250 ; 272-274. %255 . Jefferson 's Policy ; Non-importation Act. %  --  The policy by which Jefferson proposed to meet this emergency consisted of three parts : 1 . Lay up the frigates and defend our coast and harbors by a number of small , swift-sailing craft , each carrying one gun in the stern . In time of peace they were to be hauled up under sheds . In time of war they were to be shoved into the water and manned by volunteers . Between 1806 and 1812 , 176 of these gunboats were built . 2 . Make a new treaty with Great Britain , because that made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instructions of Jefferson , therefore , Monroe and Pinckney signed a new treaty in December , 1806 . But it said nothing about the impressment of our sailors , or about the right of our ships to go where they pleased , and was so bad in general that Jefferson would not even send it to the Senate. 3 Footnote 3 : No treaty can become a law unless approved by the President and two thirds of the Senate. 3 . The third part of his policy consisted in doing what we should call " boycotting . " He wanted a law which would forbid the importation into the United States of any article made , grown , or produced in Great Britain or any of her colonies . Congress accordingly , in April , 1806 , passed what was called a " Non-importation Act , " which prohibited not the importation of every sort of British goods , wares , and merchandise , but only a few which the people could make in this country ; as paper , cards , leather goods , etc . This was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chesapeake and the Leopard. %  --  Such an attempt to punish Great Britain by cutting off a part of her trade was useless , and only made her more insolent than before . Indeed , just a week after the President signed the non-importation bill , as one of our coasting vessels was entering the harbor of New York , a British vessel , wishing to stop and search her , fired a shot which struck the helmsman and killed him at the wheel . About a year later , June , 1807 , an attack more outrageous still was made on our frigate Chesapeake . She was on her way from Washington to the Mediterranean , and was still in sight of land when a British vessel , the Leopard , hailed and stopped her and sent an officer on board with a demand for the delivery of deserters from the English navy . The captain of the Chesapeake refused , the officer returned , and the Leopard opened fire . To return the fire was impossible , for only a few of the guns of the Chesapeake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as by that time three men had been killed and eighteen wounded , Commander Barron of the Chesapeake surrendered . Four men then were taken from her deck . Three were Americans . One was an Englishman , and he was hanged for desertion. 1 Footnote 1 : Maclay 's History of the Navy , Vol . I. , pp. 305-308 ; McMaster 's History , Vol . III. , pp. 255-259. %257 . The Long Embargo. %  --  The attack on the Chesapeake ought to have been followed by war . But Jefferson merely demanded reparation from Great Britain , and when Congress met in December , 1807 , asked for an embargo . The request was granted , and merchant vessels in all the ports of the United States were forbidden to sail for a foreign country till the President saw fit to suspend the law . The restriction was so sweeping and the damage done to American farmers , merchants , and shipowners so great , that the people began to evade it at once . They would send their vessels to New Orleans and stop at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , pork , rice , and lumber to St. Marys in Georgia and smuggle it over the river to Florida , or take it to the islands near Eastport in Maine and then smuggle it into New Brunswick . Because of this , more stringent embargo laws were passed , and finally , in 1809 , a " Force Act , " to compel obedience . But smuggling went on so openly that there was nothing to do but use troops or lift the embargo . In February , 1809 , accordingly , the embargo laws , after fourteen months ' duration , were repealed . Instead of them the Republicans enacted a Non-intercourse law which allowed the people to trade with all nations except England and France. 1 Footnote 1 : McMaster 's History , Vol . III. , pp. 279-338 ; Adams 's History , Vol . IV. , Chaps . 7 , 11 , 13 , 15. %258 . Jefferson refuses a Third Term. %  --  During 1806 , the states of New Jersey , Vermont , 2 Pennsylvania , New York , Rhode Island , Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President a third time . For a while he made no reply , but in December , 1807 , he declined , and gave this reason : " That I should lay down my charge at a proper period is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully . If some termination to the services of the Chief Magistrate be not fixed by the Constitution , or supplied by practice , his office , nominally four years , will in fact become for life ; and history shows how easily that degenerates into an inheritance . " This wise answer was heartily approved by the people all over the country , and with Washington 's similar action established a custom which has been generally followed ever since . Footnote 2 : Vermont was admitted into the Union in 1791 ( p. 243 ) . As Jefferson would not accept a third term , a caucus of Republican members of Congress met one evening at the Capitol in Washington and nominated James Madison and George Clinton . The Federalists held no caucus , but agreed among themselves to support C.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected , and were sworn into office March 4 , 1809 . Illustration : James Madison %259 . The Macon Bill ; Non-intercourse. %  --  When Congress met in 1809 one more effort was made to force France and England to respect our rights on the sea . Non-importation had failed . The embargo had failed . Non-intercourse had failed , and now in desperation they passed a law which at the time was called the " Macon Bill , " from the member of Congress who introduced it . This restored trade with France and England , but declared that if either would withdraw its Decrees or Orders , the United States would stop all trade with the other . %260 . Trickery of Napoleon. %  --  And now Napoleon came forward and assured the American minister that the Berlin and Milan Decrees should be recalled on November 1 , 1810 , provided the United States would restore non-intercourse with England . To this Madison agreed , and on November 1 , 1810 , issued a proclamation saying that unless Great Britain should , before February 1 , 1811 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop on that day . Great Britain did not recall her Orders , and in February , 1811 , we once more ceased to trade with her . Trade with France was resumed on November 1 , 1810 , and of course a great fleet of merchants went off to French ports . But they were no sooner there than the villainy of Napoleon was revealed , for on December 25 , by general order , every American ship in the French ports was seized , and $10,000,000 worth of American property was confiscated . He had not recalled his Decrees , but pretended to do so in order to get the American goods and provisions which he sorely needed . It is surprising how patient the Americans of those days were . But their patience as to Great Britain now gave out , and our minister at London was recalled in 1811 . This alarmed the British , who promptly began to take steps to keep the peace , and offered to make amends for the Leopard-Chesapeake outrage which had occurred four years before ( June , 1807 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck of the Chesapeake and did so ( June , 1812 ) . But the day for peaceful settlement was gone . The people were aroused and angry , and this feeling showed itself in many ways . %261 . The President and the Little Belt. %  --  In the early part of May , 1811 , a British frigate was cruising off the harbor of New York with her name Guerriere painted in large letters on her fore-topsail , and one day her captain stopped an American vessel as it was about to enter New York , and impressed a citizen of the United States . Three years earlier this outrage would have been made the subject of a proclamation . Now , the moment it was known at Washington , an order was sent to Captain Rogers of the frigate President to go to sea at once , search for the Guerriere , and demand the delivery of the man , Rogers was only too glad to go , and soon came in sight of a vessel which looked like the Guerriere ; but it was half-past eight o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle followed and lasted till the stranger became unmanageable , when the President stopped firing ; and the next morning Rogers found that his enemy was the British twenty-two-gun ship , Little Belt . %262 . The War Congress. %  --  Another way in which the anger of the people showed itself was in the election , in the autumn of 1810 , of a Congress which met in December , 1811 , fully determined to make war on Great Britain . In that Congress were two men who from that day on for forty years were great political leaders . One was John C. Calhoun of South Carolina ; the other was Henry Clay of Kentucky . Clay was made Speaker of the House of Representatives , and under his lead preparations were instantly begun for war , which was finally declared June 18 , 1812 . There was no Atlantic cable in those days . Had there been , it is very doubtful if war would have been declared ; for on June 23 , 1812 , five days after Congress authorized Madison to issue the proclamation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as set forth in the proclamation , were : 1 . Tampering with the Indians , and urging them to attack our citizens on the frontier . 2 . Interfering with our trade by the Orders in Council . 3 . Putting cruisers off our ports to stop and search our vessels . 4 . Impressing our sailors , of whom more than 6000 were in the British service . SUMMARY 1 . One reason which led Napoleon to sell Louisiana was his determination to go to war with England . This he did in 1803. 2 . Renewal of war in Europe made the United States again a neutral nation , and brought up the old quarrel over neutral rights . 3 . In 1806 , Napoleon , who was master of nearly all western Europe , cut off British trade with the continent . Great Britain in return declared , by an Order in Council , the coast from Brest to the Elbe blockaded ; that is , shut to neutral trade . 4 . Later in the year 1806 Napoleon retaliated with the Berlin Decree , declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another Order in Council ( 1807 ) , shut all European ports , under French control , to neutrals. 6 . Napoleon struck back with the Milan Decree . 7 . Our commerce was now attacked by both powers , and to force them to repeal their Decrees and Orders in Council , certain commercial restrictions were adopted by the United States . A. Non-importation , 1806 . B. Embargo , 1807-1809 . C. Non-intercourse , 1809. 8 . Each of them failed to have any effect , and in 1812 war was declared . Illustration %1803 .

Fighting on the Frontier. %  --  " Mr. Madison 's War , " as the Federalists delighted to call our war for commercial independence , opened with three armies in the field ready to invade and capture Canada . One under Hull , then governor of the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and march eastward through Canada . A second , under General Van Rensselaer , was to cross the Niagara River , take Queenstown , and join Hull , after which the two armies were to capture York , now Toronto , and go on eastward toward Montreal . Meantime , the third army , under Dearborn , was to go down Lake Champlain , and meet the troops under Hull and Van Rensselaer before Montreal . The three were then to capture Montreal and Quebec , and complete the conquest of Canada . The plan failed ; for Hull was driven from Canada , and surrendered his army and the whole Northwest , at Detroit ; Van Rensselaer , defeated at Queenstown , was unable even to get a footing in Canada ; while Dearborn , after reaching the northern boundary line of New York , stopped , and the year 1812 ended with nothing accomplished . The surrender of Hull filled the people with indignation , aroused their patriotism , and forced the government to gather a new army for the recapture of Detroit . The command was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness of Ohio , and in the dead of winter reached the shores of Lake Erie . General Winchester , who commanded part of the troops , was now called on to drive the British from Frenchtown , a little hamlet on the river Raisin , and ( in January , 1813 ) tried to do so . But the British and Indians came down on him in great numbers , and defeated and captured his army , after which the Indians were allowed to massacre and scalp the wounded . Illustration : The Canadian Frontier and Vicinity of Washington And now the British became aggressive , invaded Ohio , and attacked the Americans under Harrison at Fort Meigs , and then at Fort Stephenson , where Major Croghan and 160 men , with the aid of one small cannon , defeated and drove off 320 Canadians and Indians . %264 . Battle of Lake Erie. %  --  Again the Americans in turn became aggressive . Since the early winter , a young naval officer named Oliver Hazard Perry had been hard at work , with a gang of ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , and had used this green timber to build nine small vessels . With this fleet he sailed , in September , in search of the British squadron , which had been just as hastily built , and soon found it near Sandusky , Ohio . His own ship he had named the Lawrence , in honor of a gallant American captain who had been killed a few months before in a battle with an English frigate . As Perry saw the enemy in the distance , he flung to the breeze a blue flag on which was inscribed , " Do n't give up the ship " ( the dying order of Lawrence to his men ) , sailed down to meet the enemy , and fought the two largest British ships till the Lawrence was a wreck . Then , with his flag on his arm , he jumped into a boat , and amidst a shower of shot and bullets was rowed to the Niagara . Once on her deck , he again hastened to the attack , broke the British line of battle , and captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous as his victory : " We have met the enemy , and they are ours  --  two ships , two brigs , one schooner , and one sloop . " %265 . Battle of the Thames. %  --  Perry 's victory was a grand one . It gave him command of Lake Erie , and enabled him to carry Harrison 's soldiers over to Canada , where , on the Thames River , Harrison defeated the British and Indians . These two victories regained all that had been lost by the surrender of Hull . Along the New York border little was done during 1813 . The Americans made a raid into Canada , and to their shame burned York . The British attacked Sacketts Harbor and were driven off . The Americans sent an expedition down the St. Lawrence against Montreal , but the leaders got frightened and took refuge in northern New York . %266 . Campaign of 1814. %  --  In 1814 better officers were put in command , and before winter came the Americans , under Jacob Brown and Winfield Scott , had won the battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the British returned in force , burned Black Rock and Buffalo in revenge for the burning of York , and forced the Americans to leave Canada . The fighting along the Niagara River , by holding the army in that place , prevented the Americans from attacking Montreal , and enabled the British to gather a fleet on Lake Champlain , and send an army down from Quebec to invade New York state just as Burgoyne had in 1777 . But the land force was defeated by General Macomb at Plattsburg , while Thomas McDonough utterly destroyed the fleet in Plattsburg Bay . This was one of the great victories of the war . %267 . The Sea Fights. %  --  While our army on the frontier was accomplishing little , our war ships were winning victory after victory on the sea . At the opening of the war , our navy was the subject of English ridicule and contempt . We had sixteen ships ; she had 1200 . She laughed at ours as " fir-built things with a bit of striped bunting at their mastheads . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had destroyed her naval supremacy. 1 With the details of all these victories on the sea we will not concern ourselves . Yet a few must be mentioned because the fame of them still endures , and because they are examples of naval warfare in the days when the ships fought lashed together , and when the boarders , cutlass and pistol in hand , climbed over the bulwarks and met the enemy on his own deck , man to man . During 1812 the frigate Constitution , whose many victories won her the name of " Old Ironsides , " sank the Guerriere ; the United States captured and brought to port the Macedonian ; and the Wasp , a little sloop of eighteen guns , after the most desperate engagement of the whole war , captured the British sloop Frolic . Footnote 1 : One reason for the success of the American navy was the experience it had gained in the clash with France , and also in a war with Tripoli in 1801-1805 . At that time the Christian nations whose ships sailed the Mediterranean Sea were accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the north coast of Africa , under pain of having their ships seized and their sailors reduced to slavery . A dispute with the United States led to a war which gained for our ships the freedom of the Mediterranean . When these sloops were some two hundred feet apart , the Wasp opened with musketry and cannon . The sea , lashed into fury by a two days ' cyclone , was running mountain high . The vessels rolled till the muzzles of their guns dipped in the water . But the crews cheered lustily and the fight went on . When at last the crew of the Wasp boarded the Frolic , they were amazed to find that , save the man at the wheel and three officers who threw down their swords , not a living soul was visible . The crew had gone below to avoid the terrible fire of the Wasp . Scarcely was the battle over when the British frigate Poictiers bore down under a press of sail , recaptured what was left of the Frolic , and took the Wasp in addition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank the Peacock ; the Enterprise captured the Boxer off Portland , Maine . These and many more made up the list of American victories . But there were British victories also . The Argus , after destroying twenty-seven vessels in the English Channel , was taken by the Pelican ; the Essex , after a marvelous cruise around South America , was captured by two frigates . The Chesapeake was forced to strike to the Shannon . The Chesapeake was at anchor in Boston harbor , in command of James Lawrence , when the British frigate Shannon ran in and challenged her . Lawrence went out at once , and after a short , fierce fight was defeated and killed . As his men were carrying him below , mortally wounded , he cried , " Do n't give up the ship ! " words which Perry , as we have seen , afterwards put on his flag , and which his countrymen have never since forgotten. 1 Footnote 1 : On the naval war read Maclay 's History of the Navy , Part Third ; Roosevelt 's Naval War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70-108. %268 . The British blockade the Coast. %  --  Never , in the course of her existence , had England suffered such a series of defeats as we inflicted on her navy in 1812 and 1813 . The record of those years caused a tremendous excitement in Great Britain , all the vessels she could spare were sent over , and with the opening of 1814 , the whole coast of the United States was declared to be in a state of blockade. 1 In New England , Eastport ( Moose Island ) and Nantucket Island quickly fell . A British force went up the Penobscot to Hampden , and burned the Adams . The eastern half of Maine was seized , and Stonington , in Connecticut , was bombarded . Footnote 1 : All except New England had been blockaded since 1812 ; and in 1813 the coast of Chesapeake Bay had been ravaged. %269 . Burning of Washington. %  --  Further down the coast a great fleet and army from Bermuda , under General Ross and Admiral Cockburn , came up the Chesapeake Bay , landed in Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hamlet near the capital , the Americans made a feeble show of resistance , but soon fled ; and about dark on an August night , 1814 , a detachment of the British reached Washington , marched to the Capitol , fired a volley through the windows , entered , and set fire to the building . When the fire began to burn brightly , Ross and Cockburn led the troops to the President 's house , which was sacked and burned . Next morning the torch was applied to the Treasury building and to the Departments of State and War . Several private houses and a printing office were also destroyed before the British began a hasty retreat to the Chesapeake. 1 Footnote 1 : Adams 's History , Vol . VIII. , Chaps . 5 , 6 ; McMaster 's History , Vol . IV. , pp. 135-148 ; Memoirs of Dolly Madison , Chap . 8. %270 . Baltimore attacked. %  --  Once on the bay , the army was hurried on board the ships and carried to Baltimore , where for a day and a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ross having been killed , Cockburn reembarked and sailed away to Halifax . Footnote 2 : Francis S. Key , an American held prisoner on one of the British ships , composed the words of The Star-Spangled Banner while watching the bombardment. %271 . The Victory at New Orleans. %  --  The army was taken to Jamaica in order that it might form part of one of the greatest war expeditions England had ever fitted out . Fifty of the finest ships her navy could furnish , mounting 1000 guns and carrying on their decks 20,000 veteran soldiers and sailors , had been quietly assembled at Jamaica during the autumn of 1814 , and in November sailed for New Orleans . News of this intended attack had reached Madison , and he had given the duty of defending New Orleans to Andrew Jackson of Tennessee , one of the most extraordinary men our country has produced . The British landed at the entrance of Lake Borgne in December , 1814 , and hurried to the banks of the Mississippi . But Jackson was more than a match for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hastened from the city and with all possible speed threw up a line of rude earthworks , and waited to be attacked . This line the British under General Pakenham attacked on January 8 , 1815 , and were twice driven back with frightful loss of life . Never had such a defeat been inflicted on a British army . The loss in killed , wounded , and missing was 2036 men . Jackson lost seventy-one men . Five British regiments which entered the battle 3000 strong reported 1750 men killed , wounded , and missing. 1 Footnote 1 : Adams 's History , Vol . VIII. , Chaps . 12-14 ; McMaster , Vol . IV. , pp. 182-190 %272 . Peace. %  --  For a month after this defeat the British lingered in their camp . At last , in February , the army departed to attack a fort on Mobile Bay . The fort was taken , and two days later the news of peace put an end to war . The treaty was signed at Ghent in December , 1814 ; but it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty not a word was said about the impressment of our sailors , nor about the right of search , nor about the Orders in Council , nor about inciting the Indians to attack our frontier , all of which Madison had declared to be causes of the war . Yet we gained much . Our naval victories made us the equal of any maritime power , while at home the war did far more to arouse a national sentiment , consolidate the union , and make us a nation than any event which had yet occurred . SUMMARY 1 . The land war may be divided into : A. War along the frontier . B. War along the Atlantic coast . C. War along the Gulf coast . 2 . War along the Canadian frontier resulted in a gain to neither side . In 1812 Americans were beaten at Detroit and at Queenstown , and failed to invade Canada . In 1813 the Americans were beaten at Frenchtown , but defeated the Canadians at Forts Meigs and Stephenson , and at the Thames River , and recovered Detroit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed in the attempt to take Montreal . In 1814 the battles of Chippewa and Lundys Lane were won , and Fort Erie was taken . But the British burned Buffalo and Black Rock and drove the Americans out of Canada . McDonough won the battle of Lake Champlain. 3 . During 1812-13 the British blockaded the coast from the east end of Long Island south to the Mississippi . New England was not blockaded till 1814 . Then depredations began , and during the year Washington was taken and partly burned , and Baltimore attacked . 4 . Later in the year the British , after the attack on Baltimore , went south , and early in 1815 were beaten by Jackson at New Orleans . 5 . The navy won a series of successive victories .

CHAPTER XIX PROGRESS OF OUR COUNTRY BETWEEN 1790 AND 1815 %273. % Twenty-five years had now gone by since Washington was inaugurated , and in the course of these years our country had made wonderful progress . In 1790 the United States was bounded west by the Mississippi River . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discovered , and the Oregon country had been explored to the Pacific . In 1790 the inhabitants of the United States numbered less than four millions . In 1815 they were eight millions . In 1790 there were but thirteen states in the Union , and two territories . In 1815 there were eighteen states and five territories . %274 . The Three Streams of Westward Emigration. %  --  Sparse as was the population in 1789 , the rage for emigration had already seized the people , and long before 1790 the emigrants were pouring over the mountains in three great streams . One , composed of New England men , was pushing along the borders of Lake Champlain and up the Mohawk valley . A second , chiefly from Pennsylvania and Virginia , was spreading itself over the rich valleys of what are now West Virginia and Kentucky . Further south a third stream of emigrants , mostly from Virginia and North Carolina , had gone over the Blue Ridge Mountains , and was creeping down the valley of the Tennessee River. 1 Footnote 1 : For an account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see The First Century of the Republic , pp. 211-238 . For months each year the Ohio was dotted with flatboats . One observer saw fifty leave Pittsburg in five weeks . Another estimated that ten thousand emigrants floated by Marietta during 1788 . As this never-ending stream of population spread over the wilderness , building cabins , felling trees , clearing the land , and driving off the game , the Indians took alarm and determined to expel them . %275 . The Indian War. %  --  During the summer of 1786 the tribes whose hunting grounds lay in eastern Tennessee and Kentucky took the warpath , sacked and burned a little settlement on the Holston , and spread terror along the whole frontier . But the settlers in their turn rose , and inflicted on the Indians a signal punishment . One expedition from Tennessee burned three Cherokee towns . Another from Kentucky crossed the Ohio , penetrated the Indian country , burned eight towns , and laid waste hundreds of acres of standing corn . Had the Indians been left to themselves , they would , after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still held the frontier post at Detroit , roused them , and in 1790 they were again at work , ravaging the country north of the Ohio . They rushed down on Big Bottom ( northwest of Marietta ) and swept it from the face of the earth . St. Clair , who was governor of the Northwest Territory , sent against them an expedition which won some success  --  just enough to enrage and not enough to cow them . %276 . St. Clair ; Wayne. %  --  Not a settlement north of the Ohio was now safe , and had it not been for the men of Kentucky , who came to the relief , and in two expeditions held the Indians in check till the Federal government could act , every one of them would have been destroyed . The plan of the Secretary of War was to build a chain of forts from Cincinnati to Lake Michigan , and late in 1791 St. Clair set off to begin the work . But the Indians surprised him on a branch of the Wabash River , and inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . Public opinion now forced him to resign his command , which was given to Anthony Wayne , who , after two years of careful preparation , crushed the Indian power at the falls of the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio . The next year , 1795 , a treaty was made at Greenville , by which the Indians gave up all claim to the soil south and east of a boundary line drawn from what is now Cleveland southwest to the Ohio River . %277 . Kentucky and Vermont become States. %  --  These Indian wars almost stopped emigration to the country north of the Ohio , though not into Kentucky or Tennessee . For several years past the people of the District of Kentucky had been desirous to come into the Union , but had been unable to make terms with Virginia , to which Kentucky belonged . At last consent was obtained and the application made to Congress . But the Kentuckians were slave owners , were identified with Southern and Western interests , and cared little for the commercial interests of the East , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where each state had two votes , it was decided to offset those of Kentucky by admitting the Eastern state of Vermont . What is now Vermont was once the property of New Hampshire , was settled by people from New England under town rights granted by the governor of New Hampshire , and was called " New Hampshire Grants . " In 1764 , however , the governor of New York obtained a royal order giving New York jurisdiction over the Grants on the ground that in 1664 the possessions of the Duke of York extended to the Connecticut River . Then began a controversy which was still raging bitterly when the Revolution opened , and the Green Mountain Boys asked recognition as a state and admission into the Congress , a request which the other states were afraid to grant lest by so doing they should offend New York . Thereupon the people chose delegates to a convention ( in 1777 ) , which issued a declaration of independence , declared " New Connecticut , alias Vermont , " a state , and made a constitution . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kentucky Vermont was admitted into the Union . As she was a state with governor , legislature , and constitution , she came in at once . Kentucky had to make a constitution , and so was not admitted till 1792 . Four years later ( 1796 ) Congress admitted Tennessee . Illustration : THE UNITED STATES AND TERRITORIES July 4 , 1801 . TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER INDEPENDENCE %278 . The New Territories ; Ohio becomes a State. %  --  The quieting of the Indians by Wayne in 1794 , the opening of the Mississippi River to American trade by Spain in 1795 , coupled with cheap lands and low taxes , caused another rush of population into the Ohio valley . Between 1795 and 1800 so many came that the Northwest Territory was cut in twain and the new territory of Indiana was organized in 1800 . The acceptance by Spain in 1795 of 31 deg. north latitude as the boundary of the Floridas , gave the United States control of the greater part of old West Florida , which in 1798 was organized as the Mississippi Territory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western development . In 1800 Congress , under the influence of William Henry Harrison , the first delegate from the Northwest Territory , made a radical change in its land policy . Up to that time every settler must pay cash . After 1800 he could buy on credit , pay in four annual installments , and west of the Muskingum River could purchase as little as 320 acres . This credit system led to another rush into the Ohio valley , and so many people entered the Northwest Territory , that in 1803 the southern part of it was admitted into the Union as the state of Ohio . Illustration : Cincinnati in 18101 Footnote 1 : From an old print . In 1802 Georgia ceded her western lands , which were added to the Mississippi Territory . From the Louisiana purchase there was organized in 1804 the territory of Orleans , and in 1805 the territory of Louisiana ( see p. 247 ) . In 1805 , also , the lower peninsula of Michigan was cut off from Indiana and organized as Michigan Territory . In 1809 the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1812 the territory of Orleans became the state of Louisiana . The third census showed that in 1810 the population of the United States was 7,200,000 , and that of these over 1,000,000 were in the states and territories west of the Alleghanies. %279 . Indian Troubles ; Battle of Tippecanoe. %  --  As the settlers north of the Ohio moved further westward , and as more came in , their farms and settlements touched the Indian boundary line . In Indiana , where , save a strip sixty miles wide along the Ohio River , and a few patches scattered over the territory , every foot of soil was owned by the Indians , this crowding led to serious consequences . The Indians first grew restive . Then , under the lead of Tecumthe , or Tecumseh , they founded a league or confederacy against the whites , and built a town on Tippecanoe Creek , just where it enters the Wabash . Finally , when Harrison , who was governor of Indiana Territory , bought the Indian rights to the Wabash valley , the confederacy refused to recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched against them , and in 1811 fought the battle of Tippecanoe and burned the Indian village . For a time it was thought the victory was as signal as that of Wayne . But the Indians were soon back on the old site , and in our second war with Great Britain they sided with the British . Illustration : The United States and Territories in 1813 %280 . Industrial Progress. %  --  In 1789 our country had no credit and no revenue , and was burdened with a great debt which very few people believed would ever be paid . But when the government called in all the old worthless Continental money and certificates and gave the people bonds in exchange for them , when it began to lay taxes and pay its debts , when it had power to regulate trade , when the National Bank was established and the merchants were given bank bills that would pass at their face value all over the country , business began to revive . The money which the people had been hiding away for years was brought out and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and companies were founded to manufacture woolen cloth and cotton cloth , to build bridges , to construct turnpike roads , and to cut canals . Between 1789 and 1795 the first carpet was woven in the United States , the first broom made from broom corn , the first cotton factory opened , the first gold and silver coins of the United States were struck at the mint , the first newspaper was printed in the territory northwest of the Ohio River , the first printing press was set up in Tennessee , the first geography of the United States was published , and daily newspapers were issued in Baltimore and Boston . It was during this period that a hunter named Guinther discovered anthracite coal in Pennsylvania ; that Whitney invented the cotton gin ; that Samuel Slater built the first mill for making cotton yarns ; that Eli Terry started the manufacture of clocks as a business ; that cotton sewing thread was first manufactured in the United States at Pawtucket , R.I. ; and that the first turnpike in our country was completed . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . %281 . The Period of Commercial and Agricultural Prosperity. %  --  Just at this time came another change of great importance . Till 1793 we had scarcely any commerce with the West Indies . England would not allow our vessels to go to her islands . Neither would Spain , nor France , except to a very limited degree . It was the policy of these three countries to confine such trade as far as possible to their own merchants . But in 1793 France , you remember , made war on England and opened her West Indian ports to all neutral nations . The United States was a neutral , and our merchants at once began to trade with the islanders . What these people wanted was lumber , flour , grain , provisions , salt pork , and fish . All this led to a demand , first , for ships , then for sailors , and then for provisions and lumber  --  to the benefit of every part of the country except the South . New England was the lumber , fishing , shipbuilding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , lumber , and carried on a great commerce as well . So profitable was it to raise wheat , that in many parts of Virginia the people stopped raising tobacco and began to make flour , and soon made Virginia the second flour-producing state in the Union . Until after 1795 the people of the Western States were cut off from this trade . But in that year the treaty with Spain was made , and the people of the West were then allowed to float their produce to New Orleans and there sell it or ship it to the West Indies . Kentucky then became a flour-producing state . As a consequence of all this , people stopped putting their money into roads and canals and manufactures , and put it into farming , shipbuilding , and commerce . Between 1793 and 1807 , therefore , our country enjoyed a period of commercial and agricultural prosperity . But with 1807 came another change . In that year the embargo was laid , and for more than fifteen months no vessels were allowed to leave the ports of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people had been so much engaged in commerce and agriculture , that they had not begun to manufacture . In 1807 all the blankets , all the woolen cloth , cotton cloth , carpets , hardware , china , glass , crockery , knives , tools , and a thousand other things used every day were made for us in Great Britain . Cotton grown in the United States was actually sent to England to be made into cloth , which was then carried back to the United States to be used . %282 . " Infant Manufactures . " %  --  As the embargo prevented our ships going abroad and foreign ships coming to us , these goods could no longer be imported . The people must either go without or make them at home . They decided , of course , to make them at home , and all patriotic citizens were called on to help , which they did in five ways . First , in each of the cities and large towns people met and formed a " Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Manufactures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them , and in so doing to take a pledge not to buy or use or wear any article of foreign make , provided it could be made in this country . In the second place , these societies for the encouragement of domestic manufactures , " infant manufactures , " as they were called , offered prizes for the best piece of homemade linen , homemade cotton cloth , or woolen cloth . In the third place , they started " exchanges , " or shops , in the cities and large towns , to which anybody who could knit mittens or socks , or make boots and shoes or straw bonnets , or spin flax or wool , or make anything else that the people needed , could send them to be sold . In the fourth place , men who had money came forward and formed companies to erect mills and factories for the manufacture of all sorts of things . If you were to see the acts passed by the legislatures of the states between 1808 and 1812 , you would find that very many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thread works , factories for making cotton and woolen cloth , oilcloth , boots , shoes , rope . In the fifth place , the legislatures of the states passed resolutions asking their members to wear clothes made of material produced in the United States , 1 offered bounties for the best wool , and exempted the factories from taxation and the mill hands from militia and jury duty . Footnote 1 : McMaster 's History of the People of the United States , Vol . III. , pp. 496-509 . Thus encouraged , manufactures sprang up in the North , and became so numerous that in 1810 , when the census of population was taken , Congress ordered that statistics of manufactures should be collected at the same time . It was then found that the value of the goods manufactured in the United States in 1810 was $173,000,000. %283 . Internal Improvements : Roads ; Canals ; Steamboats. %  --  But there was yet another great change for the better which took place between 1790 and 1815 . We have seen how during this quarter of a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in number , how new states and territories were made , how agriculture and commerce prospered , and how manufactures arose . It is now time to see how the people improved the means of interstate commerce and communication . You will remember that in 1790 there were no bridges over the great rivers of the country , that the roads were very bad , that all journeys were made on horseback or in stagecoaches or in boats , and that it was not then possible to go as far in ten hours as we can now go in one . You will remember , also , that the people were moving westward in great numbers . As the people thus year by year went further and further westward , a demand arose for good roads to connect them with the East . The merchants on the seaboard wanted to send them hardware , clothing , household goods , farming implements , and bring back to the seaports the potash , lumber , flour , skins , and grain with which the settlers paid for these things . If they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads were bad , the difficulty of getting merchandise to the frontier would make them too costly . People living in the towns and cities along the seaboard were no longer content with the old-fashioned slow way of travel . They wanted to get their letters more often , make their journeys and have their freight carried more quickly. 1 Footnote 1 : McMaster 's History of the People of the United States , Vol . III. , pp. 462-465 . About 1805 , therefore , men began to think of reviving the old idea of canals , which had been abandoned in 1793 , and one of these canal companies , the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal , applied to Congress for aid . This brought up the question of a system of internal improvements at national expense , and Albert Gallatin , the Secretary of the Treasury , was asked to send a plan for such a system to Congress , which he did . Congress never approved it . %284 . The National Pike. %  --  Public sentiment , however , led to the commencement of a highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cumberland Road . When Ohio was admitted into the Union as a state in 1803 , Congress promised that part of the money derived from the sale of land in Ohio should be used to build a road from some place on the Ohio River to tide water . By 1806 the money so set apart amounted to $12,000 , and with this was begun the construction of a broad pike from Cumberland ( on the Potomac ) in Maryland to Wheeling ( on the Ohio ) in West Virginia. 1 Footnote 1 : McMaster 's History , Vol . III. , pp. 469-470 . Illustration : Phoenix1 Footnote 1 : From an oil painting. %285 . Steamboats. %  --  This increasing demand for cheap transportation now made it possible for Fulton to carry into successful operation an idea he had long had in mind . For twenty years past inventors had been exhibiting steamboats . James Rumsey had exhibited one on the Potomac . John Fitch had shown one on the Delaware in 1787 . ( See p. 190 . ) In 1804 Robert Fulton exhibited a steamboat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steam scow on the Delaware River at Philadelphia ; and John Stevens crossed the Hudson from Hoboken to New York in a steamboat of his own construction . In 1806 Stevens built another , the Phoenix. 1 Footnote 1 : Preble 's History of Steam Navigation , pp. 35-66 ; Thurston 's Robert Fulton in Makers of America Series . These men were ahead of their time , and it was not till the August day , 1807 , when Robert Fulton made his experiment on the Hudson , that the era of the steamboat opened . His vessel , called the Clermont , made the trip up the river from New York to Albany in thirty-two hours . Illustration : Model of the Clermont2 Footnote 2 : Made from the original drawings , and now in the National Museum . Then the usefulness of the invention was at last appreciated , and in 1808 a line of steam vessels went up and down the Hudson . In 1809 Stevens sent his Phoenix by sea to Philadelphia and ran it on the Delaware . Another steamboat was on the Raritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1811 a boat steamed from Pittsburg to New Orleans , and in 1812 steam ferryboats plied between what is now Jersey City and New York , and between Philadelphia and Camden. 3 Footnote 3 : On the early steamboats see McMaster 's History of the People of the United States , Vol . III. , pp. 486-494. %286 . The Currency ; the Mint. %  --  Quite as marvelous was the change which in five and twenty years had taken place in money matters . When the Constitution became law in 1789 , there were no United States coins and no United States bills or notes in circulation . There was no such thing as a national currency . Except the gold and silver pieces of foreign nations , there was no money which would pass all over our country . To-day a treasury note , a silver certificate , a national bank bill , is received in payment of a debt in any state or territory . In 1789 the currency was foreign coins and state paper . But the Constitution forbade the states ever to make any more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear out by use , the time was near when there would be no currency except foreign coins . To prevent this , Congress in 1791 ordered a mint to be established at Philadelphia , and in 1792 named the coins to be struck , and ordered that whoever would bring gold or silver to the mint should have it made into coins without cost to him . This was free coinage . As both gold and silver were to be coined , the currency was to be bimetallic , or of two metals. 1 The ratio of silver and gold was 15 to 1 . That is , fifteen pounds ' weight of silver must be made into as many dollars ' worth of coins as one pound of gold . The silver coins were to be the dollar , half and quarter dollar , dime and half dime ; the gold were to be the eagle , half eagle , and quarter eagle . Out of copper were to be struck cents and half cents . As some years must elapse before our national coins could become abundant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The first silver coin was struck in 1794 ; the first gold , in 1795 ; the first cent and half cent , in 1793. %287 . " Federal Money . " %  --  The appearance of the new money was followed by another change for the better . In colonial days the merchants and the people expressed the debts they owed , or the value of the goods they sold , in pounds , shillings , and pence , or in Spanish dollars . During the Revolution , and after it , this was continued , although the Continental Congress always kept its accounts , and made its appropriations , in dollars . But when the people began to see dollars , half dollars , and dimes bearing the words " United States of America , " they knew that there really was a national coinage , or " Federal money , " as they called it , and between 1795 and 1798 , one state after another ordered its treasurer to use Federal money instead of pounds , shillings , and pence ; and thereafter in laying taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expressed in dollars and cents . The merchants and the people were much slower in adopting the new terms ; but they came at last into general use . %288 . Rise of the State Banks. %  --  Had the people been forced to depend on the United States mint for money wherewith to pay the butcher and the baker and the shoemaker , they would not have been able to make their payments , for the machinery at the mint was worked by hand , and the number of dimes and quarters turned out each year was small . But they were not , for as soon as confidence was restored , banks chartered by the states sprang up in the chief cities in the East , and as each issued notes , the people had all the currency they wanted . In 1790 , when Congress established the National Bank , there were but four state banks in the whole country : one in Philadelphia , one in New York , one in Boston , and one in Baltimore . By 1800 there were twenty-six , in 1805 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that year ( 1811 ) the charter of the National Bank expired , and as Congress would not renew it , many more state banks were created , each hoping to get a part of the business formerly done by the National Bank . Such was the " mania , " as it was called , for banks , that the number rose from eighty-eight in 1811 , to two hundred and eight in 1814 , which was far more than the people really needed . Nevertheless , all went well until the British came up Chesapeake Bay and burned Washington . Then the banks in that part of the country boxed up all their gold and silver and sent it away , lest the British should get it . This forced them to " suspend specie payments " ; that is , refuse to give gold or silver in exchange for their own paper .

No Small Change. %  --  The consequences of the suspension were very serious . In the first place , all the small silver coins , the dimes , half dollars , and quarter dollars , disappeared at once , and the people were again forced to do as they had done in 1789 , and use " ticket money . " All the cities and towns , great and small , printed one , two , three , six and one fourth , twelve and one half , twenty-five , and fifty-cent tickets , and sold them to the people for bank notes . Steamboats , stagecoaches , and manufacturing companies , merchants , shopkeepers  --  in fact , all business men  --  did the same . In the second place , as the banks would not exchange specie for their notes , people who did not know all about a bank would not take its bills except at very much less than their face value . That is , a dollar bill of a Philadelphia bank was not worth more than ninety cents in paper money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This state of things greatly increased the cost of travel and business between the states , and prevented the government using the money collected at the seaports in the East to pay debts due in the West. 1 Footnote 1 : McMaster 's History , Vol . IV. , pp. 280-318. %290 . The Second Bank of the United States. %  --  Lest this state of affairs should occur again , Congress , exercising its constitutional " power to regulate the currency , " chartered a second National Bank in 1816 , and modeled it after the old one . Again the parent bank was at Philadelphia ; but the capital was now $35,000,000 . Again the public money might be deposited in the bank and its branches , which could be established wherever the directors thought proper . Again the bank could issue paper money to be received by the government in payment of taxes , land , and all debts . The Republicans had always denied the right of Congress to charter a bank . But the question was never tested until 1819 , when Maryland attempted to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case reached the Supreme Court of the United States , which decided that a state could not tax a corporation chartered by Congress ; and that Congress had power to charter anything , even a bank . SUMMARY 1 . The census returns of 1790 showed that population was going west along three highways . 2 . As a result of this movement , Vermont ( 1791 ) , Kentucky ( 1792 ) , Tennessee ( 1796 ) , and Ohio ( 1803 ) entered the Union . 3 . The population of the country increased from 3,380,000 in 1790 to 7,200,000 in 1810 ; and the area from about 828,000 to 2,000,000 square miles . 4 . The period 1790-1810 was one of marked industrial progress , and of great commercial and agricultural prosperity . It was during this time that manufactures arose , that many roads and highways and bridges were built , and that the steamboat was introduced . 5 . A national mint had been established .

Monroe inaugurated. %  --  The administration of Madison ended on March 4 , 1817 , and on that day James Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins were sworn into office . They had been nominated at Washington in February , 1816 , by a caucus of Republican members of Congress , for no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had as yet been thought of . The Federalists did not hold a caucus ; but it was understood that their electors would vote for Rufus King for President. 1 Footnote 1 : In 1816 there were nineteen states in the Union ( Indiana having been admitted in that year ) , and of these Monroe carried sixteen and King three . The inauguration took place in the open air for the first time since 1789 . Illustration : on the right of the previous paragraph , with caption " James Monroe " %292 . Death of the Federalist Party. %  --  The inauguration of Monroe opens a new era of great interest and importance in our history . From 1793 to 1815 , the questions which divided the people into Federalists and Republicans were all in some way connected with foreign countries . They were neutral rights , Orders in Council , French Decrees , impressment , embargoes , non-intercourse acts , the conduct of England , the insolence of the French Directory , the triumphs and the treachery of Napoleon . Every Federalist sympathized with England ; every Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of the war in 1815 , all this ended . Napoleon was sent to St. Helena . Europe was at peace , and there was no longer any foreign question to divide the people into Federalists and Republicans . This division , therefore , ceased to exist , and after 1816 the Federalist party never put up a candidate for the presidency . It ceased to exist not only as a national but even as a state party , and for twelve years there was one great party , the Republican , or , as it soon began to be called , the Democratic . %293 . The " Era of Good Feeling . " %  --  A sure sign of the disappearance of party and party feeling was seen very soon after Monroe was inaugurated . In May , 1817 , he left Washington with the intention of visiting and inspecting all the forts and navy yards along the eastern seaboard and the Great Lakes . Beginning at Baltimore , he went to New York , then to Boston , and then to Portland ; where he turned westward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made his way to Ogdensburg , where he took a boat to Sacketts Harbor and Niagara , whence he went to Buffalo , and Detroit , and then back to Washington . Wherever he went , the people came by thousands to greet him ; but nowhere was the reception so hearty as in New England , the stronghold of Federalism . " The visit of the President , " said a Boston newspaper , " seems wholly to have allayed the storms of party . People now meet in the same room who , a short while since , would scarcely pass along the same street " . Another said that since Monroe 's arrival at Boston " party feeling and animosities have been laid aside , and but one great national feeling has animated every class of our citizens . " So it was everywhere , and when , therefore , the Boston Sentinel called the times the " era of good feeling , " the whole country took up the expression and used it , and the eight years of Monroe 's administration have ever since been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ %  --  Though all was quiet and happy within our borders , events of great importance were happening along our northern , western , and southern frontier . During the war with England , the Creek Indians in Georgia and Alabama had risen against the white settlers and were beaten and driven out by Jackson and forced to take refuge with the Seminoles in Florida . As they had been the allies of England , they fully expected that when peace was made , England would secure for them the territory of which Jackson had deprived them . When England did not do this , they grew sullen and savage , and in 1817 began to make raids over the border , run off cattle and murder men , women , and children . In order to stop these depredations , General Jackson was sent to the frontier , and utterly disregarding the fact that the Creeks and Seminoles were on Spanish soil , he entered West Florida , took St. Marks and Pensacola , destroyed the Indian power , and hanged two English @#//       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
