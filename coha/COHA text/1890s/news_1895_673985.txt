txt amining a witness , Mr. Delany shotsted at Mr. Mitchell : " Have you considered this question in the Committee on Contested Seats ? " " We have , " said Mr. Mitchell . " Have you decided on your report ? " " We have , " answered Mr. Mitchell to this very unnecessary question . " Did you issue any notice that a meeting of the committee was to be held at which a decision was to be made ? " " Me did . " " Well , " said Mr. Delany , " one of the members of the committee told me this afternoon that lie knew nothing about it . " Then Mr. Delany stalked up and down the aisle like a tiger in a cage , while Mr. Mitchell explained that the committee had decided the contest in the only way that e as possioie tamer the circumbtancs . When Delany ' got the floor he " orated " in the fiercest fashion . He walked about a mile in front of the platform in the course of his athletic effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a meeting of the Tammany Hall General Committee were on hand to do the cannonading against the will of the people of the Eleventh Assembly District . His reference was to Col. Fellows , who looked rather surprised , for he was there for an entirely different purpose . " Men who have left Tammany Hall before have been accused of not having fought their grievances out within the organization . I want to call your attention to the fact that we have fought this matter out from beginning to end within the organize ' tion , and on your verdict must depend the question whether we will have to go outside and settle this question at the polls on Nov. 5 . " " Sore head ! Sore head ! " shouted a man in the front of the hall . " Hoora for Delaney ! " shouted a man in the back of the hall . Delany told about the primary in the Eleventh District . He said that they had consented to the selection of James J. Grady as an Inspector . They thought a physician of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the primary that It was I James O'Grady , and not James J. Grady , who was the Inspector . " O'Grady ? , " began Delany . Two or three men in the Eleventh District sitting delegation jumped to their feet . One , presumably O'Grady , yelled : " Hey ! How do you spell your name ? " Another shouted " You do n't spell your name like your father 's . " " I do . I know what my name is . " " Do you ? Well , your father 's name is up on the sign yet . " All this was going on amid howling , yelling , and cheering . Ex-Senator M. C. Murphy rose in his place , claimed a point of order , and was recognized by Chairman Peters . " The remarks on both sides are disgrace ' ful to this committee and the Democratic Party . " " Your point is well taken . There must be order , " said Mr. Peters . When Mr. Peters started to recognize another man who wanted to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purposely . Then he went on to tell about O'Grady , who , he said , had signed his name as James J. Grady to the returns filed in the County Clerk 's office . " And that , " said Mr. Delany , " is a violation of the law that the District Attorney , who is here , to do the cannonading against us , should look into . " ' The plan of the leaders , " went on Mr. Delany. " was to stand together . They have done so . The leaders have kept in power all the worn-out political hacks , and have called that reorganization . " Sneers and jeers came from Dalton 's followers . Hah ! " shouted back Delany . " I am laughing at your chances on the 5th of November . " " Charlie Steckler , " said a voice in the crowd . " Oh ! go and join the State Democracy , " said another . " Do not let it be understood , " said Delany , " that there is on the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter here leave all hope behind . ' " Delany was cheered heartily by his followers when he had finished , and then the vote was taken on the report , and it was unanimously adopted . No fuss was made about the Thirty-fourth District . As soon as the report was adopted , Delany marched down to the plaform again and shouted : " On behalf of the Eleventh Assembly District contestants , I announce that we leave Tammany Hall . " Cheers and hisses followed . Those who had expected to see a lot of vacant seats were disappointed . Delany and , perhaps , 200 of his men went out very quietly , but the exodus did not appear to make much of a difference in the crowd . Once outside , the bolters cheered Delany heartily and marched back to the Eleventh District in a body . They will run a ticket for the Assembly and for the Senate in the Sixteenth District . They will meet to-night to make arrangements . This incident being disposed of , Col. Fellows offered the following resolution : ' rho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admirable platform of principles adopted by the Democracy of the State of New-York at its recent convention , and pledges to the candidates placed thereon its hearty and enthusiastic support . Col. Fellows was called to the platform to speak to the resolution . He dealt chiefly with the excise plank . " That Government which rules the least is ruled best , was the maxim of our forefathers , " he said . " The issues of this campaign are plainly made up . I take exception to the remarks made by some Democrats that the Republican Convention was cowardly in its handling of the excise question . It was bold , aggressive , intolerant , and proscriptive . It insists that the present laws should be maintained for all time , although they do not meet the wishes of the people . That was the position taken by Warner Miller , said in so many words . " Col Feliows then discussed the question from the standpoint of natural rights . The right to drink what a man wanted was a natural right , he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of securing peace to the people after 1 o'clock in the morning , and securing an orderly Sunday . " If that is done , I hold that there is no further power in government to restrict this natural right . Mr. Miller says that he will maintain these laws . I have been in Herkimer . Mr. Miller is the Herkimer statesman . Mr. Miller never knew the Sunday that visitors to Herkimer and its inhabitants could not get liquor in the licensed saloons of that town , and yet Herkimer is a most orderly place on Sundays and every other day . What kind of Sundays does Mr. Miller want ? Does he want the Sunday of Syracuse ? Everybody knows that everybody . can get all that he wants to drink on Sunday in Syracuse . Does he want the Sunday of Buffalo , of Rochester , or of our sister city of Brooklyn . in which you can get all that you want to drink ? What kind of a Sunday is it that he wants ? Is it the kind that there is in Herkimer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New-York . " I appeal from Warner Miller and the proscription of the Republican Party to that great Master who declared that the Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath . I want to tell Warner Miller that you can never persuade the moral sentiment of this State that that which you can do on the six days of the week under the sanction and the protection of the law becomes a , serious crime if you do it on Sunday . " Referring to what Dr. Parkhurst had said about the Democratic platform , Col. Fellows said : " When I read what that stern , strong man had said I wondered if he could have read the platform . We declare that we shall have a quiet and orderly Sunday . " Col. Fellows then spoke of his great respect for Sunday , and pointed out that the laws proposed by the Democratic Party would carefully conserve peace and good order on that day .                   @ @
