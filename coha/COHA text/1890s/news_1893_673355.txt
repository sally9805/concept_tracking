txt The twenty-fifth anniversary of Cornell University , which will be celebrated at Ithaca to-day , is an event in education that suggests interesting comparisons . Founded at a time when scientific studies occupied subordinate places in courses of study , and . receiving from the State a large gift under the Morrill land grant , Cornell not only took an eminent part in an educational movement that has gradually revolutionized college courses everywhere , but entered upon a work which has given to young men in this State exceptional opportunities for free instruction of the highest class . It is not easy now io understand what at the time was the full meaning of the step taken , or what was the courage shown by EZRA . CORNELL and ANDREW D. WHITE when they set aside the old and honored methods and . began their laborious task of establishing a university with new ones on those bleak and rail-fenced. farm lands that now make up , perhaps , the most picturesque campus in the country . EZRA CORNELL aimed to found . " an institution where any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion of twenty-five years devoted to the fulfillment of this purpose shows with what energy and . intelligence his work has been carried . forward . Cornell is now at the highest point of usefulness and prosperity that it has ever reached . Beginning with only 26 teachers of all grades , it has now 142 , While the number of students has advanced from 412 to 1,700 , and . the total university expenses annually have become $501,458 . The idea of EZRA CORNELL that the university he was founding should have for its prime purpose the promotion of education that would be useful in practical life has dominated the whole career of Cornell . Nothing so vividly shows this as a table printed in President ScauRmAx 's annual report just issued , giving the distribution of students in the several courses for the whole twenty-five years . Out of the 412 students in 1868 there were 234 pursuing what are known as general courses , or those leading to the degrees of arts , philosophy , and science , while only 96 were pursuing the technical courses , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus giving ' them professions as well as degrees . For the year just passed , these figures have greatly changed in their proportions , for out of 1,700 students only 433 are taking the general courses , while 784 are taking the technical ones . In other words , the general courses have not quite doubled their students , but the technical ones are now pursued by more than eight times ae many students as in 1868 . Another point on which a comment should be made is the growth in the number of students from this State educated free of tuition , according to the terms under which the Western lands were obtained . In 1868 the average number for the year was only 55 . It is now 429 . President SCHURMAN points out that in educating New-York students free the university bestows upon the State a financial benefaction annually of $160,138 . Last year an appropriation of $50,000 made by the Legislature was the first gift of money the university ever had received from the State , but this was to aid . the College of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of State students at Cornell , reckoning by the averages for each year , was nearly 5,000 . The Cornell Western lands cost the State nothing . They came to it from the Federal Government , and hence this sum of $50,000 practically represents the State 's outlay from its own Treasury thus far for the education of these 5,000 students .
