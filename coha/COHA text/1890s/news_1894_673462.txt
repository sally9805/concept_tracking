txt John I. Davenport may as well pack up his traps . The Federal Election law , which has stood between him and an . indignant country for twenty-four years , got its death blow by the Senate . In a day or two the President will affix his signature to the repeal measure , so that practically Mr. Davenport is ? tee of a job . Only Republican partisans of the Frye-Hoar stripe pretend to believe that the country will suffer by reason of the wiping out of this obnoxious law . The final vote on the Federal Election , bill stood 39 to 28 . The Populist Senator voted with the Democrats In the affirmative . The Senate refused to accept numerous amendments offered by Mr. Chandler , who did not desist offering until he had exhausted his stock . Mr. Hoar made a final appeal for the existing law early in the day , and an effective reply was given by Mr. Bate of Tennessee . Before the hour for taking the vote arrived , Messrs . Cameron , Gray , Daniel , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest ? ing exchanges of compliments . Mr. Hoar said , in opening his remarks , that he was one of the five persons now in the Senate who had voted for the election law of 1870 , and he had been often called upon to explain and defend it . " Wherever , " he said , affecting a very sol ? emn tone , " there is a crevice in our protection of the freedom of the ballot there you will find the Democratic Party trying to break through . Wherever we have left open an opportunity to get possession of an office contrary to the true and constitutional will of the majority , there you will find that party exercising a devilish ingenuity before which even the great inventive genius of the American people , in other directions , is insignificant in performance . " Mr. Hoar gave considerable time to a dig , cussion of objections raised against the law , and then , getting considerably excited , ex. claimed : " The records in the archives of this Capitol make of the history of elections in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime since the world was created . We can only deal with that subject in silence . When these reports are read , blackening the fair fame of this land , we must walk backward with averted gaze and hide our heads in shame . This is a question of fraud or no fraud , and there is nothing else to it . It is a question whether the supreme pearl and gem in the crown of America 's manhood shall not have the strongest force on the face of the earth for its protection and defense . " Mr. Gray , ( Dem. , Del. , ) replying , said Mr. Hoar had mistaken or misrepresented the gravamen of Democratic opposition to the election laws . They wanted to wipe them out , not because they protected the weak from the strong . It was because Democrats believed , from bitter experience , that those laws were at war with every tradition of local self-government . Not only did they degrade the States of which they were citizens , but they buttressed up the very fraud which they were professedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure they had been necessarilyan auxiliary to the party machine of the party in power in the Federal Government . In every city of 20,000 inhabitants they had been the ready means by which in the last twenty . years the Republican Party had put its hand into the Treasury of the United States in order to defray the election charges and expenses of the party . There could not be a successful denial of that statement . Mr. Bate , ( Dem. , Tenn .. ) in closing the debate , said it was susceptible of demonstration that the chief object of the reconstruction laws , of which the Federal election laws formed a part , had been to capture the electoral ' cotes of the Southern States , and to secure Republican Senators and Representatives . But the scheme had gone awry and all the plots had failed . The " new allies " had deserted the Republican standards , and the Republican Party had ceased to have a local habitation in those States , from which four years after the war it had had all their Senators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election laws were or were not constitutional , they were certainly in the year of grace 1894 unwise and unnecessary . They embodied the same ideas that had dictated reconstruction . and that should now be repealed . They had inspired more fraud at elections than they had suppressed . They should be all repealed , and the States should be left to regulate all elections within their borders . thus giving emphasis to the doctrine of home rule  --  the only safety of a republic . At the close of Mr. Bate 's speech Mr. Chandler ( Rep .. N. H. , ) withdrew the amendment heretofore offered by him and moved another , the purport of which was to make the proposed repeal effective only to the extent of prohibiting the employment of Deputy Marshals at elections . This amendment was rejected ? yeas. 27 ; nays. 40 . The three pepu , lists , Senators Allen , Kyle , and Peffer , and one Republican , Senator Stewart of Nevada , voted with the Democrats in the negative . Another amendment was offered by Mr. Chandler for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " crimes " sections of the Revised Statutes in regard to elections . It was also rejected  --  yeas , 27 ; nays , 38 . Five other amendments offered by Mr. Chandler were rejected . A taunting inquiry by Mr. Chandler as to whether Mr. Stewart would contribute his vote to the repeal of the law which had been one of the noblest acts of his puolie life brought out a short speech from Mr. Stewart to the effect that the Election act of 1870 was passed just after the Nation had emerged from war , and that now the Nation had entered on another war  --  that of the Executive against the producing classes . Mr. Perkins ( Rep. , Cal .. ) offered the amendment of which he had given notice yesterday , allowing the election laws to remain , but confining the Federal supervision to cities of 200.000 inhabitants or over , instead of as now to 20.000 . The amendment was rejected  --  yeas , 27 ; nays , 39 . The bill was then passed  --  yeas. 39 ; nays. 28 -- a party vote , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messrs . Allen , Kyle , and Peffer ( Pops. ) voted with the Democrats in the affirmative .
