txt " I am a Democrat . I never voted for a Republican for President , but the candidate of that party will have my vote in November if he is strong for gold and stands on a strong platform , and if the Democratic Party is weak in either respect . This is the feeling among business men generally . Democrats and Republicans have no differences on the money standard . " These are the words of Mr. HENRY HENTZ , Chairman of the Committee on Sound Money Legislation of the Chamber of Commerce . There is nc like body of business men in the United States the members of which have wider or closer relations and connections with business men of the entire country than those of the Chamber of Commerce . Mr. HENTZ , by his official work in the Chamber , as well as by his personal and business acquaintance , is especially well informed as to the sentiment and purpose of the business class . He says that he , a Democrat , will vote for the candidate " who is strong for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter which party presents such a candidate and platform , if the other party is " weak in either respect . " And he says that " business men generally , " whether Democrats or Republicans , feel as he does and will act as he says that he shall act . These are very plain and strong statements . They are beyond all doubt true . Their authority is beyond question , and if it were not , the business men of the country could not , without incredible folly , feel or act in any other way . For more than a quarter of a century the business men have had no opportunity to express their views definitely and effectively on the question of the currency . Since the election of 1868 , when the payment of the bonds in greenbacks was proposed , and when the country rose to the stirring appeal of Mr. FESSENDEN to " repudiate the repudiators , " vital changes have been made in 1 the currency of the country . The payment of legal-tender notes has been stopped and their continual reissue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as full legal tender and purchased and coined or stored in a volume that has greatly disturbed the stability of the currency . A large debt has been incurred to maintain the credit of the Government , under laws passed for a wholly different purpose . The Treasury has struggled , year after year , now under a Democratic , now under a Republican , Secretary , but always with the severest difficulty , to make head against the rising tide of silver and to preserve the gold payments on which the whole business of the land has rested . But in this long period of doubt and trouble and contest the politicians have contrived to keep the people from speaking at the ballot box . The vast interests depending on the currency have been endangered in a petty and cowardly game of politics . One concession after another , one compromise after another , has been juggled through Congress by men who dared not go straight and fair to the people . This thing can go on no longer . Party ties are snapped like the withes that bound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people are questioned this year , their answer will relate to the .. ? urrency , and there will be no mistaking it . If both the great parties present , in Mr. HENTZ 's words , " a candidate strong for gold , who stands on a strong platform , " then the people will crush a third party that ventures in the field for silver . If one party presents such a candidate and platform and the other does not , the first will win , and the second will be overwhelmed . This is the situation to-day , and the men whose business it is to shape , so far as they can , the course of the Democratic Convention , must face it . They may have the power  --  we believe that they have ? to plant a strong man on a strong platform . If they do , their party has a chance , a good fighting chance , for victory .
