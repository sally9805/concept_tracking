txt William J. Bryan came to New York yesterday , and during the day managed to see and talk with most of those who were associated with him in the last Presidential campaign . He arrived in this city at 6:30 o'clock from Troy and took breakfast at the Grand Union Hotel with Janes Oliver , Sergeant at Arms of the National Committee . Then he took a local train for Irvington-on-the-Hudson , where he went to see John Brisben Walker . Mr. Walker was not expecting Mr. Bryan , and was just getting up when he arrived . They walked out on the tennis lawn , sat down under the trees , and talked for some time . Then they took a train for this city , and arrived at the Grand Central Station at 11:35 A. M. There was some cheering for Mr. Bryan as he alighted , and an enthusiast called for cheers for " the next President " H. M. , President of the Loyal Democratic League , was among those who met Mr. Bryan at the station . Mr. Bryan immediately went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and J. C. Redpath . Afterwards Mr. Bryan called on Philo S. Bennett of the firm of Bennett &; Sloan , 100 Hudson Street . He wrote some letters there . Then he called on Elliot Danforth , Chairman of the Democratic State Committee , at his office at 257 Broadway . The discussion was said to have been on general topics , and Mr. Danforth hurried away to catch a train , having an engagement out of the city . Culled on John C. Sheehan . Mr. Bryan then called on Cot William L. Brown at The Daily News office , and from there , in company with Col. Brown , he went to the office of John C. Sheehan , the leader of Tammany Hall , at Broadway and Warren Street . He was met there by Mr. Sheehan and Augustus W. Peters , Chairman of the Tammany General Committee . He was ushered into Mr. Sheehan 's private office and talked with Mr. Sheehan , Col. Brown , and Mr. Peters for about a quarter of an hour . When Mr. Bryan came out he shook hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . All that Mr. Sheehan would say about the meeting was that Mr. Bryan had made a social call . They had talked over the last campaign , he said , and Mr. Bryan congratulated Tammany upon its work . If the issues of the local campaign were discussed Mr. Sheehan did not care to talk about them . It is said that Mr. Bryan told Mr. Sheehan what he told the reporters later  --  that he did not purpose to interfere in any way with local matters . This , in fact , was the point that Mr. Bryan made during his visit with much distinctness . He also declined in.vitations to speak here at this time , and he left the question as to whether he would talk here at all during the campaign in uncertainty . Ho is not to talk either at to-morrow night 's meeting in favor of municipal ownership of franchises , in Union Square , nor at the Brooklyn silverites ' meeting , on July 5 . Silverites Wait on Him . From Mr. Sheehan 's office Mr. Bryan went back to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence he hurried to the Bartholdi Hotel , where rooms had been secured for him , and where a number of silver enthusiasts were awaiting him . The Bartholdi is the headquarters of the Progressive Democratic League , which wants Tammany to reindorse silver , and many of its members were on hand to welcome Mr. Bryan . There was also a delegation from the Loyal Democratic League waiting to see him . President headed this delegation , and he walked into Mr. Bryan 's parlor at the head of the League 's Executive Committee . He said to Mr. Bryan that they would like to hear a few words of a non-political character from him for their guidance . Mr. Bryan said in reply ; ' One of the hardest things to do is to make a non-political speech . It is easier to make a non-partisan speech . My attention has been given so completely to political affairs that it is peculiarly hard for me to refrain from speaking upon politics . By political questions I mean questions that concern government . It is the duty of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . " A man may or may not be called to public service , but it is the duty of every citizen to take an active interest in the affairs of the Nation . Whether he is a candidate or not is a matter which concerns others , but whether he takes part in Government affairs depends upon himself . The affairs of Government concern every good citizen . I was a public officer myself for a short time . Good of the Late Campaign . " I look upon the recent campaign as one of great advantage to the American people . You can not always measure the effects for good or evil immediately . Whether the victory is permanent or temporary remains to be seen . But I am sure that the study excited by the campaign last year will be productive of great good for years to come . ' Whenever the people commence the study of political questions they carry out that study until they find the best solution . " They also begin the scrutiny of their public servants . I was once a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being watched , and every one who desires to do his duty should be glad to be watched . They are faithful in the discharge of their duties when they know the eye of the public is upon them . An awakened people will watch the public servants . A Dollar That Grows Fatter . " The monopoly of gold enabled the people to know the meaning of a dollar that grows fatter every day , while the people grow leaner . Whenever a great purpose is to be accomplished there must be unity . Organization is necessary . I know not the detail of your organization , and I care not . A small compact body of men fighting together will overcome a great army shooting at random . " " I am a believer in local self-government . I believe the people of each community are able to fight their own battles , understand their own needs , and carve out their own destiny . " " You call yourselves the Loyal Democratic League . You have chosen an unusually fortunate combination of names . To be loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic principles can we make our Government what it ought to he . The word democracy has already been included by me when-I spoke of loyalty . " Democracy is more than a name . It is a system of government . I believe that the people are more ready to accept Democratic doctrine to-day than at any time in recent years . There is nothing in Democracy excapt as it expresses the equality of all under the law . The growth of great trusts ? tnd combinations of capital has led the people to realize the danger of monopolies , which have deprived the weaker of their rights . After Mr. Bryan had completed his talk to his friends of the league , he was waited upon by the Railroad Committee of the Knights of Labor , who askel him to remain over and speak at the Union Square meeting to-morrow night . P. J. Collins , Michael Kelly , Charles Sotheran , James E. Quinn , and Thomas J. O'Reilly were in the party . Mr. Bryan said that he regretted that it was impossible fur him to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chautauqua Association in Norfolk . The conference was private , and afterward one of the Knights of Labor said that Mr. Bryan had said that the experience of the last campaign demonstrated that the Knights of Labor in Greater New York would be sufficiently able to see to it that the party took no step backward . Mr. Bryan afterward said that his remark was that the whole Democracy could be depended upon . Bryan Is Not a Boss . Mr. Bryan , according to the knights ' report , said that the meeting on Monday ' night concerned a local matter in which he ought not to be expected to interfere , as he believed the present leaders sincere in their Democratic profession . One of the delegates said that the knights did not think so , for while Mr , Sheehan was thought to be in favor of municipal ownership , the Tammany members of the Board of Aldermen voted against it in the cases of the Eighth and Sixth Avenue Railroads . The statement was made that if Tammany did not do right they would not support it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in local political matters everywhere , I would be considered a boss , and I do n't believe in bossism . " That ended the interview . Some of the Knights threatened to put up a separate ticket if Tammany would not follow its wishes . Ills Plans for the Summer . Congressman Tom L. Johnson of Ohio called on Mr. Bryan and took him out for a short drive . Mr. Johnson had somethings to say to him , and they wanted to get away from the crowd . When Mr. Bryan returned he talked freely with the newspaper men . AU efforts to get him to commit himself on the local situation were useless . He said that he never felt better in his life . He proposed leaving for Washington last night , and from there he would go by boat to Norfolk . He will speak there tomorrow night , and on Tuesday he will speak before the Washington and Jefferson Societies at the commencement exercises of the University of Virginia , at Charlottesville . Then he will start back West , stopping over at his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Neb. , he will talk at Carthage . Mo. , and at Ottawa , Kan . He expects to be home by June 27 , and then he will start on a new trip to the West . He will be in Los Angeles , Cal. , on July 5 , where he will talk before the Silver Repubican Club . He will talk in San Francisco on July 7 , and then will make a trip through Oregon , and will get back to Salt Lake City for the Trans-Mississippi Convention , in the middle of July . Mrs. Bryan and their children will meet him there , and they will go for a long vacation in Yellowstone Park . He is now President of the Trans-Mississippi Conference , but says that he will not be reelected . As to Tammany and the Platform . " Do you think the Chicago platform should be indorsed by Tammany this year ? " Mr. Bryan was asked . He smiled blandly . " I hardly think that I care to mix in your local politics , " was the reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign ? " " My time is ' engaged up to the middle of August . I have received two or three invitations to speak here , but I have not been able to accept them . " " What do you think of the Democratic chances in this city ? " " It seems to me that they are very good . There has been a natural growth of Democratic sentiment . " " Do you think that free silver has gained ? " I certainly believe that it has . " Then , turning quickly from the subject , Mr. Bryan said : , " Your local issues here will aid the party greatly . I understand that the Republican administration here has been unsatisfactory . " " Should Tammany stand on the Chicago platform this year ? " " I do not want to discuss questions of local politics . " " Why will you not discuss local political matters ? " " Because I believe in the Democratic principle of local self-government , and I believe it would be offensive to that idea for a man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the country has been not to interfere in local matters . " Has Not Seen Prosperity 's Return . No form of question elicited any different sort a answer . Mr. Bryan seemingly had decided not to mix up in the local fight . He said that in his travels he had not seen any evidence of the return of prosperity . " Prosperity , " he said , " seems to be hesitating upon the threshold . " Mr. Bryan said that it was too early to talk about the issues of 1900 , but it was plain that he thought it would be silver . At 6 o'clock Mr. Bryan walked up to Delmonice 's to dine with Col. Brown , whose other guests were John C. Sheehan , Willis Abbott , and Congressman William Sulzer . They dined in a private room . It was stated at the Bartholdi Hotel early this morning that Mr. Bryan had left for Washington at midnight . MR . TOWNS IS AROUSED . Threatens Reprisals Against Tammany If It Repudiates Mr. Bryan . Mirabeau L. Towns , poet laureate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are a. joy everlasting to his brother lawyers , has again taken the war path . Mr. Towns is the sponsor of William J. Bryan in Kings County , and no more rabid silverite than he exists . The trouble with Mr. Towns yesterday was that he ' eared Tammany will repudiate Mr. Bryan in the coming campaign , and in consequen " he has threatened serious reprisals . " If the Democratic organization of the greater city , " said he , " by which is meant Tammany Hall in New York and the machine in Brooklyn , repudiates Mr. Bryan , we who believe in the principles for which he stands will be against it at the polls in November . " We will support the Republican nominatien which we can conscientiously do if the Democratic organiation shall say that Natio ' al issues are not involved , or in case their nominee does not suit us , put a ticket of our own in the field headed by Henry George , Howard Crosby , or some other man of their type . We do not propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Democratic organization in the greater city , seduced by the desire to obtain for itself a few offices , is willing to combine with men who betrayed the party last Fall . " I understand that it Is the programme of the machine leaders to repudiate the men for whom in November six million and a half American citizens cast their votes . They intend to repudiate Bryan and the platform upon which he stood , not perhaps in words , but more contemptibly , by silence . Let them do it . There are enough real Democrats in New York and Brooklyn to insure their defeat at the polls if they try anything of the kind . " The Democrats have no other issues but National issues , and the National issues are involved as much in this municipal campaign as they were in the campaign of 1896 , whether those issues be free silver , regulation of the corporations , or adjustment of taxes and incomes or not . Democrats , if they expect to keep up their organization , and if they cherish any hope of winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must stick together , and be true to the principles for which they suffered martyrdom in 1806 . " The cry should be a straight Democratic ticket , headed and tailed by honest and capable men , a fearless fight , an open confession of past sins , an honest assurance of future reformation , arid an appeal candidly made to the vast majority of voters who are now disgusted with the bunco men who have been taking them into camp under promise of reform and better times for the last four years . " MR . BRYAN 'S EXPENSES . Local Associations Pay Bills , He Says , Not the Silver League . William J. Bryan 's present trip through the country has excited much comment as to who is paying the expenses of it . It has been currently rumored that the National Silver League stands sponsor for the expenses . While Mr. Bryan was at the Bartholdi Hotel yesterday he was asked whether the Silver League was paying the bills . " Not at all , " he replied . " There is nothing at all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cities I visit and under the auspices of which the lectures are given . That is all there is to
