txt It seems certain that the " compromise " bill relating to teachers ' salaries will be passed by the Legislature . It differs from the Ahearn bill as originally introduced by the insertion of the condition that advances in the various salaries shall be made , not for mere length of service , but only when " approved , after inspection and investigation , " by the Borough Board of School Superintendents , to whom is joined , in the case of teachers , the Principal of the school in which they shall be employed . This is the sound principle . It is one that protects the rights of the public and is in every way honorable and advantageous to the good teachers of whatever grade . There was practical unanimity among the school authorities in the view that the general rate of pay in the schools of Greater New York was too low . As we have before said , we could not believe that the average service was , on a ihuch higher level than the pay . it was of the utmost importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair chance to raise the standard of service and get the worth of the taxpayers ' money . This , we think , the proposed bill reasonably does . It is greatly to the credit of the school authorities and of the Governor that they have Imposed this condition . No really good teacher will complain that the public is to have decent security that more nay is earned before it is granted . As for the others , the public will sympathize with some of them , but will part with all of them with a sense of relief .
