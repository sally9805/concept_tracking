txt trust , will not lose anything by this visit - from two transatlantic co-workers . " " What was the general sentiment in England in regard to the Pullman strike ? " Air . Burns was asked . " I am di ; inclined to speak upon that subject , " was the reply . " I mean to visit Pullman to confer with the managers of the company and to see the labor leaders . When I have done so , I will be glad to give Yon my personal opinion on the matter , but not now . I can say that the troubles caused intense interest in England . " " What about Debs ? " " I have not had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Debs , therefore 1 must again decline to give you an opinion . it would he doing a great injtn , the , to him , and to the people who chose him for a leader , were I to attenint to criticise a man whom I know so very little about . " I am for fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another question . More especially am I an advocate for the international fusion of the workingmen . In England , 1 believe from what I have heard of America , we have among honor men different plans and policies from those that have been adopted here . There , 1 must say , we have been singularly successful in eliminating politics from trade unionism . ? ? Take , for instance , the Trade Union Congress , a body composed of many religious beliefs , of many political opinions ; some are prohibitionists , others are not ; some are not ashamed to gamble , others arc : but all these various opinions are laid aside when trade union matters are discussed . Trade unionism above all is the motto . As a Socialistic leader has expressed it , a trade union bird in the hand is better than an uncaptured swan in the bush . " We believe , too , in retaining our leaders in office so long as they are worthy to be kept there . Socialists of my type are ever reluctant to dismiss men of tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Incidentally Mr. Burns observed that he was elected to Parliament as a " SocialDemocrat , " and that he was in favor of independent political action . He also expressed a preference for the practical application of the hard and concrete facts of life . " Are you going to urge a Socialistic doctrine here ? " he was asked . " No , " was.the reply . " I am restricted so far as this visit is concerned . Outside of my formal duties as delegate , I do not intend to take a part in labor matters here beyond helping the unions to a better organization . I expect to meet the various leaders and to talk over the situation with them , icoking to a final consolidation of the laboring classes . " On this subject I might add that I am not wholly obscure here , and it was a great pleasure to me when a number of dock laborers recognized me to-day , and hailed me with the familiar greeting , " Ow are ye , Sohn ? ' ? ? I hold to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor organization is for the men , the rank and file , to make sacri/lees when such are needed , and for the leaders to be ever alert and honest and to scorn the delights of ease . " " Do you know Mowbray ? " he was asked . " Yes , I know him , " Mr. Burns replied . n ' He is a tailor in London , and is identified ' with a clique which holds certain social and economical opinions . I hold entirely opposite views , and disagree with him entirely . " About the inroads made by machinery ? Well , 1 consider that as one of the results of the evolution of industry . The workingmen of England do not object to it . Our object there is to neutralize as far as possible the bad consequences of its introduction into many trades  --  to make it a less positive dictator . However , I am an advocate of machinery . I myself am a member of the Amalgamated Engineers , an association having a membership of 75,000 . " Touching upon representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that here in America labor had no direct representation in either the Senate or House of Representatives . There are in England , he said . leaoo workingmen who are members of School Boards and of County Councils who are occupying the magisterial bench and who are in Parliament . In reply to a question about the excise law . Mr. Burns said that , while he was an abstainer , he was not here as a temperance reformer . He added irrelevantly that he was not a universal peacemaker , and that he was nv nature a tighter . Continuing . he said that the eight-hour movement in England had made great strides . There was no phase of the labor movement , he added , of which he was more proud than the way In which this concession to the wage earner had been gained by the labor organizations . " What is the relative condition of the orkingman here and in England ? " he was asked . " I think , " said Mr. Burns , slowly , " that the high rate of wages paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly exaggerated . I believe that , on the other hand , the low rate of English wages and of comforts have also been exageera tel . I heard much about the Americans during my voyage here from some good citizens of yours . They enamela:en alt the defects of this country from the time of Washington until yesterday . And if what they say is true . I must believe that the Americans need more Character and less cash . " Mr. Burns has some theories about the Government ownership of land . The nationalization of land . he said , will be brought about in different countries by different means ? in some by a revolutionary crisis , in others by a system of cumulative taxation . Mr. Burns announced that his party intended to attend the concert at the Metropolitan last night . This evening a public reception will he tendered him in Cooper Union , and a dinner will be given in his honor to-morrow evening at Clarendon Hall . 112 East Thirteenth Street . The party will leave far Denver Wednesday . John Burns was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From his earl : ' -t infancy he was in close contact with poverty . At the age of ten he went to work in a factory-. and worked there until he left the workshop to stand as a Parliamentary condidate . He was the leading organizer of the dock strike , and is a man who has fought and suffered for his e ! ass , and who has endured imprisonment for his cause . At the time of the West End riots he was arrested for seditious speeches . He was again arrested for an alleged wish to further elevate Balfour by means of dynamite , but the evidence against him was insufficient and he was discharged .
