His companion on the voyage was Alice Snell McCrea. the daughter of Millionaire Snell of Chicago , whose murder furnished one of the greatest sensations Chicago has ever known .

Mr. Green fell before her charms , abandoning his own wife and family on her account , and a week ago last Sunday , at Old Point Corafort , the ceremony of marriage was performed between them , making Mr. Green a bigamist . Although the story was somewhat startling as retailea. on Wall-street yesterday , it hardly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town knew of Green 's infatuation for the woman and of his desertion of his own wire . The scandal had spread so widely indeed that the houses of many of his friends were closed against him , and his social opportunities underwent serious restriction during the past two months . Even business associates , who had no reason to be thin-skinned over his personal conduct , watched his course with anxiety and reproved him for it . He was not to be staid . Appeals to his honor had no seeming effect . It was noticed that his operations on the Street , which were never by any means conducted solely through his own firm , were no longer intended to follow the market , but seemed designed rather to realize cash , as if a withdrawal from the market might be ills purpose . As he held a seat in the Stook Exchange and could operate for himself , his friends could judge:of his motives only in the vaguest way . They do not seem to have apprehended that he was systematically unloading until about a fortnight ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , in which he was a large owner , dropped suddenly several points . About that time he disappeared . Ile went to Old Point Comforts Mrs. McCrea was there and had made a great impression on the garrison at Fortress Monroe . The officers who basked in her favor were accordingly much chagrined when Mr. Green turned up week ago lounday and proceeded to monopolize the young divorcee 's society . They aeon had more than that to talk about , foatha , tafternoon Mr. Green and Mrs. McCrea , with several friends , visited several clergymen in the neighborhood , and the next day , having procured a license , they were married at Hampton by the Rev. Mr. Thornton , a colored preacher . After the wedding the party immediately started for Washington . Two or three days later they were back in this city . Mr. Green and the bride went to different hotels . The wedding because a matter of rumor at Fortress Monroe last week . and there were hints of it here , but Green 's friends would not believe that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , to lead to messages to Green 's family at Savannah , and If he had not sailed away yesterday ho would have been under detention before this time for examination under lunacy proceedings . His deserted wife and his two children are living with his relatives in Savaunab . Before his marriage Mrs. Green was Miss Laura It . Tewksbury of Manchester , N. H. Thoth she was married to Green nine years ago . Naturally the office of Green &; Batopaan was visited yesterday by many brokers . Inquiries at last became so numerous that the members of the firm authorized a statement that on account of the scandal Mr. Green 's connection . with the firm had been.severed . The firm had an.inkling of the scandal several days ago. , When Mr. Green returned he was asked to explain . He neglected to do so , but was quite willing to.part company with his business associates . That having been arranged , and knowing that the scandal was on the verge of exposure , the trip to Europe was hastily and secretly decided upon . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement was made at the Exchange yesterday that Mr. Green was no longer with the firm . Probably the most disgusted and astonished of all of Mr. Green 's friends and relatives was his brother-in-law , Ttr . W. Mackall , Jr. , of Savannah . Mr. Mackall reached here on Tuesday . He came for the express purpose of instituting proceedings to have Mr. Green declared insane . He saw Mr. Green several times during the day , and yesterday morning went to Gen. Roger A. Pryor 's office to engage him to take charge of the lunacy proceedings . Soon atter he learned that his brother-in-law and Mrs. McCrea had sailed on the Lahn . As showing the fact that there had been an actual intention of beginning an action to have Mr. Green declared insane , Mr. Mackall signed this statement : " Upon satisfactory proof of the insanity of Mr. DoriMaits Green his family deemsil it their duty 10 commit him to anasylain , and I , his brother-in-law . retained Gen. Pryor to institute proceedings to that end . " This corroborative statement was signed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends of sir . Douglass Green , and upon abundant evidence of his insanity . I was about to institute proceedings for his commitment to an asylum when I was informed of his departure from the country . " Dr. H. H. Cents had attended Mr. Green as his physician . He wrote the following letter to Mr. Mackall : " In response to your request for my opinion as regards the question of insanity in the case of Mr. Douglass Green . and for a description of the dieease for which he has been under my treatment . I bog leave to say that in my opinion Mr. Green has exhibited symptoms of insanity for several mouths past . I consider that there is a strong probability of its being a direct result of his disease , as he is suffering from a necrosis of the ethnoid bone in close relationship to the brain . He has experienced much pain , and has frequently told me that his memory load become affected . Of late his conduct had become so extraordinary that I had urged him to voluntarily allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a view with which ho appeared to coincide . I have for some time felt that there existed enough evidences to justify me in so committing him . " While generally an expression of opinion in regard to a patient is not in accord with professional ethics , I feel that in justice to Mr. Green himself and to his family I should state the facts as I believe them . " When Mr. Mackall reached this city on Tuesday he at once Bought out Mr. Green , down town . Ile spoke to him of his escapade with Mrs. McCrea , and Mr. Green admitted that he and the woman hod been married . He seemed not to realize that there was anything out of the way in what he had done . He did not , how-ever , say anything about his intention of leaving the country , nor did he take the trouble to inform Mackall that ha and Mrs. McCrea were going on board the Lahn that very night . Mr. Mackall noticed that his actions were strange , aside from his failure to show any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCrea . As long as two years ago Mr. Green 's actions aroused the suspicion that he was becoming insane . Within the past four months his actions were noticed by his relatives to have grown more peculiar . Symptons of insanity wore noted in his correspondence . Twice , before Mr. Mackall came on this week , the family had talked over the matter and bad decided that eters should be taken to have Mr. Green declared insane , but for some reason their intentions were not carried out . Mr. Maokail. who married a sister of Mr. Green , came to this city twice daring the time the family were speculating in regard to Mr. Green 's insanity , for the purpose of finding oat , more particularly what his condition actually was , and taking steps to have him committed to an asylum if necessary . That Mrs. McCrea knew of Mr. Green 's insanity when she was married or supposed she was married to him is almost unquestionable . Several friends of Mr. Green had told her that he was not in his right mind . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the impression of some of Mr. Green 's friends who were seen yesterday that Mre . McCrea was much infatuated with Vim . and had made up her mind to have some sort of marriage ceremony between them at any cost , although she knew that he could not marry her legally . A lawyer said it was easily comprehended why the marriage had not taken place here , where get ' zing marriage is nos a difficult task . New-York has a law by which a person who marries another knowing that he or she Is already married is punishable. - Virginia has no such law , and therefore the marriage took place in V1rgime .. Mrs. McCrea , knowing that Mr. Green was a married man , did not wish to put herself in a position to oe punished by the law . There was one point . however , the same gentleman said , which she had overlooked . An insane man can not be guilty of a crime , Mr. Green , if insane , could not be guilty of bigamy . The plain fact was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigamous one , between Mr. Green and - Mrs. McCrea , as It could undoubtedly be proved that he was insane . Mr. Green is about forty years of age , of a very nervous disposition . He lived with his wife in the Barcelona apartment house , and after she went South he still kept his apartthere.
