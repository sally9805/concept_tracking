txt The recent passage of the new Mexican Pension bill has properly been referred to as an illustration of the results of altering standard values of pensions . One would hardly have expected , in the present state of the Treasury , another costly general pension bill . But the simple explanation is that , having previously fixed on $12 instead of the familiar $8 a month for dependent Union veterans in the Disability bill , Congress felt obliged to raise also from $S to $12 the gratuities of dependent survivors of the Mexican war , who average , perhaps , a dozen years older . The plain lesson is that , when once a rate fixed for years as just and satisfactory is raised , the precedent is likely to entail an enormous cost . Of course , in cases of severe and painful injuries such increases are entirely warranted . But it is the increase of rates on other pensions , and great classes of them , that forms one of the most serious sources of burden , promising to counterbalance for many years any decrease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of pensioners . One or two points in the story of the Umbria 's misfortunes stand in need of elucidation . It is of importance that it be determined whether , as now appears , the Gallia actually denied her sister ship 's appeal for aid and sailed away because she " carried mails " and could not be delayed ; also , how the officers of the Galileo so misread , if they did misread , the Umbria 's signals as to suppose that she required no aid when in fact she had asked for a tow to port . In whatever way these questions may be answered , the story of the accident should teach steamship companies that , while it is highly desirable to fulfill valuable mail contracts and save salvage money , the feelings of passengers and the friends of passengers are entitled to be considered .
