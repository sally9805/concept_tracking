txt The Board of Aldermen , at yesterday 's session , passed four bond issues , amounting in the aggregate to $1,580,000 , and thus absolved themselves of the charge of holding up public improvements . The Council , on the contrary , refused to take a " hung-up " resolution from the committee which has been considering it for months , and then adjourned , because , as the Tammany leader expressed it . " it was evident that nothing could be clone and it was useless to fool away more time . " When the Aldermen were called together it was apparent that some Influence had been at work to cause a full attendance , for at one time or another during the session every member of the board was present . The usual number of petitions for the erection of peanut stands and for permission to utilize lampposts to advertise " chowders " and excursions had been read by the Clerk , and the board was about to settle down to the contemplation of similar petitions which had come in later , when Mr. McCall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the issue of $570,000 in bonds for the purchase of the plant of the - Long Island Water Supply Company . This resolution had been before the board for over a year , and had railed to receive the necessary majority on a dozen occasions . Mr. McCall was not fearful of the fate of the measure yesterday , however , and he did not ourden his colleagues with any remarks on the necessity for passing the resolution Mr. Burleigh ( Rep. , Kings. ) was the only speaker , and he confined himself to reading a petition from the Brooklyn League , in which the whole history of the scandal was reviewed . On the roll call forty-seven members voted in the affirmative and ten , Aldermen Bridges , Byrne , Dooley . Elliott , Hennessy , Keegan , Kenney , Lang , Schmitt , and Felton , in the negative . All of these men are Brooklyn Democrats , and their action yesterday was consistent with their course heretofore . Aldermen Gaffney ( Tam. ) and Keeley and , ( Dems .. Kings. ) were absent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate vote had been announced . His appearance was greeted with hoots of derision . It was later explained by Mr. McCall that Mr. Gaffney had ? been detained by important personal business , and that ' t was his desire to be recorded in the affirmative . This request was objected to , so Mr. Gaffney was noted as being absent . CROTON WATERSHED ISSUE . The next bond issue called up was that of $500,1,1V0 for the sanitary protection of the Croton watershed . There were no speeches in opposition , but in explaining his vote . Mr. Bridges , ( Dem. , Kings , ) said : " I 'm agoira to vote for this resolution . I do n't vote for it because I 'm afraid of the press or any public official . There is things clone in this city that ought n't to be done , and there . is things being done that ai n't right . I 'm not afraid of the press . I was elected by the people of the Second District of Kings County . and I 'm responsible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only four men opposed this resolution  --  Byrne , Lang , Stewart , and Wafer  --  all of Kings County . The last two are Republicans . The bond issues of $500,000 for the new East River Bridge and : i:10,01 ) for a small park at Jefferson Street and East Broadway were unanimously adopted . Alderman Outman ( Cit . U. ) sent shivers down the backs of his Tammany colleagues by moving that the Committee on Public Buildings . Lighting . and Supplies be discharged from the further consideration of his resolution permitting the Mazet committee to hold its sessions in the Aldermanic Chamber . There was a storm of protest at this innocent motion , but finally Alderman McCall recovered his breath by a hard effort and moved that Mr. Oatman 's motion be laid on the table . While the Aldermen were thus attending to their long-neglected duties . the Council was engaged in defending itself against newspaper attacks and in explaining its alleged dereliction . Mr. Brice ( Tam. ) began the proceedings by moving to expel The New York World representative from the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council . including himself . Mr. Leich ( Rep .. Brooklyn , ) referred to the attack as being " clever but scurrilous. " and said that public officials must expect to be criticised . Mr , Francisco . another Brooklyn Republican , declared that the charge that he was a member of a " bond hold-up combine " was false . Referring to one of the statements in the article in question , he declared : The Commissioner who gave that information is a coward , a liar , and no good politically , socially , or morally . " How much further the indignant Councilman would have gone can not be imagined , but fortunately PreSident Guggenheimer , by dint of much hammering , succeeded in calling him to order . Mr. Brice 's motion was defeated in a viva voce vote . THE BOND HOLD-UP . The bond hold-up was brought up incidentally by a resolution offered by Mr. Leich , calling on the Commissioner of Highways for a detailed statement of the streets which he proposes repaving in the Seventh District . Mr. Leich , in speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for repaving ought to be held up until the streets to be improved are designated . Mr. Cassidy ( Dem .. Queens , ) wanted his district , the Ninth , inserted in the rsolution , and accused the Commissioner of Highways of bad faith , and Mr. Francisco observed that " we " ( the obstructionists ) " have got the right end of this , if we have n't got the press . Mr. Oakley 's motion to refer the resolution to the Committee on Streets and Highways prevailed , and peace reigned until ' , Mr. Oakley moved that the Committee on Affairs of Boroughs be discharged from the consideration of a resolution providing for a bond issue of $2,000,000 for repaving in all boroughs . This motion was defeated , but it gave several Councilmen an opportunity of defending themselves from accusa-tions of " holding up " measures . The first man with a grievance was Mr. Wise , ( Tam. , ) who surprised his colleagues by speaking against the motion , and declaring the Board of Public Improvements was responsible for delays in public works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chair-man of the committee named . began his speech by exclaiming , dramatically , " Pub- I lie opinion ! How many crimes are committed in thy name ! " In a sad tone , he observed that " public opinion and the or- I ganization , long strangers , are now walking hand in hand , " and closed by request- ing all the members of the Council to vote for the motion and for the bond isue , and ; leave it to the future to vindicate them . I As Mr. dropped wearily into his chair , his place on the floor was taken by Mr. Leich , who had boasted previously that the advertising he got by the newspaper accounts of his frequent speeches in the I Council was worth gri0,000 a year to him . His speech attracted little attention . Mr. Murray ( Tammany ) also made a short speech , in which he declared that he had been criticised In the press unjustly . He felt that the committee should continue in charge of the bond issue for repaving until the Commisisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APPEAL OF MR . OAKLEY . Vice Chairman Oakley , in reply , said that he did not believe any member of the Coln-cif was dishonest . The Committee on Affairs of Boroughs had not acted in good faith , he said , but had retained the resolution for months when it should have finished with it in a week . Public opinion would be gratified , he said , only by-the passage of the
