txt Mayor STRONG should have the thanks of all sensible citizens for putting his veto on the bill giving the Fire Commissioners control over the civil service examinations for appointments in their department . And our thanks should be the more hearty because he took time enough for his veto to make it fatal . The bill was bad , without excuse or palliation . It was based on a bad principle , and its motive was as wrong as it well could be . The one purpose of the civil service provisions of ' the Constitution is to take away from politicians the power to give or get offices for party service past or future . In doing this the people secure the best service that can be got at the lowest cost , since men will work harder ' for less pay when they know that to keep their places or to get better ones they have only to earn them . At the same time the right of all men to compete on equal terms for public employment is secured . To obtain these very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the main , appointing officers shall not have the tests of fitness for appointment in their own hands , because officers who would , if free , give places for party reasons would so apply the tests as still to do that . The Fire Commissioners asked for the control of the examinations solely because they wished to run them for politics ; the Legislature granted the Commissioners ' request for the same reason . In putting a stop to this wretched little game the Mayor has done a good piece of work , not only because it was a wretched game , but because , if he had let it succeed , it would have been played in all the departments , one after another , as fast as the spoilsmen were ready to seize them .
