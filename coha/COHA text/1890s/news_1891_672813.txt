txt " Tim Byrnes indicted for forgery ' . Whew . " ThIs exclamation broke from the lips of scores of New-York City Republican politicians yesterday . They bad read the news from Minneapolis printed in TEE TIMES of Sunday to the effect that Timothy E. Byrnes , tho " National Or ? ? ganger " of the Republican League of Clubs , had been indicted for uttering forged papers by the Grand Jury of Hennepin County  --  Tim Byrnes , the closest mau to President J. S. Clarkson in the affairs of the League . It was a stunning bit a news to the Republicans . There are other things about Mr. Byrnes for which he will not be indicted ; in all probability . bat which will interest the Republican polinoians here quite as- ranch as his indictment has surprised them Whether Mr. Byrnes% indictment will prevent hen from ' working out a great scheme to raise money for use by his party in the next national campaign remains to be seen . That ever since the last election , and possibly before it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great campaign fund far 1S92 out of the pockets of the Federal office holders all over the entire ' , Zenon , there is more than good reason to believe . Byrnes is as well known in the corridorsof the Fifth Avenue Hotel **25;0;TOOLONG Committee of the County Committee . and , indeed , better than Some of them . As organizer of the Republican League he has a salary , and , nominally , an office at 202 Fifth Avenue . the headquartersof the League . He was here snueh of the time during the recent campaign , and he has been here aline . He was here at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the league , and he went ? on to Washington to attend the meeting of the Sub-Executive Committee which was held there during the time that the National Republican Executive Committee was settling the question as to . where the National Convention should go . Incidentally , Brynes boomed Minneapolis . Since J. S. Clarkson was made President of the League . Organizer Byrnes has been more active in Its affairs than ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the League so that it could be put to some effective use as a. political machine , and when he took hold it was with the determination to make this League an important factor in the eampaign of next year . Byrnes was found useful for thiapurnose . During his recent visits here Mr. Clarkson has stayed at the Plaza Hotel . Mr. Byrnes also went to the Plaza Hotel . Messrs . Clarkson and Byrnes were very much together . The politicians knew , or believed , that they were preparing a big scheme with the object of doing some great thing for 1892 . Very few politicians in this city knew what the scheme was . It began to leak out that Clarkson was for Harrison for 1892 , and the knowing members of the Republican County Committee began to talk Harrison with more vim than they had previously done . Messrs . Clarkson and Byrnes talked and t alked . The meeting of the club 's National Executive Committee came , and Mr. Byrnes 's scheme , with the backing of others , was not divulged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sub-committee held in Washington . At least men who were at both these meetings say the question of finance only came up in a general way , that the financial talk had simply to do Willi reports from the various States as to whether the clubs in them could get along without aid from the other States , See . But the big Republican bosses do . not confide all their neat schemes to hat/one/ " Executive Committees " of clubs , or even to their SubExecutive Committee . After these meetings Mr. Byrnes went West from Washington . He had not been gone long when , within a very limited circle here , it became known that an important movement was on foot in the name of the Republican clubs . This movement had to do-with raising the big Lund for use next year from the Federal office holders . The plan , in brief , appears to be this : The Federal office holders in every State in the ' Chien , in every Post Office , Custom House , Apeiraiser 's office , and navy yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Government , must give his share to pile up the big fund that is to be used in the election next year . Each Stale is to be assessed for a certain amount , and this sum is to be so apportioned that each city will yield its proportionate amount Every city and town , in other words , will be assessed for a specified sum  --  if the scheme goes through . The Federal office holders in this city are to be assessed for many thousands of dollars . but the work of getting in the premises will not be begun quite yet . It is only a very few weeks since the Republican office holders here had to go down into their pockets in answer to the demand the State Committee made upon them through the now famous circular . The Inspiration of the present Byrnes scheme can be readily traced to this circular . The bold dash made by the Republican State Committee when it sent out this circular brought the dollars from the poorly-paid Government clerks in swarms . They realized that this cannier was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it it was bad enough to have to give up money that was in some cases sorely needed by the clerk 's family , but the prospect of losing their jobs was worse . The position of the clerk Is readily under Stood when it is known that no matter how much like a request a circular of the sort sent out by the State Committee may be worded every clerk who gets one feels that his place is in danger if he does not respond . That is the iniquity of It . Having seen how sucebssfully the scheme worked In this State daring the last campaign , some of the National Republican managers were evidently fascinated by its possibilities if properly worked throughout the whole Nation . What wee easier or more logical than an attempt to work nationally what had been worked so successfully locally ? Who was a better man to do it than Mr. Byrnes , who , in his capacity of national organizer , could go about the country making arrangements without attracting any notices Under the guise of organizer he could safely act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrnes 's plan is to let the superior officer in a Custom House , navy yard , or Post Office determine hltdself what the best plan Is of getting the money out of the small place holders , providing , of course , the superior officer is in sympathy with the movement . If he is not , Byrnes 's plan is said to be to work his place from the outside . One plan known to be a popular one has to do with the organization In the various cities and towns of the officeholders into a tariff league club pr protective club or some similar name . Once the clubs are formed , the word will be passed along to all Republican officeholders , end in many cases to the Dereocratio hold-o very , that it would be very advisable for them to join the club organized in their city or town and pay the dues of from $5 to e20 per year . If all the small Republican Federal office holders contribute from $5 to $20 it can be readily seen what au enormous fund will be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one is an office holder and coneludes to Join a club , he will not be informed that the money is to be devoted to the purpose of pulling Republican national chestnuts out of the tire In the Presidential campaign . He will be told that it is to be devoted to the Tariff League Club 's campaign of education . It Is a very pretty scheme , but once it becomes public property it will be a very difficult thine to make it slip along with that smoothness which secrecy would insure . There is some evidence of initial work on be1351/ of this delightful plan in this city . There is more of it in the West . where organizer Byrnes has been of late . He has been in Chicago , St Louis . and elsewhere , and there is reliable information Indicating that Byrnes has met with considerabie success . Some of the Western cities have already been assessed for deed eanounta . Byrnes has been quoted among certain politicians as saying in the West that New York City office holders had already promised to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also promised a lane sum , while work in St. Louis and elsewhere was promising . Here in New-York the formation of " Tariff ' Clubs " has not been actually begun , but there were indications during the latter part of the last campaign that something was on foot The so-called ' Mutual Benefit Organization of the Inspectors of Customs was tightened up , and Democratic hold-overs were discriminated against in the organization . Then . too , some of the leaders of the local Republicans suddenly discovered that it was time to take some action in reference to the ? ? Empire State Club , " which was projected early in the year at a quiet meeting held at the Brunswick Hotel . Messrs . Clarkeon and Byrnes had had many talks at the Plaza Hotel before the decision to throw some life into the Empire Club scheme , which had beep lying dormant for six months , was taken . Suddenly , right in the very thickest of the fight in this city , the Committee ou Organization of the Empire State club was called together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the State ticket The long dormant club was to he revived for some purpose outside of the campaign then in progress . This Committee on Organizatiou is made up of John N. Drake , Postmaster Cornelius Van Cott . Jacob M. Patterson . Bernard Biglin , Jambs A. Blanchard , and John E. Milholland . Mr. Drake was the Chairman- The result of the meeting was the sending out of the following circular , which was received by many office holders in the Custom House and Post Office : EMP:RE CLUB OF Sate-ionic . The objects of this club are for the purposes of brin=ing together to one organization the active workers in the Republican Party throughout the State : to foster friendly relatimis and geodfellewship among members : to provide suitable headquarters for the club , and for such other purposes as may be deemed necessary . This club is designed to be a popular , aggressive . political organization composed of those who have the success of the Republican Party at heart , and who are willing to labor in its Interest . It desires to recruit its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain at its headquarters in New  --  York city a complete enrollment of the Republicans of the State , together with such other informal Ion of a general or local csarseter as may be deemed necessary for political purposes . It is proposed to locate the clubhouse near the Fifth Avenue Hotel , where the members will have convenient and desirable headquarters for social and political purposes . Republicans only are accepted as members , that being the sole requirement exacted . J he initiation fee will not exceed $10. and the an . anal dues will not be over $10 yer year , payable halfyearly in adcnnee . Republicans in sympathy with the objects of the ? lob are cordially invited to aid as in its formation . Respectfully , JOHN N. DRAKE . Accompanying this was the following note : Mee SIR : If the object as outlined in the inclosed meets your approval , will you kindly glen the - application and circulate it among your active Republican friends ! When you bare completed such a canvass as you are able to make in the interest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible to yours truly , JOHN N. DRAKE . Post office ; Boa 1,775 , Chairman of Committee on Organization . The circulars were not dated as to the day of " the month . Some of them , it is asserted , were sent out after the election , As one Republican said yesterday : e This is a fine time for us to got up a big club . With our National Committee $39,000 in debt , our State Committee $19,000 In debt , and our County Committee something like $6,000 in debt , I thin ) ; we had bettor square up before we get into any more debt for clubs or anything else . " The Empire Stare Club has not been much heard of lately , but it was learned yesterday that the scheme is simply lying dormant for the time being . But that clubhouse " near the Fifth Avenue Hotel " is still away at the other end of ' a long vista that reaches into the future . It remains to be seen how closely allied to Byrnes 's scheme is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Clarkson and Byrnes in other matters are the men who are most prominently named in connection with the Empire State Club scheme . Vi hat is the reason for this extraordinary effort that is being made to secure money for the Republican cause t is a question that is likely to be asked by some folk who have not looked closely into the matter . in the first place , the result of the last campaign in this city not only tightened up tee Republican purse , but it has made many mannfacturers who have contributed liberally to the Republican national cause in other years feel more inclined to contribute to the Democratic cause next year . They can not see where they are coming in under the bill . Besides , every one who knows anything about politics knows that Republican plans indicate that the Republican managers in this State are not going to depart from the Quay-Platt tactics of 1888 . These taotios will require an enormous corruption fund for 1892.                 @ @ @ @
