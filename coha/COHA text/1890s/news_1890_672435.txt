txt Some time ago the Admiralty decided to send out torpedo boats to Halifax to strengthen the defensive powers of the port , and docks were constructed in view of the advent of these miniature war vessels . The boats chosen were Nos. 81 and 62 , and they arrived here this mornink in company with the troopship Tyne . These are the first torpedo boats ever on this station , and they are attracting much attention . They were commissioned June 3 , with a complement of sixteen officers and men to each boat . The start from Sheerness was made June 7 . Portsmouth and Torquay were called at and brief stays made at each , and Plymouth was reached June 10 . The two boats sailed from Plymouth with the troopship Tyne June 13 , and . made Queenstown after a Tonga passage the next day , June 14 . After clearing the harbor of Queelafffewn the Tyne took the two torpedo boats in tow and made a good run for six miles , When a thick fog was encountered which caused delay . June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the torpedo boats tells this story of the voyage : " The sea in a short time was running sufficiently high to make the pitching and rolling of the boats very uncomfortable . Capt . Goodrich of the Tyne then began using oil to break the force of the sea and so enable the boats to ride more easily . The oil did all that was required of it , and things began to be more comfortable . Some idea of the force of the sea may be estimated from the fact that in one night thirty gallons of oil were used before any effect was produced . Tuesday , . Tune 17 , during a lull the boats were run alongside the Tynk and coaled and ' watered . Three days later , when things were at their worst , Capt . Goodrich made the signal : ' The worst of the weather over ; Captain , officers , and men of the Tyna sympathize with the officers and crews of the boats in their great discomfort . ' " The signal was fully appreciated by all hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , June 22 , the weather had moderated sufficiently to enable us once more to supply the boats with coal and water , but by 8 P. M. the weather became so bad that No. 61 , the stearnmost boat , carried away her towing hawser , and with 360 feet of three-andone-half-inch wire was forced to ride out the gale by herself . Meanwhile , on board the Tyne , the greatest anxiety prevailed as the lights of No. 61 on several occasions , especially during heavy hail squalls , disappeared , and it was feared that she was in a bad way . A consultation was held as to the advisability of turning the Tyne and putting back to her relief , but this was found to bo impracticable , as any attempt in that direction would imperil the safety of No , 62 , the boat in tow . Had it been required , no lifeboat could have been sent to the assistance of No , 61 , with any chance or living against the sea that was running . As may be imagined , it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 81 safely under the ship 's lee In the morning . " By Monday , June 23 , at noon , the wind and sea had both abated , and the folio wing morning , N o. 61. having once more beentaken in tow . the weather was so improved as to allow of a good run being made on that and the succeeding day . June 17 we were overtaken by fog and our speed was considerably reduced . Bad running was made on Saturday and Sunday up to 7:30 P. 11. owing to the fog , but after that we , eot through the thick weather and once more sighted land , and at the same time was introduced to our first icebergs . " To those on board to whom these were a new experience it seemed incredible that such huge masses could be anything but islands , and it was only after passing within a short distance of one that they were convinced . The land sighted proved to be Baccilew Island , some fifty miles to the northward of St. Soluas , Newfoundland , prey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opposite direction to that which might have been expected . Our course was shaped for St. John 's , and a nasty night was experienced by the Captain and officers of the watch on board the Tyne , as the course had to be constantly altered to clear icebergs . The morning round us in St. John 's Harbor . The run from St. John 's to Halifax was unmarked by anything in particular . Fog was experienced the whole way . " Life on board the torpedo boats , according to those who came over in them , is decidedly not all beer and skittles . To begin with , the freeboard of the boats is so low that any sea larger than a ripple is fairly certain to wash down fore and aft . Cooking in bad weather was found impossible . At one period of the voyage Boat No. 62 made five feet of water every two hours . Torpedo Boats Nos. 61 and 62 , which are in many respects similar to the - United States torpedo boat Cushing , were built by Yarrow &; Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125 feet in length and 13 feet in breadth , and have a trial displacement of sixty-two tons . They draw forward 1 foot 7 inches , aft 6 feet 3 inches . They have a coal capacity of eighteen tons , and can develop a speed of nineteen knots and about six hundred and fifty indicated horse power . Their armament consists of five torpedo guns , two three-pounder Hotchkiss quick-tiring guns , two two-barreled Nordenfelclt guns , and they carry an electric search light . The Tyne brought out eighty men for the West Riding Regiment . ?
