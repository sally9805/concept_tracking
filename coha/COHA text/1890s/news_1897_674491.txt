txt The Senate Finance Committee has made the crockery and china schedule of the tariff a deliberate and cruel imposition on the poorer classes . We give in our columns this morning some statements from tradesmen intimately acquainted with the crockery business , to which we call especial attention . They all agree that the duties have been arranged so as to exact most from the cheaper articles of general use and necessity , while allowing the finer and more costly goods , which in effect are luxuries that only the rich or wellto-do can afford to buy , to go with a much lighter tax .

Moreover , with the development of industry and invention , prices tend steadily downward . This tendency is strongest in staple goods , which , having a wide use , can be turned out with the greatest advantage from improved methods . As , under this tendency , the poor man 's " stone ware " falls in the foreign market , the tariff , by its specific duty , takes a larger and larger share of the price . He pays 100 per cent . this year , and the same tax , before the tariff can be changed , becomes 130 per cent. , 130 per cent. , and easily may be even more . Meanwhile the corresponding change in the duty on costly articles amounts to very little . What is the origin of this wicked discrimination ? We regret to say that the centre from which the greatest influence is exerted in its support is East Liverpool , Ohio , close to the town of Canton .                @ @ @ @ @
