Higginson , Thomas Wentworth , 1823-1911 : JOY COMETH WITH THE MORNING . from Poems , in Such as they are ( 1893 ) Out of the dreams and the dust of ages , Hindu reverie , Hebrew boy , Deeds of heroes and lore of sages , Comes the hope that turns earth to joy . But the rosy light of the morning teaches A blither knowledge than books can tell , And the song that rings through the orchard preaches The ceaseless message that all is well . Hark to the lesson that Nature meaneth ! List to the breeze on the pine-clad hill ! See , the sun-rays stream to the zenith ! Thrice the oriole whistles shrill . Myriad odors are faint and tender , Sweet notes come from the woodlands far . Draw fresh life from the day 's new splendor , Pluck thy hope from the morning star ! ALBUM VERSES FOR CHILDREN .
