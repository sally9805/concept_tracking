DECEMBER , 1890 . LIFE IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE THE DISCOVERY . No. 2 . GOLD BY JOHN BIDWELL ( PIONEER OF 41 ) . THE party whose fortunes I have followed across the plains1 was not only the first that went direct to California from the East ; we were probably the first white people , except Bonneville 's party of 1833 , that ever crossed the Sierra Nevada . Dr. Marsh 's ranch , the first settlement reached by us in California , was located in the eastern foothills of the Coast Range Mountains , near the northwestern extremity of the great San Joaquin Valley and about six miles east of Monte Diablo , which may be called about the geographical center of Contra Costa County . There were no other settlements in the valley ; it was , apparently , still just as new as when Columbusdiscovered America , and roaming over it were countless thousands of wild horses , of elk , and of antelope . It had been one ofthe driest years everknownin California . The country was brownand parched ; throughout the State wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving for grass , and the people , except perhaps a few of the best families , were without bread , and were eating chiefly meat , and that often of a very poor quality . Dr. Marsh had come into California four or five years before by way of New Mexico . He was in some respects a remarkable man . In command of the English language I have scarcely ever seen his equal . He had never studied medicine , I believe , but was a great reader : sometimes he would lie in bed all 1 See " The First Emigrant Train to California , " in THE CENTURY for November , 1890 .

In fact , with the exception of Dr. Marsh there was then no physician of any kind anywhere in California . We were overjoyed to find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found him one of the mostselfish of mortals . The night of our arrival he killed two pigs for us.2 We felt very grateful , for we had by no means recovered from starving on poor mule meat , and when he set his Indian cook to making tortillas ( little cakes ) for us , giving one to each ,  --  there were thirty-two in our party ,  --  we felt even more grateful ; and especially when we learned that he had had to use some of his seed wheat , for he had no other . Hearing that there was no such thing as money in the country , and that butcherknives , guns , ammunition , and everything of that kind were better than money , we expressed our gratitude the first night to the doctor by presents - one giving a can of powder , another a bar of lead or a butcher-knife , and another a cheap but serviceable set of surgical instruments . The next morning I rose early , among the first , in order to learn from our host something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could go ,  --  and , strange as it may seem , he would scarcely answer a question . He seemed to be in an ill humor , and among other things he said , " The company has already been over a hundred dollars expense to me , and God knows whether I will ever get a real of it or not . " I was at a loss to account for this , and went out and tol*zl some of 2 Men reduced to living on poor meat , and almost starving , have an intense longing for anything fat . 163 YOL . XLI .

We held a consultation and resolved to leave as soon as convenient .

After the others had left I started off traveling south , and came to what is now called Livermore Valley , then known as Livermore 's Ranch , belonging to Robert Livermore , a native of England . He had left a vessel when a mere boy , and had married and lived like the native Californians , and , like them , was very expert with the lasso . Livermore 's was the frontier ranch , and more 1 The rancheros marked and branded their stock differently so as to distinguish them . But it was not possible to keep them separate .

That valley was full of wild cattle ,  --  thousands of them ,  --  and they were more dangerous to one on foot , as I was , than grizzly bears . By dodging into the gulches and behind trees I made my way to a Mexican ranch at the extreme west end of the valley , where I staid all night . This was one of the noted ranches , and belonged to a Californian called Don Josi Maria Amador-more recently , to a man named Dougherty.1 Next day , seeing nothing to encourage me , I started to return to Marsh 's ranch . On the way , as I came to where two roads , or rather paths , converged , I fell in with one of the fourteen men , M. C. Nye , who had started for San Jos&amp; He seemed considerably agitated , and reported that at the Mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of San Jose , all the men had been arrested and put in prison by General Vallejo , Mexican commander-in-chief of the military under Governor Alvarado , he alone having been sent back to tell Marsh and to have him come forthkill the most of the other 's cattle . Cattle in those days were often killed for the hides alone . One day a man saw Amador kill a fine steer belonging to Livermore . When be reached Livermore 's - ten or fifteen miles away - and told him what Amador had done , he found Livermore skinning a steer of Amador 's SACRAMENTO VALLEY . // with to explain why this armed force had invaded the country . We reached Marsh 's after dark . The next day the doctor started down to the Mission of San Jose , nearly thirty miles distant , with a list of the company , which I gave him . He was gone about three days . Meanwhile we sent word to the men on the San Joaquin River to let them know what had taken place , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Marsh came back he said ominously , " Now , men , I want you all to come into the house and I will tell you your fate . " We all went in , and he announced , " You men that have five dollars can have passports and remain in the country and go where you please . " The fact was he had simply obtained passports for the asking ; they had cost him nothing . The men who had been arrested at the Mission had been liberated as soon as their passports were issued to them , and they had at once proceeded on their way to San if os ( i . But five dollars ! I do n't suppose any one had five dollars ; nine-tenths of them probably had not a cent of money . The names were called and each man settled , giving the amount in something , and if unable to make it up in money or effects he would give his note for the rest . All the names were called except my own . There was no passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I had furnished him with the list of our names myself . Possibly his idea was-as others surmised and afterwards told me - that , lacking a passport , I would stay at his ranch and make a useful hand to work . The next morning before day found me starting for the Mission of San Jos6 to get a passport for myself . Mike Nye , the man who had brought the news of the arrest , went with me . A friend had lent me a poor old horse , fit only to carry my blankets . I arrived in a heavy rain-storm , and was marched into the calaboose and kept there three days with nothing to eat , and the fleas were so numerous as to cover and darken anything of a light color . There were four or five Indians in the prison . They were ironed , and they kept tolling a bell , as a punishment , I suppose , for they were said to have stolen horses ; possibly they belonged to the Horse-thief tribes east of the San Joaquin Valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window I made a motion to an Indian boy outside and he brought me a handful of beans and a handful of maiifeca , which is used by Mexicans instead of lard . It seemed as if they were going to starve me to death . After having been there three days II saw through the door a man whom , from his light hair , I took to be an American , although he was clad in the wild picturesque garb of a native Californian , including serape and the huge spurs used by the vaquero . I had the sentry at the door hail him . He proved to be an American , a resident of the Pueblo of San Jos6 , named Thomas Bowen , and he kindly went to Vallejo , who was right across the way in the big Mission building , and procured for me the passport . I think I have that passport now , signed by Vallejo and written in Spanish by Victor Prudon , secretary of Vallejo . Every one at the Mission pronounced Marsh 's action an outrage ; such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man by the name of Sutter was starting a colony a hundred miles away to the north in the Sacramento Valley .

( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY BRADLEY &amp; RULOFRON , LENT BY LOYALL FARRAGUT. ) // done I now determined to go to Sutter 's , afterward called " Sutter 's Fort , " or New Helvetia . Dr. Marsh said we could make the journey in two days , but it took us eight . Winter had come in earnest , and winter in California then , as now , meant rain . I had three companions . It was wet when we started , and much of the time we traveled through a pouring rain . Streams were out of their banks ; gulches were swimming ; plains were inundated ; indeed , most of the country was overflowed . There were no roads , merely paths , trodden only by Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths , even when they were under water , for the moment our animals stepped to one side down they went into the mire . Most of the way was through the region now lying between Lathrop and Sacramento . We got out of provisions and were about three days without food . Game was plentiful , but hard to shoot in the rain . Besides , it was impossible to keep our old flint-lock guns dry , and especially the powder dry in the pans . On the eighth day we came to Sutter 's settlement ; the fort had not then been begun . Sutter received us with open arms and in a princely fashion , for he was a man of the most polite address and the most courteous manners , a man who could shine in any society . Moreover , our coming was not unexpected to him . It will be remembered that in the Sierra Nevada one of our men named Jimmy John became separated from the main party . It seems that he came on into California , and , diverging into the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little before we reached Dr. Marsh 's . Through this man Sutter heard that our company of thirty men were already somewhere in California . He immediately loaded two mules with provisions taken out of his private stores , and sent two men with them in search of us . But they did not find us , and returned , with the provisions , to Sutter 's . Later , after a long search , the same two men , having been sent out again by Sutter , struck our trail and followed it to Marsh 's . John A. Sutter was born in Baden in 1803 of Swiss parents , and was proud of his connection with the only republic of consequence inEurope . He was a warm admirer of the United States , and some of his friends had persuaded him to come across the Atlantic . He first went to a friend in Indiana with whom he staid awhile , helping to clear land , but it was business that he was not accustomed to . So he made his way to St. Louis and invested what means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexi OLD RUSSIAN BUILDING . FONT ROSS . // can trader to Santa F6 . Having been unsuccessful at Santa F* , he returned to St. Louis , joined a party of trappers , went to the Rocky Mountains , and found his way down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver . There he formed plans for trying to get down to the coast of California to establish a colony . He took a vessel that went to the Sandwich Islands , and there communicated his plans to people who assisted him . But as there was no vessel going direct from the Sandwich Islands to California , he had to take a Russian vessel by way of Sitka . He got such credit and help as he could in the Sandwich Islands and induced five or six natives to accompany him to start the contemplated colony . He expected to send to Europe and the United States for his colonists . When he came to the coast of California , in 1840 , he had an interview with the governor , Alvarado , and obtained permission to explore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the bay of San Francisco , procured a small boat and explored the largest river he could find , and selected the site where the city of Sacramento now stands . A short time before we arrived Sutter had bought out the Russian-American Fur Company at Fort Ross and Bodega on the Pacific . That company had a charter from Spain to take furs , but had no right to the land . The GENERAL JOHN A. SUTTER . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH RY BRADLRY &amp; RULOFSON. ) // charter had about expired . Against the protest of the California authorities they had extended their settlement southward some twenty miles farther than they had anyrightto , and had occupied the country to , and even beyond , the bay of Bodega . The time came when the taking of furs was no longer profitable ; the Russians were ordered to vacate and return to Sitka . They wished to sell out all their personal property and whatever remaining right they had to the land . So Sutter bought them out - cattle and horses ; a little vessel of about twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including forty odd pieces of old rusty cannon and one or two small brass pieces , with a quantity of old French flint-lock muskets pronounced by Sutter to be of those lost by Bonaparte in 1812 in his disastrous retreat from Moscow . This ordnance Sutter conveyed up the Sacramento River on the launch to his colony . As soon as the native Californians heard that he had bought out the Russians and was beginning to fortify himself by taking up the cannon they began to fear him . They were doubtlessjealous because Americans and other foreigners had already commenced to make the place their headquarters , and they foresaw that Sutter 's fort would be for them , especially for Americans , what it naturally did become in fact , a place of protection and general rendezvous ; and so they threatened to break it up . Sutter had not as yet actually received his grant ; he had simply taken prelim mary steps and had obtained permission to settle and proceed to colonize . These threats were made before he had begun the fort , much less built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many Indians whom he had collected about him , and a few white men ( perhaps fifteen or twenty ) and some Sandwich Islanders . When he heard of the coming of our thirty men he inferred at once that we would soon reach him and be an additional protection . With this feeling of security , even before the arrival of our party Sutter was so indiscreet as to write a letter to the governor or to some one in authority , saying that he wanted to hear no more threats of dispossession , for he was now able not only to defend himself but to go and chastise them . That letter having been despatched to the city of Mexico , the authorities there sent a new governor in 1842 with about six hundred troops to subdue Sutter . But the new governor , Manuel Micheltorena , was an intelligent man . He knew the history of California and was aware that nearly all of his predecessors had been expelled by insurrections of the native Californians . Sutter sent a courier to meet the governor before his arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveying his greetings to the governor , expressing a most cordial welcome , and submitting cheerfully and entirely to his authority . In this way the governor and Sutter became fast friends , and through Sutter the Americans had a friend in Governor Micheltorena . SUTTER 'S FORT . ( REDRAWN FROM A PHOTOGRAPH OF AR OLD PRINT. ) // The first employment I had in California was in Sutter 's service , about two months after our arrival at Marsh 's . He engaged me to go to Bodega and Fort Ross and to stay there until he could finish removing the property which he had bought from the Russians . I remained there fourteen months , until everything was removed ; then I came up into Sacramento Valley and took charge for Sutter of his Hock farm ( so named from a large Indian village on the place ) , remaining there a little more than a year-in 1843 and part of 1844 . Nearly everybody who came to California made it a point to reach Sutter 's Fort.1 Sutter was one of the most liberal and hospitable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all the same . He had peculiar traits : his necessities compelled him to take all he could buy , and he paid all he could pay ; but he failed to keep up with his payments . And so he soon found himself immensely - almost hopelessly - involved in debt . His debt to the Russians amounted at first to something near one hundred thousand dollars . Interest increased apace . He had agreed to pay in wheat , but his crops failed . He struggled in every way , sowing large areas to wheat , increasing his cattle and horses , and trying to build a flouring mill . He kept his launch running to and from the bay , carrying down hides , tallow , furs , wheat , etc. , returning with lumber sawed by hand in the redwood groves nearest the bay and other supplies . On an average 1 Every year after the arrival of our party , in 1841 , immigrant parties came across the plains to California ; except in 1842 , when they went to Oregon , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1841 being the first , let me add that a later party arrived in California in 1841 . It was composed of about twenty-five persons who arrived at Westport , Mo. , too late to come with us , and so went with the annual caravan of St. Louis traders to Santa F* , and thence via the Gila River into Southern California . Among the more noted arrivals on this coast I may mention : 1841. - Commodore Wilkes 's Exploring Expedition , a party of which came overland from Oregon to California , under Captain Riuggold , I think . 1542. - Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones , who raised the American flag in Monterey . 1843. - First . L. W. Hastings , via Oregon . He was ambitious to make California a republic and to be its first president , and wrote an iridescent book to VOL . XLI. - 23. it took a month to make a trip . The fare for each person was five dollars , including board . Sutter started many other new enterprises in order to find relief from his embarrassments but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every year found him worse and worse off ; but it was partly his own fault . He employed men - not because he always needed and could profitably employ them , but because in the kindness of his heart it simply became a habit to employ everybody who wanted employment . As long as he had anything he trusted any one with everything he wanted - responsible or otherwise , acquaintances and strangers alike . Most of the labor was done by Indians , chiefly wild ones , except a few from the Missions who spoke Spanish . The wild ones learned Spanish so far as they learned anything , that being the language of the country , and everybody had to learn some- induce immigration ,  --  which came in s84fi ,  --  but found the American flag flying when he returned with the immigration he had gone to meet .

The number of men employed by Sutter may be stated at from 100 to *oo - the latter number at harvest time .

The Missions in California invariably had gardens with grapes , olives , figs , pomegranates , pears , and apples , but the ranches scarcely ever had any fruit.1 When you wanted a horse to ride , you would take it to the next ranch - it might be twenty , thirty , or fifty miles - and turn it out there , and sometime or other in reclaiming his stock the owner would get it back . In this way you might travel from one end of California to the other . The ranch life was not confined to the 1 With the exception of the tuna , or prickly pear , these were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except oranges , lemons , and limes , in a few places . country , it prevailed in the towns too . There was not a hotel in San Francisco , or Monterey , or anywhere in California , till 1846 , when the Americans took the country . The priests at the Missions were glad to entertain strangers without charge . They would give you a room in which to sleep , and perhaps a bedstead with a hide stretched across it , and over that youwould spread your blankets . At this time there was not in California any vehicle except a rude California cart ; the wheels were without tires , and were made by felling an oak tree and hewing it down till it made a solid wheel nearly a foot thick on the rim and a little larger where the axle went through . The hole for the axle would be eight or nine inches in diameter , but a few years ' use would increase it to a foot . To make the hole , an auger , gouge , or chisel was sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small tree required but little hewing and shaping to answer for an axle . These carts were always drawn by oxen , the yoke being lashed with rawhide to the horns . To lubricate the axles they used soap ( that is one thing the Mexicans could make ) , carrying along for the purpose a big pail of thick soapsuds which was constantly put in the box or hole ; but you could generally tell when a California cart was coming half a mile away by the squeaking . I have seen the families of the wealthiest people go long distances at the rate of thirty miles or more a day , visiting in one of these clumsy two-wheeled vehicles . They had a little framework around it made of round sticks , and a bullock hide was put in for a floor or bottom . Sometimes the better class would ha*ye a little calico for curtains and cover . There was no such thing as a spoked wheel in use then . Somebody sent from Boston a wagon // 0 LL* 0 0 0 // as a present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose , but as soon as summer came the woodwork shrunk , the tires came oft ; and it all fell to pieces . There was no one in California to set tires . When Governor Micheltorena was sent from Mexico to California he brought with him an ambulance , not much better than a common spring wagon , such as a marketman would now use with one horse . It had shafts , but in California at that time there was no horse broken to work in them , nor was there such a thing known as a harness* so the governor had two mounted vaqueros to pull it , their reatas being fastened to the shafts and to the pommels of their saddles . The first wagons brought into California came across the plains in 1844 with the Townsend or Stevens party . They were left in the mountains and lay buried under the snow till the following spring , when Moses Schallenberger , Elisha Stevens ( who was the captain of the party ) , and others went up and brought some of the wagons down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California across the plains.1 Elisha Stevens was from Georgia and had there worked in the gold mines . He started Mr. Schallenberger still lives at San Jos* . He remained a considerable part of the winter alone with the wagons , which were buried under the snow . When the last two men made a desperate effort to escape over the mountains into California , Schallenberger tried to go with thens , but was unable to bear the across the plains with the express purpose of finding gold . When he got into the Rocky Mountains , as I was told by his friend Dr. Townsend , Stevens said , " We are in a gold country . " One evening ( when they camped for the night ) he went into a gulch , took some gravel and washed it and got the color of gold , thus unmistakably showing , as he afterwards did in Lower California , that he had considerable knowledge of gold mining . But the strange thing is , that afterwards , when he passed up and down several times over the country between Bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spring of 1845 to bring down their wagons , he should have seen no signs of gold where subsequently the whole country was found to contain it . The early foreign residents of California were largely runaway sailors . Many if not most would change their names . For instance , Gilroy 's ranch , where the town of Gilroy is now located , was owned by an old resident under the assumed appellation of Gilroy . Of course vessels touching upon this coast were liable , as they were everywhere , to lose men by desertion , especially if the men were maltreated . Such things have been so common that it is fatigue , aud so returned about fifteen miles to the cabin they had left near Donner Lake ( as it was afterward called ) , where he remained , threatened with starvation , till one of the party returned from the Sacramento Valley and rescued him . HUNTINO A RUNAWAY SAILOR . // not difficult to believe that those who left their vessels in early days on this then distant coast had cause for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stain upon a man 's character . It was no uncommon thing , after my arrival here , for sailors to be skulking and hiding about from ranch to ranch till the vessel they had left should leave the coast . At Amador 's ranch , before mentioned , on my first arrival here , I met a sailor boy , named Harrison Pierce , of eighteen or twenty years , who was concealing himself till his vessel should go to sea . He managed to escape recapture and so remained in the country . He was one of the men who went with me from Marsh 's ranch to Sutter 's . Californians would catch and return sailors to get the reward which , I believe , captains of vessels invariably offered . After the vessels had sailed and there was no chance of the reward the native Californians gave the fugitives no further trouble . At that time the only trade , foreign or domestic , was in hides , tallow , and furs ; but mostly hides . With few exceptions the vessels that visited the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and trade for hides . ' Occasionally vessels would put in for water or in distress . San Francisco was the principal harbor ; the next was Monterey . There was an anchorage off San Luis Obispo ; the next was Santa Barbara , the next San Buenaventura , then San Pedro , and lastly San Diego . ( See map . ) The hides were generally collected and brought to San Diego and there salted , staked out to dry , and folded so that they would lie compactly in the ship , and thence were shipped to Boston . Goods were principally sold on board the vessels : there were very few stores on land ; that of Thomas 0 . Larkin at Monterey was the principal one . The entrance of a vessel into harbor or roadstead was a signal to all the ranchers to come in their little boats and launches laden with hides to trade for goods . Thus vessels went from port to port , remaining few or many days according to the amount of trade .

Larkin received his commission as American consul for California , at Mazatlan , in 1844 . On his return to Monterey the woman who washed his clothes took the small-pox . Larkin 's whole family had it ; it spread , and the number of deaths was fearful , amounting to over eighty . When I first saw Santa Barbara , February 5 , 1845 , the old Mission buildings were the principal ones . The town - probably half a mile to the east - contained possibly one hundred persons , among whom I recall Captain Wilson , Dr. Nicholas Den , Captain Scott , Mr. Sparks , Nibever ; and of natives , Pablo De la Guerra , Carlos Antonio , Carillo , and others .

Subsequently , after the revolt of September , 1846 , San Diego was the point from which , in January , 1847 , the final conquest of California was made . THE FIRST CALIFORNIA JAIL , MONTEREY .

When the story came out his career as a doctor was at an end , and he soon after left the country . In 1841 there was likewise no lawyer in California . In 1843 a lawyer named Hastings arrived via Oregon . He was an ambitious man , and desired to wrest the country from Mexico and make it a republic . He disclosed his plan to a man who revealed it to me . His scheme was to go down to Mexico and make friends of the Mexican authorities , if possible get a grant of land , and then go into Texas , consult President Houston , and go East and write a book , praising the country to the skies , which he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start a large immigration , and in this he succeeded . The book was published in 1845 , and undoubtedly largely induced what was called the " great immigration " of 1846 across the plains , consisting of about six hundred . Hastings returned to California in the autumn of 1845 , preparatory to taking steps to declare the country independent and to establish a republic and make 1 New Mexican miners invariably carried their gold ( which was generally small , and small in quantity as well ) in a large quill- that of a vulture or turkey buzzard . Sometimes these quills would hold three or himself president . In 1846 he went back to meet the immigration and to perfect his plans so that the emigrants would know exactly where to go and what to do . But in 1846 the Mexican war intervened , and while Hastings was gone to meet the immigration California was taken possession of by the United States . These doubtless were the first plans ever conceived for the independence of California . Hastings knew there were not enough Arnericans and foreigners yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get money to publish his book , and went about lecturing on temperance in Ohio , where he became intimate with a fellow by the name of McDonald , who was acting the Methodist preacher and pretending , with considerable success , to raise funds for missionary purposes . At last they separated , McDonald preceding Hastings to San Francisco , where he became bartender for a man named Vioget , who owned a saloon and a billiard table - the first , I think , on the Pacific coast . Hastings returned later , and , reaching San Francisco in a cold rain , went up to Vioget 's and called for brandy . He poured out a glassful and was about to drink it , when McDonald , recognizing him , leaned over the bar , extended his hand , and said , " My good temperance friend , how are you ? " Hastings in great surprise looked him in the eyes , recognized him , and said , " My d*ar Methodist brother , how do you do ? " It is not generally known that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what is now a part of Los Angeles County . The yield was not rich ; indeed , it was so small that it made no stir . The discoverer was an old Canadian Frenchman by the name of Baptiste Ruelle , who had been a trapper with the Hudson Bay Company , and , as was not an infrequent case with those trappers , had drifted down into New Mexico , where he had worked in placer mines . The mines discovered by Ruelle in California attracted a few New Mexicans , by whom they were worked for several years . But as they proved too poor , Ruelle himself came up into the Sacramento Valley , five hundred miles away , and engaged to work for Sutter when I was in Sutter 's service.1 Now it so happened that almost every year a party of a dozen men or more would come from or return to Oregon . Of such parties some - perhaps most of them - would be Canadian French , who had trapped all over the country , and these were generally the guides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party was getting ready to go to Oregon . four ounces , and , being translucent , they were graduated so as to see at any time the quantity in them . The gold was kept in by a stopper . Ruelle had such a quill , which appeared to have been carried for years . // CANON OF THE AMERICAN RIVER . Baptiste Ruelle had been in Sutter 's employ several months , when one day he came to Sutter , showed him a few small particles of gold , and said he had found them on the American River , and he wanted to go far into the mountains on that stream to prospect for gold . For this purpose he desired two mules loaded with provisions , and he selected two notedly stupid Indian boys whom he wanted to go into the mountains with him , saying he would have no others . Of course he did not get the outfit . Sutter and I talked about it and queried , What does he want with so much provision - the American River being only a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he want those two stupid boys , since he might be attacked by the Indians ? Our conclusion was that he really wanted the outfit so that he could join the party and go to Oregon and remain . Such I believe was Ruelle 's intention ; though in 1848 , after James W. Marshall had discovered the gold at Coloma , Ruelle , who was one of the first to go there and mine , still protested that he had discovered gold on the American River in i843 . The only thing that I can recall to lend the least plausibility to Ruelle 's pretensions would be that , so far as I know , he never , after that onetime , manifested any desire to go to Oregon , and remained in California till he died . But I should add , neither did he ever show any longing again to go into the mountains to look for gold during the subsequent years he remained with Sutter , even to the time of Marshall 's discovery . Early in the spring of 1844 , a Mexican working under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ON THE SUMMIT OF THE SIERRA . Sutter came to me and told me there was gold in the Sierra Nevada . His name was Pablo Gutierrez The discovery by Marshall , it will be remembered , was in January , 1848 . Pablo told me this at a time when I was calling him to account because he had absented himself the day before without permission . I was giving him a lecture in Spanish , which I could speak quite well in those days . Like many Mexicans , he had an Indian wife ; some time before , he had been in the mountains and had bought a squaw . She had run away from // him , and he had gone to find and bring her back . And it was while he was on this trip , he said , that he had seen signs of gold . After my lecture he said , " Sefior , I have made an important discovery ; there surely is gold on Bear River in the mountains . " This was in March , 1844 . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear River . We went five or six miles intothemountains , when he showed me the signs and the place where he thought the gold was . " Well , " I said , " can you not find some ? " No , he said , because he must have a ba/ca . He talked so much about the " batea " that I concluded it must be a complicated machine . " Ca n't Mr. Keiser , our saddle-tree maker , make the batea ? " I asked . " Oh , no . " I did not then know that a batea is nothing more nor less than a wooden bowl which the Mexicans use for washing gold . I said , " Pablo , where can you get it ? " He said , " Down in Mexico . " I said , " I will help pay your expenses if you will go down and get one , " which he promised to do . I said , " Pablo , say nothing to anybody else about this gold discovery , and we will get thebatea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to let him go to Mexico , lest when he got among his relatives he might be induced to stay and not come back , so I made a suggestion to him . I said , " Pablo , let us. save our earnings and get on a vessel and go around to Boston , and there get the batea ; I can interpret for you , and the Yankees are very ingenious and can make anything . " The idea pleased him , and he promised to go as soon as we could save enough to pay our expenses . He was to keep it a secret , and I believe he faithfully kept his promise . It would have taken us a year or two to get money enough to go . In those days there were every year four or five arrivals , sometimes six , of vessels laden with goods from Boston to trade for hides in California . These vessels brought around all classes of goods needed by the Mexican people . It would have required about six months each way , five months being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , our plans were interrupted . In the autumn of that year , 1844 , a revolt took place . The native chiefs of California , Jose Castro and ex-Governor Alvarado , succeeded in raising an insurrection against the Mexican governor , Micheltorena , to expel him from the country . They accused him of being friendly to Americans and of giving them too much land . The truth was , he had simply shown impartiality . When Americans had been here long enough , had conducted themselves properly , and had complied with the colonization laws of Mexico , he had given them lands as readily as to native-born citizens . He was a fair-minded man and an intelligent and good governor , and wished to develop the country . His friendship for Americans was a mere pretext ; for his predecessor , Alvarado , and his successor , Pio Pico , also granted lands freely to foreigners , and among them to Americans . The real cause of the insurrection against Micheltorena , however , was that the native chiefs had become hungry to get hold again of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and became their main excuse . The English and French influence , so far as felt , evidently leaned towards the side A THE ANCHORAGE OF MONTEREY FROM THE OLO BURIAL-OROUNO. // of the Californians . It was not open but it was felt , and not a few expressed the hope that England or France would some day seize and hold California . I believe the Gachupines - natives of Spain , of whom there were a few - did not participate in the feeling against the Americans , though few did much , if anything , to allay it . In October Sutter went from Sacramento to Monterey , the capital , to see the governor . I went with him . On our way thither , at San Jose , we heard the first mutterings of the insurrection . We hastened to Monterey , and were the first to communicate the fact to the governor . Sutter , alarmed , took the first opportunity to get away by water . There were in those days no mail routes , no public conveyances of any kind , no regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel happened to touch at Monterey , and Sutter took passage to the bay of San Francisco , and thence by his own launch reached home . In a few days the first blow was struck , the insurgents taking all the horses belonging to the government at Monterey , setting the governor and all his troops on foot . He raised a few horse as best he could and pursued them , but could not overtake them on foot . However , I understood that a sort of parley took place at or near San Jose , but no battle , surrender , or settlement . Meanwhile , having started to return by land to Sutter 's Fort , two hundred miles distant , I met the governor returning to Monterey . He stopped his forces and talked with me half an hour and confided to me his plans . He desired me to beg the Americans to be loyal to Mexico ; to assure them that he was their friend , and in due time would give them all the lands to which they were entitled . He sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Mission of San Jose and there fell in with the insurgents , who had made that place their headquarters ; I staid all night , and the leaders , Castro and Alvarado , treated me like a prince . The two insurgents protested their friendship for the Americans , and sent a request to Sutter to support them . On my arrival at the fort the situation was fully considered , and all , with a single exception , concluded to support Micheltorena . He had been our friend ; he had granted us land ; he promised , and we felt that we could rely upon , his continued friendship ; and we felt , indeed we knew , we could not repose the same confidence in the native Californians . This man Pablo Gutierrez , who had told me about the gold in the Sieria Nevada , was a native of 1 The insurrection ende4 in the capitulation- I might call it expulsion - of Micheltorena . The causes which led to this result were various , some of them infamous . Pio Pico , being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Castro Sinaloa in Mexico , and sympathized with the Mexican governor and with us . Sutter sent him with despatches to the governor , stating that we were organizing and preparing to join him . Pablo returned , and was sent again to tell the governor that we were on the march to join him at Monterey . This time he was taken prisoner with our despatches and was hanged to a tree , somewhere near the present town of Gilroy . That of course put an end to our gold discovery ; otherwise Pablo Gutierrez might have been the discoverer instead of Marshall.1 But I still had it in my mind to try to find gold ; so early in the spring of 1845 I made it a point to visit the mines in the south discovered by Ruelle in 1841 . They were in the mountains about twenty miles north or northeast of the Mission of San Fernando , or say fifty miles from Los Angeles . I wanted to see the Mexicans working there , and to gain what knowledge I could of gold digging . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was gold on Bear River was fresh in my mind ; and I hoped the same year to find time to return there and explore , and if possible find gold in the Sierra Nevada . But I had no time that busy year to carry out my purpose . The Mexicans ' slow and inefficient manner of working the mine was most discouraging . When I returned to Sutter 's Fort the same spring Sutter desired me to engage with him for a year as bookkeeper , which meant his general business man as well . His financial matters being in a bad way , I consented . I had a great deal to do besides keeping the books . Among other undertakings we sent men southeast in the Sierra Nevada about forty miles from the fort to saw lumber with a whipsaw . Two men would saw of good timber about one hundred or one hundred and twenty-five feet a day . Early in July I framed an excuse to go into the mountains to give the men some special directions about lumber needed at the fort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced . No place looked favorable for a gold discovery . I even attempted to descend into a deep gorge through which meandered a small stream , but gave it up on account of the brush and the heat . My search was fruitless . The place where Marshall discovered gold in 1848 was about forty miles to the north of the saw-pits at this place . The next spring , 1849 , I joined a party to go to the mines on and south of the CQsumne and commander-in-chief of the military . They reigned but one year , and then came the Mexican war . Castro was made governor of Lower California , and died there . Pio Pico was not a vindictive man ; he was a mild governor , and still lives at Los Angeles . // Mokelumne rivers . The first day we reached a trading post- Digg 's , I think , was the name . Several traders had there pitched their tents to sell goods . One of them was Tom Fallon , whom I knew . This post was within a few miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked Fallon if he had ever seen the old saw-pits where Sicard and Dupas had worked in 1845 . He said he had , and knew the place well . Then I told him how I had attempted that year to descend into the deep gorge to the south of it to look for gold . " My stars ! " he said . " Why , that gulch down there was one of the richest placers that have ever been found in this country " ; and he told me of men who had taken out a pint cupful of nuggets before breakfast . Fr6mont 's first visit to California was in the month of March , 1844 . He came via eastern Oregon , traveling south and passing east of the Sierra Nevada , and crossed the chain about opposite the bay of San Francisco , at the head of the American River , and descended into the Sacramento Valley to Sutter 's Fort . It was there I first met him . He staid but a short time , three or four weeks perhaps , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could obtain , and then set out on his return to the United States . Coloma , where Marshall afterward discovered gold , was on one of the branches of the American River . Fr*mont probably came down that very stream . How strange that he and his scientific corps did not discover signs of gold , as Commodore Wilkes 's party had done when coming overland from Oregon in 1841 ! One morning at the breakfast table at Sutter 's , Fr&amp;-mont was urged to remain a while and go to the coast , and among other things which it would be of interest for him to see was mentioned a very large redwood tree ( Sequoia sernj5ervirens ) near Santa Cruz , or rather a cluster of trees , forming apparently a single trunk , which was said to be seventy-two feet in circumference . I then told Fr6mont of the big tree I had seen in the Sierra Nevada in October , 1841 , which I afterwards verified to be one of the fallen big trees of the Calaveras Grove . I therefore believe myself to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California . The Sequoias are found nowhere except in California . The redwood that I speak of is the Sequoia serny5ervirens , and is confined to the sea-coast and the west side of the Coast Range Mountains . The Sequoia gigan/ea , or mammoth tree , is found only on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada-nowhere farther north than latitude 380 30 ' . Sutter 's Fort was an important point from the very beginning of the colony . The building of the fort and all subsequent immigrations added to its importance , for that was the first point of destination to those who came by way of Oregon or direct across the plains . The fort was begun in 1842 and finished in 1844 . There was no town till after the gold discovery in 1848 , when it became the bustling , buzzing center for merchants , traders , miners , etc. , and every available room was in demand . In 1849 Sacramento City was laid off on the river two miles west of the fort , and the town grew up there at once into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hastings and myself in the month of January , 1846 , about three or four miles below the mouth of the American River , and called Sutterville . But first the Mexican war , then the lull which always follows excitement , and then the rush THE OLD CUARTEL AT MONTEREY . // and roar of the gold discovery , prevented its building up till it was too late . Attempts were several times made to revive Sutterville , but Sacramento City had become too strong to be removed . Sutter always called his colony and fort " New Helvetia , " in spite of which the name mostly used by others , before the Mexican war , was Sutter 's Fort , or Sacramento , and later Sacramento altogether . Sutter 's many enterprises continued to create a growing demand for lumber . Every year , and sometimes more than once , he sent parties into the mountains to explore for an available site to build a sawmill on the Sacramento River or some of its tributaries , by which the lumber could be rafted down to the fort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mountains , but the cafion features of the streams rendered rafting impracticable . The year after the war ( 1847 ) Sutter 's needs for lumber were even greater than ever , although his embarrassments had increased and his ability to undertake new enterprises became less and less . Yet , never discouraged , nothing daunted , another hunt must be made for a sawmill site . This time Marshall happened to be the man chosen by Sutter to search the moul*tains . He was gone about a month , and returned with a most favorable report . James W. Marshall went across the plains to Oregon in 1844 , and thence came to California the next year . He was a wheelwright by trade , but , being very ingenious , he could turn his hand to almost anything . So he acted as carpenter for Sutter , and did many other things , among which I may mention making wheels for spinning wool , and looms , reeds , and shuttles for weaving yarn into coarse blankets for the Indians , who did the carding , spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall went through the war to its close as a private . Besides his ingenuity as a mechanic , he had most singular traits . Almost every one pronounced him half crazy or harebrained . He was certainlyeccentric , and perhaps somewhat flighty . His insanity , however , if he had any , was of a harmless kind ; he was neither vicious nor quarrelsome . He had great , almost overweening , confidence in his ability to do anything as a mechanic . I wrote the contract between Sutter and him to build the mill . Sutter was to furnish the means ; Marshall was to build and run the mill , and have a share of the lumber for his compensation . His idea was to haul the lumber part way and raft it down the American River to Sacramento , and thence , his part of it , down the Sacramento River , and through Suisun and San Pablo bays to San Francisco for a market . Marshall 's mind , in some respects at least , must have been unbalanced . It is hard to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark , or how any one could have selected such a site for a saxvmill under the circumstances . Surely no other man than Marshall ever entertained so wild a scheme as that of rafting sawed lumber down the cafions of the American River , and no other man than Sutter would have been so confiding and credulous as to patronize him . It is proper to say that , under great difficulties , enhanced by winter rains , Marshall succeeded in building the mill - a very good one , too , of the kind . It had improvements which I had never seen in sawmills , and I had had considerable experience in Ohio . But the A SPANISH-CALIFORNIAN TYPE . // mill would not run because the wheel was placed too low . It was an old-fashioned flutter wheel that propelled an upright saw . The gravelly bar below the mill backed the water up , and submerged and stopped the wheel . The remedy was to dig a channel or tail-race through the bar below to conduct away the water . The wild Indians of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar there would be plenty of fall . The digging was hard and took some weeks . As soon as the water began to run through the tail-race the wheel was blocked , the gate raised , and the water permitted to gush through all night . It was Marshall 's custom to examine the race while the water was running through in the morning , so as to direct the Indians where to deepen it , and then shut off the water for them to work during the day . The water was clear as crystal , and the current was swift enough to sweep away the sand and lighter materials . Marshall made these examinations early in the morning while the Indians were getting their breakfast . It was on one of these occasions , in the clear shallow water , that he saw something bright and yellow . Hepickeditupit was a piece of gold ! The world has seen and felt the result . The mill sawed little or no lum-4 , BULL AND BEAR FIGHT . her ; as a lumber enterprise the project was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand success . There was no excitement at first , nor for three or four months - because the mine was not known to be rich , or to exist anywhere except at the sawmill , or to be available to any one except Sutter , to whom every one conceded that it belonged . Time does not permit me to relate how I carried the news of the dis covery to San Francisco ; how the same year I discovered gold on Feather River and worked it ; how I made the first weights and scales to weigh the first gold for Sam Brannan ; how the richness of the mines became known by the Mormons who were employed by Sutter to work at the sawmill , working about on Sundays and finding it in the crevices along the stream and taking it to Brannan 's store at the fort , and how Brannan kept the gold a secret as long as he could till the excitement burst out all at once like wildfire . Among the notable arrivals at Sutter 's Fort should be mentioned that of Castro and Castillero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been before in California , sent , as he had been this time , as a peace commissioner from Mexico . Castro was so jealous that it was almost impossible for Sutter to have anything like a private interview with him . Sutter , however , was given to understand that , as he had stood friendly to Governor Micheltorena on the side of Mexico in the late troubles , he might rely on the friendship of Mexico , to which he was enjoined to continue faithful in all emergencies . Within a week Castillero was shown at San J os6 a singular heavy reddish rock , which had long been known to the Indians , who rubbed it on their hands and faces to paint them . The Californians had often tried to smelt this rock in a blacksmith 's fire , thinking it to be silver or some other precious metal . But Castillero , who was an intelligent man and a native of Spain , at once recognized it as quicksilver , and noted its resemblance to the cinnabar in the mines of Almaden . A company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castro , Alexander Forbes , and others were members . The discovery of quicksilver at this time seems providential in view of its absolute necessity to supplement the imminent discovery of gold , which stirred and waked into new life the industries of the world . It is a question whether the United States could have stood the shock of the great rebellion of r86i had the California gold discovery not been made . Bankers and business men of New York in 1864 did not hesitate to admit that but for the gold of California , which monthly poured its five or six millions into that financial center , the bottom would have dropped out of everything . These timely arrivals so strengthened the nerves of trade and stimulated business as to enable the Government to sell its bonds at a time when its credit was its lifeblood // and the main reliance by which to feed , clothe , and maintain its armies . Once ourbonds went down to thirty-eight cents on the dollar . California gold averted a total collapse , and enabled a preserved Union to come forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a hundred billions . The band of Providence so plainly seen in the discovery of gold is no less manifest in the time chosen for its accomplishment . I must reserve for itself in a concluding paper my personal recollections of Fr*mont 's second visit to California in 1845-46 , which I have purposely wholly omitted here . It was most important , resulting as it did in the acquisition of that territory by the United States . Jo/in B/dwell.
