txt Bugler Hayes , gorgeously arrayed , will Bound a fanfare on his bugle at 9 o'clock this morning . one of Superintendent Frank Clarke 's overgrown jockeys will swing aside the gates at the Fourth Avenue entrance to the tan-bark ring in the Madison Square Garden to admit of the entrance of a lot of horses to the enclosure , and so the Horse Show of 1593 will be inaugurated . Most of the horses that are to compete for the prizes were at the Garden yesterday . The rest , save those that are housed In stables in the city , will be there before the bugle is sounded this morning . Such animals as had arrived yesterday gave promise of a grand , good show during the week to visitors who go to see the horses rather than the crowds . Quality takes the place of quantity this year , and the change is one that is for the best . Requirements for entry to the several classes have been somewhat too lax in the past . Restrictions which will bring out better horses have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of being the best that the association has had in Its history . Hackneys and jumpers will be the strong features , which is not to be wondered at , as the two classes are especially show horses , and they make a better impression with the crowds than do the less fashionable , and , if possible , more useful horses with which the average American Is more familiar . Perhaps the Shetland ponies should be included in the list of essentially show horses that will be in the ring , for there is no class which furnishes so much delight to the children , and to ladies who are not particularly given to following the hounds , than do these miniature horses . George Greene has a fine lot of these little horses , some of which are not so big as a good St. Bernard dog , the lot being headed by the champion stallion Montreal , and includins the mares Gyp and Tirsda , both of which have their foals at their side . A large number of gentlemen were entertained at luncheon at the Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after the spread furnished by Caterer McGrath had been done full justice to these were given a " press view " of some of the cracks of the show , who were led to halter in the ring . The hackneys predominated , and a right good show they made as they cantererd gayly about in their snow-white trappings , held in check by grooms wearing the yellow and black jackets of the attendants of the show . Mr. Greene 's lot , which included Rufus Jr. , Forest Swell , May Queen , and the hackney pony Sir Gibbie , led the parade , followed by a string from the stable of Dr. W. Seward Webb , made up of the handsome prize winner , Matchless of Londesborough , : Dagraar , Lady Alice , Princess Dagnaar , Gay Lady , Typhoon , and White Socks . Miss Webb showed a pretty hackney pony , Eccles Wonder , and the chief prize winner at the World 's Fair , Ottawa , the property of Robert Beith of Ontario , wound up the hackney lot . The latter is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sold in England for 5,000 guineas , which Is the top price ever paid for a hackney stallion . Just as the parade of the horses was ending , the horsemen watching it recognized Fashion , who was led into the Garden by a groom . This veteran hackney was apparently as full of fire and life as he was when first exhibited at the first of the series of shows held in this city . Save for the sway in his back he does not show his age , and in the little chance he had to show himself he was as nimble on his feet as a ballet master . The old horse has still a host of admirers , and will be a pet of the crowds as in the past Woodlawn Park Farm will have a good representation in the hackney class in Prince Victor , Berseker. and Montjoie , which were shown singly after the general show of the horses In the crowded ring was ended .

Other saddle horses , but of an entirely different type , were the hunters , Odd Fellow , Sunbeam , Roebuck , Rocket , Escape , Vixen , and Eureka , and several others that have seen service in the same ring at previous shows , and have been more or less successful in getting some of the prizes . Rundel &; White of Danbury , Conn .. had their champion trotting stallion Quartermaster out in the ring , and he found a host of admirers in spite of the fact that there is beginning to be a perceptible sway in his back and other evidences of the fact that he is getting along toward the years when he will no longer be available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only trotter of note that was in the lot of horses that yesterday pranced about the ring and occasionally lunged out their heels to notify the crowd that they must not get too near the rail if they would be perfectly safe . But when it comes to contesting for the ribbon Quartermaster will have a competitor in Alcantara , and the struggle for the champion prize between them and their get is expected to be a sharp one this time . In the throng that watched the display of the horses yesterday afternoon were Col. Lawrence Kip , Vice President of the association ; John G. Heckscher , the always popular Secretary ; H. H. Hollister , the Treasurer , and A. Newbold Morris and J. G. K. Lawrence , who have been identified with the association ever since its organization . The latter appeared on crutches , but was no less cheerful and contented than usual .
