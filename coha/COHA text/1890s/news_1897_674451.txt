txt If any further evidence was necessary to prove the antagonism of the powers , as represented by their Admirals , to the Christians , it is furnished by an incident that has just occurred at Akrotiri , where the fleets recently bombarded the insurgents ' position . The insurgents there are cut off from receiving provisions from the land side by the Turkish and foreign troops , and the foreign warships have prevented them from receiving supplies from sea . Their position is becoming desperate , and they yesterday sent envoys to Suda to beg that food be supplied to them from the warships . The Admirals refused to give them the assistance asked for , but said that if medical aid was needed it would be forthcoming . Later several of the doctors from the fleets visited the camp of the insurgents . It is reported here that when the Italian officer who was intrusted with the duty of notifying Col. Vassos , the commander of the Greek army of occupation , of the establishment of the blockade , handed a copy of the blockade proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declared that he would resist it as far as it was in his power to do so . Later he had a conference with the insurgent chiefs , and he afterward stated that he would cause every copy of the autonomy proclamation to be torn up . Judging from the reports which reach Canea from the camp of Col. Vassos , it is thought that he intends to assume the offensive shortly , in which case plenty of employment will be furnished to the foreign troops . It is rumored that Greece has offered to buy the island from Turkey . This idea grows in favor rapidly . There is little doubt if Turkey would accept such an offer that the money for the purchase could be found in twenty-four hours .
