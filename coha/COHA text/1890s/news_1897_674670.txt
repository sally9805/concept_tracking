txt The most hopeful sign of a real reform of our currency is the fact that the actual needs of the West and South are more and more recognized in the East and North . It is seen that the strong desire for " more money " and for " cheaper money " which made possible the movement for inflation by paper or by silver was to a substantial degree based on disadvatages which these sections suffer as compared with the more settled and the wealthier parts of the country . These disadvantages may be removed with benefit to all and injury to none ; there are safe remedies for the ills for which perilous remedies were sought . The need of the South and West which the present currency system does not meet is - the facilities for exchange , in proportion to trade , which the East enjoys . These facilities consist largely in two forms of bank credits , loans and currency . To put it in the simplest way , a merchant buying goods in the East can discount his note and obtain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger percentage of the value of the goods and at a lower rate of interest than a merchant in the West can cornmand . Of course , in each case the capital and business methods and character of the borrower will be taken into account ; but supposing these and other like considerations to be the same , the Western borrower is at a disadvantage which to a great extent can and ought to be removed . The disadvantage arises from the fact that banking capital is prevented by law from making the same rate of profit in the West ; the conditions attached to the issue of notes make such issues less profitable . If tl.ese were properly modified , capital would seek employment in the West , and credit safe and advantageous to all concerned would be cheaper . The rate of interest would not necessarily be the same , but it would tend to become uniform . Above all , the arbitrary and needlessly irritating differences would gradually be removed , and a very serious political danger to the country would in time disappear . This fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Monetary Commission , and will be respected in the woyk of the commission . The provisions of law which create this state of things are chiefly these : First , there is an arbitrary , fixed , and excessive Government currency , which has no relation whatever to the wants of trade , and which tends always to flow toward the financial centres and congest them . Second , National banks are forced to deposit low-rate high-priced Government bonds as security for their notes ( and a certain amount whether they issue notes or not ) from 11 per cent . to 30 per cent . in value beyond the notes . Third , neither banks with less than $$50 , - 000 capital nor branches of larger banks are permitted . Still another cause of the disadvantages suffered in the South and West is the fact that there is no real redemption of bank notes . so that bank currency , made rigid in volume by the bond security and irresponsive to local needs , flows to the centres as does the Government currency . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the remoter sections could profitably and with perfect safety use . We have no hesitation in saying that were they changed , as it is perfectly feasible to change them , it would not only be to the great advantage of these sections , but of the whole country , while the plea for inflation would lose a great deal of its force .
