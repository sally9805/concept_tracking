txt THE American citizen performs no duty with greater pleasure , or with a profounder sense of personal responsibility for*good government , than that of casting his ballot for President of the United States . He properly regards it as a high privilege , and in theory , at least , looks upon it as invested with much sacredness , so that to be denied the right would be regarded as a privation or calamity not to be endured or tolerated . There is , however , a widespread feeling in the country , if it does not amount to a positive conviction , that some of the laws regulating the method by which the choice of the people for the highest office in their gift is made , have survived the period of their usefulness , and ought to be revised and adapted to the conditions of the present time , which differ so widely from those existing when these laws were enacted . The indications are not obscure that there is a growing desire in the country to have the existing electoral plan re-examined , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct popular vote . There is at least enough of this feeling abroad to justify an impartial study of the subject from a non-partisan standpoint , and with a view to do ample justice to the plan as it is , as well as to ascertain whether it might be modified so as to become more republican in spirit , and to work with greater equality among the voters of the different States . The topic is too great in itself , and too positive and far-reaching in its bearings on related questions , to be treated otherwise than tentatively or suggestively in the limits here imposed ; and yet it is hoped that in outline it may be presented so as to point in the direction to which thought might be profitably turned . It // 403 is needless to refer to the extraordinary state of things which was developed a few years ago when the connt of the electoral vote was in dispute , as a reason for the revision of the laws relating thereto , since some amendments have been made , and possibly enough to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiences of that crisis remind us that dangerous anbiguities may exist in legislation , and pass undiscovered for years , till some dangerous emergency brings them to light . If anything should be perfectly intelligible , and incapable of any other meaning than that intended by its authors , it is the language of the laws under which the people hold their rights and exercise their privileges as citizens of the Republic . The experiences of that crisis show , furthermore , that the people look wi** no little anxiety to the proceedings of Congress in making the final declaration of the result of an election , after the count has been reasonably well ascertained . Their alertness indicates the consciousness of the possibility of a mishap of some kind in any case where there is not a very decided and well-known preponderance in the electoral vote . The subject is exceedingly delicate as well as important , and certainly there is nothing in the range of national legislation which deserves cooler or profounder thought than the regulations for expressing , and then ascertaining and declaring , the people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . All the essential features of the law on this subject should be placed beyond the uncertainty of majorities in Congress , by being incorporated in the Constitution of the United States . In the study of this subject , the first question which presents itself is as to whether the time has come for abolishing the electoral system , and for making provision in the organic law for electing the President by popular vote , as other officers are elected . This , however , is a question of too broad significance to be answered from impulse or from partial examination . There are at least two sides to it . In our high appreciation of the popular will and of the rights of majorities there is a possibility of accepting the affirmative without giving due thought to the considerations which might be adduced by one disposed to maintain the other side . It is not impossible to make a plausible argument in favor of continuing the electoral system , with such modifications as the changed condition of the country indicates to be // wise . The people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities of evil in it have come to light and may be remedied , while no serious dissatisfaction has arisen , and no popular outcry against it is likely to be made . Its abolishment is not , therefore , in any sense to be regarded as a reform measure to eradicate abuses . It is not to be doubted that the founders of the Republic were actuated by as high a sense of the duty of citizenship as their children possess , and their appreciation of the sacredness of the ballot and of the rights of majorities was not inferior to ours ; yet in their anxiety to throw around the elective franchise all possible safeguards , and to invest it with all the sacredness that should attach to it , they saw fit to prefer the electoral system to th$* direct popular vote . Their motives in doing so are not in question . They undoubtedly thought it necessary to adopt some conservative method to obviate confusion and possible strife in making up results , and to prevent the undue influence of local issues and temporary excitements in determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehended undesirable results from those personal qualities in candidates which sometimes excite the multitude to act more from impulse than from the deliberate exercise of sober reason . Before discarding their work , and substituting for it the plan of popular election , the evils of which they sought to avoid by adopting the electoral plan , we ought to place ourselves as nearly as possible in the situation of those who framed the Constitution , so as to see things as they saw them , and to feel the force of the arguments which were to them powerful and decisive . It is necessary for us to remember that as yet , while the Constitution was being framed , and these great questions were pending , there was in reality no national government-no consolidated union  --  but only an assemblage of independent States , temporarily united for mutual defence and safety , under articles of confederation without the binding qualities of a national compact ; and that this fact , while calculated to awaken local jealousies with regard to interests not general , was not unfavorable to the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country alike . There is no doubt that the question of State sovereignty , and the kindred question of State equality , entered largely into the deliberations of the constitutional convention , and had a controlling // influence upon the members in deciding upon the plan for choosing the President . It seemed to them both natural and necessary that in the exercise of this high function , the States , as such , should have a voice , and be represented according to their separate populations , without having their votes merged into the general mass , losing their identity as states in the final decision . In estimating the merits of the scheme adopted it is reasonable that we take account of the situation as it then was , and of the reasons for its introduction into our economy . If the controlling reasons for it were valid at that time , and if its adoption met an emergency in harmonizing conflicting claims , and in satisfying the demands of the smaller States , the wisdom of the action is vindicated , whether the same conditions still exist as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have so changed *s to justify the revision of the electoral system , or its abandonment altogether . Without doubt great changes in the situation have come ; and such changes as could not have been anticipated , either as to their character or magnitude . It was not possible for the wisest statesmen of these days to imagine the facilities which our times afford to the average voter for exercising an intelligent and independent judgment with reference to the qualifications of candidates or as to the merits of proposed policies of administration . Those in office did not then , as they do now , perform their duties in the glare of the midday sun and in the focus of millions of watchful eyes . Neither steam nor lightning aided in the diffusion of knowledge . Travel was slow and difficult , while the weekly mail and the weekly papers were the best privileges of the favored sections , leaving vast regions with the slightest opportunities for communication with the world at large . The horseback mail , the stage-coach , and the canal-boat represented the best achievements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties were not known at that time as agencies for bringing out candidates ; nor is it at all probable that the influence of such agencies for directing voters and controlling elections entered into the calculations of the times . The power of party drill was imperfectly understood and perhaps formed no part of the thought of those whose best energies were given to the study of the best plan for expressing the popu .. Jar will in the choice of . the Chief Magistrate . It was the // recognized right of any eligible citizen to become a candidate for this office at the instigation of his friends , or at his own option , without formal nomination by a political party ; and the reasonable probability that each election would find several candidates in the field , rendering it unlikely that any one would secure a majority of the popular vote under such conditions , or even such a plurality as would make it desirable to declare him elected . was no doubt considered , and had weight in determining the conclusion reached . The force of this reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to do full justice to the authors of the electoral plan without considering the electoral bodies of the several States , in their true character as electoral bodies in fact , with the duties , privileges , and respousihilities of the individual electors composing them . The electors were not chosen to act as passive agents in carrying out imperative instructions , which it would be political treason to depart from under any conceivable exigency , although as representatives of the people they could not do otherwise than respect the wishes of their constituents , and secure the election of their first choice if possible ; but they were not absolutely debarred from the exercise of personal judginent in the event of conditions arising not anticipatcd before the election . It was evidently understood that the electors chosen by popular vote were to exercise some discretion after becoming electors , as to the candidates who should finally receive their votes . The original idea appears to have been that the electors of any State might come together as a body charged with an important trust , and consider the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the availability of candidates , and the desirability of securing for their people a second choice , if their first choice had become an impossibility , and , after proper discussion and deliberation , each elector cast his vote according to his own judgment and sense of duty . But this discretion of the individual elector is not now to be thought of as part of the scheme ; for custom has laid restrictions upon the members of the body , and therefore upon the body itself , which the law did not lay upon them . The electors can do nothing more than voice the expressed will of those whoso ballots place them in the body . The original electoral plan has been changed by constitutional // 407 amendment , and this fact suggests that other changes may be made when later experiences and observations make it plain that altered conditions render changes desirable and expedient . It was not long after the system was set in operation till the provision requiring the electors to vote only for candidates for the Presidency , making the one who received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest vote next to the highest the Vice-President , was unwise , as it always placed in the second office of the government a disappointed man , and the one who had been the successful candidate 's strongest competitor for the first place . The provision was then made for electing the Vice-President as now , so that the President and Vice-President might be in complete harmony , and work together for the success of the adminis*Ab tration . This change was a necessary one , a step in the right direction , and other changes will doubtless be made as soon as the wisdom of making them shall become apparent . But the people of the country will be slow to approve of modifications of the organic law without the clearest evidence that the proposed alteration will be an improvement . Notwithstanding the seeming radicalism seen in party movements and excitements , the people of this country are at heart loyal to the established government , and essentially conservative . They are not clamoring for changes for the sake of changes-not even for the election by popular vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so long as there can be no assurance that in the future canvassings for the high office there will be only two candidates in the field , so that a majority of the votes will be certainly given to one or the other . It is clearly undesirable to go into an election by the people , with the strong probability that a choice by a majority is impossible ; and it is even less desirable to have such an election decided by a plurality , although on the present plan it sometimes occurs that the defeated candidate receives more votes than the successful one . If there must be an election by less than a majority , it is better that it be by the voice of the States through the electoral agency than by a plurality of the whole vote . The distribution of the popular vote is something for consideration . The rights of the States are supposed to be better secured by this plan than ould be done by merging the whole voting population of the oiiutry into one body . The massing of the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this upon sectional and local issues , is measurably forestalled by this plan . At least this is the impression , and it is manifestly one design of this unique method of expressing the xviii of the people . Assuming that the electoral plan is to continue , the question of its improvability is pertinent . Voting by States is the fundamental idea in it , its basal thought , as it is also in the alternative provision for an election by the House of Represeiitatives in the event of a failure to elect by the electors chosen by the States . It is evident that the notion of State sovereignty , which prevailed prior to the adoption of the Constitution , had something to do with shaping the plan as it was originally made , and as it exists at the present time . It was inevitable that this idea should have prominence in the Constitutional Convention , and *iave large influence , commanding almost universal assent , while as yet the national union was not consummated ; for , while the country was under the tentative articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind with regard to the independence of the several States , so recently achieved . Some of the States were larger than others , but all were alike independent , and the smaller dreaded over-slaughing or absorption by the larger , and naturally insisted upon protection against any tendency towards such a result in any scheme of federation or union that might be proposed . All eyes were open to catch the first appearance of anything that looked like giving the large and powerful States any advantage over the others , except the natural advantages of territory and population , which could not be affected or controlled by law . The Constitution , when completed , had to be approved by the States separately , in order to its adoption , and this provision for the independent action of the States in choosing the chief executive officer was , no doubt , influential in conciliating those who were reluctant to come into the Union . Whether it secured equality of power in this respect or not , it looked in that direction , and approximated that end as nearly as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Representatives , it had the appearance of giving the smaller States an equal voice with the larger in this important action . There are checks and helps in the system which amount to real advantages , although it is not possible to devise a suneme that will give perfect equality to the States as such , so long as // representation in the electoral college , or in the House of Representatives , is based on population ; and population is the only basis on which it can be based . It is , therefore , evident that all expectation of making the small States equal to the large States should be abandoned hs unwise and impracticable . In the present system the advantage of the individual voter for electors is with the voters in the larger States . This is an inequality that should be remedied ; for , while there is no good reason why a State like Rhode Island or Nevada , or some new Territory just coming into statehood , should have as much power in the choice of President as Pennsylvania or New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large States should have greater power than the voter in the small State . This contention is not for the equality of States as States , but for the equality of voters as voters . When the election takes place in the House of Representatives , and each State casts a single vote , that vote being determined by the majority of representatives from the State , the small State makes the nearest approach to equality with the large State that is possible under the Constitution . Then the relation of the vote to population is nearly disregarded . The justice of this near approach to equality is not apparent , and now that " the more perfect union " is formed , and the Constitution is in force , which bears directly upon the rights of the people , as well as upon the States as organized bodies , it is not impertinent to assume that the primary reasons for this equality of States have passed out of existence , if they ever had any foundation or substance outside of State pride or local prejudice . The claim for equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the claim that one man 's vote shall count for as much as any other man 's vote anywhere in the Union . With the existing method of choosing electors for the State on a common ticket the equality sought is impossible , and yet the inequality is so subtle or so well hidden that some effort is necessary to bring it fully into view . In looking for it , the question to be pursued is not the right of the individual to cast his vote , for that is conceded ; but it has reference to the relative power of a single vote when cast in a large State or in a small State . In other words , it is a question as to whether it is a larger privilege to vote for twenty or thirty electors than it is to vote for three or five . IDoes one vote cast for each of thirty electore have // a greater effect in the final count than does one vote cast for each of three electors ? This is the practical question which deserves elaboration . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each of thirty-six electors . His vote is counted for each , and each elector chosen by that ballot votes for President ; so that the vote of one man bears directly on thirty-six votes in the electoral college . In one respect the man has but one voice , but that one voice is potential in filling many seats in the body which decides the election . In another State each voter has a voice in selecting twelve electors , or one-third the number chosen in New York . His voice counts in determining twelve votes in the electoral college . His influence in the whole body is one-third as great as it would be if he could vote for three times as many electors , as does the vote cast in New York . In another State of still less population , the voter has a voice in the election of three electors , or onetwelfth as many as the voter in New York influences . In this condition of things it is pretty evident that the voter i*New York has twelve times the power in the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suffrage in the smallest State . There is no unfairness in the fact that the larger State should have this preponderance of power , as a State , for the larger voting population justifies this ; but that each voter should wield such an excess of power is scarcely compatible with equity and justice . The equality of the power of single votes is destroyed . It will be alleged in reply to this that the inequality disappears when it is remembered that in the larger State more votes are required to make the majority which elects ; but the reply is fallacious , for the trouble is not in the greater or less number of votes requisite to the majority in the large or small State , but it has reference to the power of the single vote . Is not that vote multiplied , or its power increased , in proportion to the number of electors it helps to elect ? If so , the lack of equality in the power of the single voter in the different States is demonstrated . This question of majorities will illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining majorities in a large State as in a small State . Suppose that in the great State of New York the electors are all chosen by a majority of eleven hundred ... -. is not that a supposable case ? A change of six hundred votes would // put the majority on the other side . That change of six hundred votes would take thirty-six electors from one side and add them to the other side . Then suppose that in Montana the electors are chosen by a majority of eleven hundred votes . A change of six hundred votes would put the majority on the other side . The change of six hundred votes in Montana would take three electors from one side and add them to the other side . Thus it is seen that the six hundred voters in New York have twelve times the power of six hundred voters in Montana . Then , if six hundred voters in New York can wield twelve times the power of six hundred in Montana , who will say that each individual voter does not wield twelve times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter ? Nor is it possible that twelve votes cast in Montana can equal the one vote cast in New York ; for the one vote touches the election of thirty-six electors in New York , while the twelve votes in Montana can only affect three electors , even if they do swell the vote of the three more than the one vote swells the majority of the thirty-six . If the ballot for each elector were cast separately , he of Montana would vote three times , and he of New York thirty-six times . Say not , then , that the ways of this system are equal . How can equality be secured ? It can not be till voters throughout the country vote for the same number of electors . This requires the election of presidential electors by districts instead ot by States . Slight alterations in State constitutions will authorize this , and nothing oppressive would result if the National Constitution should be made to recuire it . In this way the voice of the people can have free expression and a voter in one part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other part of the Union . It gives to every one the right to vote for the elector of his choice , with the assurance that his vote will be as influential in determining the composition of the electoral body as will the vote of any other man . When one of the States adopted this plan , the innovation appeared to be serious enough to elicit comments upon it by President Harrison in his annual message to Congress . His objections to it were as weighty as can be made , but they were not formidable . The dangers arising from the possibility of unfairness in arranging the districts , in the interests of one party at the expense of another party , were emphasized . What is // known in political parlance as the " gerrymander " is an evil that ought to be suppressed , whether electors are elected by districts or not . Members of Congress are so elected , and must be . It is a humiliating confession of weakness to recognize the " gerrymander " as too formidable to be overcome . If the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrent vote of two-thirds of both Houses of the Legislature , the obnoxious gerrymander will be next to impossible , as it will seldom occur in any State that two-thirds of both Houses will consent to palpably unfair legislation . It is simply absurd to refuse to do the fair thing with all the voters of the United States because political tricksters may take advantage of equitable laws to promote partisan ends . There are other advantages in the district method which existing peculiarities in certain sections render important enough to call forth the profoundest thought . In the State of New York , for example , it is known that the entire electoral vote is frequently determined by the foreign vote in the cities of New York and Brooklyn . In those cities there are hundreds of thousands of voters whose knowledge of this country and its needs has been gained by a brief sojourn in that dense population . They " vote the ticket , " of course , and swell the majority of one of the parties , while the other citizens of the State struggle in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a single voice even when they elect many representatives to Congress . Hundreds of thousands of voters have no representative in that body , who choose their own representatives in the State Legislature and the Congress . The great cities overslaugh them , and decide for them , in opposition to their wishes , who shall represent them in the election of President . These rural populations and the voters of the villages and towns of the State , outside of the great city , are as intelligent and as patriotic , and in every respect as well qualified to select their own representatives as are the controlling elements in city populations ; yet it so happens that the worst elements in city life give such a preponderance to one of the political parties , that the majority which represents the intelligence of the great State is overborne , and compelled to accept the situation determined on any other than patriotic grounds . The same thing is liable to occur in Illinois , and in Ohio , and in any State in which there is a large city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The objection is not to allowing legal voters of this class the right to vote , and to choose their own representatives ; but it is to a system which mt*kes it possible for them to determine the representation of the entire State . If the electors were chosen by districts , so that each one should vote only for his own representative , the State would have its full number in the electoral body , and yet the great cities and the rural districts would alike choose their own , and all would be fairly represented , and stand on equal grounds . This would be just to the State , and just to the several districts of the State , and to the nation as a whole . In this arrangement no one would be deprived of voting for this choice of electors ; no one would vote for a larger number of electors than every other one , while * every section would be represented by the choice of its majority , whether in the great city or in the rural districts . Under a system of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would often occur ; but that is possible under the present plan , and has occurred without disaster to any interest . The outcome , on the whole , might not be greatly altered , as the change contemplated would be as advantageous to one party as to another ; but then every voter would have an equal voice in the result and a more direct representation and a more satisfactory relation to the choice of President . Besides this , every elector would have a distinct constituency of his own and a more direct personal responsibility , which would enhance the value of his office and clothe it with something like the character originally designed for it . There are other changes which , if made , would add to the dignity of the office of elector , and adapt the provisions of the system itself to the changed conditions of our times . The requirement calling the electors of each State to the State capital , to cast the ballot of the State , and the provision for reporting the result to Congress through the Vice-President , evidently grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the sheerest formality , while the necessity of sealing up the report of the ballot and conveying the document to Washington by special messenger , or otherwise , is not only an arrangement in pursuance of the relations of the States under the Articles of Confederation , but it belongs to the condition of the country with reference to mail and travelling facilities prior to the advent of railroads and // telegraphs . At that time there were reasons for not calling all the electors together to act as one body in the transaction of their business , but those reasons exist no longer . That which was then inconvenient and expensive is now easily practicable . An electoral body composed of all the electors of all the States would be in fact an Electoral Congress , and it might be in name . The meeting of such a body for the election of President and Vice-President of the United States would be an event worthy the dignity of the nation , and of the offices to be filled . In fulfilling this high function such a Congress might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result . If the first ballot did not elect , it might ballot again and again , till an election should be secured . When the electors have each a distin*t constituency , and are empowered by legal right to control their own votes , as they are now under the law , there can be no reason for restricting their right to a single ballot . The delegates in the National Conventions are not so restricted in making nominations , nor are members of the State Legislatures in balloting for United States Senators . The electoral body ought to be so constituted that it could be safely empowered to perform its work to completion , e*en if the first choice of the political parties proved unable to command a majority on the first ballot . This representative body might well be intrusted with as much power as the more loosely constructed conventions of the parties . Of course , this suggestion looks to radical changes , so great indeed that possible difficulties will occur to practical minds , but it is believed that the chief changes contemplated are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions and existing conditions . In all this it is not forgotten that senatorial electors are to be chosen , as well as district electors . The thing sought being equality in the power of the individual voter in all the States , the principle contended for is not violated by the election of senatorial electors on a common ticket for the State . In that event each voter will vote for one district and two senatorial electors in all the States , great and small alike . While this does not make the States equal , it makes all the voters in all the States equal , giving to every man who votes an equal voice with every other man throughout the Union . Whether the time is here , or is coming , when it will be ex // 415 pedient to alter the Constitution so that no State shall have more Senators in the Upper House than it has Representatives in the Lower House , is another question . But it is a question ; and one which has much to do with the dignity of that body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most august legislative body in the world . The common-sense judgment of the people is that any State without population enough to entitle it to two Representatives in the Lower House , the popular branch of Congress , could be amply represented in the Senate by one Senator . At all events , there is and ought to be difference enough between district and senatorial electors , to justify a difference in the manner of their election ; and the generalticket plan for electors-at-large , and the district plan for the district electors , secures equality to the voters , and consistency in the electoral system . Under such a system a solid South , or a solid North , or any other sectional predominance , would be practically impossible . With equal rights for all , equal power in every vote , and equal standards for the privileges of citizenship , the ballot would then prove " A weapon that comes down as still As snowflakes fall upon the sod ; But executes a freeman 's will As lightning does the will of God .
