txt " I must confess that I see no prospect of a compromise . I offered my services to bring about a settlement of the difficulties , but both sides are indisposed to come to terms . " This is the manner in which Commissioner Thomas F. Gilroy of the Department of Public Works summed up the condition of the stoneworkers ' strike yesterday , and his opinion represents the actual state of affairs about as clearly as it can be stated . Neither side will listen to a proposition which might imply yielding from the stand that has been taken . The employers say that they are in a position to prolong the light Indefinitely , and the workingmen claim the same advantage . It will prola ably take weeks , and perhaps months . to decide - which of the two factions is really the stronger . In the meanwhile , business is suffering on every hand , and the strike is gradually spreading . It will not have reached its worst nntll the latter part of this week , as the committee in charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New-York City before that time in the work of reporting buildings and other works where non-union granite is used . Manhattan Island . as well as Long Island and New Jersey towns . will be canvassed most carefully street by street . and in every instance Where the committee discovers non-union stone the matter will be reported to the Board of Walking Delegates and a strike will follow . Commissioner Gilroy , whose department is naturally the greatest sufferer by the strike , appreciates the gravity of the situation thoroughly , but even with all the power of his department behind him he has been able to do nothing . Armed with the letter from the workingmen printed in yesterday 's TIMES . in which the strikers set forth the terms on which they would be willing to compromise , Mr. Gilroy called at the office of Booth Brothers . He had a long talk with the senior member of the firm , and afterward met William , the workingmen 's representative . He tried arguments , threats , and persuasion with both sides , but he had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even guess how long the present state of things will last , " he said . - The work of paving the streets is absolutely at a standstill . We have begged the payers to let us finish some of the smaller jobs where the blocks are on the ground and the streets are torn up , to the great injury of business and to the great discomfort of the people . but they refuse to do so . They say that to agree to the proposition would be to give up the strike . " In consequence of this refusal I have ordered Contractors Smith and Garrity to relay the old blocks taken up in West Street so that traffic can be resumed . Contractor Kelly has been ordered to do the same thing in Third Avenue When the trouble is over the old blocks will have to come up again and the new pavement will be laid . " The extra work is the contractors ' loss . I can not allow them to keep the streets in an impassable condition . I want to see the strike ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contractors until the time specified In their contracts has expired , and it is doubtful whether even then the city can allege willful negligence against them on account of the strike . " Whether the contractors had begun to execute his orders about relaying the old stones , Mr. Gilroy said he did not know , as his Inspectors had not reported to him . If the contractors did not proceed with the work . however , within a few days he would take it for granted that they had refused . In that event . " he added , " I will proceed to do the work myself with men from this department , The cost of the work will bo charged in that event to the contractors . " " But the latter have proclaimed that they - will not pay for any such work . " " Well , I 'll see that they do . They ca n't keep the streets open in this city for an indefinite period , obstructing traffic and injuring business . with no prospect of a settlement of the strike . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so many days in which to finish their work , but in view of the present situation this clause can not be construed to mean that they shall be permitted to leave the streets in an impassable condition during all this time . That would be preposterous. - Take Third Avenue , for instance . The contractor of that work there has 143 days , I think , in which to complete his undertaking . Of this period only forty days or so have passed . Do you suppose that I would permit him to leave the street in its present condition for the remaining ninety days before taking any action I Assuredly not . " " And it the contractors decline to pay , how will you collect the costs from them ? ' " H necessary I 'll stop the amounts out of their contracts , and if they carry the matter into court . why I guess we can meet them there , too . " That the contractors are in no hurry to comply with the order to relay the old stones is evident None of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Battery Place and West Street , where a start had been made , the task was ? ? hung up " again yesterday . The Belt Line Street Car Company sought relief by putting its own pavers to work replacing the old stones between the rails . The traffic at this point is very heavy , as the Pennsylvania Road and Lehigh Valley Road have two of their largest freight viers at the . junction of Battery Place and West Street . There was an endless stream of heavily laden trucks destined for these piers , many of - which were stalled in the gullies between the car tracks . An extra policeman was stationed at this place to prevent blockades as far as possible . RAS noon yesterday Mr. Gilroy opened bias for the repaving of a number of new streets , a list of ' which was published yesterday . The work was divided into five sections . on each of which separate bids were requested . All the bidders on the work were men who hold contracts for street paving at present under the Department of Public Works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all men whose pavers are at present on strike . The exception was Matthew Baird , the wealthy Brooklyn contractor and quarry owner . Mr. Baird employs only union men , and his quarries are not ingluded In the association which has locked out its employes . He now holds the contract for work in West One Hundred and Nineteenth and West One Hundred and Twenty-third Street , and his pavers , who are hired by the sub-contractors Moran &; Low , are the only ones at work on new atone in the city . The bids were as lollows : First Contract-P . H. McCallagh , $33,867.50 ; p . Thielemann. $31,716.55 ; Matthew Baird , $30.349.65 . Second Contract  --  Fitzgerald ct Crock , $39,107.25 ; Thomas Gearty , $37,993.50 ; F. Thielemann , Jr. , $35.605.55 ; M. Baird. $34,019.65 . Third Contract-Dennis O'Connell , $34,509.80 ; M.

Firth Contract-Dennis O'Connell , $203,016.50 ; Thomas Gearty , $192,134 ; M. Baird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bids that alr . Baird 's offer to do the work is the lowest in four out of the five contracts . As he is the only one of the contractors submitting bids who can go ahead with the work without interference from the strikers , the contracts are likely to go to him . But as to this or the award of any of the contracts , Commissioner Gilroy would not commit himself yesterday . He said that he Would not be in a hurry to make the awards , as be intended to look over the ground very carefully . If ho thought best , he said that all the bids might he thrown out , so that the work *mild be readvertised after the strike was con-eludedA number of representatives from the strikers severe present at the opening of the bids. includ'jug Secretary Grant and William , the Chief of the Knights of Labor forces . After the bids-had been read , Grant and his associates said that the workingmen would agitate for the enactment of a law providing that none but union out and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . had such tegulations , and in Baltimore , where the law - tad been force for some time , all paving contracts contained a clause stipulating that only ' linden labor should be employed . Another change which the men are going to ' strive for Is an amendment of the laws so that the Department of Public Works shall be permitted to buy paving blocks from the quarries direct . At present this is not permitted . Commissioner Gilroy , according to Grant and , is In favor of the scheme , which , they say , will save the city considerable money . The new Strike Committee , appointed by the *Kiel branch of the GrImite Cutters ' Union at its - mass meeting in Clarendon Hall on Monday Bight , organized for action yesterday by electing W. S. Bradley Chairman . W. A. Hanley Treasurer , and L. L. Brown Secretary . To-day Vie committee will start on a tour of inspection , taking in all the buildings not already tied up : Where it is suspected non-union stone is being rased . The list includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue ; the Dutch Reformed Collegiate Church , West End Avenue and Seventy-seventh Street ; the Imperial Hotel annex , Thirty-second Street and Broadway ; the Metropolitan Club in Fifth A.venue , Bloomingdale Brothers ' new building , the Mohawk Building , the Colby mansion , and ethers . In the afternoon a mass-meeting of the striklag pavers was held at 52 Union Square . Reports of the progress of affairs were read by MeN air and Grant . The letter said that the finances were in an excellent condition . Contributions were coming in at the rate of from $200 to $800 a day , and letters of sympathy and encouragement arrived with every mail . read a communication from District Assembly 64 , Knights of Labor , of Albany , asking if a general tie-up should be ordered there . An answer in the affirmative was ordered to be sent . A close watch is kept from this city on the Southern and Western quarries in order to provide openings for the locked-out men in NewEngland . A large number has been placed through this system , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application for eighty meh from Charles Appel , a quarry owner of Lithonia , Ga . The application was accompanied by passes for eighty . In coratnenting on this request Grant said that the quarrymen. were leaving New-England at such a rate that the owners would find it bard work after the settlement of the strike to start up their quarries again for lack of hands . It was supposed that the strike would seriously interfere with the dedication of monuments on Decoration Day , but from all accounts there will be no trouble on that score . Ail the men in the monument yards will be allowed to finish the work on which they are engaged , but they have been instructed by their unions not to begin new jobs on New-England granite until the strike is over . E. J. Atkinson of the Memorial Committee of the Grand Army of the Republic said yesterday that so far as he knew all the monument work contracted for would be ready on Decoration Day . Work might be delayed on the Brooklyn memorial arch , but that would not interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compiled yesterday by Eecretary Grant , showing the number of men looked out in each of the affected quarries in the New-England States , the total will be over 59,000 . Mr. Grant says that the figures he has obtained came from the most reliable sources , and in order to prove his assertions he gives the name of each quarry , its location . and the number of men employed before the lock-out.
