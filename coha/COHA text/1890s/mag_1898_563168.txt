txt THE firing of the cannon being over , interest in other than war subjects may revive , and attention will be attracted to the elaborate and important work in which Mr. Alexander Sutherland applies the principle of evolution to the origin and growth of the moral instinct. * It is the well-known lot of every great discovery , after being first received as a paradox , possibly as a heresy , ultimately to become a universal solvent and perhaps a craze . One familiar instance is the discovery of the circulation of the blood , which after being strenuously denied and contemptuously ridiculed , was followed by the general treatment of the questions of human physiology as problems in hydraulics . Evolution has been no exception to the law . It was at first received in most quarters not only with incredulity , but with aversion ; in some quarters with horror . Now everything is Evolution . The tendency surely reaches its climax when to reconcile us to the manifold imperfections , moral , historical and scientific , of the Bible , the evolutionary theory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine nature through inspired writings or in some other way . To be revealed at all , the divine nature must be fully revealed , since an imperfect revelation of character , divine or human , would be false . An evolution of revelation would seem , therefore , to imply an evolution of God . It would , at all events , assume the divine operation to be subject to a law which we can not conceive otherwise than as one of physical necessity , identical with that of which the worm is developed into the ape and the ape into the man . If this is not exactly Pantheism , it is * " The Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct . " By Alexander Sutherland , M. A. 2 vole . London , New York , and Bombay : Longmans , Green &amp; co. , 1898. // something still more remote from the common idea of a moral and personal God . Admitting , as everyone who is open to reason must admit , that evolution is a most momentous discovery and has profoundly altered our views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destiny , of man , we may be permitted to doubt whether it has at once assumed its ultimate form and found its final limits . Men of science are not agreed-indeed , they differ widely-as to the probable age of our planet ; but they are all agreed , and if they accept the evolutionary theory plainly must be agreed , in holding that the earth had a beginning . The Darwinian theory is that evolution works through natural selection ; in other words , through the improvement of accidental variations under the influence of surroundings . An eminent Darwinian was asked what length of time it would probably take on any conceivable theory of probabilities to evolve in this way a bird which would build a nest in anticipation of laying an egg . Some birds , it is true , do not build nests , but many do , and to them the question applies . The answer , which was not very prompt or confident , involved the intervention of imitation . But here was another principle which had itself to be evolved by natural selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not likely that even such a master-mind as that of Darwin has reached the whole truth at a bound . Especially we may be allowed to suspend our belief with regard to the final relation of the discovery to human action and character . That it has profoundly changed our ideas upon these subjects and exploded much of our moral philosophy can not be questioned . We can no longer rest our faith on anything super- 7 natural , transcendental , or intuitive . We can no longer believe in any innate moral sense , unless it be in the way of hereditary transmission . Kant 's " categorical imperative ' * disappears , together with the implanted sense of right and wrong , and with Butler 's divinely accredited conscience , which , " if it had power as it has authority , would rule the world . " Even apart from Darwin 's discovery , theories of the immutable distinction between right and wrong and of the moral law engraved on our hearts would be confuted by the variations in the moral code among the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seem possible that , without // the intervention of anything miraculous or any breach in the continuity of development , moral action and character may be the commencement of a new order of things in such a sense that the transition would be a saltus mortalis for any purely physical theory of evolution . From the worm to the man , still more from the primeval concurrence of atoms to the man , the progress may be unbroken , but the change , if there is such a thing as change , is vast ; and there is no apparent reason for assliming that it has been arrested at the particular point up to which the Darwinian theory explains it . it may be true that the rudiments of morality are found in brutes . They are , however , rudiments only . The most remarkable of them owe their existence to the influence of man and to the hope of good or fear of punishment at his hands . Brutes show no tendency to spontaneous improvement , though a habit impressed by man may become hereditary in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often intense and touching , is at the same time blind . The dog shows no sign of moral discrimination . Bill Sykes 's dog was just as much attached to his master as ever was the dog of a philosopher or saint . We canno im .. imagine a brute forming an idea of moral excellence , or striving to attain a moral ideal . Mr. Sutherland undertakes to evolve all morality out of sympathy . He connects his theory with the general idea of Adam Smith 's " Moral Sentiments , " though Adam Smith could , *f course , have no knowledge of evolution . He traces scientifically , it might almost be said ultra-scientifically , the growth of sympathy from the very lowest orders of animal life up to its highest development in man . The term " sympathy " is used by him in an extended and , it may be thought , hardly legitimate , sense as comprehending not only fellow-feeling , but affection of all kinds , conjugal affection , for instance , and the mutual affection of parent and child . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions which are done from the pure sense of duty and characters formed upon that sense , such as the character of William III . or Washington ; falling thus into an error opposite to that of Kant , who held the best action not to be moral if it was done not from a sense of duty , but because it gave pleasure to the agent . He would seem also to exclude self-control and good habits , such as temperance , continence , industry , or frugality , // formed for the benefit of the agent alone . Morality , according to all common notions of it , is regulative ; while sympathy and affection are impulsive and require a rule to make them moral . We can hardly feel convinced , therefore , that Mr. Sutherland , though he may have collected many interesting facts and thrown side-lights on the subject , has solved his great problem . A moral philosopher who is a thorough-going evolutionist must apparently be a thorough-going necessarian . He must believe ; in fact , that our actions are predetermined , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things . A thorough-going necessarian Mr. Sutherland is , as the following passages show : " But sometimes we become imbued with a strong belief in will-power as something of itself selective and determinative . When we see a man who refuses to be the sport of circumstances , who does not drift with the current , but strikes boldly out for some definite point on the shore , we are inclined to regard him as one who can rise superior to the laws of causation . Yet the two factors in the determination of such a man 's career are independent of his volition ; how came he by that strong will-power , and what were the exterior circumstances that gave to it its tone and direction ? That ' will power must be hereditary ; he did not create it . The man born without it can never make it for himself . And , moreover , whatever be the appearances , this will-power is necessarily , in regard to its scope and direction , the sport of circumst ' *nces . " II. , 108 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ordinary terms , is no separate existence , no real entity . It is only a capacity of being so powerfully attracted by one motive that other motives become insignificant . It is as if the iron ball of our illustration were so decidedly drawn by one particular kind of magnet , that the others had little or no power to deflect its course . " - II. , 109 . " It is hard to persuade the common sense man that he never really makes a deliberate choice ; yet in fact all that his judgment can do is to weigh th' various attractions of several motives , and the more powerful must certainly prove victorious , as when a child measures with his eyes two piece of cake and thinks he chooses the larger , when it is in reality the larger pie ce which has attracted him . " - II. , 110 . " In general , when we deliberate , we are only giving to our minds the time to picture to themselves in imagination the more distant motives for action . One of the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropic sky might long to drink a cool draught of the ocean waters . If he deliberates it is because fancy begins to elaborate all the joys of later life , , inevitably lost if such a draught be drunk . He is reckoned to be a strongwilled man if he insists u*pn drinking in spite of the warnings and entreaties of his fellow-sufferers. *- Nevertheless , he is considered a strong-willed man if , on the contrary , day after day , in spite of the horrid temptation to drink , he remains true to his motive of once more seeing home and family . He is considered a man of weak will if he is inclined now one way and now another . But in every case his action will be determined by the attraction which these motives exercise on a mind of his class , " - II. , 111. // All this , we vent uirc to submit , is hypothesis , and apparently , from the nature of the case , incapable of verification . Science can not inspect a motive as it inspects a physical force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , how it acts , what determines its strength or weakness . The strongest motive is that which in the end prevails ; no more scientific definition can be given . It will be observed that in the passages quoted there is recognized , besides the motives by the comparative force of which action is supposed to be absolutely determined , something which compares these weights with each other and ultimately strikes the balance between them . What is this determining factor ? To put the case in another and a broader way , what is it that makes us conscious and reflecting agents ; in what does our personality consist ? We not only balance motives against each other at the time of action , but we afterwards reflect on our decision and commend or blame ourselves , according as the decision appears to us to have been right or wrong . If this is a mere delusion , how is the existence of the delusion to be explained ? What are selfapproval and remorse if the action about which they are felt is merely the resultant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnet and the iron have over the resultant of their approximation to each other ? Nobody imagines that anything like the phenomena of the retroactive conscience can have a parallel in the case of purely physical agents . The necessarian hypothesis is not , and we do not see how it ever can be , an observed or demonstrated fact . It is a supposed intellectual necessity . It can appeal for verification to nothing but our consciousness , and by our consciousness it is distinctly and uniformly denied . " The constitution , " says Bishop Butler , " of the present world and the condition in which we are placed is as if we were free . And it may perhaps justly be concluded that since the whole process of action , through every step of it , suspense , deliberation , inclining one way , determining , and at last doing as we determined , is as if we were free , therefore we are so . " This is oldfashioned reasoning , antecedent to the discovery of evolution . But can it be positively shown to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , admitted at the time // of his writing , and would still more emphatically admit now , that ihe word " free " required important qualification in view of the influences of surroundings , hereditary tendencies , and other circumstances which limit the action of the will . He would have admitted , to adopt Mr. Sutherland 's illustration , that it makes an immense difference whether a boy is brought up in the home of an English squire or in that of a German musician . But he would probably have insisted that this did not extinguish , though it limited , his moral freedom . Is it not possible that physical science as well as popular opinion may have its idola , and that one of them may be that nothing can have any real existence which is not capable of being explained by the Darwinian hypothesis ? It is surely paradoxical to say that " the absence of free will does not imply absence of responsibility . " What can imply absence of responsibility if it is not implied in the absence of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility , it is true , directly contradict the necessarian hypothesis . But they are phenomena all the same , and those who deny the reality of their existence still feel themselves constrained to assume it in moral judgments of all kinds , in penal legislation and in the whole conduct and intercourse of life . Mr. Sutherland , in perfect consistency with his theory , denies that punishment is retributive , since if it were it would imply free agency in the person on whom it is inflicted . He maintains that it is merely preventive . But surely it is also retributive if it is proportioned , as all reasonable punishment is , to the gravity of the offence . If nothing but prevention were considered , our punishments should be measured only by their preventive effect . We might punish shoplifting or petty larceny with death . Such , in fact , was the principle of the penal code of England in the last century . But juries rebelled against the application of the code because it was not retributive , or , to use a plainer term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be repealed . Mr. Sutherland recognizes , as nobody who chooses to accept phenomena can help recognizing , the existence of moral ideals and of conscious effort to realize them . How , on the evolutionary hypothesis , can he account for the existence of the ideal , or the attempt at realization ? It can hardly be said that anyone has yet been able to afford the necessarian theory that which would be its decisive // confirmation , by treating human history as a subject of exact science . The most important attempt is that of Comte , whose wellknown theory is that the course of history is determined by man 's mode of explaining phenomena , and in accordance with that law has passed through three stages ; the theological stage , in which phenomena are explained by the action of deity , beginning with Fetichism and ending with Monotheism ; the metaphysical stage , in which they are explained by the action of certain occult agencies , such as Nature ; and the positive stage , which is that of purely scientific observation , ushered in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third stage is final , and this finality inns through the whole philosophy of Comte , who *eems to think that progress has , ended with his own era and undertakes to furnish humanity with a final religion , pantheon , and form of government . But the theory , however imposing and in some respects suggestive , has never been applied , nor apparently is it capable of being applied , to the particular facts . No such universal connection as it supposes has yet been proved to exist between man 's reading of phenomena and his moral actions . The three zones of history can not be identified ; the metaphysical zone , especially , eludes definite location . Nor can they be said to be nmtually exclusive , some of the greatest lights of positive science , Newton , for instance , having been also devout theists . The philosophy of history has no doubt greatly advanced ; we understand far better than our forefathers the connection of events , the succession of eras , the influence of the general conditions of each era on individual character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rational , comprehensive , and tolerant view of humanity generally , we are greatly indebted to the discoveries , still more perhaps to the spirit , of science . But no one has yet found it possible to deal with the phenomena of history as we deal with those upon observation of which the strict sciences are founded . If it is said that the explanation of this is to be sought , not in any essential difference of the phenomena , but merely in the difference of complexity , we can only reply that when this difficulty has been overcome and the possibility of a science of history analogous to the physical sciences has thus been demonstrated , we shall all be ready to accept the demonstration . Morality , surely , in the common sense of the term , is not an affection , sympathetic or otherwise , nor is it an instinct , a*iy // more than it is a divine revelation or a metaphysical necessity . It is simply another name for the rule of reason applied to human action and regulating man 's natural appetites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , the family , the community , the kind ; in regard to the three last of which relations , man being a complex being , his interest is as much self interest as in regard to the first . In the case of the individual , the rule of reason presents itself as temperance , continence , industry , frugality , and other principles necessary to individual conservation ; in the case of the family , it presents itself as domestic duty ; in that of the country as civic duty ; in that of humanity at large as general benevolence . Duty is another name for the observaiice of rules essential to our welfare in the different aspects of our being , especially in relation to our families , the community , and our fellow-men . It has its origin in the dawn of reason and reflection . Its warrant is general experience . It owes its sacredness to the voice of universal opinion . It is preserved by tradition , perhaps also by hereditary transmission . Conscience is the register in each man 's mind of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consequence , good or evil . The rule is improved , elevated , specialized , refined by each step in the progress of moral civilization . It varies in different *races or nations , according to their stage of civilization , or under the influence of local circumstance and fashion , sufficiently to repel the hypothesis of its being implanted by the Creator or Nature in all breasts ; but its general identity is preserved by the uniformity of human nature . So long as that uniformity continues , though we can not proclaim the immutability of right or wrong , we are not in danger of confusion . The utilitarian doctrine , in fact , appears to be sound provided that it is sufficiently comprehensive , and embraces all the needs , desires , and affections , domestjc , social , intellectual and even aesthetic , as well as egoistic , of our complex human nature . The rul'e of the highest expediency will then be identical with morality . We may , in fact , dispense with the term " egoism " as well as with " altruism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure in self-sacrifice , and it is felt by the man 's self . Beyond morality , as the rule of the highest expediency and the regulator of our current actions , there appears to be such a thing as a moral ideal . Beauty of character , apart from the current use- // fulness of moral habits , is a thing of which we a.ll more or less have a perception and to which the highest of our species distinctly aspire . This beauty may be capable of resolution into usefulness , and the admiration which the sight of it produces in us may be simply a high degree of that which is produced in us by the sight of any perfect and exquisite adaptation . It may be so or it may not . If it is not , there would seem to be an indication of something beyond the practical requirements of our present existence , something corresponding to the idea of spiritual life . We are bound to scrutinize all moral as well as all physical phenomena , and to reject anything fanciful or superstitious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of phenomena because they are not capable of explanation by any physical theory . After all , is not the mystery of the universe unfathomable ? Can we think it likely that the range of our five senses , upon the evidence of which all physical science rests , is coextensive with being ? How can we tell what there is beyond ? The great religions are in fact pursuits of a moral ideal which is personified in God , and the attainment of which is regarded as an approximation to the divine nature , bringing with it everlasting bliss . They are in this distinguished from anything Fetichist and from the mere- superstitious belief in the power of a tribal god , who is propitiated by sacrifices and rit*s unconnected with morality and sometimes distinctly immoral . This is eminently true of that which is far the greatest of all religions , Christianity . But the Christian ideal , however sublime and beneficent , is imperfect . It involves an impracticable secession from the world and disregard of all worldly interests . Christianity has had little influence on industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To hell with Spain ! Remember the Maine ! ' ' * been the cry of the most church-going of communities ? It has hitherto been the general belief that morality , besides being the dictate of our highest interest , was the command of God , in whom we have impersonated it , that conscience was His voice in our nature , and that it held out as the consequence of well or ill doing eternal reward or punishment . This belief , which k in fact essential to the common conception of conscience , has , on the most moderate estimate of its influence , been a powerful auxiliary to opinion and to law in the repression of individual appetites and passions , when by their violence they overcame the // social sentiments and threatened the general welfare . It has also acted as a social sedative by holding out to those who have reason to repine at their present lot the prospect of a reversal of conditions in the next world , tempering thereby the dangerous force of envy as well as that of disconteiXt . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hold , and its departure is attended by heavings of social discontent and disaffection . Law may repress detected crime , but it must first detect ; and if the voice of conscience is no longer heard in the breast , what is to restrain a man who thinks he can escape detection from gratifying his individual appetites and passions at the expense of his fellow-man or of the community ? Transition , as history tells us , has its perils , though all may be destined to come right in the end . The work of earnest inquirers such as Mr. Alexander Sutherland , who are trying to place morality on a rational and sound foundation , is therefore most seasonable as well as good.
