Miller , Joaquin , 1837-1913 : SONGS OF SUMMER LANDS . from Songs of summer lands ( 1892 ) In that far land , farther than Yucatan , Hondurian height , or Mahogany steep , Where the great sea , hollowed by the hand of man . Hears deep come calling across to deep ; Where the great seas follow in the grooves of men Down under the bastions of Darien : In that land so far that you wonder whether If God would know it should you fall down dead ; In that land so far through the wilds and weather That the lost sun sinks like a warrior sped ,  --  Where the sea and the sky seem closing together , Seem closing together as a book that is read : In that nude , warm world , where the unnamed rivers Roll restless in cradles of bright buried gold ; Where white flashing mountains flow rivers of silver , As a rock of the desert flowed fountains of old ; By a dark , wooded river that calls to the dawn , And calls all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonderful sun and weather , With green under foot and with gold over head , Where the spent sun flames , and you wonder whether ' T is an isle of fire in his foamy bed : Where the oceans of earth shall be welded together By the great French master in his forge flame red ,  --  Lo ! the half-finished world ! Yon footfall retreating ,  --  It might be the Maker disturbed at his task . But the footfall of God , or the far pheasant beating , It is one and the same , whatever the mask It may wear unto man . The woods keep repeating The old sacred sermons , whatever you ask . It is man in his garden , scarce wakened as yet From the sleep that fell on him when woman was made . The new-finished garden is plastic and wet From the hand that has fashioned its unpeopled shade ; And the wonder still looks from the fair woman 's eyes As she shines through the wood like the light from the skies . And a ship now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . It lies close to the bank ; Then a dull , muffled sound of the slow shuffled plank As they load the black ship ; but you hear nothing more , And the dark , dewy vines , and the tall , sombre wood Like twilight droop over the deep , sweeping flood . The black masts are tangled with branches that cross , The rich , fragrant gums fall from branches to deck , The thin ropes are swinging with streamers of moss That mantle all things like the shreds of a wreck ; The long mosses swing , there is never a breath : The river rolls still as the river of death . Miller , Joaquin , 1837-1913 : A GARIBALDIAN 'S STORY . from Songs of summer lands ( 1892 ) " Ay , signor , that 's Nervi , just under the lights That look down from the forts on the Genoese heights ; And that stone set in stone in the rim of the sea , Like a tall figure rising and reaching a hand , Marks the spot where the Chief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ah , yes ! as for me I have lights , and a leg  --  short a leg , as you see ; And have three fingers hewn from this strong sabre-hand . " Look you there ! Do you see where the blue bended floors Of the heavens are fresco 'd with stars ? See the heights , Then the bent hills beneath , where the grape-growers ' doors Open out and look down in a crescent of lights ? Well , there I was born ; grew tall . Then the call For bold men for Sicily . I rose from the vines , Shook back my long hair , look 'd forth , then let fall My dull pruning-hook , and stood up in the lines . Then my young promised bride held her head to her breast As a sword trail 'd the stones , and I strode with a zest . But a sable-crowl 'd monk girt his gown , and look 'd down With a leer in her face , as I turned from the town . " Then from yonder green hills bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the grey olive trees , We watch 'd the slow sun ; slow saw him retire At last in the sea , like a vast isle of fire . Then the Chief drew his sword : there was that in his air , As the care on his face came and went and still came , As he gazed out at sea , and yet gazed anywhere , That meant more , signor , more than a peasant can say . Then at last , when the stars in the soft-tempered breeze Glow 'd red and grew large , as if fann 'd to a flame , Lo ! something shot up from a black-muffled ship Deep asleep in the bay , like a star gone astray : Then down , double quick , with the sword-hilt a-trip , Came the troop with a zest , and  --  that stone tells the rest . " Hot times at Marsala ! and then under Rome It was hell , sure enough , and a whole column fell Like new vines in a frost . Then year follow 'd year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home  --  As the strife lull 'd a spell , came limping back here  --  Stealing back to my home , limping up out of hell , But we won , did we not ? Won , I scarcely know what  --  Yet the whole land is free from the Alps to the sea  --  Ah ! my young promised bride ? Christ ! that cuts ! Why , I thought That her face had gone by , like a dream that was not . .... " Yes , peaches must ripen and show the sun 's red , In their time , I suppose , like the full of a rose , And some one must pluck them ; that 's very well said , As they swell and grow rich and look luscious to touch : Yet I fancy some men , some fiends , must have much To repent of : this reaching up rudely of hand For the early sweet fruits of a warm , careless land ; This plucking and biting of every sweet peach Ere yet it be ripe and come well to its worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the reach Of the swine and the things that creep close to the earth . ... " But he died ! Look you here . Stand aside . Yes , he died Like a dog in a ditch . In that low battle-moat He was found on a morn . The red line on his throat They said was a rope . ' Bah ! the one-finger 'd man Might have done it , ' said one . Then I laugh 'd till I cried When the guard led me forth , and the judge sat to scan My hands and my strength , and to question me sore : ' Why , what has the match-man to do with all this ,  --  The one-finger 'd man , with his life gone amiss ? ' I cried as I laugh 'd , and they vex 'd me no more . " Some men must fill trenches . Ten thousand go down As unnamed and unknown as the stones in a wall , For the few to pass over and on to renown : And I am of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is free ; and what more , after all , Did I ask from the first ? Do n't you think that yon lights Through the black olive trees look divine on the seas ? Then look you above , where the Appennines bend : Why , you scarcely can tell , as you peer through the trees , Where the great stars begin or the cottage-lights end ! " Yes , a little bit lonely , that ca n't be denied : But as good place to wait for a sign as may be . I shall watch on the shore , looking out as before ; And the Chief on his isle in the calm middle sea , With his sword gather 'd up , stands waiting with me For the great silent ship . We shall cross to the shore Where a white city lies yon Alps in the skies , And look down on this sea ; and right well satisfied . " Have a light , sir , to-night ? Ah , thanks , signor , thanks ! Bon voyage , bon voyage ! Bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
