txt THE development of industry and the progress of economic thought have lately evolved in the union label an economic force which promises to grow constantly stronger as it becomes more widely known . It is sufficiently interesting , at any rate , to deserve more attention than it has hitherto received . Although the union label has been a valuable factor in strengthening three of the most powerful of the American trade-unions , and has exerted an incalculable influence in bringing about some changes that are of serious importance to society as a whole , it is within a year that it has begun to be noticed at all by the students of economics , or by anybody else outside the trade-unions . No mention of the label appears in any of the books on economics or sociology . Even Professor Ely , who has written exhaustively on the labor movement in America , apparently has never heard of the union label . The past year , however , has worked wonders for the spread of the label 's particular light outside the ranks of the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students of economics at Columbia , and one of the students has the label for his thesis . The National Labor Bureau has commissioned a special agent to investigate the union label . Consumers ' Leagues , whose membership consists of wealthy buyers , have discussed it exhaustively . Evidently its day is near at hand . To a great extent , no doubt , its neglect is due to the fact that American students of economics are forever studying the history of the English labor movement , with the conviction that the American organizations are bound to develop on identical lines , and that , given a similar situation , the step taken by the English unions twenty-five or thirty years ago is bound to be // followed by the American organizations of the present . They quite overlook differences in the American character and situation . The union label had never been heard of in England until a couple of years ago , when two delegates from the American Federation of Labor expatiated on its advantages at the convention of British and Irish trade-unions . The'union label is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who used it at first on the Pacific Coast in the later seventies as a means of protection against Chinese industry , which was flooding the California markets with cigars and threatening to drive the white cigarmakers to starvation wages in order to compete with it . The feeling against the Chinese was particularly strong just then , and an appeal was made to the smoking public on aesthetic and sanitary , as well as ethical , grounds . Men were urged not to purchase goods made by leprous Chinese under all sorts of unhealthful conditions , but instead to buy the products of well-paid white citizens employed at living wages in decent shops . To distinguish the cigars made by the white workmen from those made by the Chinese the local cigarmakers ' union issued a label , a strip of blue paper bearing the union seal , which was pasted around the cigar box after the fashion of the revenue stamp . The label was welcomed by the manufacturer , because with the public state of mind on the Chinese question its use meant increased sales of his wares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarmakers was so successful that it was adopted by the International Cigarmakers ' Union at its next convention , and its use has extended gradually until now " blue label " cigars are common all over the country . The Cigarmakers ' Union issues on an average about 20,000,000 blue labels annually . These labels are given on demand to any manufacturer who complies with the rules of the union as to wages and hours of labor . Besides indicating that the goods were a b ges , the made by members of trade-union receivincr fair wa union label is usually considered a guarantee that the article on which it appears was made in a factory complying with the factory laws , and not in a sweatshop or tenement . Occasionally , however , less stress is laid on this point than is desirable from the consumer 's point of view . Labels have been adopted by more than twenty national trade-unions , and they represent all stages of development . All // the labels indicate a struggle for improved conditions . Some of the.a* represent partial attainment . In most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is chiefly valuable at present as an indication that a certain evil has been abolished in the cases where the label is in use . The hatters were the first to follow the example of the cigarmakers by the adoption of a label to distinguish the hats made in " fair " shops from those made in " unfair " establishments . Twelve years ago , at a national convention , an inch square of buff paper , perforated around the edges like a postage stamp , was adopted as the hatters ' union label . It is sewed under the sweatband of the hat . A majority of hat manufacturers employ union men and the label is in use wherever there is any demand for it . All grades of men 's hats from the cheapest to the most expensive may be had with the label in them . The National Garment Workers ' Union has a cambric label an inch wide by two inches long , which is stitched into the pockets of men 's and boys ' suits and overcoats . About five millions of these labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the United States bears the union label . The demand for the label on ready-made cl6thing has been worked up within the past three or four years . The Garment Workers ' Union was organized only six years ago with 250 members . Its membership in 1896 was estimated at 40,000 . Within the past five or six years labels have been adopted by the bakers , tack-makers , iron moulders , shoemakers , coopers , beer brewers , horseshoe nail makers , wagon-makers , broom makers , collar and cuff makers , canners of domestic sardines , and a number of other trades . If one rides in a carriage one may have a union label on the horse 's collar , if one insists , and on one 's coupe or brougham . If one is an enthusiast on the subject it is quite possible to help create a demand for union labels by refusing to wear shoes , hats , collars , cuffs or coats or trousers which do not carry on them the union workman 's guarantee of fair making . Custom tailors and custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the readymade articles . Housekeepers have it in their power to make or numake the bakers , broom-makers , and a host of other tradeunions . They may if they choose serve their families with union labelled bread and crackers , union-labelled canned vegetables and // fruit . The housewife may put down her carpet with unionlabelled tacks , sweep it with nulon-labelled brooms , and set a union-labelled stove upon it . If one elects to do so one may patronize union-labelled shops . The retail salesmen have a button which they wear indicating membership in the Retail Clerk 's Union . The Barbers ' Union issues a card to mastor barbers who pay union wages and keep union hours . The card is hung in a conspicuous place in the shop or in the shop window . The union label appears more frequently on goods used by working people than on those in demand among the well-to-do . The reason for this is simple . The demand for articles bearing the union label originated with members of trade-unions acting in their capacity as consumers , and so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the union label . In fact until recently it was practically unknown outside the tradeunions . Overalls are the great staple for labels . They come under the head of ready-made clothing , of course , and the Garment Workers ' Union issues the label , but overall making is a distinct branch of the business . Indeed , the ready-made garment trade is exceedingly interesting as an example of the extreme to which the subdivision of labor has been carried . It is very rarely that a manufacturer makes more than one distinct kind of goods . No workman nowadays ever works on men s coats and trousers and children 's jackets , for instance , as he might have done thirty years ago . These different garments are made in widely separated shops by different people . And no one person makes a whole garment . One cuts it , another runs the seams , another hems , another bastes , another makes pockets . A coat passes through at least twenty hands in the process of making . The Garment Workers ' Union is an amalgamation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular division of the work . But to return to overalls , which , of course , are articles used exclusively by working men . It is hardly possible to buy a pair without the union label . The " scab " and the man who considers the union a great engine of oppression and injustice are likely to come in contact with evidence of its success every time he puts his hand in his overall pocket . The supply of overalls seems to come from half a dozen immense factories where thousands of women are employed . In this case the union label guarantees to // the purchaser that the garments were made under conditions several hundred per cent . better than those which prevail in other branches of the ready-made garment trade . There are few or no union labels on women 's ready-made clothing or other articles used exclusively by women , or made only by them . There are two causes for this . Neither*men nor women have yet come to a realization of the economic importance of women either in production or consumption . Women as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as purchasers for themselves and their families . Before there can be a union label there must first be a trade-union which shall adopt a label to be given to manufacturers who are willing to enter into an agreement with the union to provide what the workers and employers agree to be fair conditions . And before the union label can be of conseqnence in making or sustaining fair conditions there must be a purchasing public interested in creating a demand for it . Six years ago the International Typographical Union adopted a device which may be printed on all work done in a union office . Most of the offices , in the larger cities at any rate , employ only members of the union , so that if there were a concerted demand for this evidence of harmony between employer and employed it could be obtained . Public sentiment has not been aroused on the subjeeL as yet , however , and there is no such demand . Handbills and pamphlets printed for unions or social reform organizations usually bear the printer 's label , and in many small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of their editorial columns . The printers ' label , however , seems to have greater possibilities as a political force than any other . Forty city councils scattered over the country have passed ordinances requiring the union label on all municipal printing . The Montana Legislature recently passed a law requiring the label on public printing done throughout the State . Boston 's city printing is done by union printers , and the plant is under municipal control . Other unions have succeeded , in a measure , in getting recognition for their labels from local governing bodies . The Common Council of Utica has passed an ordinance that no iron moulding shall be used in public buildings which does not bear the iron nioulders ' label . // Such municipal ordinances are the result of concerted action on the part of local federations of unions in various trades . They demand , as citizen taxpayers and voters , that laws previously passed by State legislatures requiring payment of prex ailing wages and the employment of adult-citizen labor on all public works shall be enforced in local contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being evaded the union 's trade-mark shall appear wherever it can be used . It is interesting to observe the extent to which the law has taken cognizance of the union label . The first objection raised by the sympathetic outsider whose attention has been called to the union label as a means of improving the conditions under which workmen are employed is : " How shall we know a label is genuine ? May not anybody put a label on his goods and say it stands for fair conditions ? " Nearly every State in the Union where goods are made by organized workmen , or where such goods are sold , has passed special laws protecting union labels from counterfeits and imitations , in some States the labels are registered and protected nuder the laws regulating trade-marks . In 1895 twenty-five States had laws protecting union labels , and as the number of States having such laws is constantly increasing , it is likely many others have been added to the list since . The protection given by the label laws is very great . In many States the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offenders . The employer unable to get the right to use the label from the union , and yielding to the temptation to use a counterfeit or imitation , is liable to a year 's imprisonment or a fine of $200 , or both . This is the maximum punishment . It is less in some States , and in practice the limit will probably never be imposed on an offender . The goods bearing the counterfeit label may be seized and destroyed . The union also has grounds for a civil suit for damages . Mr. C. F. Willard , a lawyer employed by several unions to look after the registration of labels , says that the most important feature of the laws relating to uniou labels has not yet been recognized , either by the unions or the manufacturers . " In granting protection to union labels of associations of workmen , " says Mr. Willard , " the different States have recognized their right of property in such labels and in so doing have legalized the status of such associations or combinations . They recog // nize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually the abolition of the old conspiracy laws in those States which have passed laws to protect union labels . The label laws mean that the law recognizes the right of property on the part of the labor organizations in their label or trade-mark , and thus the right to hold property . They also mean that the wageworker has been conceded the right to own and register a mark to be used on goods , which in a legal sense he does not own , but into which the labor of himself and of his fellows combined in unions enters as a predominating factor . These laws , by inference , thus establish the equity right of labor in the product owned by the employer . " The trade-union never urges the label upon an employer , and no employer ever applies to the union for the use of its label until he is confronted with a demand for it from a sufficient number of his customers to make it worth his while to have it placed on the goods he has for sale . It must not be supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the employer to get ready to come around to the union office for the label . On the contrary , it is " perniciously active ' * in its efforts to influence him in an indirect way to adopt the label . The label is extensively advertised in the newspapers and labor organs . Pictures of the various labels and appeals to consumers to ask for goods bearing them are widely circulated among union men of all crafts and among their friends and sympathizers . Committees from local unions visit the shops of their towns arid set forth to dealers the advantages of keeping union-labelled goods in stock , since the several hundred or thousand members whom they represent are pledged to give the preference in purchasing to such goods , and to dealers keeping them on hand . In small towns the patronage of the union men and their friends makes a material difference to the shopkeeper , and frequently , through him , to the manufacturer who supplies him with goods . In one of the smaller cities of New York State a baker 's business experienced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he was the only boss baker who was willing to enter into a satisfactory agreement with the bakers ' union and consequently was the only one who could get the bakers ' label . The wives and mothers of the union men of the town were interested and took pains to buy none but bread bearing the union label , with the result that this // particular baker needed more help and the other bakers lost their trade . In many towns , particularly up in New York State and through the middle West , the wives of union men have been interested in the garment workers ' grievances , and when they buy clothing for their little sons they insist upon having the label in the pockets of jackets and knickerbockers . The demand for childrens ' clothing bearing the union label has been worked up to such an extent , through these smaller towns , that three large manufacturers in New York have within a year secured the label . Not long ago a manufacturing house up the Hudson went out of business , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make terms with the union , together with the persistent demand of its customers , the retailers , for union labelled goods , which their customers in turn insisted on having . The demand for the union label is hardly sufficiently developed as yet to make it possible to estimate or predict its effect upon production . A universal demand for it , of course , would take away any advantage which its use at present gives to dealers or manufacturers . Not to have it would be a disadvantage , but having it would not add to one 's customers . The sum which it adds to the manufacturers ' cost of production on any one article is infinitesimal . The cost of registering the labels in the various States , which amounts to about #500 , is borne entirely by the union owning the label . The cost of printing and making the labels is divided between the manufacturers and the union . The proportion varies with different unions . In the clothing trade the manufacturers pay two-thirds of the cost of the labels , or about $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cent to the cost of each garment . The cost and trouble to which the manufacturer is put to obtain the label is more than made up by the free advertising he gets through the union and the labor press , not to mention the additional customers who are secured by the use of the label . The effect of the use of the label upon consumption will be to bring an ethical element into economic transactions , a result much to be desired according to the best ecoaomists . It is in the change which has come over economic thought in the last quarter of the century that the union label finds its justification . The stress is no longer on production or exchange but // upon consumption . The consumer , it is seen , is the real maker of goods . Whether goods shall be made under sweat-shop conditions , under conditions which mean the brutalization of the great mass of humanity , or under conditions which permit the development of all that is best in the workers , and which are the best conditions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumers and not upon the producers . When the ethical sense of the community is so highly developed that no one will wear a garment for which just wages have not been paid , the sweatshop will disappear . In the present stage of development , the union label seems to to fill a want , to meet a desire for some guarantee that the articles are what they are represented to be-made under fair conditions . The union label is probably only a temporary device , just as any present thing is adapted to present conditions , present circumstances , present evils . When conditions and circumstances change , it will give way to something else . It is not an ideal solution of labor problems . If it does not stand for all its newest friends think it should , it must be remembered that it is not fully matured . Like the trade-union , of which it is an outgrowth , it must be of slow development . It can grow no faster than those who use it . In its early days the trade-union was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is a powerful economic , social , and political force . At first the union was little more than a temporarily organized mob , making , sometimes , unreasonable demands ; thinking strikes and physical violence the only means of gaining its ends . With more leisure and better wages , gained in part by these destructive methods , the organized workers have come gradually to stand for peaceful measures and various reforms beneficial , not only to themselves , but to the body of which they are a part . In similar fashion the union label is developing . At first it meant simply that the makers of the articles bearing it were white men , not Chinese . A little later it said to the buyer : " These goods are made by a member of the union of the trade . " The union man might be working in a two-room home , assisted by his family ; that did not matter . Presently the union reached the stage where it became an ardent advocate of factory laws and waged war on child labor . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made by a union man employed in a factory // governed by factory laws , receiving union wages and working eight hours or ten hours a day . It meant that the article was not made in a sweatshop or tenement house and that child labor was not employed in its making . In its very latest development the union label stands also for good workmanship . It signifies that the worker has reached the stage of growth where he takes sufficient pride in his work to put his best efforts into it . However desirable this qualification may be from a consumer 's point of view , there are grave difficulties in the way of its fullest development under the present organization of industry . Labor is only a partner . The laborer has not full say in the matter of what he shall put into the goods he makes . It is desirable , from the consumer 's point of view , that things shall be cheap . Possibly the only way to secure cheapness may be to put less work or inferior material into an article . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the manufacturers ' point of view , which is influenced always by the consumer 's desires , it may be better to turn out a great deal of work not done in the best manner than to make a few beautifully finished articles . Exquisite finish takes more time , costs more and must be sold for more . Fewer people can afford to buy it , no matter how much they may admire it . The demand is reduced . Fewer articles are required . Probably fewer workmen will be needed to make the limited supply . It is doubtful whether it is a wise thing for the consumer friends of the union label to insist too strongly as yet that it shall stand for good workmanship . The old saw , " What is worth doing at all is worth doing well , " is just as true as it ever was ; but until the public taste has been educated through technical and art training , or in some other way , so that it will have nothing but what is in good taste and well done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point where getting more than one pays for will not be considered an evidence of good judgment and good business ability , it will be wiser not to insist too strongly on excellence of workmanship . For the consumer to say to the trade-unionist , " When you can assure us that the label stands for conscientious workmanship , just relations between workmen and employer , good sanitary conditions , enforced factory laws , etc. , we will give you our hearty support , ' * is like saying to the slave , " We see you are un // qwq Mr. Sumner 's unsparing pen began to appear . Some unfit appointments were made and some good ones were unmade . And it was particularly observed that officers who had identified themselves with the rising aspirations for reform , like Secretary Cox and David A. Wells , were among the first to be retired . The removal of Mr. Motley from the post of Minister to the Court of St. James , and the degradation of Mr. Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct . Republican masses , in view of the tendency at Washington , and to a feeling of dissatisfaction with the President , although it found no immediate expression in proportion to its extent . Except in the simplicity and honesty of his character , the President 's traits were not calculated to propitiate the critical disposition thus evoked . If he had had the slightest touch of the dramatic dignity of Marlborough , or of the electric tact of Napoleon , he might have shrouded the errors of inexperience beneath a halo of well-earned prestige ; but being as plain as an average private , and as silent as a model picket , his short-comings lay open to the dullest observation , with everybody welcome to make the most of them . Hence it happened that , without regard to the question whether nine or thirteen of the President 's relatives were in office , - surely about the smallest question ever pressed by grave statesmen upon the attention of the American people , - and independent of the fact that there were grave differences of opinion among Republicans as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in defiance of the other more pertinent fact that his administration , on the whole , was a fair one , and was , in some respects , extraordinarily good and effective , the renomination , after all , was carried with the rather qualified heartiness and formal unanimity of which we have spoken . The truth is , two influences were , throughout , operative upon the judgment which General Grant 's administration had to encounter , and which colored the impression produced by every incident of importance as it arose . The first came from that accumulation of grievances , disappointments , hopes deferred , and the other personal discontents which inevitably rage within the bosom of a party that has been ten years in power ; and the other from the fact that , owing probably to the grand moral reawakening caused by the struggle for national preservation , there was a vital reform sentiment among the people , prepared to assert itself just as fast as the outstanding issues of the war period - which , in parliamentary language , " had the floor " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , to Grant 's administration being judged by a somewhat higher standard than had been usually applied to its predecessors ; and , on the other , to its encountering // a swarm of the most unreasonable and irritating objections . Out of this state of things arose the first marked phenomenon of the present campaign , the Liberal Republican defection ; and it showed both the influences we have mentioned but whether it is to be defined as a reform movement subject to personal perturbations , or as a quarrel taking on the pretensions of reform , is not yet settled beyond question . Perhaps some light can be thrown upon it by considering the manner in which the principal man of the movement became detach6d from the support of the administration . When General Grant entered upon his Presidential term , Charles Sumner was not only the most prominent figure in the Republican party , but in American civil life . History , indeed , must place him in the van , if not actually in advance , of the guiding minds during that crisis which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Made for rugged work , his foibles were as plain to his acquaintances as his merits were to the country . Such a man , out of gratitude as well as from the suggestions of an enlightened policy , deserved respectful and generous consideration on the part of all associated with him for common public purposes . If every one who was introduced to Erskine was expected to pay proper regard in conversation to the great principle of the right of trial by jury , if Chatham 's most esteemed friends had to wait patiently in his anteroom till his vestments and crutch had been properly disposed and the light adjusted with due Rembrandt effect , it was surely worth while for a new and unskilled Republican President to have paid special attention and even deference to Senator Sumner . It is to the eternal honor of General Grant that he showed a soldier-like delicacy and discretion toward his chief antagonist in the field , when he had him in his power . He ought to have been at least equally delicate and discreet toward his chief supporter in civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desirable . Had he understood this duty as well as President Lincoln did , it is almost safe to say that Mr. Sumner 's defection - so regretted by the best friends he still has - would never have occurred . We are not attempting to settle the question of moral responsibility among the parties to this affair , nor to determine the point at which policy would // cease to be a virtue ; but we are endeavoring to take a fair historic view of an event in which , as in most public events , personal influences played an inseparable part . Instead of pursuing the wiser course , the President neglected , not to say slighted , the Senator . The latter was not consulted , as he had a right to be , even in his province of foreign relations ; his opponents in the Senate received marked executive favor ; his intimate friend , Mr. Motley , was summarily and rudely removed from his responsible position ; and Mr. Sumner himself was deposed from the chairmanship which he had signally honored . True , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if not prompted by executive influence , it might have been averted by it . The San Domingo agitation widened the breach , till Mr. Sumner stood in open revolt against the President , and ultimately against his administration . From this point onward , truth compels us to say , that the personal injustice , the passion and vindictiveness were , so far as they were discernible to the public , wholly on the side of the Senator . The exhibition is lamentable , but it is not subject to the criticism of those upon whom rests the consciousness that they might have possibly prevented it , or that they ought at least to have made the effort . While Mr. Sumner is not to be taken as the complete type of the leading class who joined in the Liberal exodus from the Republican party , there were points of similarity in the personal influences visibly operative upon all . Mr. Trumbull and Mr. Schurz , Mr. Greeley and General Banks , undeniably had their grievances with the administration or its too often officious champions , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence their public action ; and the same peculiarity can be traced throughout the length and breadth of the Liberal movement . There was little in common at first between the individual seceders , and the whole movement had the questionable aspect of proceeding downward from the leaders , instead of upward from the masses . An organ of the party , commenting upon the little encouragement derived from the returns of the election in Maine , says that political reforms do not originate among such populations as the voters of that State . The truth is , it is exactly among such populations that they // do originate , as a general thing . When a young British nobleman was sneering at " tea-table reforms , " a veteran statesman said , " Never do that ; all the reforms in my day have come up from the tea-table . " In this country , certainly , there never was a great popular movement , reformatory or otherwise , that did not make itself heard in the " back towns " before it reached Washington . However , the Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking on its distinctive public character . A local contest in Missouri , where a portion of the Republicans had joined with the Democrats against the body of the supporters of the administration as to some points of State policy , particularly amnesty to the late rebels and revenue reform , was seized upon as the nucleus for a national organization . Thence originated the " Cincinnati movement , " favored by the Liberal Republicans on the one side , and the " Passivist " Democrats on the other , and ending its first stage with the Cincinnati Convention of May 1st . That body met avowedly and almost exclusively as a reform gathering , devoted to reform in general and to revenue reform ( to be embodied in a purely revenue tariff ) in particular . The person chiefly mentioned in connection with the ' Presidential nomination to be made by the convention was Charles Francis Adams , whose name , should he accept the honor , was a sufficient guaranty that he would keep the movement true to its professed objects , and whose character commanded the respect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and merriment of the people , fell upon horace Greeley . Precisely how this result was brought about is not known to this day , - whether it came from previous negotiations or understandings with Democratic leaders , of which there are some evidences extant , or was achieved through the skilful tactics of General Blair and Governor Brown of Missouri , in the convention itself , or is to be accepted as the last case of political spontaneous combustion , originating in the inflammable materials of a miscellaneous gathering . What is known is , that Mr. Greeley 's nomination proved as great a surprise to the more prominent and best participants in the convention as to the people outside , and a great source of grief as well . Here was a revenuereform convention nominating the most radical and inveterate // protectionist in the country ; a movement for the purification of politics seized upon and controlled by some of the most desperate political gamesters that even New York City could send to Cincinnati ; and an endeavor to fill the chief magistracy of the Union with a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of the talents which had made him a power in his sphere , exhibited not a single statesmanlike quality in his whole nature . Those who had gone into the convention for the purpose of founding a party on a reform policy , whatever had been their faith in reform as a principle , were confounded and paralyzed . They might have repudiated the nomination and made another on the spot ; and , since the convention had no formal delegate authority , they might thus have gone before the country with the full weight attaching to the wisdom of their action . But they had not the nerve and intrepidity for this . They hesitated and lost their last opportunity to make their principles felt in this campaign . In the mean time , where was the old Democratic party , so long the ruling political force of the country ? At the point of death as an organization . A writer , whose liveliness is quite in contrast with the solemnity of the subject , affirms that death does not necessarily mean departure from the scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such popular phrases as " dead and gone " and the like . Perhaps the Democratic party , therefore , was dead , but not gone . It had seen the main questions which it had contested during the last dozen years of its life decided irrevocably against it , and incorporated in the Constitution or imbedded in permanent legislation . Its prestige had been shattered by its equivocal and carping attitude toward the government in the great struggle for national existence , and during the reconstruction period its mere obstructive activity had exposed it to such uninterrupted defeats at the polls , that it was doubtful if it would make any Presidential nomination . Symptoms of the same condition , indeed , had been disclosed in 1868 , when the traditions of the party seemed likely for a time to be disregarded by the nomination of Chief JustIce Chase for the Presidency ; but in 1872 the conviction had become general among the more vigilant and practical spirits of the organization , that it was the merest folly conceivable to enter into another national campaign // under the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , the day which had finally come upon the old Federal party and upon the Whig party , was now confronting the Democracy , and they looked about to save themselves by translation , - a feat brilliant but of exceeding rarity in this world . The progress of the Republican defection had , accordingly , been watched with the keenest interest , as promising to afford that relief which could be discerned in no other quarter . Thoughtful Democrats saw an opportunity to slough off worn-out and discredited pledges and substitute new strength from what they called " live issues " ; the calculating had fresh visions of offices to be obtained through the reinforcement of the usual Democratic array at the polls by all the Liberal Republican voters ; and the rank and file were rallied to the inspiring , if not elevating , cry of " Anything to beat Grant . " This tendency was particularly obvious where it was hardly to have been expected , in the Southern wing of the Democracy , who thus appeared to be applying the last public advice of Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents " divided , and at issue with themselves , and then join the party and support the candidate and the platform that promises a restoration of constitutional liberty " ; and also to be fulfilling apparently a former prediction of Mr. Greeley 's , that " they expect to regain as Democrats , through elections , the power they lost as rebels through the war . " This singular result certainly did not spring from any new-born impulse toward reform at the South , for those representatives of the section who met the hesitating Liberals at the " Fifth Avenue Conference , " to see what should be done about Mr. Greeley 's candidature , horrified their associates by their utter indifference to the whole reform question , " caring no more about it , " according to one of the conferees , " than a starving person cares about the religious creed of a man who gives him a dinner . " The same Liberal authority testifies to utterances of " a thirst for revenge " on that occasion , - which may have been only the more intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their peculiar readiness to adopt Mr. Greeley , in spite of his championship of nearly all the reconstruction measures , especially of those // Oct. denounced for their " centralization " tendencies , could only be explained by their remembrance of his advocacy of the right of secession at the very moment when such a voice at the North was most fearfully potential at the South , of his misplaced peace negotiations at Niagara Falls , and of his bailing of Jefferson Davis , as well as by the " gratitude " which has been politically defined as " a lively sense of favors yet to come . " However that may have been , it was the fact , at once apparent to all intelligent observers , that the idea of accepting Mr. Greeley as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency was especially popular with the Southern section of the party , and was making its way with such rapidity through the rest of the organization as to insure its consummation at Baltimore . The only incidental question that arose in the mean time was as to whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the circumstances , to the support of the Democracy , or should receive a formal , old-fashioned nomination . The latter process was adopted , because , as explained by leading Democratic authorities , it would enable their party , in case Mr. Greeley should be elected , " to control his administration . " It will be seen that , at this point , the vital question comes in , what was the real character and extent of that change in the Democratic party which could constrain it to the unnatural and unprecedented expedient of going outside of its own ranks for a Presidential candidate ? We have said that the party was at the point of death as a political entity and force ; and the proof is , that it was no longer able to keep the field with its old organization alone , with its distinctive flag still flying and its record unbroken . It had become , in fact , through the disintegrating recoil of its own bad courses , but an aggregation of individual Democrats , detained within the old party lines because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into three classes , of which the first comprised those who had heartily and from conviction " accepted the situation , " as it was termed , or - which will answer as a sufficiently comprehensive designation - had become sincerely reconciled to the adoption of the principle of equal rights as the basis of our regenerated organic law , and who would be faithful to its logi // Cal application in practice . It may be conceded that this class of Democrats still exists to take part in the campaign , and cast votes for Mr. Qreeley . But it can not be large , either absolutely or relatively . It is confined to the young men - like those " not over forty years of age , " who alone originally accepted Harvey 's theory of the circulation of the blood - and to those men of thoughtful and independent minds upon whom partisan ties rest lightly . The fact that these men , throughout the last decade , have always had the ben*efit of a natural mode of expressing their approval of Republican measures by leaving their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands have availed themselves of that privilege , implies that they have not left many behind them of like convictions ; nor do we see any record of such in the usual , conventions and other authentic manifestations of the Democratic party , previous to the advent of Liberalism , when such record could have been attributed to principle and not to the hope of spoils . It was only the opportune supremacy of this class that could have justified Mr. Sumner 's professed belief in the wholesale conversion of the Democracy , - that could really have wrought the marvel of " the deformed transformed " ; and that supremacy was never even pretended . The second class was composed of those Democrats who , within their sphere , made good the rebel boast of having been merely " overpowered , not conquered . " They acquiesced in the three last constitutional amendments and the general results of reconstruction just so far , and so far only , as they were compelled to do so by the stress of irresistible public opinion . Whether this class still remains numerous or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only safe way to deal with it is to keep it fixedly under the impression that the fruits of the war , as embodied in our political system , are a finality . Another grand decision of the people in the line of those heretofore made , four years more of the steady sway and extension of impartial rights , will confirm these unapt students in the school of experience , beyond any danger of retrogression or wavering . But open to them now the prospect , or even the chance , of cancelling the work of reconstruction , by expelling its authors from power and installing its enemies , and all their progress hitherto is // undone in a moment , and they are changed from a negative element on the right side to a positive mischief-making force on the wrong side . There remain , then , those Democrats who are at heart hostile to the substantial achievements of reconstruction , and who mean to arrest and undo them at the first opportunity , and so far as the circumstances of the times will allow . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , whose representatives , in national convention assembled , only four years ago deliberately pronounced the whole reconstruction system " unconstitutional , revolutionary , and void . " What reason is there to believe that they have changed their minds during this brief period , especially as they have all the while maintained that President Grant 's administration was but adding one abuse to another in its policy toward the South ? Great parties and extended social communities must have time for radical changes ; the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence in politics as well as in mechanics ; and if the secession chiefs were , as one of them has boasted , thirty years engaged in indoctrinating their people for the outbreak , there is no hope that seven years of returning peace are sufficient to restore the victims of this malady to their right minds , and to expel the taint from public4ife . Accordingly , we have seen , within the last three years , several thousand well-authenticated cases of Ku-Klux violence , the horrible nature of which has been sufficiently certified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reverdy Johnson . We have seeii , during the present year , the Democrats of Kentucky - where they are strong enough to speak their minds with freedom - expressly reaffirming a former platform condemnatory of negro suffrage . And within a month or two we have seen the Democrats of West Virginia voting for a constitution framed to discriminate against the rights of the colored citizens of the State . Innumerable expressions of a determination to reverse the work of reconstruction might be quoted , not only from leading Southern men and newspapers , but from representative Democrats at the North . Of the latter , Judge Jeremiah S. Black of Pennsylvania , by reason of his high professional standing and his public career , will serve as a fair example . He speaks // of the present contest as " not all about men , and not wholly on questions of administration , " and points out that the real question relates to what he considers the evils inherent in the reconstruction system . Even Mr. Greeley 's election , he admits , will not extirpate these evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " begin the process of their gradual extinction , " for which he has faith in Mr. Greeley , not only on account of his history and character , but in consequence of " the moral influence which the Democrats will necessarily exert upon his conduct . " In review , therefore , of this branch of our inquiry , we think we are warranted in the very moderate statement that there is among the Democrats of to-day a strong reactionary element , which particularly interests itself in the election of Mr. Greeley . Lest we be thought to have overlooked another section of the Democracy , which , on the score of party pedigree and inherited prestige , would seem to claim some attention , let us say a word or two in reference to the Straight-out Democrats , who have thrust a candidate into the field , though it is still doubtful at our time of writing whether they will be able to keep him there . The doings of the Louisville Convention and the nomination of Charles O'Conor - with his replies so deliciously garnished with lofty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Quixote of a vanishing era - are , indeed , farcical enough , but they are significant as to some of the points we have already discussed . They show that there was not moral firmness enough in the Democratic party to prevent its somersault in policy , and not vitality enough to put forth any practical body of principles on the part of those who remained to represent the old organization . If this was the legitimate drama , the Democratic patrons appeared to be quite justified in rushing to the melodramatic exhibition of Cincinnati , for there was life there and not much danger of pathos being mistaken for fun . Thus we have before us the antagonistic issues and forces of the Presidential campaign of 1872 . The student of the era , like the average voter , perceives the usual disproportion of surplusage to substance , of irrelevant personalities to cogent arguments on either side . The roar of laughter that greeted Mr. Greeley*s nomination has subsided in a way which his friends // regard as quite complimentary to the dignifying effect of foriuidable strength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumner 's panegyrics , - nearly as amusing , though hardly as life-like , - have ceased to attract attention ; and all the noise about Grant 's gift-takings , nepotism , seaside loiterings , etc. , has been dismissed as of equally trifling account in the scale of national issues . Such things may qualify opinion as to candidates , but they do not affect their support any more than the great editor 's grotesque chirography would disturb his professional standing , or the great general 's cigar would interfere with his success in the field . The day is far distant when the American people will decide a Presidential contest on the strength of any considerations purely personal ; at all events , they have dropped them from this contest . There is another thing , however , which has been dropped that is much more serious ; for we think it must be conceded on all sidQs by this time that the question of reform is not now an issue before the country . Possibly it may be doubted whether a Presidential campaign is a fit time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that all the mercenary , corrupting , anti-reform influences and agencies are at the height of their activity . As well expect a Western steamboat captain to set about repairs in the midst of a race . What should have been done was to pass suitable reform measures , and to make their enforcement " all snug and tight , " before the tug for the Presidency came on . In this respect the Republicans were negligent , faulty , and all the more so that their President had led the way and invited their support . The measure of civil-service reform , which he established for officering the departments on the principle of ascertained merit , though limited and doubtless imperfect , was an excellent beginning . It failed - so far as it has failed --  solely from want of Congressional support ; that is , when the trouble is traced down to its roots , the people were found to be not yet earnest enough about the matter to compel their representative servants to relinquish an inherited brokerage in the patronage of the government . This kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the member for the district " first of all ; for suppose the President to be limited to one term , according to Mr. Gree // ley 's temporary hobby , the Congressmen would still have their own re-election to look after , their district friends to reward and enemies to punish ; and it is they who have usurped nine tenths of the appointing power of the executive , with , of course , the full knowledge and consent of their constituents . When the latter are ready for reform , general or special , it will come . The isolated incident which led many enthusiastic persons to suppose that the advent had already occurred - the overthrow of the Tammany thieves - was a special revolt against intolerable outrage , rather than the manifestation of a general sentiment in favor of reform , although such sentiment is unquestionably gathering strength all the time . IReform , is in the air ; but it scarcely touches the solid ground . It certainly did not at Cincinnati . The body there assembled was expressly called together on a platform of revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was discovered that those who had no right to be there at all were strong enough to shuffle the whole question aside and to nominate the chief protectionist of the country . And the candidate capped the climax of recreancy by swallowing all his strongest convictions . In his letter to Mr. Schurz , - who seems , about two months alter the nomination , , to have had a very natural curiosity to learn what had become of reform , - Mr. Greeley says , in portraying his ideal of a chief magistrate as a sort of Brahma of a new revelation , that " he should dread nothing but the accusing voice of history and the inexorable judgment of God " ; but at the same time he admits , by his own pledges to abdicate in advance the constitutional safeguard of the veto upon all revenue measures , that , as to this class of legislation at least , his two supreme objects of dread may fade away before the political obligations incurred in getting into office . From this drying up of reform at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have nothing to expect in that quarter , even if we could overlook the notorious clique of politicians who brought about Mr. Greeley 's nomination , or the fact that his champions and organs in the campaign have abandoned nearly all reference to the subject . The best that we can hope is , that a continuance of the present administration , by the general quiet it promises to afford and // the exclusion of all new sources of distraction , will provide a sort of coffer-dam , within which the foundation of genuine reform may be securely laid . Indeed , there is obviously a " previous question " which precludes as yet that full and free consideration of reform by the people which is requisite to its development , and which may come within the next half dozen years . That we are now very near the closing up of one distinct political era and the opening of another is apparent from various signs , such as the disappearance of well-defined principles on either side , the wavering of party lines and the decay of party discipline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of figure-heads on men-of-war , the strong family likeness of all platforms , and the general looking forward to new issues , without a corresponding preparation to meet them . These things indicate that the epoch of the war and reconstruction is about to give way to another with a totally different set of questions , probably reformatory and financial . But the people have an invincible repugnance to dealing with more than one class of questions at a time , or to opening new ones before the old ones are completely and permanently settled . And here , we imagine , is the hinge on which the present Presidential campaign will turn , making the popular decision analogous to the vote of confidence , or want of confidence , which usually settles the fate of British ministries . Two administrations are offered the American people , the one to be conducted by General Grant , the other by Mr. Greeley . Which will they have ? In considering the probable import and effect of Grant 's reelection , we need not pay the least qwq // threatening topic of disturbance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which not only satisfies the body of the people , but actually goes further than any event of modern times toward ushering in the sway of universal peace . A humane Indian policy has been initiated , and a judicious pressure brought to bear upon polygamy , which puts it , as Mr. Lincoln said of its twin relic of barbarism , " in the process of extinction . " The national debt has been reduced as no other debt ever was , the annual interest-charge having been diminished by over $22,000,000 ; our bonds have been brought up to par in gold , and are being renewed with new bonds at a reduced rate of interest ; the currency shows an advance of twenty-four cents ; over a thousand items of internal taxation , irritating as well as burdensome , have been compressed into a half-dozen , with a reduction of at least one third in the total amount levied ; the revenues have been found subject to an unprecedentedly slight shrinkage in passing from the pockets of the people to the coffers of the treasury ; the delicate financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease and security ; the hum of prosperous industry rises from every section , and mercantile confidence reigns supreme . But it is said there is a hideous blot in this picture in the condition of the South , aggravated , if not entirely produced , by the despotic disposition , military policy , and systematic neglect of those at the head of the government . When the electioneering contest is over , charges of this nature will surely disappear . It is not necessary to say that the evils which have undoubtedly rested heavily upon the people of the Southern States have been brought upon them by themselves , - they have grown inevitably out of the exigency . In the chaos , social and political , which there succeeded the war , the ballot had to be given to the freedman . His ignorance and other immediate disqualifications were distinctly seen and lamented ; but the ground theory of our institutions , all the considerations of the future , and the occurrence of an opportunity which , if neglected at the moment , could perhaps never be redeemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done more than they did to render the initiation of the new citizens into their rights rapid and advantageous to the community , and the same may be said // of the carpet-baggers who overran many parts of the South ; but both these classes were equally beyond the reach and control of the government . Perhaps the executive did not sympathize so openly as it should have done with the victims of misrule , but it could do nothing , without exposing itself still further to the charge of interfering in local affairs . And so it happened that South Carolina , for instance , in the paralysis which followed an exhausting war on its own soil , and the upheaval of its whole social system , suffered , just as the commercial metropolis of the Union had suffered , from the temporary ascendency of scoundrels over honest men , in addition to those other evils consequent upon the derangement of business , loss of productive power , and vitiated currency , which were afflicting the whole country . At the same *time enmity and injustice toward the negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the form of Ku-Klux violence , which was terribly far from being sporadic in its character , but bore , on the contrary , every evidence of a gigantic political conspiracy , waged for the most part , indeed , by worthless individuals , but having its roots in a bad public sentiment and the sympathies of influential classes . The government called for new measures of repression , and they were granted with powers ample and even dangerous in their *scope , and possibly not fully justified under the circumstances . They were used , however , by the President with a discretion and moderation which have compelled the recognition even of those to whom they were most offensive . The cry of military domination was absurd , because , if for no other reason , the military forces were not available for the purpose . Out of the reduced army of thirty thousand men the government could spare only one tenth for service at the South , exclusive of ordinary garrison duty . Amnesty , which the President had early recommended , has been in the mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of holding office only some two hundred of those original secessionist leaders whose " bad eminence " it was to add perjury to the crime of treason ; and these probably have only to go through with the form of application to Congress , or to wait for another session , to have their disability entirely swept away . Already thirteen Confederate generals are sitting in Congress . // Suffrage is , and for five years has been , so far as the Federal government could effect it , universal at the South ; and reform movements to rectify local abuses are originating , as they should , in the several communities concerned and among those heartily devoted to the new order of things . All that seems to be wanted is the quiet continuance of the present opportunities and dominant influences , in order that the great settlement may complete itself ; and that is precisely what we are to expect from the re-election of President Grant . What , on the other hand , is the country to expect from the election of Mr. Greeley ? To carry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Representatives , the Senate , for a time at least , remaining Republican . Discord , therefore , between the legislative branches of the government , an eccentric , fickle , and inefficient executive , and a ravenous horde of office-seekers swarming up from various factions outside , - this is the outline of the new situation which is promised us , and which was but faintly prefigured by the national experience under Andrew Johnson 's administration , - a prospect which the business classes of the country certainly can not contemplate with any complacency . Suppose , however , that through the weak or corruptible elements of the Senate , or by the effect of new elections , that body is brought into accord with the House and the President , - is the prospect any better ? Certainly not in the direction of reform . In his Portland speech , and in his assurances to General Gordon of Georgia , Mr. Greeley is the first of our Presidential candidates to give a public pledge as to the manner in which he shall distribute the offices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , that his inauguration will be the signal for a general revolution among the fifty thousand office-holders under the government ; and in the midst of that hurly-burly , who will remember " competitive examinations , " unless it be some applicant for place successful and happy enough to indulge in the best joke of the season ? Neither can such a prospect be regarded as favorable to the national finances . In the first place it would involve a change , and no change is wanted , least of all one to be inaugurated by a President who believes that a card tacked upon the treasury doors would accomplish the instant resumption of specie // payments , by making the gold in the treasury - which lie also thinks ought to be sold off- convertible into five or six times the same amount of paper-money ; who has in his train repudiationists on the one hand , and on the other those who advocate the payment of pensions to rebel soldiers and even compensation for the loss of slaves , and who think they see the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeley has disabled himself from resisting by renouncing the use of the veto . These , however , serious as they are , may be called minor objections to Mr. Greeley 's election ; the decisive one is this , that , in relation to reconstruction and the security of all those great results which have been bought by the blood and treasure of the country , that election would mean reaction . The composition of his supporters , their avowed aims , and the growth and controlling tendencies of their movement , all drive to this unwelcome conclusion . Every unrepentant rebel in the country , except the few so frenzied as to have fallen into the forlorn hope led by Mr. O'Conor , is in this coalition enterprise , and is there for a purpose ; all who are hostile to the establishment of impartial rights , all who would undo special parts of the reconstruction system , and all who are consciously or unconsciously playing into the hands of these men by their reckless political sympathy and co-operation , are now moving fraternally forward under the leadership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal traits become of any concern to the country . In order to resist or counteract the malign influences that would be swept into power with him , he would have need to be an exceptionally discreet , strong , stable character . That is exactly what Mr. Greeley is not . In the great crucial crisis of secession , when he ought to have been adamant , he was putty . And the fault was not exceptional : it was characteristic , and cropped out all through the war , to the serious detriment of the loyal cause . The mere fact , indeed , that an extreme " centralizationist , " an advocate of all the features of reconstruction most offensive to his present supporters , and of still severer measures which a Republican Congress declined to adopt , a life-long denouncer of the Democracy , and a recent eulogist of President Grant , should now be found heading a cause and a party so // utterly at war with his record , and all for the apparent purpose of gratifying a chronic ambition to get into office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidency at this juncture . Thousands of his supporters would have no other understanding than that his success meant somehow the reversal of that policy which they have stigmatized as despotism , and which , with all the blindness of prejudice and the sense of injury combined , they have abominated as the cause of their own misfortunes ; and we should again witness that hideous uprising of exulting disloyalty and violence which greeted the reactionary course of President Johnson . With these would be joined the mischievous intellects that have never yet paused in their scheming to undermine the whole fabric of reconstruction by whatever insidious measures the times suggested to their hands . It is not necessary to suppose , as General Banks suggests for the play of his grandiloquent refutation , that the restoration of slavery would be immediately attempted . Other lines of operation would be more available and profitable . The Southern war claims , which , at the time the court for their adjudication was established , judicious United States Senators estimated as likely to amount to not over seven or eight millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are coming forward at a rate which bids fair to reach double that amount before the close of the year . These would receive a tremendous impetus , in volume and strength , by Greeley 's election , and open a new mine of trouble and corruption . Of the ingenious efforts which would be made to amend the pension laws and to do away with all discriminations between those who , it will be said , engaged in a great controversy to determine contitutional questions , we have already spoken . All the laws of Congress , at least , which give to the Federal government , in denial of " State 's rights , " the enforcement of the later amendments of the Constitution , would be assailed , and if possible repealed . By this process , if successful , the protection of the freedman in his new immunities would be remitted to local legislation ; and if that would prove , in some States , any better than slavery , it would be owing to the development of a spirit among the late master class more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us distinctly say , however , that we do not apprehend that , , even if the worst came to the worst , these nefarious designs could be accomplished . The virtue that has regenerated the Republic will be found adequate to confirm its safety . at all points . But we should have a temporary arrest of all the present pacificatory processes ; bitter agitation , accompanied possibly with violent outbreaks , would embroil the sections , convulse business , and repress the prosperity and development of the country , - and surely that would be enough .. All this , too , would be done under the cry of " reconciliation* ' ! Reconciliation , indeed , is desirable and indispensable ; but it is a poor compliment to the rectitude of the American people to say that it can be anything else than an incident of the right settlement of outstanding questions . If , then , the settlement upon which the nation has determined and has brought so near to consummation is wrong , wrong in basis and wrong in purpose , let it be overthrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . But if it is right , as even the Cincinnati platform substantially admits , let us stand by it and keep it in the charge of its tried friends till it is perfected forever.
