txt MY earliest memories , or those which I can make sure are not the sort of early hearsay that we mistake for remembrance later in life , concern a country newspaper , or rather a country printing-office . The office was in my childish consciousness some years before the paper was ; the compositors rhythmically swaying before their cases of type ; the pressman flinging himself back on the bar that made the impression , with a swirl of his long hair ; the apprentice rolling the forms , and the foreman bending over the imposing-stone , were familiar to me when I could not grasp the notion of any effect from their labors . In due time I came to know all about it , and to understand that these activities went to the making of the Whig newspaper which my father edited to the confusion of the Locofocos , and in the especial interest of Henry Clay ; I myself supported this leader so vigorously for the presidency in my seventh year , that it was long before I could realize that the election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been a printer for a good many years , and some time in the early thirties he had led a literary forlorn hope , in a West Virginian town , with a monthly magazine , which he printed himself and edited with the help of his sister . As long as he remained in business he remained a country editor and a country printer ; he began to study medicine when he was a young man , but he abandoned it for the calling of his life without regret , and though with his speculative and inventive temperament he was tempted to experiment in other things , I do not think he would ever have lastingly forsaken his newspaper for them . In fact , the art of printing was in our blood ; it never brought us great honor or profit ; and we were always planning and dreaming to get out of it , or get it out of us ; but we are all in some sort bound up with it still . To me it is now so endeared by the associations of childhood , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presses without emotion ; and I should not be surprised if I found myself trying to cast a halo of romance about the oldfashioned country office , in what I shall have to say of it here . II . Oun first newspaper was published in southwestern Ohio , but after a series of varying fortunes , which I need not dwell upon , we found ourselves in possession of an office in the northeastern corner of the State , where the prevalent political feeling promised a prosperity to one of my father 's anti-slavery opin // ions which he had never yet enjoyed . He had no money , but in those days it was an easy matter to get an interest in a country paper on credit , and we all went gladly to work to help him pay for the share that he acquired in one by this means . An office which gave a fair enough living , as living was then , could be bought for twelve or fifteen hundred dollars ; but this was an uncommonly good office , and I suppose the half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Afterward , within a few months , when it was arranged to remove the paper from the village where it had always been published to the county-seat , a sort of joint-stock company was formed , and the value of his moiety increased so much , nominally at least , that he was nearly ten years paying for it . By this time I was long out of the story , but at the beginning I was very vividly in it , and before the world began to call me with that voice which the heart of youth can not resist , it was very interesting ; I felt its charm then , and now , as I turn back to it , I feel its charm again , though it was always a story of steady work , if not hard work . The county-seat , where it had been judged best to transfer the paper lest Every sort of farm produce was legal tender at the printing-office.

The dauntless man who represented the district in the House for twenty years , and who had fought the anti-slavery battle from the first , was his fellow-villager , and more than compeer in distinction and besides these , there was nearly always a State Senator or Representative among us . The county officers , of course , lived at the county-seat , and the leading lawyers , who were the leading politicians , made their homes in the shadow of the court-house , where one of them was presently elected to preside as Judge of the Common Pleas . In politics , the county was already overwhelmingly Freesoil , as the forerunner of the Republican party was then called ; the Whigs had hardly gathered themselves together since the defeat of General Scott for the presidency ; the Democrats , though dominant in State and Nation , and faithful to slavery at every election , did not greatly outnumber among us the zealots called Comeouters , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men to own men . Our paper was Freesoil , and its field was large among that vast majority of the people who believed that slavery would finally perish if kept out of the territories , and confined to the old Slave States . With the removal of the press to the county-seat there was a hope that this field could be widened , till every Freesoil voter became a subscriber . It did not fall out so ; even of those who subscribed in the ardor of their political sympathies , many never paid but our list was nevertheless handsomely increased , and numbered fifteen or sixteen hundred . I do not know how it may be now , but then most country papers had a list of four or five hundred subscribers ; a few had F // Perhapa because my head Was so sot with it my feet Were alWaYS very cold . - page 543. // qwq steam saw-mills dropped down on the borders of the woods have long since eaten their way through and through them , and devoured every stick of timber in most places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept full ; but at that time half the land was in the shadow of those mighty poplars and hickories , elms and chestnuts , ashes and hemlocks ; and the meadows that pastured the herds of red cattle were dotted with stumps as thick as harvest stubble . Now there are not even stumps ; the woods are gone , and the water-courses are torrents in spring and beds of dry clay in summer . The meadows themselves have vanished , for it has been found that the strong yellow soil will produce more in grain than in milk . There is more money in the hands of the farmers there , though there is still so little that by any city scale it would seem His children gathered about the same lamp with their books or their jokes .

At first our family was housed on a farm a little way out , because there was no tenement to be had in the village , and my father and I used to walk to and from the office together in the morning and evening . I had taught myself to read Spanish , in my passion for Don Quixote , and I was then , at the age of fifteen , preparing to write a life of Cervantes . This scheme occupied me a good deal in those bleak walks , and perhaps because my head was so hot with it , my feet were always very cold ; but my father assured me ers had to be thawed before they could be used on the press , and if the current of the editor 's soul had not been the most genial that ever flowed in this rough world , it must have been congealed at its source . The cases of type had to be placed very near the windows so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all the cold there was , too . From time to time , the compositor 's fingers became so stiff that blowing on them would not avail ; he passed the time in excursions between his stand and the stove ; in very cold weather , he practised the device of warming his whole case of types by the fire , aud when it lost heat , warming it again . The man at the press-wheel was then the enviable man ; those who handled the chill damp sheets of paper were no more fortunate than the compositors . The first floor of our officebuilding was used by a sash and blind factory ; there was a machine-shop somewhere in it , and a mill for sawing out shingles ; and it was better fitted to the exercise of these robust industries than to the requirements of our more delicate craft . Later , we had a more comfortable place , in a new wooden " business block , " and for several years before I left it , the office was domiciled in an old dwelling-house , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could never have been a very luxurious dwelling , and my associations with it are of a wintry cold , scarcely less polar than that we were inured to elsewhere . In fact , the climate of that region is rough and fierce ; and the lake winds have a malice sharper than the saltest gales of the North Shore of Massachusetts .

A deputation of the lead IT may h qwq caused it to give out at the moments of the greatest reluctance in the press . But still , he must have had his misgivings of latent danger of some other kind , though nothing ever actually happened of a hurtful character . To this day , I do not know just where those seams or fissures were , but I think they were in the boiler-head , and that it was therefore suffering from a kind of chronic fracture of the skull . What is certain is that , somehow , the engine and the press did always get us through publication day , and not only with safety but often with credit ; so that not long ago , when I was at home , and my brother and I were looking over an old file of his paper , we found it much better printed than either of us expected ; as well printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an old hand-press , instead of the steam-power press which it vaunted the use of . The wonder was that , under all the disadvantages , the paper was ever printed on our steam-power press at all ; it was little short of miraculous that it was legibly printed , and altogether unaccountable that such impressions as we found in that file could come from it . Of course , they were not average impressions ; they were the very best out of the whole edition , and were as creditable as the editorial makeup of the sheet . V ON the first page was a poem , which I suppose I must have selected , and then a story , filling all the rest of the page , which my brother more probably chose ; for he had a decided fancy in fiction , and had a scrap-book of inexhaustible riches , which he could draw upon indefinitely for old personal or family favorites . The next page was filled with selections of various kinds , and with original matter interesting to farmers . Then came a page of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had given his opinions of the political questions which interested him , and which he thought it the duty of the country press to discuss , with sometimes essays in the field of religion and morals . There was a letter of two columns from Washington , contributed every w.eek by the congressman who represented our district ; and there was a letter from New York , written by a young lady of the county who was studying art ur " er a master of portraiture then flourishing in the metropolis ; if that is not stating it too largely for the renown of Thomas Hicks , as we see it in a vanishing perspective . The rest of this page , as well as the greater part of the next , was filled with general news , clipped from the daily papers , and partly condensed from them . There was also such local intelligence as offered itself , and communications on the affairs of village and county ; but the editor did not welcome tidings of new barns and abnormal vegetation , or flatter hens to lay eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . All that order of minute neighborhood gossip which now makes the country paper a sort of open letter , was then unknown . He published marriages and deaths , and such obituary notices as the sorrowing fondness of friends prompted them to send him ; and he introduced the custom of publishing births , after the English fashion , which the people took to kindly . We had an ambition , even so remotely as that day , in the direction of the illustration which has since so flourished in the newspapers . Till then we had never gone farther in the art than to print a jubilant raccoon over the news of some Whig victory , or what was to the same purpose , an inverted cockerel in mockery of the beaten Democrats ; but now we rose to the notion of illustrated journalism . We published a story with a woodcut in it , and we watched to see how that cut came out all through the edition with a pride that was perhaps too exhaustive ; at any rate , we never tried another . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was controversial , and was carried on with editors of other opinions elsewhere in the county , for we had no rival in our own village . In this , which has always been the vice of American journalism , the country press was then fully as provincial as the great metropolitan journals are now . These may be more pitilessly personal in the conduct of their political discussions , and 546 I // of advertising . Then we did not get it , and we never got it , though we were always glad to get the legal advertising on the chance of getting the pay . It was not official , but was made up of the lawyers ' notices to defendants of the suits brought against them . If it had all been paid for , I am not sure that we should now be in a position to complain of the ingratitude of the working-classes , or prepared to discuss , from a vantage of personal experience , the duty of vast wealth to the community ; but still we should have been better off for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large and loyal list of delinquent subscribers . From time to time there were stirring appeals to these adherents in the editorial columns , which did not stir them , and again the most flattering offers to take any kind of produce in payment of subscription . Sometimes my brother boldly tracked the delinquents to their lairs . In most cases I fancy they escaped what . ever arts he used to take them ; many died peacefully in their beds afterward , and their debts follow them to this day . Still , he must now and then have got money from them , and I am sure he did get different kinds of " trade . " Once , I remember , he brought back in the tail of his wagon a young pig , a pig so very young that my father pronounced it " merely an organization . " Whether it had been wrought to frenzy or not by the strange experiences of its journey , I can not say , but as soon as it was set down on the ground it began to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and perished miserably . It had been taken for a year 's subscription , and it was quite as if we had lost a delinquent subscriber . a little more skilled in obloquy and insult ; but the bickering went on in the country papers quite as idly and foolish ly . I fancy nobody really cared for our quarrels , and that those who followed them were disgusted when they were more than merely wearied , The space given to them might better have been given even to original poetry . This was sometimes accepted , but was not invited ; though our sixth page commonly began with a copy of verse of some kind . Then came more prose selections , but never at a y time accounts of murder or violent crimes , which the editor abominated in themselves and believed thoroughly corrupting . Advertisements of various kinds filled out the sheet , which was simple and quiet in typography , wholly without the handbill display which now renders nearly all newspapers repulsive to the eye . I am rather proud , in my quality of printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we maintained it against all advertisers , who then as now wished to outshriek one another in large types and ugly woodeuts . It was by no means easy to hold a firm hand with the " live business men " of our village and county , who came out twice a year with the spring and fall announcements of their fresh stocks of goods , which they had personally visited New York to lay in ; but one of the moral advantages of an enterprise so modest as ours was that the countingroom and the editorial-room were united under the same head , and this head was the editor 's . After all , I think we lost nothing by the bold stand we made in behalf of good taste , and at any rate we risked it when we had not the courage to cut off our delinquent subscribers . We had business advertising from all V. the villages in the county , for the paper qwq lost , I am sure that this endeavor must have had some tacit effect ; and I am very sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted itself to the highest interest of the reader , that appealed to nothing base , and flattered nothing foolish in him . It went from our home to the homes of the people in a very literal sense , for my father usually brought his exchanges from the office at the end of his day there , and made his selections or wrote his editorials while the household work went on around him , and his children gathered about the same lamp , with their books or their jokes ; there were apt to be a good many of both . Our county was the most characteristic of that remarkable group of counties in northern Ohio , called the Western Reserve , and forty years ago the population was almost purely New England in origin , either by direct settlement from Connecticut , or indirectly after the sojourn of a generation in New York State . We were ourselves from southern Ohio , where the life was then strongly tinged by the adjoining life of Kentucky and Virginia , and we found these transplanted Yankees cold and blunt in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They formed in that day a leaven of right thinking and feeling which was to leaven the whole lump of the otherwise proslavery or indifferent State ; and I suppose that outside of the antislavery circles of Boston , there was nowhere in the country a population so resolute and so intelligent in its political opinions . They were very radical in every way , and hospitable to novelty of all kinds . I imagine that they tested more new religions and new patents than have been even heard of in less inquiring communities . When we came among them they had lately been swept by the fires of spiritualism , which had left behind a great deal of smoke and ashes where the inherited New England orthodoxy had been . A belief in the saving efficacy of spirit phenomena still exists among them , but not , I fancy , at all in the former measure , when nearly every household had its medium , and the tables that tipped outnumbered the tables that did not tip . The old New York Tribune , which was circulated in the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooled the people in the economics of Horace Greeley , and they were ready for any sort of millennium , religious or industrial , that should arrive , while they looked very wisely after the main chance in the meantime . They were temperate , hard - working , hard4hinking folks , who dwelt on their scattered farms , and came up to the County Fair once a year , when they were apt to visit the printing-office and pay for their papers . In spite of the English superstition to the contrary , the average American is not very curious , if one may judge from his reticence in the presence of things strange enough to excite question ; and if our craft surprised these witnesses they rarely confessed it . They thought it droll , as people of the simpler occupations are apt to think all the more complex arts , and one of them once went so far in expression of his humorous conception as to say , after a long stare at one of the compositors dodging and pecking at the type in his case , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This sort of silence , and this sort of comment , both exasperated the printers , who took their revenge as they could . They fed it full , once , when a country subscriber 's horse , tied before the office , crossed his hind legs and sat down in his harness like a tired man , and they proposed to go out and offer him a chair , to take him a glass of water , and ask him to come inside . But fate did not often give them such innings ; they mostly had to create their chances of reprisal , but they did not mind that . There was always a good deal of talk going on , but although we were very ardent politicians , the talk was not political . When it was not mere banter , it was mostly literary ; we disputed about authors among ourselves , and with the village wits who dropped in . There were several of these who were readers , and they liked to stand with their backs to our stove , and challenge opinion concerning Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dickens and Shakespeare . It was Shakespeare who was oftenest on our tongues ; indeed , the printing office // of former days had so much affinity with the theatre , that compositors and comedians were easily cQnvertible ; and I have seen our printers engaged in handto-hand combats with column-rules , two up and two down , quite like the real bouts on the stage . Religion entered a good deal into our discussions , which my father , the most tolerant of men , would not suffer to become irreverent , even on the lips of law-students bathing themselves in the fiery spirit of Tom Paine . He was willing to meet anyone in debate of moral , religious , or political questions , and the wildest - haired Comeouter , the most ruthless sceptic , the most credulous spiritualist , found him ready to take them seriously , even when it was hard not to take them in joke . It was part of his duty , as publisher of the paper , to bear patiently with another kind of frequenter : the type of farmer who thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be talked into continuing it . I think he rather enjoyed letting the subscriber talk himself out , and carrying him from point to point in his argument , always consenting that he knew best what he wanted to do , but skilfully persuading him at last that a home-paper was more suited to his needs than any city substitute . Once I could have given the heads of his reasoning , but they are gone from me now . The editor was especially interested in the farming of the region , and I think it was partly owing to the attention he called to the question that its character was so largely changed . It is still a dairy country , but now it exports grain , and formerly the farmers had to buy their flour . He did not neglect any real local interest in his purpose of keeping his readers alive to matters of more general importance , but he was fortunate in addressing himself to people who cared for the larger , if remoter , themes he loved . In fact , as long as slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness and dignity which the present geneiation can hardly imagine ; and men of all callings felt themselves uplifted by the appeal this question made to their reason and conscience . My father constantly taught in his paper that if slavery could be kept out of the territories it would perish , and , as I have said , this was the belief of the vast majority of his readers . They were more or less fervid in it , according to their personal temperaments ; some of them were fierce in their convictions , and some humorous , but they were all in earnest . The editor sympathized more with those who took the true faith gayly . All were agreed that the Fugitive Slave Law was to be violated at any risk ; it would not have been possible to take an escaping slave out of that county without bloodshed , but the people would have enjoyed outwitting his captors more than destroying them . Even in the great John Brown times , when it was known that there was a deposit of his impracticable pikes somewhere in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among us on some mysterious business of insurrectionary aim , the affair had its droll aspects which none appreciated more keenly than the Quaker-born editor . With his cheerful scepticism , he could never have believed that any harm or danger would come of it all ; and I think he would have been hardly surprised to wake up any morning and find that slavery had died suddenly during the night , of its own iniquity . He was like all country editors then , and I dare say now , in being a printer as well as an editor , and he took a full share in the mechanical labors . These were formerly much more burdensome , for twice or three times the composition was then done in the country offices . At the present day the country printer buys of a city agency his paper already printed on one side , and he gets it for the cost of the blank paper , the agency finding . its account in the advertisements it puts in . Besides this patent inside , as it is called , the printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as wide a range of matter as the exchange newspapers he used to choose from . The few columns left for local gossip and general news , and for whatever editorial comment he cares to make on passing events , can be easily filled up by two compositors . But in my time we had three journeymen at work and two or three girl-compositors , and commonly a boy-apprentice besides . The paper was richer in a personal qual // ity , and the printing-office was unquestionably more of a school . After we began to take girl-apprentices it became coeducative , as far as they cared to profit by it ; but I think it did not serve to widen their thoughts or quicken their wits as it did those of the men . They looked to their craft as a living , not as a life , and they had no pride in it . They did not learn the whole trade , as the journeymen had done , and served only such a brief apprenticeship as fitted them to set type . They were then paid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great at the end of a month as at the end of a year . But the boy who came up from his father 's farm , with the wish to be a printer because Franklin had been one , and with the intent of making the office his university , began by sweeping it out , by hewing wood and carrying water for it . He became a roller-boy , and served long behind the press before he was promoted to the case , where he learned slowly and painfully to set type . His wage was forty dollars a year and two suits of clothes , for three years , when his apprenticeship ended , and his wander-. years ( too often literally ) began . He was glad of being inky and stained with the marks of his trade ; he wore a fourcornered paper cap , in the earlier stages of his service , and even an apron . When he became a journeyman , he clothed himself in black doeskin and broadcloth , and put on a silk hat , and the thinnestsoled fine boots that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of the world as he knew how to do . His work brought him acquainted with a vast variety of interests , and kept his mind as well as hands employed ; he could not help thinking about them , and he did not fail to talk about them . His comments had generally a slightly acid flavor , and his constant survey of the world , in the " map of busy life ' always under his eye , bred in him the contempt of familiarity . He was none the less agreeable for that , and the jokes that flew about from case to case in our office were something the editor would have been the last man to interfere with . He read or wrote on through them all , and now and then turned from his papers to join in them . vi THE journeyklan of that time and place was much better than the printer whom we had known earlier and in a more lax civilization , who was too apt to be sober only when he had not the means to be otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket , and departed into it with only money enough to carry him to the next printing-office . If we had no work for him it was the custom to take up a collection in the office , and he accepted it as a usage of the craft , without loss of self-respect . It could happen that his often infirmity would overtake him before he got out of town , but in this case he did not return for a second collection ; I suppose that would not have been good form . Now and then a printer of this earlier sort appeared among us for a little time , but the air of the Western Reserve was somehow unfriendly to him , and he soon left us for the kindlier clime of the Ohio River , or for the more southerly region which we were ourselves sometimes so homesick for , and which his soft , rolling accent so pleasantly reminded us of . Still , there seemed to be something about the business-perhaps the arsenic in the typemetal-which everywhere infected the morals with a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves . There was one of our printers who was a capital compositor , a most engaging companion , and of unimpeachable Western Reserve lineage , who would work along in apparent perpetuity on the line of duty , and then suddenly deflect from it . If he wanted a day off , or several days , he would take the time , without notice , and with a princely indifference to any exigency we might be in . He came back when he chose , and offered to go to work again , and I do not remember that he was ever refused . He was never in drink ; his behavior was the effect of some obscure principle of conduct , unless it was that moral contagion from the material he wrought in . I do not know that he was more characteristic , though , than another printer of ours , who was dear to my soul from the quaintness of his humor and his love of literature . I think he was , upon // the whole , the most original spirit I have known , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was then aiming to become a professor in some college , and was diligently training himself for the calling in all the leisure he could get from his work . The usual thing would have been to read law and crowd forward in political life , but my friend despised this common ideaL We were both studying Latin , he quite by himself , as he studied Greek and German , and I with such help as I could find in reciting to a kindly old minister , who had forgotten most of his own Latin , and whom I do not now wish to blame for falling asleep over the lessons in my presence ; I did not know them well enough to keep him up to the work . My friend and I read the language , he more and I less , and we tried to speak it together , to give ourselves consequence , and to have the pleasure of saying before some people 's faces what we should otherwise have said behind their backs ; I should not now undertake to speak Latin to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal together , mainly Shakespeare and Cervantes . I had a task of a certain number of thousand ems a day , and when I had finished that I was free to do what I liked ; he would stop work at the same time , and then we would take our Don Quixote into some clean , sweet beechwoods there were near the village , and laugh our hearts out over it . I can see my friend 's strange face now , very regular , very fine , and smooth as a girl 's , with quaint blue eyes , shut long , long ago , to this dolce lome ; and some day I should like to tell all about him ; but this is not the place . When the war broke out he left the position he had got by that time in some college or academy farther West , and went into the army . One morning , in Louisiana , he was killed by a guerilla who got a shot at him when he was a little way from his company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain . But as yet such a fate was unimaginable . He was the first friend of my youth ; he was older than I by five or six years ; but we met in an equality of ambition and purpose , though he was rather more inclined to the severity of the scholar 's ideal , and I hoped to slip through somehow with a mere literary use of my learning . *TL As I have tried to say , the printers of that day had nearly all some affinity with literature , if not some love of it ; it was in a sort always at their fingers ' ends , and they must have got some touch of it whether they would or not . They thought their trade a poor one , moneywise , but they were fond of it and they did not often forsake it . Their hope was somehow to get hold of a country paper and become editors and publishers ; and my friend and I , when he was twenty-four and I eighteen , once crossed over into Pennsylvania , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had not the courage to offer even promises to pay for it . The craft had a repute for insolvency which it merited , and it was at odds with the community at large by reason of something not immediately intelligible in it or at least not classifiable . I remember that when I began to write a certain story of mine , I told Mark Twain , who was once a printer , that I was going to make the hero a printer , and he said , " Better not . People will not understand him . Printing is something every village has in it , but it is always a sort of mystery , and the reader does not like to be perplexed by something that he thinks he knows about . " This seemed very acute and just , though I made my hero a printer all the same , and I offer it to the public as a light on the anomalous relation the country printer bears to his fellowcitizens . They see him following his strange calling among them , but to neither wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not take up something else , something respectable and remunerative ; they feel that there must be something weak , something wrong in a man who is willing to wear his life out in a vocation which keeps him poor and dependent on the favor they grudge him . It is like the relation which all the arts bear to the world , and which is peculiarly thankless in a purely commercial civilization like // ours ; though I can not pretend that printing is an art in the highest sense . I have heard old journeymen claim that it was a profession and ought to rank with the learned professions , but I am afraid that was from too fond a pride in it . It is in one sort a handicraft , like any other , like carpentering or stonecutting ; but it has its artistic delight , as every handicraft has . There is the ideal in all work ; and I have had moments of insurpassable gladness in feeling that I had come near the ideal in what I had done in my trade . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as modern methods have taken it from him they have wronged him . I can understand iRuskin in his wish to restore it to some of the handicrafts which have lost it in the " base mechanical " operations of the great manufactories , where men spend their lives in making one thing , or one part of a thing , and can not follow their work constructively . If that were to be the end , the operative would forever lose the delight in work which is the best thing in the world . But I hope this is not to be the end , and that when people like again to make things for use and not merely for profit , the workman will have again the reward that is more than wages . I know that in the old-fashioned country printing-office we had this , and we enjoyed our trade as the decorative art it also is . Questions of taste constantly arose in the arrangement of a title-page , the display of a placard or a handbill , the use of this type or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they employed the critical faculty and the aesthetic instinct , and they allied us , however slightly and unconsciously , with the creators of the beautiful . But now , it must be confessed , printing has shared the fate of all other handicrafts . Thanks to united labor , it is better paid in each of its subdivisions than it once was as a whole . In my time , the hire of a first-rate country printer , who usually worked by the week , was a dollar a day ; but of course this was not so little in 1852 as it would be in 1892 . My childish remembrance is of the journeymen working two hours after supper , every night , so as to make out a day of twelve hours ; but at the time I write of the day of ten hours was the law and the rule , and nobody worked longer , except when the President 's message was to be put in type , or on some other august occasion . The pay is not only increased in proportion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conditions are all very much better . But I believe no apprentice now learns the whole trade , and each of our printers , forty years ago , would have known how to do everything in the kind of office he hoped some day to own . He would have had to make a good many things which the printer now buys , and first among them the rollers , which are used for inking the types on the press : These were of a composition of glue and molasses , and were of an india-rubbery elasticity and consistency , as long as they were in good condition . But with use and time , they became hard , the ink smeared on them , and they failed to impart it evenly to the type ; they had to be thrown away , or melted over again . This was done on the office stove , in a large bucket which they were cut up into , with fresh glue and molasses added . It seems in the retrospect to have been rather a simple affair , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved so much absolute failure , and rarely have given a satisfactory result . The mould was a large copper cylinder , and the wooden core of the roller was fixed in place by an iron capand foot-piece . The mixture boiled away , as it now seems to me , for days , and far into the sleepy nights , when as a child I was proud of sitting up with it very late . Then at some weird hour , my father or my brother poured it into the mould , and we went home and left the rest with fate . The next morning the whole office crowded round to see the roller drawn from the mould , and it usually came out with such long hollows and gaps in its sides that it had to be cut up at once , and melted over again . At present , all rollers are bought somewhere in New York or Chicago , I believe , and a printer would no more think of making a roller than of making any otherpart of his press . " And youknow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , " we do n't wet the paper now . " Good heavens , " said I , " you do n't print // Then we would take our Don Quixote into some clean , sweet beech-woods there were near the viliage. *Page 551. // it dry ! " " Yes , and it does n't blur any more than if it were wet . " I suppose wetting the paper was a usage that antedated the invention of movable types . It used to be drawn quire by quire , through a vat of clear water , and then the night before publication day , it was turned and sprinkled . Now it was printed dry , I felt a if it were time to class Benjamin Franklin with the sunmyths . VIII . PUBLICATION day was always a time of great excitement . We were busy all the morning getting the last editorials and the latest news in type , and when the paper went to press in the afternoon , the entire force was drafted to the work of helping the engine and the press through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the press , even when it was in a willing frame ; others folded the papers as they came from it ; as many more were called off from their wonted work to address them to the subscribers ; for , with the well-known fickleness of their sex , the young ladies of the village ceased Skilfully persuading him at last that a hsme paper was more suited ts his needs . - Page 549. to do this as soon as the novelty of the affair wore off . Still , the office was always rather a lively scene , for the paper was not delivered at the village houses , and each subscriber came and got his copy ; the villagers began to come about the hour we went to press , the neighboring farmers called next day , and throughout the week . Nearly everybody who witnessed the throes of our machinery had advice or sympathy to offer , and in a place where many people were of a mechanical turn , the spectacular failure of the editor 's additions and improvements was naturally a source of public entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventions as he did . Of course , about election time the excitement was intensified ; we had no railroad or telegraphic communication with the outer world , but it was felt that we somehow had the news , and it was known that we had the latest papers from Cleveland , and that our sheet would report the intelligence from them . After all , however , there was nothing very burning or seething in the eagerness of our subscribers . They could wait ; their knowledge of the event would not change it , or add or take away one vote either way . I dare say it is not so very differcut now , when the railroad and the telegraph have made the little place simultaneous with New York and London . We people who fret our lives out in cities , do not know how tranquil life in the country stillis . We talk of the whirl and rush , as if it went on everywhere , but if you will leave the express train anywhere and pass five miles into the country , away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rush . People sometimes go mad there from the dulness and the ennui , as in the cities they sometimes go mad from the stress and the struggle ; and the problem of equalizing conditions has no phase more interesting than that of getting the good of the city and the country out of the one into the other . The old - fashioned country newspaper formed almost the sole intellectual experience of the remote and quiet folks who dwelt in their lonely farmsteads // on the borders of the woods , with few neighbors , and infrequent visits to the township centre , where the church , a store or two , and a tavern constituted a But by far the greater number of our subscribers took no paper but our own . I do not know whether there is much more reading done now on the farms , Well , let 's see what old Horace says this week . qwq prise , which was more important in our eyes than the matters the message treated of . There is no longer the eager popular expectation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think it is something of a loss , that ebb of the high tide of political feeling which began with the era of our immense material prosperity . It was a feeling that formed a solidarity of all the citizens , and if it waa not always , or often , the highest interest which can unite men , it was at least not that deadly and selfish cult of business , which centres each of us in his own affairs and kills even our curiosity about others . Very likely people were less bent qwq born ; and the people instinctively feel that they have no longer the old interest in President or Congret*s ? There are those that say so , and whether they are right or not , it is certain that into the great centres where money is heaped up , the life of the country is drained , and the country press has suffered with the other local interests . The railroads penetrate everywhere , and carry the city papers seven times a week , where the home paper pays its tardy visit once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the invasive dailies . Other causes have worked against the country press . In counties where there were once two or three papers , there are now eight or ten , without a material increase of population to draw upon for support . The county printing , which the paper of the dominant party could reckon upon , is now shared with other papers of the same politics , and the amateur printingoffices belonging to ingenious boys in every neigliborhoed get much of the small job-work which once came to the publisher . qwq ure loves a scapegoat , and from time to time we load up some individual with the common sins , and drive him into a wilderness where he seems rather to enjoy himself than otherwise . I suppose that even if the conditions had continued favorable , the country press could never have become the influence which our editor fondly hoped and earnestly strove to make it . Like all of us who work at all , the country printer had to work too hard ; and he had little time to think or to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His paper had once perhaps as much influence as the country pulpit ; its support was certainly of the same scanty and reluc tant sort , without consecration by an avowed self-devotion . He was concerned with the main chance first , and after that there was often no other chance , or he lost sight of it . I should not instance him as an exemplary man , and I should be very far from idealizing him ; I should not like even to undertake the task of idealizing a city journalist ; and yet , in the retrospect at least , the country printer has his pathos for me  --  the pathos of a man who began to follow a thankless calling because he loved it , and kept on at it because he loved it , or else because . its service had warped and cramped him out of form to follow any other.
