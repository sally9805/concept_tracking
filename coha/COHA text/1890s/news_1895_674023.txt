Smith and his father , Henry Smith , who is sixty years old , work until a late hour . They worked last night until after midnight . On their way home they stopped at a restaurant to get something to eat , and then concluded to take home a pall of oysters . When these were opened it was 1:30 o'clock . They reached home about twenty minutes later . There is an alley beside the house . They passed through this alley in order to enter by the rear door . They found this door open , but supposed that Mrs. Smith had neglected to close it . The elder Smith passed through the kitchen into the dining room , while the son waited for him to light the gas , intending to put the pail of oysters he carried in the refrigerator .

Smith grappled with him . The next instant the burglar pressed a pistol against his side and fired . The ball took effect , and as Smith staggered back the burglar escaped through the door and into the yard of the adjoining house , where he scaled a fence and got away through Traphagen Street . Smith , recovering from the shock , and in the excitement not realizing how badly he was wounded , started after him .

Otsinger saw that the man was in his stocking feet , but that was about all he did see . As he appeared in the hall the burglar leveled a pistol at him . " Get back into your room , " said the robber , " or I 'll shoot you through the head . " Otsinger retired precipitately , but , peering out as he held the door on a crack , he saw the burglar drop to the top of the porch , whence he jumped to the ground and escaped without any one but Otsinger seeing him or knowing of his presence .
