txt Before the war broke out it seemed to be an accepted fact that the project of Hawaiian annexation was killed . There had been too much time allowed for discussion , and the effect of free and full discussion had been to crush the project . But the vitality of the project is both remarkable and suspicious . It is given out that the annexation of Hawaii is now to be urged as a " war measure , " and it is asserted that the feeling on behalf of it in Congress is very much stronger than when it was up before . There is absolutely no rational basis for this feeling . There is not only no sort of reason which did not exist before why Hawaii should be annexed to the United States , but the existing condition strengthens the argument against annexation . We have the entire friendliness of the Hawaiian Government in the war with Spain , and at the same time we do not need it .

We need no intermediate station between San Francisco and Manila or Hongkong . But if we did need it in the Hawaiian Islands , we should have it by the action of the Hawaiian Government , which has put the islands , in the Spanish phrase , at our disposition . Their rulers may have relied upon a wave of indiscriminate effusion from Washington in reciprocation of this offer , which should result in floating the islands , with all their responsibilities , into our possession . But that is no reason why the wave should make itself manifest . On the contrary , it is a very good reason why it should not .

The islands are satisfied with them ; they are satisfied with the islands . Why , then , their anxiety to unload the islands on us ? For the purposes of war all we need there is a naval base . Even that we no longer need for the purposes of this war , the power of Spain in the Pacific being already nullified . And we should still be recognized , whether we assumed the control of the islands or not , as having a paramount interest in their destinies . That interest has been steadily asserted by ourselves and steadily recognized by Great Britain , the only power of which the naval force in the Pacific is sufficient to dispute it . It is true that it is to American capital and enterprise that the islands look for their development .
