txt Goldwin Smith in The Saturday Review . The Monroe doctrine seems to have been of late the theme of active discussion in the British press , and to have been treated by different journals in different ways . Soma journals seem to have treated it as an aggression , others as a fanfaronade , and others again as a hypothesis which they might safely concede in dealing with the Venezuelan question . By this time Englishmen must all know pretty well what the Monroe doctrine really is . They must be aware that there are , in fact , two doctrines comprised in the same message of President Monroe , cognate , yet distinct from each other , and directed as warnings to different powers . To Russia is directed the warning that the American continent is no longer to be regarded as a field for European colonization . To the Holy Alliance , which was inclined to meddle with the new-born republicanism of South America , is directed the warning that no European power can be allowed to interfere with the political selfdevelopment of American communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South American Republics will be regarded as an unfriendly act by the United States . Monroe Manifestly claimed for his Republic a tutelary power . On the other hand , there is nothing in the message that can be construed as a pretension to territorial aggrandizement on the . part of the United States . Whether the Monroe doctrine thus stated is a part of international law seems not a very practical question . International law is a law without a legislature , without a policeman , and without a Judge . Its highest court of appeal is the cannon . The Monroe doctrine will be law if America is strong enough to enforce it . Louis Napoleon did not regard it as law , but he nevertheless had to accept it and retire from Mexico . In this respect it seems to stand on much the same footing as the European protectorate of Turkey , the guaranteed independence of ? Belgium , and other understandings respected in diplomacy , which rest , not on universal law , but on the readiness of the parties interested to fight for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monroe doctrine as formulated in the famous message that Englishmen are now in contact , and , if Mr. Chamberlain pursues his " dream " of imperial confederation , may be one day brought into collision , so much as with the Monroe sentiment . The Monroe sentiment imports that the New World shall be free from Interference on the part of the Old World ; that it shall be allowed to follow its own destinies , and to work out its own civilization ; that It shall not be made the field or the highway of European war ; but shall be left without molestation to dedicate itself to peaceful industry and the improvement of the human lot . There is in this , at all events , nothing of vulgar ambition or rapacity . Of mere territorial aggrandizement I have never in thirty years of intercourse detected the slightest desire in the American breast . The Americans refused San Domingo , they refused St. Thomas . and they would yery likely have refused Alaska , if they could have done it without offending Russia , who had been their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical or political , fled with slavery . But the Monroe sentiment as to the independence of the continent has always seemed to me to be strong , and strong I believe it would be found by any one who should venture to defy It . It showed its force in the fixed resolution to eject Louis Napoleon and his Latin Empire from Mexico , while the Americans have never betrayed any disposition to annex Mexico themselves , easy as the acquisition would probably be . Nothing seems to be more certain than that Canada , if she were independent and chose so to remain , might rest in perfect security by the side of her mighty neighbor . Opinion in the United States is even divided as to the expediency of admitting her to the Union . If she is the object of any hostile feeling on the part of the Americans , it is not as an independent territory , but as the outpost and the entering wedge of European interfere ence with the American continent . In that aspect she is always being presented to the Americans by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military harbor which Englishmen are constructing at Esquimault threaten the territory of the , United States , though they are not constructed with that object . Esquimault threatens the whole Pacific coast , which at present is defenseless . The bombardment of the seaboard cities of the United States by English ironclads is a. familiar subject - of speculation . Hence naturally arises a. desire on the part of the Americans to create a war navy ; and that navy is , of course , directed against the only power from which they have anything to fear . People in England do not realize all this , nor do they hear the language which Canadian loyalty holds , or see the demonstrations in which it indulges on their behalf . ? Whether in case of war a sea power could Well avail itself of a land route , and , in particular , whether the Canadian Pacific Railway , with the accidents to which a mountainous and sub-arctic line is exposed , could be trusted for the sure and rapid transmission of troops , are questions for the War Office to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt on the part of Great Britain tO use the American Continent as a base or highway of sear against a nation with which the United States were at peace would be apt to call the Monroe sentiment into active play . Englishmen have to consider , then , what would be the safety and value of a. military road , exposed as the Canadian Pacific Railway is , through a great Part of its course , to the emissaries of any hostile power , against whose machinations It could be protected only by the most zealous vigilance on the part of the adjoining States . Some side lights have recently been thrown upon these questions . The Canadian Commissioner says that the English is the only nation that treats its colonies commercially as foreign countries . Are not the English the only colonies which treat their mother country as a commerical enemy , laying protective duties on ha , goods ? Englishmen have been given by a Canadian Minister to understand , in effect , that the imperial veto on colonial legislation is a preZtical nullity , however injurious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will legislate for herself in commercial matters , with little regard to British expostulations . Even on such a question as copyright it is found that imperial unity does not exist . The refusal of the colonies to contribute ts imperial armaments appears to be definitive . According- to the colonial theories which have been broached in connection with the copyright question , the British Parliament is , in fact , only one of a number of local legislatures , all independent of each other , nothing being imperial except the nominal power of the Crown , the only perogative of Great Britain being her sole responsibility for the general defense . If Mr. Chamberlain 's " dream " is , as he says , tending to become a reality , its approacan it masked with great skill . These opinions , I fear , are not popular ; but I know that they are those of an Englishman loyal to the interests and honor of his country . The " Messiah " at the Opera . House .
