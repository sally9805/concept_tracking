txt An " appreciation " of Carmencita , the Spanish dancer , sppeIrs in the always serious and often seve-e columns of The London Saturday Review of a character so remarkable that it will be read with amazement by Americans , wile , while most of them more or less admired the vigorous art of that agile young person , never thought of regarding her as a person of any great importance . If the British critic is to be believed , they missed the opportunity of a lifetime . Hear him : " It Is curiously significant of this nation and this age , an age of sham passion and anaemic gesture , that the greatest of living dancers has come among us , and we have known her not . For several weeks past Carmencita has danced nightly before an audience that has made little pretense of appreciating her art , and none of understanding it . But for the genius of an American painter it is unlikely that we should ever have heard her name before its appearance on the playbills of the Palace Theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had spent with us the five years which built her an enduring fame in America we . should be any nearer the comprehension either of her beauty or her art . Both are , for many reasons , antagonistic to our national temper ; and , as our aesthetic sensibilities are not sufficiently keen to enable us to admire that which is beyond our previous artistic experience , Carmencita has danced in vain to the solid phalanx of British indifference . " The discredit of the failure lies , however , not with the dancer , but with us . That peculiarly Germanic preference of the gross to the passionate is at the root of the instinctive antipathy to this glorious Andalusian woman , who is a creature of sheer passion with a power of translating it into motion  --  motion that has the restraint as well as the expressive quality which brings It into the province of great art . There is no suggestion in Carmencita 's dancing of the license which so shocked English spectators of the danse des almaes at the Paris Exhibition . It is instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the South , and is essentially the spontaneous interpretation of simple sensation . " Carmencita 's art has not a trace of the modern spirit in it , nothing of that maladie du siecle of which the serpentine dance was a supreme expression . It is as barren of sous-entendu , of complex feeling , as a melody of ' Verdi or a Swinburnian lyric , and as eloquent , for there is in it , besides Its exultant optimism , a strain of the latent savagery of the Spaniard . Every motion is a challenge to the love that ends in despair , to all those violent yet naive emotions that are bred of the sun , of hair that is black and a mouth that is red . Such is Carmencita , and such are not we . " Truth to tell , the art , however strongly charged with passion that contains no element of perversity , makes but a faint appeal to us . The explanation is probably to be found in the fact that the average Englishman , who Is a conspicuous illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and cares less . To him dancing is an exercise , not an art , a synthesis of posture which Is the result of long training , and he would as soon think of extracting a symbolic idea from Shooting or fishing as from a pas seul . " Carmencita dances as great writers write and as great painters paint  --  she dances because she must in spite of the indignation naturally aroused by the spectacle of unacknowledged genius , there is in the memory of Carmencita , tossing her insolent head , with its wonderful farouchg beauty , at those cold , phlegmatic rows of Englishmen , a certain aesthetic satisfaction . The soul of the artist is , after all , the lawful possession of the comprehending . So a man feels who buys a beautiful picture and hangs it where he alone can admire it , or who rejoices in the consciousness of having known and loved Carmencita 's art . There is , moreover , a cynical content in the certainty that it will not be travestied in society drawing rooms . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
