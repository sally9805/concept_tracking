txt The American manufacturer , bright and capable as he is , betrays in one respect a dull and ' stubborn indocility that makes him the wonder of the age . We refer to his refusal to make goods of the proper pattern and to put them up in the proper packages to sell in foreign markets . A flagrant instance of this intractable Bourbonism has lately come to our knowledge . A big manufacturing concern in New England that makes an article of universal need and unsurpassed excellence sent an agent to Brazil in search of foreign customers . The agent , who was a man of brains and energy , wore out his shoe leather and his nervous system in the vain attempt to get orders for his employers ' goods . The high quality of his samples was admitted . The Brazilian merchants were willing to concede that the goods he displayed were better than the goods on their shelves  --  bought in Birmingham , we presume . But it was of no use to argue . They knew their business , and knew they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent found out why his goods were unsalable in Brazil . The Birmingham article was always put up in blue paper packages . His goods were always and everywhere put up in brown paper packages . For years the Brazilian consumers had been accustomed to the blue wrapping and would take no other . Brown Was strange , foreign , and they distrusted it . Thereupon the agent , who was a man of push , spent many dollars in a long cable dispatch to his employers . He explained the matter to them frankly and clearly , and expressed his full confidence in his ability to find a ready sale and a wide market far their goods in Brazil if only they would change the color of the wrapping front brown to blue . He got this reply : " If you can sell our goods in blue packages you can sell them in brown . " This is a typical case . Our Consuls in foreign lands and particularly In South America , which we ought to supply with all the manufactured goods it needs , have for twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers that the tastes and customs of the people of Peru are not those of the people of Indiana , and if they want to sell axes , wagons , or boots and shoes in foreign markets they must manufacture such axes , wagons , and boots and shoes as the people of the country are accustomed to buy . Knowing that his goods are almost universally better in make and pattern ? this is particularly true of tools and I hardware  --  than the European article , the American manufacturer has stuck to his patterns as though they were his religion . The New England manufacturers whom we have used as a text would no more have permitted their agent to sell their goods to the Brazilians in blue wrappers than they would have instructed him to preach the Mohammedan creed or baptism without immersion . This singular bigotry has robbed us of millions of trade and shut us out of profitable markets . It must be got rid of if our factories that are now complaining of the always overstocked home market are to find enough buyers of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports of manufactures , a branch of- our trade upon the development of which our future commercial greatness depends , is seriously hampered by this narrow and ignorant spirit .
