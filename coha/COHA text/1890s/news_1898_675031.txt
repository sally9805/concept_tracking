txt The Paris correspondent of The Daily Mail summarizes this morning an interview he has had with United States Senator Cushman K. Davis of the Peace Commission , who advocates a triple alliance between the United States , Great Britain , and Japan . The correspondent says : " Mr. Davis declared that American and British interests in the Par East run quite parallel and that , therefore , the two powers should act jointly . ' I am not appealing to sentiment , ' he said , though blood is thicker than water , and this argument should not be ignored . My thesis in favor of co-operation is borne out by the coldest logic . I favor a treaty of alliance including the United States , Great Britain , and Japan for the protection of all their interests north of the equator . The rest of the world would have a wholesome fear , synonymous with respect , for us . ' " He proceeded to argue that Russia , Germany , and France had the great bulk of the commercial benefits in China to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a Dreibund could have nothing to fear from any coalition of other nations , and that , therefore , it would tend to preserve the peace . ' There are still 500 years of vigorous fight in England , ' said Mr. Davis , ' which shows no sign of decreptitude ; while , strong as America is , it will take several hundred years to develop her promise and potency . I do not see why other nations should object to the alliance . If they do , let them . Germany already by special legislation has immensely injured America 's commercial Interests . German-Americans regret this attitude on the part of the mother country . " So far as the Philippines are concerned , there will be an open door , but not free trade . Our protection policy will be applied without favoring any nation , and . the local needs of our new territories will be considered . ' "
