IDEALS OF COLLEGE EDUCATION . By F. Spencer Baldwin . T the present time two contrasted ideals of college education are contending for possession of the field . These opposing ideals may be designated as the orthodoxclassical , and the heterodox-practical , The educator of the orthodox-classical school would restrict the college curriculum to the so-called " humanities and liberal arts . " He would have the student devote himself chiefly to the language , the literature , and the life of the classic past . He holds that the study of the classics will develop the mind , elevate the moral nature , and refine the tastes of the student , as no other discipline can possibly do . Education , in the opinion of the classicist , should aim at no utilitarian end ; the function of the college is not to impart merely useful knowledge , to turn out " practical men . " The college is rather a place for the discipline of the higher powers of the student , for ethical and aesthetic culture ,  - -  in fine , for the training of gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally allies itself with aristocratic ideas of society . Consciously or unconsciously , its adherents incline to the belief that higher education is not for the masses and that the colleges should train , not a vast army of educated men , but a sort of Sacred Band , an " aristocracy of intellect . " The educator of the heterodoxpractical school advances an educational ideal opposed to this in all points . He would admit to the college curriculum the physical sciences , the mechanical arts and a11 useful branches of knowledge . " A university , " he argues , " ought to teach everything which anybody wants to know . " * The classics he would crowd into the background , putting in their place the studies that deal with the language , the literature , and the life of the peoples of the present . The college should teach preferably the things that will be " of value to an American man in the American life of to-day . " He denies that the classical william Graham Sumner : " Our colleges before the Country. * ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the natural sciences and other useful disciplines ; and he maintains that , even were this true , the real test of the educational value of a study is the practical utility of the knowledge that is imparted , not the efficiency of the mental training that is given . College education , in his view , should aim principally to equip the student , not with the polite culture demanded by the gentleman , but with the practical knowledge required by the man of affairs ; the college should fit its students to earn a living . This practical idea is usually associated with strong democratic sympathies . Its advocates believe in popular education , in the widest sense . Education is a good thing for all ; the colleges should be open to the masses . Not the breeding of an " aristocracy of intellect , " but the diffusion of knowledge among the people , the training of the whole body of citizens in all useful arts ,  --  this is the true function of the modern college . The educational creed of the orthodox-classical party has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbia College . In his brilliant paper on " Some Phases of American Education , " * he says : " So far from adding to the subjects now included in the university curriculum , we should instead diminish them . The present craze for making that curriculum a common dumping-ground for every possible variety of instruction is the most unfortunate of all the tendencies that are visible in educational theory today . . . . . When machine-shops and factories and all the paraphernalia of the applied sciences are imported into the academic shades , and when the perfume of the Attic violet is stifled by the stenches of the chemist 's crucible , the true purpose of the university is forgotten , and its higher mission is in great measure sacrificed ; for then there can exist no longer a distinct and definite type of university man . The civic value of the university in times now past was this : it gave to the community a very special class , not only highly trained and trained *Cosmopoiitan Maqcezine , July , 1897. in a broad and liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with an absolute identity of training . This indentity of training bound all university men together by the strongest possible ties of sympathy and mutual understanding . But now the curious belief that all subjects of study are in themselves equally important is importing into the sphere of university teaching anything and everything which the casual person may desire to know ; and worse than this , it is putting upon every grade of capacity and attainment the self-same stamp of approval . is When we hear to-day that soand-so a university man , one never knows by reason of that fact whether this person is in reality a gentleman and a scholar , or whether he is only a sublimated type of tinker . And now that this confusion has been thoroughly established , what intimate and universal bond of sympathy can possibly exist among the scions of a university ? The university has in fact been swamped by the influx of the mob , and its inmates are themselves becoming only an unconsidered fraction of that mob . But the key to it all is the true conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist to train mere sordid toilers and to help them to make money . We do not need more baccalaureate bag-men , more " hustlers , " more matriculated mechanics , more polymathic plumbers . We have too many of them now . Its purpose should be something higher  --  to teach serenity of mind and loftiness of purpose , to make men see straight and think clearly , to endue them with a sense of proportion and a luminous philosophy of life  --  a thing impossible to those who do not draw their inspiration from the thought , the history , and the beauty of the classic past . " Contrast with this enthusiastic eulogium of the aristocratic classical curriculum the following uncompromising indictment of that curriculum by the late James Anthony Froude , the Oxford historian . In an academic address on education , Mr. Froude once said : " A young man going to Oxford learns the same things which were taught there two centuries ago His antiquated knowledge has fallen out of the market . There is no. demand for him He is called educated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not earn a sixpence for himself . An Oxford education fits a man exi*Rectoria1 Address at the University of St. Andrews March 59 , 5869. // tremely well for the trade of gentleman . I do not know for what other trade it fits him as at present constituted . More than one man who has taken high honors there , who has learned faithfully all that the university undertakes to teach him , has been seen in these late years breaking stones upon a road in Australia . That was all which he was found to be fit for when brought in contact with the primary realities of things . . . . Every man born into the world should be put in the way of maintaining himself in honest independence . No education which does not make this its first aim is worth anything at all . History , poetry , logic , moral ; hilosophy , classical literature are excellent as an ornament . But they will not help you to stand on your feet and walk alone ; and no one is properly a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . You must choose among the objects of knowledge , and the only reasonable guide to choice is utility . " This war of educational ideals is a result of the vast extension of the boundaries of human knowledge which has taken place during the present century . New sciences and quasi-sciences have appeared and have demanded for themselves a place in the college curriculum . Previously to the advent of the new studies the classical ideal had met no rival . From the time of the revival of learning at the close of the Middle Ages well down into the nineteenth century the classics held almost exclusive sway in the higher institutions of learning . The college course included also , to be sure , some instruction in mathematics and philosophy , but beyond this practically nothing . Courses in science , general literature , history and politics were almost unknown , for these departments of knowledge had not yet been developed and their subject-matter reduced to systematic , teachable form . Indeed it was altogether natural and proper that at the beginning of the modern era the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was little else to study . " There was at that time , " says Mr. Goldwin Smith , " no other literature worthy of the name ; no philosophy but the speculations of the schoolmen ; no history but the monkish chronicle ; no oratory but the monkish homily ; no poetry but the monkish hymn . The Greek and Latin languages were then the casket in which all the treasures of the intellect were enclosed ; and it was as the key to that casket , not as a mental gymnasium , that grammar was established as the prime instrument of instruction . " * Even so late as the opening years of the nineteenth century the prestige of the classics remained unshaken . The natural sciences were in embryo ; history was at the drum and trumpet stage ; political economy was in its infancy ; the modern languages were studied only in fragmentary , unsystematic fashion ; the political institutions of modern democracy were too little developed to form proper subjectmatter for scientific study ; and the sounding word " sociology " had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present century there began that marvelous widening of the field of human knowledge to which I have referred as the cause of the unsettling of educational ideals . Scientific investigation entered upon its unparalleled career of conquest ; then came the awakening of interest in historical studies ; the new economic relations created by the rise of " the great industry " gave impetus to the study of political economy ; the drawing together of the nations by bonds of commercial and social intercourse led to a more general and more systematic study of the modern languages ; the problems raised by the spread of democracy lent weighty significance to the study of politics ; and , finally , sociology came forward with pretentious claims for admission to the hierarchy of the sciences . Not all the learning unearthed by investigators in the new fields has yet been reduced to systematic organization , but its discoverers maintain that it is at least rational and valuable knowledge and * University Education , " in Journal of Social Science , 1869. // should therefore be admitted to the college curriculum . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classics to a monopoly of the colleges . It was urged that the college curriculum should be broadened and diversified to keep pace with the broadening and diversification of human knowledge . Under the domination of the classics academic training was asserted to have degenerated into an " unintelligent routine . " Classical studies , having sunk to a perfunctory character , were alleged to stand in the way of faithful study of anything . Against these attacks the conservative upholders of the classical regime defended themselves vigorously , seeking to prevent the innovators from forcing their way within the academic shades . The assaulting party has been in a measure successful . The new studies have been admitted to the curriculum , but not on a footing of full equality with the classics . Provision has been made for them in elective courses . But this compromise has not ended the struggle . The extreme representatives of the new tendency are determined to complete their victory by crowding the study of the classics either entirely out of the course , or at least into a very subordinate position . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expelling the offensive intruders . Which of these rival ideals of college education is fitter to survive ? In order to answer this question it will be necessary first to get a clear conception of the true aim of college education . The aim of college education is nothing less than to make capable , cultivated , and aspiring human beings . The colleges should give to the community the type of man described by Huxley in his noble address on " A Liberal Education " : " That man , I think , has had a liberal education who has been so trained in his youth that his body is the ready servant of his will , and does with ease and pleasure all the work that , as a mechanism , it is capable of ; whose intellect is a clear , cold logic engine , with all its parts of equal strength and in smooth working order , ready , like a steam engine , to be turned to any kind of work , and spin the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fundamental truths of nature and of the laws of her operations ; one who , no stunted ascetic , is full of life and fire , but whose passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous will , the servant of a tender conscience ; who has learned to love all beauty , whether of nature or of art , to hate all vileness , and to respect others as himself . " Not all that goes to the making of a man such as this can be taught in the college course . College education is only one short stage in that long educational process which begins for each individual with the first moment of dawning intelligence and ends only with life . The college curriculum is not the place for every useful branch of knowledge ; some things can be learned only outside the college walls , or outside the college years . It is profoundly true , as Professor Peck says , " that the most vital and important facts of life can not be taught by academic training , but must be learned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its limitations ; but within these the college must keep steadily in view its high aim . Its vocation is not the breeding of elegant dilettantes , gilded idlers , gentlemen falsely so-called ; nor is it the manufacture of human tools , efficient bread-winners , skilled moneychangers . It is rather the making of men and women of fine intelligence , broad culture , and lofty ideals . The education of an individual in this broad and liberal way involves a three-fold process . The first thing to be done is to develop and train the native faculties and capacities of the student ; that is , - if I may employ the traditional figure of speech - there must be a " drawing out " of the student 's latent powers . This " drawing out " process is primarily and chiefly a training of the intellect , at least so far as this part // of education devolves upon the schools . It is the mental powers that are to be developed and disciplined . One hears a deal of vague talk nowadays about the necessity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual , aesthetic , ethical and physical . But the greater part of this all-round training must , in the nature of things , be nonacademic . It certainly belongs outside the sphere of college education . Much of it must always be left to individual self-culture . The college , as a disciplinary institution , trains only the intellectual powers . Its business is to teach men how to think . The second process in education is not a " drawing out , " but a " putting in . It consists in imparting knowledge to the student , in giving him information regarding his surroundings , in making him acquainted with all which man has thought and done in the world . Education should furnish the individual the knowledge that he requires in order to interpret his environment and to regulate his conduct intelligently . It should open for him a wider outlook upon life , show him the whole course of human history , and thus give him the true perspective of his own time and calling . The third office of education , which unfortunately is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to awaken and inspire the student , to reveal to him the possibilities of his own nature , to fill him with enthusiasm for the higher things of life , to fire him with a desire to know , to be , and to do . It was this third task of the teacher which the late President Garfield had in mind when he gave his epigrammatic definition of a university as " a log with Mark Hopkins at one end and a student at the other . " Emerson has expressed the same thought in these glowing words : " Colleges have their indispensable office to teach elements . But they can only highly serve us when they aim not to drill , but to create ; when they gather from far every ray of various genius to their hospitable halls and by the concentrated fires set the hearts of their youth on flame . " These then are the three things which a liberal education should do for the individual : it should form , inform , and inspire him . Its aim , be it emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , large attainments , and high purposes . We come now to test the two educational ideals before us by the requirements of this standard . The classical curriculum is admirable as a means of forming the mind ; it draws out and disciplines the highest powers of the intellect in a manner unequaled by any other course of study . It is distinctly inferior , however , as a means of informing the mind ; the amount of valuable knowledge imparted is comparatively slight . Whether , finally , the classical curriculum prove itself a means of inspiration depends upon the temperament and mental make-up of the individual student . When the classical curriculum was first established in the universities of the old world , it was primarily for the sake of the knowledge thus to be gained , not for mental discipline , that the ancient authors were studied . At that time classical studies had a very high informational value . But later , as successive additions were made to the stock of human learning , it became increasingly necessary for the seeker after knowledge to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present time , it is almost solely for the sake of their disciplinary and refining influence that classical studies are pursued . The grammar of the ancient languages has become a mere manual of higher mental gymnastics ; it is no longer studied as the open sesame of the storehouse of learning . The college graduate who has been educated on the classical plan can hardly be regarded as a wellinformed man . The amount of knowledge , properly so-called , which he // 575 brings away from the university is insignificant . He knows , as a rule , little of the natural sciences , and of the social sciences still less . He has not been furnished with the information that would enable him to interpret his surroundings and to solve the problems that confront him . It is altogether a strange world into which he has been thrust forth , but half prepared . For a time he stands helpless in the presence of " the rough realities of life . " But soon , if he be of a sane mind , the conviction comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vitally important part - of his education has been neglected . He confesses with humiliation that he is an ignoramus ; and such in truth he is . Then , if he be of a stout heart , he sets himself to the task of self-education . He has discovered , somewhat late , that a classical education merely drills - not fills - the mind . The success of the classical curriculum in awakening and inspiring the student must depend , as I have said , l ? rgely upon the nature of the student 's tastes and aptitudes . A young person of finer literary tastes , with a natural bent to language studies , will find in the classics a never-failing source of pleasant inspiration . But a student of robuster tastes - of coarser mental fibre , if you will ,  --  with no liking for linguistics , will find in the classics only weariness and vexation of spirit . Such a one will languish in the thin air of philological and literary studies . To him the delicate perfume of the Attic violet is insipid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a delightful odor . Many a student set down in the valley of classical learning has discerned there only dry bones , unmoistened by shred of flesh or drop of marrow . The words of the prophet have come to him with new force : He " set me down in the valley which was full of bones , and caused me to pass by them round and about ; and , behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and , lo , they were very dry . " The charge has been made against classical education that it fails utterly with the great majority of students . " The great mass of students , " we are told , " though so many years of their lives are mainly occupied with the study , at the end of the course have not acquired a sufficient knowledge of Greek and Latin to read the ancient authors with facility , to appreciate their beauties , or to receive from them any mental culture beyond the mere exercise of the faculties involved in getting up any subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate them with difficulty , and on leaving the university lay them and all classical studies aside forever . " * This is a serious charge . But my own observation convinces me that it is sustained by the facts . Classical education does fail with the mass of the college students . Why ? Simply because , as I have pointed out , the classical curriculum is adapted to the tastes and the needs of only one class of students ; and , deplore the fact as we may , this particular class constitutes only a small minority of the whole student body . The* requirements of the majority are not met by the classical curriculum . In thus calling attention to the shortcomings of the classical scheme of education , I have no desire to appear to disparage the classics and to minimize their importance . On the contrary , I would personally pay grateful tribute to the developing , refining and elevating influence of these studies . I am concerned here merely to state the conclusions to which an impartial examination of the educational value of the classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum , although incomparable as a mode of mental discipline , fails in all cases thoroughly to inform the student , and in the great majority of cases fitly to inspire him . The practical studies have little disciplinary value . The mental training Goidwin Smith ; University Education . " // that they give is , as a rule , of the flimsiest sort . It may reasonably be predicted , however , that , as the new departments become better organized and the methods of instruction are improved , the inferiority of the practical studies in this respect will grow less apparent . In point of informational value , on the other hand , the new studies are as vastly superior to the old as they are inferior in disciplinary value . And it is this which gives them unquestionably a strong claim to a large place in the college curriculum . For , of the two educational processes , the forming and the iiiforming , the latter , I take it , is of the more importance in college education , the former in secondary education . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storing of the mind should not go on concurrently at every stage of the educational process , but simply that in the secondary stage the training is the principal thing and the storing subordinate , while in the higher stage this order of prominence is reversed . The secondary schools should emphasize the disciplinary element in education , the higher institutions the informational . It has been truly said by Goldwin Smith , in the essay from which I have quoted , that a university - and the remark applies to a college as one department of a university - should not be so much a place of mental discipline as " a repertory of various kinds of knowledge . " It is distinctly the place for the higher informational studies . In this examination of the two ideals of education , both have been found wanting . Each ideal embodies a half-truth , presented in exaggerated form . The conservative defender of the old curriculum over-emphasizes the disciplinary and refining influence of classical studies and under-estimates the immense informational value of the new courses . The radical advocate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reform , that not all branches of useful knowledge can be taught in a college ; the curric ulum can not be made a catch-all for every odd bit of hap-hazard knowledge . As a rule , the utilitarian reformer aims to make the college course practical in a sense quite inconsistent with the true purpose of a liberal education . The curriculum should never be made practical in the narrow , technical sense of fitting to earn a living ; although it should always be practical in the broad , liberal sense of fitting to live . Again , the reformer underestimates the value of the classics as a means of mental culture and the importance of the disciplinary element in general . Each ideal is strong in the precise particulars in which the other is weak . The one supplements the other . A sound educational system , therefore , will combine the two . In fact , this is the policy which has already been forced upon the colleges by the exigencies of the controversy . A temporary compromise has been effected , and the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readjustment of the terms of this compromise . In any event , this much is certain : there can be no cutting down of the curriculum to the orthodox old limits . These have been forever outgrown . The American colleges must offer courses of study as broad and varied as are the needs of modern American life . The conditions of this American life , in particular the political conditions , make large demands upon the colleges . Thorough training in economics and politics is required to equip the college man for the duties of citizenship in a democracy . Education in a democracy must be largely political in character ; it must fit the individual to take part in public affairs . Unfortunately the demands of democracy upon the colleges have been too little considered in the past . The political education of the student has been neglected . The aim has been to fit him only for private life . Consider for a moment the extent of the demand in this country // for men to fill the various public offices . The legislative bodies alone call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the fortyfive state legislatures , and the countless municipal boards and councils . Then there is the army of executive officials required for the administrative service of nation , state , county and municipality ; and , finally , comes the great body of the judiciary . These offices make up a total demand of immense proportions . Hitherto the colleges have done too little toward qualifying their graduates to meet this demand of the public service . In his essay on " Representative Government , " Mr. Herbert Spencer comments as follows on the neglect of the schools to train men for political life and the resulting incompetence of public officials : " One would think that the whole system had been framed on the sayings of some political Dogberry . The art of healing is difficult , the art of governing easy . The understanding of arithmetic comes by study , while the understanding of society comes by instinct . Watch-making requires long apprenticeship , but there needs none for the making of institutions . To manage a ship properly requires teaching , but the management of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges should send out scholars competent to grapple with the problems of American life . These problems are chiefly of a socialeconomic nature . There is need of scholars , trained in the sciences of society and the state , who can speak on these questions with authority and help to create a sound public opinion . " There is probably nothing , " writes Mr. E. L. Godkin , " from which the public service of the country suffers more to-day than the silence of its educated classes , that is , the small amount of criticism which comes from disinterested and competent sources . " * 5 " The Duty of Educated Men in a Democracy , " - in Problems of Modern Democracy . This is true . But the root of the trouble lies still deeper . It is not , in reality , merely the silence of the educated classes that we are suffering from ; it is their incompetence - the cause of their silence . The education of these classes has not fitted them to be competent critics of the public service , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to endure , the scholars must go into politics . " The republic was founded by scholars , " said James Russell Lowell ; " it can be perpetuated only by the solicitous and unselfish devotion of scholars . " * And certainly there is no surer way to draw the scholars into politics than to give them the kind of training that will attract them in the direction of the public service . That training the colleges must provide . They must breed thinking men of *action to go forth as leaders of the people . The people must have guidance ; and , when the true leader is not forthcoming , the vacant post of leadership is usurped by the demagogue . But the rule of the demagogue means the failure of democracy ; for the demagogue gives no guidance ' - he follows with flattering self-effacement the momentary mood of the mob . The true demagogue loudly repudiates any pretension of knowing more than " the people . " He proclaims the divine right of the mob , and protests that the people can do no wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pernicious as the old doctrine of the divine right of kings which it has supplanted . Faith in democracy is something higher than this fatuous belief in the infallibility of the unguided people . Long ago Carlyle told us with vehement iteration that the grand problem of democracy was to find government for the people by their real superiors . Other and calmer critics of democratic institutions have repeatedly pointed to the same difficulty - the difficulty of securing competent leadership . This // thought , that a nation of business men should tolerate inefficiency and corruption in the public service . But the explanation is suggested by the remark , quoted by IVIr . White , of a business man in the great American metropolis , so often notorious as the most corruptly governed city in the world : " We have thought this thing over , " he said , " and we find that it pays better to neglect our city affairs than to attend to them ; that we can make more money in the time required for the full discharge of our political duties than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharging them . " The danger with which this ' all-pervading mercantilism threatens American civilization can be averted only by setting before the people higher ideals , which shall emancipate them from the control of the mercantile spirit .

White , formerly president of Cornell University , in the thoughtful and stirring address from which I have already quoted . To the question : " What then is to be done in order to develop counter-elements of civilization which shall hold in check the spirit of mercantilism ?

Howells , in Harper 's Monthly , July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need not pessimism , but a new optimism , which shall be calmer and saner than the exuberant and selfcomplacent optimism of our swaggering national youth , an optimism springing from a deep-rooted faith in the future of American democracy , yet tempered by a wholesome respect for the institutional experience of older peoples , a saving knowledge of the difficulties and the dangers that still confront the nation , and a quick sense of the duties and responsibilities that go hand in hand with the rights and privileges of citizenship in a free republic . It is this spirit of thoughtful loyalty to democratic institutions which the colleges are called upon to inculcate in the leaders of the people whom they shall send out to set higher ideals for American civilization . If higher education is faithful to this trust , the future of the nation shall be even grander than anything that we have attained or dreamed of in the memorable past .
