txt The question of regulating railroad labor is a very perplexing one , and it is ; very doubtful if it eau ever be solved by liegislation or judicial decision . Out on the Santa Fe line there is much embarrassmettt on account of a strike of workmen in repair shops and . machine shops . There are . not enough engines in effective condition to run the trains . Now , if engineers antd firemen can be compelled not to quit% work without notice and opportunity forifilling their places , because it would interfere with the legal obligations of common carriers , how about the shopmen who repair engines and keep the rolling stocky in condition I Can they be compelledfito contribute to an uninterrupted traffic or be found guilty of conspiracy ? There will obviously have to be some method of reconciling the differences and adjusting the relations of employer and employed in the railroad business more practicable and effective than the legal coercion of the workmen . The plan of holding an election by Democratic voters to determine the local party preference as to candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were three applicants for the office , and the Congressional delegation from the State was divided in its recommendations ; so it was decided at a mass meeting to allow the people , or rather thelDemoeratic voters , to exercise their choice on the assurance from Washington that it would be accepted by the appointing power . It is said that the idea of deciding such contests in this manner is popular in North Carolina and is likely to be adopted in other towns . A still better plan would be to allow all the qualified voters of a town to take part in the choice regardless of party . Popular election of Postmasters is hardly practicable . but many problems of government are solved by custom rather than law , and if the expression of popular preference became common , it would in time be accepted by the appointing power as a sort of mandate that must be heeded . It would be a vast improvement over the present method of relying upon the preferences of local politicians . We presume that the authorities of Hamburg had in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday to exclude from the city hereafter all emigrants from Russia , but their action is a matter of some importance to the people of the United States . During the cholera epidemic of last year the Hamburg authorities would not permit emigrants from Russia on their way to this country to leave the railway cars at any place in the city except at the wharves - where they were to embark . They could not endure the presence of these dangerous persons except in the barracks at the water front from which the emigrants were to bo transferred to the steamships , but they were willing that America should be exposed to infection from Russians who had passed through the town under quarantine . Tho now order of exclusion affects emigrants in transit as well as those who desire to reside in Hamburg . From what port will Russian emigrants sail hereafter If a similar order shall be made and enforced at other German ports , they will probably be diverted to some Dort on the Mediterranean . Russia is now thoroughly infected with cholera , and it is perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be admitted at our ports . Cholera has already been carried to Manitoba by one party of Russians who entered at Montreal , but fortunately the disease v. as quickly stamped out . The United States Investor publishes au interesting article about the resources and purposes of the branch of the SiemensHalske Electric Company recently established in this country , and joints out that if there should be a demand here for the substitution of storage-battery motors for the trolley system this company could satisfy it . " The Siemens-I Ialsho Company , " says the Iv ** storage-battery patents that have been and are now being operated in Europe successfully ( both from a mechanical and from a financial point of view ) and is likely sooner or later to introduce this system of motive power here . " We certainly hope it is true that the company is inclined to assist the development of the storage-motor system in the United States . It is frequently asserted that this development has purposely been retarded by the powerful American company that controls the trolley system . Whether this be true or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be desired .
