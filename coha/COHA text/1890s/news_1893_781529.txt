txt Due regard for precision of statement requires that the supporters of the Hon. EnWARD MURPHY , Jr. , should cease to proclaim him as the candidate of the regular Democracy for the United States Senate . He is nothing of the kind . The Democracy of the State of New-York is not an admirer of Mr. MURPHY , and is opposed to his senseless Senatorial aspirations . His support is confined to the Trill-Murphy machine , a numerically small though perfectly organized body of Democrats holding offices in the State and in the party . They are not the Democracy of the State , they do not represent the Democracy of the State , do not understand its views or consult its wishes . These are the men who called the " snap " convention , and who made immortal fools of themselves at Chicago . The Democracy of New-York is the Cleveland Democracy . It is not for MURPHY . The expenditure of another small part of the great sum appropriated by the Panama Canal Company for the use of its " American committee " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APPLETON of Boston . We have already shown that the Chairman , Mr , RICHARD W. TEIOMPSON of Terre Haute , Ind. , received a salary of $25,000 per annum for presiding over the deliberations and . supervising the rather mysterious operations of the committee . Mr. APPLETON now says that from 1881 until 1888 he was employed by the company as " general agent , " at a. salary of $4,000 per annn m and that he received nothing in addition . Of the large sum appropriated for the use of the committee he " knows absolutely nothing , " and . has never heard it mentioned by M. DE LESSE.PS or other officers of the company . We assume that the $32,000 received by Mr. APPLETON was paid by the American committee . If we take out thug and the money drawn by the influential resident of Terre Haute , there remains about $2,200,000 which appears to have been expended in other ways . We still think that Mr. THOMPSON should enlighten the public as to the expenditure of this sum by his committee .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
