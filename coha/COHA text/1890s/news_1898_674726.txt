txt The appointment by the Board of Education of Mr. C. B. J. SNYDER to be Superintendent of School Buildings for the greater city was a matter of course . Mr. SNYDER has fairly earned his promotion . One of the very brightest pages of the history of the Strong administration , which has its very bright and its very dark pages , is that which recounts the reform of the public school system . And in this reform nothing has been more noteworthy than the improvement in the school buildings . This was connected with all the other reforms in the department , and was necessary to the other reforms . Up to the accession of Mr. SNYDER all school buildings had been built upon a plan at least half a century old , in which no improvements had been made in the interval . Architects were aware that the schools were ill planned , and that many improvements could be made in them . But this conviction had never reached the Board of Education . That body had never seen the necessity of employing an educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform type of school building was not good enough . The employment of Mr. SNYDER brought a. remarkable and gratifying change . For the first time within the memory of man , the public school buildings began to be studied with reference to their purposes . Everybody is aware of the architectural improvement that has ensued . But this , though by no means a small public benefit in itself , is small in comparison with the improvement in the buildings in fitness for their purpose . One of the results of intelligent study has been to make it plain that they could be made not only to subserve better the purpose which had always been recognized , but that they could be made to subserve other public purposes the importance of which had not been discerned by the School qwq ecessors . The schoolhouse may become , it has now been discovered , a. place of instruction and recreation for its neighborhood , the centre , in fact , of neighborhood Life . The social and moral consequences of this discoveiy have not yet been fully appreciated . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the school buildings will be of scarcely less public importance than their primary purpose . And in this development the Superintendent of School Buildings may be expected to play an important part . It is proper to point out that the enlargement of Mr. SNYDER 'S sphere of usefulness Is due to the fact that the board which has promoted him holds over from the last t.dministration , and holds over in spite of the present administration . By means of a singular explosion of temper the Mayor has made known to the members who hold over that if he had his way he would turn them all out . In that case , in place of being promoted , Mr. SNYDER would doubtless have been discharged like Col. WARING , like Mr. GREENE , like Mr. PARSONS  --  like everybody who owed his place in the municipal service to fitness and merit , and not to politics . The promotion of one public servant whom the Mayor can not get at affords a. useful lesson in contrast with the discharge of the public servants whom the Mayor has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
