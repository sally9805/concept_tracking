txt A great deal of reticence is exhibited at the War Department relative to the state of affairs at Iloilo . It is admitted that Gen. Otis has reported to the department the facts that were reported to him in turn by Gen. Miller , but all that can be gathered as to the nature of the communication is that it goeS to confirm the press reports as to the attitude of the insurgents . There are excellent reasons . why the officials at the War Department at this stage maintain secrecy as to the instructions governing the movement of troops in the Philippines . The situation is admitted to be critical , but not hopeless by any means , and it is extremely desirable that the danger of a rupture shall not be increased by inflammatory publications , which powerfully affect the excitible Filipinos . It is believed that Otis is framing a plan of eQtripaign which will result in the extension of his control over the Island of Panay , at least , without actual hostilities , or , if it must come to warfare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably the first step in this campaign has been taken by this time in the establishment of a camp on the Island of Guiamaras , lying only a few miles from Iloilo , and easily accessible to the warships . This probably will be made the base of operations if hostilities become unavoidable . The Government , however , has not abandoned hope that a peaceful solution can be rea ched . The Government 's instructions sent to Gen. Miller at Iloilo were to land and get in communication with the insurgents . This is as far as his orders have gone except that when he has established communication with the insurgent officials and people he is to make public the purposes of the United States . Not a shot is to be fired by the forces of this country unless they are attacked or until further orders are given from here . This programme was agreed upon between President and Secretary Alger several days ago . Secretary Alger was at the White House for some time this afternoon . He stated in the most emphatic terms that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not believe a shot had been fired so far or that one would be fired . He is confident that Gen. Miller will be able to handle the situation successfully , and obtain control of Iloilo without bloodshed . He is of the opinion that the insurgents have been so long ' imposed upon that they are naturally suspicious , and fear the worst if they surrender their strongholds into the hands of the United States . The policy to be adopted now is a gentle one . Persuasion will be used before powder . That will be the last resort , and Secretary Alger is optimistic in his views that it will never be necessary . The President , it is said , also views the situation in a similarly hopeful manner . He believes that the Filipinos will become less suspicious when they understand more fully the intentions of this country . He believes that careful work on the part of prudent officials will convince the Filipinos of the earnestness of the United States and of the purpose of this Government to protect their lives and property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
