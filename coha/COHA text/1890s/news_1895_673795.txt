txt In the Power of Removal bill as it has now passed both branches of the Legislature the partisan has prevailed against the reformer . It gives the power of removal to the Mayor " elected for a full term , " and withholds it from the President of the Board of Aldermen - who may become Mayor . The present Mayor and the present President of the Board of Aldermen were nominated , were supported , and were elected on the same plat- I form , pledged to a non-partisan policy in municipal affairs , but one is known to be in his politics a Republican and the other a Democrat . This is the sole reason for the discrimination , and it is partisan in the smallest , narrowest , and meanest sense , and it is a violation of the faith on which the reform coalition was made last Fall . Whether the bill in this form is to be " accepted by the city " depends upon Mayor Strong , who in that respect is the constitutional voice of the city , but it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reform organizations as a reform measure , for it violates a principle which they have declared to be fundamental and essential . Practically it may make no difference now , and it will depend on the chapter of accidents whether it will practically make any difference hereafter . But as a fatter of principle it is a serious set-back for nonpartisanship in the legislation demanded for this city . It is a defiance of the reform sentiment , and enacts into law the scorn expressed in the Senate for the " whole gang of reformers . " It is an ill omen for the legislation to come , which is demanded for the purpose of taking the police and other branches of the municipal service out of politics . A hearing must be given on the bill in this city before it can take effect , and the Committee of Seventy , the chosen and accepted representative body of the citiZens of New-York , should not fail to enter its protests . If it accepts defeat on this point , the first upon which its stand was taken , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless reformers stick to their principles and insist upon their adoption , they will find their cause betrayed at every point .
