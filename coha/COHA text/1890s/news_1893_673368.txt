txt The Rev. Dr. Alfred Momerie of London , who has been attending the Parliament of Religions in Chicago , occupied the pulpit yesterday in All Souls ' Protestant Episcopal Church , Madison Avenue and Sixty-sixth Street . At the morning service Dr. Momerie delivered an interesting discourse on the harmony of science and religion . Taking as his text , " What God has joined together let no man put asunder , " he showed  --  that there was no real conflict between scientific and religious truths . There was no real difference between them . He explained the distinction between theology and religion . There were two kinds of theology , the stagnant and the progressive , and it was only with the former that the physical sciences came into conflict . Genuine science was an attempt to reveal to mankind the thoughts of the Creator as manifested in His works . Religion sought to reveal the sentiments and emotions of the Deity . Both were working in the same direction , and he argued , therefore , that there could be no real conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of theology . " Religious Bigotry " was the subject of his discourse in the afternoon . " A bigot , " he said , " is a man who worships his own creed and fancies he is the especial favorite of the Almighty because of certain religious doctrines he happens to hold . Those who hold different beliefs he thinks are in danger of being lost . " It has been generally understood that Roman Catholics have been pre-eminent examples of bigotry , but if you read history you will find that Protestants have been just as intolerant . Every little denomination has imagined that its members were the particular favorites of God . " To hold that God takes men to heaven or sends them to hell because of certain opinions is to say that He is unjust . Such a belief is contrary to the spirit of religion . The mercies of God are above all His works . " One of the greatest evils of bigotry is that it leads to mental stagnation and substitutes orthodoxy In place of good works . The bigot thinks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows everything from the time of Adam down to the Day of Judgment . He disdains all science and secular knowledge . Another evil eil.b8ct of bigotry is that it takes away the desire of performing good works . The bigot worships his religious creed . Christ laid especial stress upon conduct ; the bigot lays especial stress +upon creed . His motto is that he can not be wrong because his creed is right . " Bigotry makes men selfish and cruel . The bigot tries to bring others to believe in his creed by inflicting torture upon them , and sometimes even death . " The worst feature of bigotry is that it has been frequently mistaken for religion . It is one of the worst forms of irreligion , and is responsible for the indifference we find among people who are too good to tolerate bigotry . " But the hour has come for the doom of bigotry . That hour seemed very near last month when the Congress of Religion met in Chicago . When the great bell of the exposition rung in that congress it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will preach next Sunday at Cambridge , Mass. , and before returning to England h:i has promised to preach in several leading Episcopal churches in this city .
