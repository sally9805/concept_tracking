JOHN WILLARD of Salem Farms was employed during the earlier days of the witchcraft prosecutions to assist in bringing in the persons accused . Accusations were finally made against Willard himself . It has been stated that he was charged because he had expressed sympathy with the accused and doubts of the justice of the proceedings . One remark quoted is : " Hang them , they are all witches . " Just why this remark should bring upon him the displeasure of the prosecutors is not easy to understand . Is it not more probable that he was cried out against , as so many others were , from no apparent motive , but through the excitement and terror of the times ? He was " talked about " for some time before any movement was made to arrest him . He went to his grandfather , Bray Wilkins , and asked the old man to pray with him , but Wilkins was just going from home and could not stop then . He told Willard he would not be unwilling if he got home before night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilkins and his wife , both more than eighty years of age , rode to Boston on their horse . Willard went , also , with Henry Wilkins , Jr . Daniel Wilkins , Henry 's son , had heard the stories about Willard , and protested against his father going with him . He is quoted as saying of Willard : " It were well if Willard were hanged . " On election day , Bray Wilkins and his wife and T Rev. Deodat Lawson were at Lieutenant Richard Ways ' house for dinner . Willard and Henry Wilkins came in later . The elder Wilkins says he thought Willard did not look on him kindly , for , he says , " to my apprehension , he looked after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any . " Wilkins was taken very sick that afternoon and remained so some days . He was carried home , and on arriving there , found Daniel Wilkins , the young man who had advised his father not to go to Boston with Willard , also very ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis and Mary Walcott were sent for to come and solve the mystery of so much sickness in the Wilkins family . They were , as usual , equal to the occasion . They " saw the apparitions of Sarah Buckley and John Willard upon the throat and breast of Henry Wilkins , " and saw them press and choke him until he died . Lewis then went to the room where old Bray Wilkins lay . Asked if she saw anything , she replied : " Yes , they are looking for John Willard . " A little later she exclaimed : " There he is upon his grandfather 's belly . " A warrant for Willard 's arrest was issued on May io , on complaint of Thomas Fuller and others . Two days later , Constable Putnam returned the document with the indorsement that he had made search for him and could not find him . He was produced in court on the i8th , By U/infield S. Nez ; ins. // having been arrested in Groton . Among the more interesting papers on file in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was presented to the magistrates to induce them to issue a warrant for Willard 's arrest , or was given in at the preliminary examination at Beadle 's Tavern in Salem , we have no means of knowing . The document is as follows " The shape of Samuel Fuller and Lydia Wilkins this day told me at my own house hy the bedside , who appeared in winding sheets , that if I did not go and tell Mr. Hathorne that John Willard had murdered them they would tear me to pieces . . . . At the same time the apparition of John Willard told me that he had killed Samuel Fuller , Lydia Wilkins , Goody Shaw and Fuller 's second wife , and Aaron Way 's child , and Ben Fuller 's child and this deponent 's child , Sarah , six weeks old , and Phillip Knight 's child with the help of William Hohbs , and Jonathan Knight 's child and two of Ezekiel Cheever 's children with the help of William Hobbs ; Ann Elliott and Isaac Nichols with the help of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same day came to me and told me that Goody Corey had killed him . " Must we not accept one of two explanations of this remarkable piece of evidence - that the whole story was literally true , and therefore witchcraft a reality , or that Mrs. Ann Putnam deliberately falsified ? Will the theory of general terror and hallucination in the community sufficiently explain the statement ? Were the people " out of their wits , " as Martha Carrier said ? On th' other hand , I am bound to say that I find no evidence of any cause which should prompt Mrs. Putnam to make such serious charges against Willard and others , unless we accept the claim of some writers who profess to believe that it was for the purpose of supporting the general plan of prosecution for witchcraft . Willard was committed to jail , and subsequently tried at the August session of the court . Only one piece of evidence has been preserved from this trial . Susan Sheldon , eighteen years of age , testified that at Nathaniel Ingersoll 's house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons : " William Shaw 's first wife , the widow Cook , Goodman Jones and his child , and among these came the apparition of John Willard to whom these four said , you have murdered us . Thes&amp; four having said thus to Willard they turned as . red as blood . And turning about to look at me they turned as pale as death . These four desired me to tell Mr. Hathorne . Willard , hearing them , pulled out a knife , saying if I did he would cut my throat . " On another occasion there came to her a shining man and told her to go and tell Hathorne . She told him she would if he would hunt Willard away , she would believe what he said . " With that the shining man held up his hands and Willard vanished away . About two hours after , the same appeared to me again and the said Willard with them and I asked them where their wounds were and they said there would come an angel from Heaven and would show them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted up his winding sheet , and out of his left side he pulled a pitchfork-tine and put it in again , and likewise he opened all the winding sheets and showed all their wounds . And the white man told me to tell Mr. Hathorne of it an ( l I told him to hunt Willard away , and I would , and he held up his hand , and he vanished away . " She also saw Willard suckle the apparitions of two black pigs on his breasts . John Willard was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged ; and on August is he was executed . Brattle says of Willard and Proctor at their execution , that " their whole management of themselves from the jail to the gallows was very affecting , and melting to the hearts of some considerable spectators . " Martha Carrier was arrested , probably , on May 28 , as the warrant against her was issued on that day . She was examined on the 3rst . Martha was about forty years of age , and the mother of a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custody at the same time that she was . We have little information regarding her life previous to her arrest . At the examination before the local magistrates they said to her : " You see you look upon them and they fall down . " " It is false , ' she replied ; " the devil is a liar . I looked upon none since I came into the room but you . " Susan Sheldon said : " I wonder what could you murder thirteen persons for . " Goodwife Carrier repelled the insinuation , and the afflicted all had terrible fits . She charged that the magistrates were unfair , and said : " It is a shameful thing that you should mind these folks that are out of their wits . " To the accusers she cried : " You lie , I am wronged . " The recorder of the trial adds : // " The tortures of the afflicted were so great that there was no enduring it , so that she was ordered away and to be hound hand and foot with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as she was well bound they all had strange and sudden cease . " Martha Carrier was committed to prison where she remained until the August term of court when she was tried , convicted and sentenced . Her execution took place on the nineteenth of the same month . Her daughter Sarah , eight years of age , confessed herself a witch and testified against her mother . Little Sarah said she had been a witch since she was six years old , that her mother made her a witch and made her set her hand to the hook . The place where she did it was in Andrew Foster 's pasture . The witches promised to give her a black dog , but it never came to her . A cat came to her and said it would tear her in pieces if she would not set her hand to the book . Her mother came like a black cat . The cat told her that she was her mother . Richard Carrier , eighteen years of age , told the magistrates that he had " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued as folloxvs : " Is your brother Andrew ensnared by the devil 's snare ? - Yes . " How long has your brother been a witch ? - Near a month . " How long have you been a witch ? - Not long . Have you joined in afflicting the afflicted per . sons ? - Yes . " You helped to hurt Timothy Swan , did you ? - Yes . " How long have you been a witch ? - About five weeks . " Who was at the Village meeting when you were there ? - Goodwife How , Goodwife Nurse , Goodwife Wilds , Proctor and his wife , Mrs. Bradbury and Corey 's wife . " What did they do there ? - Eat , and drink wine . " From whence had you your wine ? - From Salem , I think . " Goodwife Oliver there ? - Yes , I know her . " During the trial of Martha Carrier , Benjamin Abbott testified that he had some land granted to him by the town of Andover , and , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carrier was very angry , and said she would stick as close to Benjamin Abbott as the bark stuck to the tree , and that I should repent of it afore seven years came to an end , and that Dr. Prescott could never cure me . These words were also heard by Allen Toothaker . She also said to Ralph Farnum , Jr. , that she would hold my nose so close to the grindstone as ever it was held since my name was Benjamin Abbott . Presently after I was taken with a swelling in my foot , and then was taken with a pain in my side , exceedingly tormented , which led to a sore which was lanced by Dr. Prescott , and several gallons of corruption did run out , as was judged . " This continued six weeks , and subsequently he had two sores in the groin which brought him almost to death 's door , and continued , " until Goodwife Carrier was taken and carried away by the constable , and that very day I began to grow better ; " therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great hand in his sickness . Abbott 's wife testified to all the above , and also that there was " terrible sickness and death among the cows , some of whom would come up out of the woods with their tongues hanging out of their mouths in a strange , aifrighting manner . " The case of Elizabeth How , wife of John How , husbandman , sometimes described as of Jpswich and sometimes as of Topsfield , has always excited much interest . The documents in the case show that she was a woman of most exemplary character , devout and pious , kind and charitable . These traits availed her nothing , however , when children accused her of witchcraft . She was arrested on May 29th , on a warrant issued the previous day , and brought before the magistrates for examination on the 31st . Elizabeth How was torn from a loving and afflicted husband and two interesting daughters . Her husband was blind , and it is related that after his wife was placed in Salem jail , he and one daughter used to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction and sentence , one of the devoted daughters went to Boston to beg for the life of her mother , but the governor was immovable . On her being brought before the magistrates , the accusers went through their usual performances . " What say you to this charge ? " asked Hathorne . " If it was the last moment I was to live , " she replied , " God knows I am innocent of anything in this nature . " She was committed for trial , and tried at the sitting // of the court on June 29th . The first charge against her was made by a girl of ten years , of the name of Perley . There had been trouble between the How and Perley families , which is pretty clearly stated in the testimony that follows . Timothy Perley and his wife , Deborah , testified that , - " There being some difference between Goode How and Timothy Perley about some boards , the night following three of our cows lay out , and finding them the next morning we went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but two or three spoonsfuls of milk , and one of the other cows did not give above half a pint , and the other gave a quart , and these cows used to give three or four quarts at a meale ; two of these cows continued to give little or nothing four or five meals , and yet they went in a good English pasture , and within four days the cows gave their full proportion of milk that they used to give . ' * These witnesses further deposed that Elizabeth How " afflicted and tortured their daughter , ten years of age , until she pined away to skin and bone , and ended her sorrowful life . " Also that How desired to join the church in Ipswich , and they went there to testify against her , and " Within a few days after had a cow well in the morning as far as we know ; this cow was taken strangely running about like a mad thing a little while , and then ran into a great pond and drowned herself , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towed her to the shore , and she stunk so that we had much ado to slea her . " Francis Lane testified that he helped James How get out some posts and rails , and How 's wife told them she did not think the posts and rails would do because John Perley helped get them , and when they went to deliver the posts and rails the ends of some forty broke off ; although Lane said , " that in his apprehension they were good sound rails . " Captain John How , father-in-law of Elizabeth , testified that she asked him to go with her to Salem Farms when she was to be examined , and he declined because he had to go to Jpswich , and that soon after he got home , - " Standing near my own door talking with one of my neighbors , I had a sow with six smale pigs in the yard , the sow was as well as far as I know as ever one , a sudden she leaped up about three or four feet high , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . " He told his neighbor he thought the animal was bewitched. and then cut off her ear , and the hand he had the knife in , was " so full of pain that night and several days after that I could not do any work , and suspected no other person but my said sister , Elizabeth How . " Elizabeth How was hanged with others on Tuesday , July *9th . XII . SUSANNA MARTIN , MARY EASTY , ANIIY OTHERS . SUSANNA MARTIN of Amesbury was a. widow . She had been charged with witchcraft as early as 1669 , but escaped conviction at that time . Her examination in 1692 took place at the Village on May 2 , the warrant having been issued on the 3oth of April . In the preliminary examination , Goodwife Martin was confronted by about the same witnesses and the same sort of testimony as those who had preceded her . The following extract from the record of her examination is in-teresting " Hath this woman hurt you ? - Abigail Vilhams declared that she had hurt her often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . And the ' rest were struck dumb at her presence . " What , do you laugh at it ? - Well I may at such folly . " What ails these people ? - I do not know . " But what do you think ails them ? . -I do not desire to spend my judgement upon it . " Do you think they are bewitched ? - No , I do not think they are . " Well , tell us your thoughts about them . - My ' thoughts are mine own when they are in , but when they are out they are anothdr 's . " Do you believe these afflicted persons do not say true ? - They may lie for aught I know . " May not you lie ? -I dare not tell a lie if it would save my life . " What do you think is their master ? - If they be dealing in the black art you may know as well as I. " Martin was committed to jail , where she remained until the 29th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trial . At her trial one singular piece of testimony was offered . It was evidence of such peculiar neatness on the part of Goodwife Martin as to lead a neighbor to conclude that she was a witch . Sarah Atkins testified that Susanna Martin came to her house in Newbury one very stormy day in an " extraordinary dirty season , " when it was not fit for any person to travel . She asked // her if she came from Amesbury afoot , and expressed surprise thereat , and told her children to give Mrs. Martin a chance to get to the fire and dry herself . Martin replied , " she was as dry as I was , and I could not perceive that the soles of her shoes were wet . " This , the witness declared , startled her , and she at once concluded that the woman was a witch . John Kembal deposed that he agreed to purchase a puppy from Martin , but not keeping his bargain , and purchasing a puppy from some one else , she remarked she would " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house soon after sunset one night , " there did arise a little black cloud in the northwest and a few drops of rain , and the wind blew hard . In going between John Weed 's house and the meeting-house there did appear a little thing like a puppy of darkish color . It shot between my legs forward and backward . " He used all possible endeavors to cut it with his axe , but could not hurt it , and as he was thus laboring with his axe , the puppy gave a little jump from him and seemed to go into the ground . " In a little further going there did appear a black puppy somewhat bigger than the first , but as black as a coal , " to his apprehension , which came against him " with such violence as its quick motions did exceed the motions of his axe , " do what he could . And it flew at his belly and away , and then at his throat and over his shoulder one way , and off and up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it assault him as if it would tear out his throat or his belly . He testified that he was much frightened , but recovered himself and ran to the fence , " and calling upon God and naming the name of Jesus Christ , and then it invisibly flew away . " Mary Easty , wife of Isaac Easty of Topsfield , and sister of Rebecca Nurse and Sarah Cloyse , was fifty-eight years of age in 1692 , and the mother of seven children . The Eastys lived on , and owned , one of the largest farms in the town . It was the farm known to the present generation as the Peirce farm . A warrant for the arrest of Mary Easty was issued by the magistrates on April 21 , and she was examined on the following day and committed to prison . During her examination , the magistrates said to her : " Confess if you be guilty " ; to which she replied : " I will say it , if it was my last time , I am clear of this sin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the magistrates to have doubts as to her guilt , for they asked the accusing girls if they were certain this was the woman , and they all went into fits . Subsequently they said : " 0 , Goody Easty , Goody Easty , you are the woman , you are the woman . " On May r8 , for reasons which the present age knows not nor ever can know , Mary Easty was released . Two days after her discharge , Mercy Lewis , living at Constable John Putnam 's , Jr. , had a fit and performed in a manner usual to the accusing girls . A messenger was sent for Ann Putnam to come and tell who afflicted Mercy . At Ann 's home he found Abigail Williams , whether there by design or accident we may only surmise . The girls visited Mercy Lewis , and declared that they saw Mary Easty and John Willard afflicting her body . John Putnam and Benjamin Hutchinson went to Salem the night of the 20th of May and procured from Hathorne a warrant for the arrest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to Beadle 's in Salem for examination . Upham says , " after midnight , she was roused from sleep by the unfeeling marshal , torn from her husband and children , carried back to prison , loaded with chains , and finally consigned to a dreadful and most cruel death . She was an excellent and pious matron . Her husband , referring to the transactions nearly twenty years afterwards justly expressed what all must feel , that it was a hellish molestation . ' For the second time Mary Easty was examined and committed to jail . She remained there from May 2 I until the September sitting of the court , when she was tried , convicted , and sentenced . Previous to the trial , she united with her sister , Sarah Cloyse , in a request to the court that the judges would act as counsel for them and direct them wherein they stood in need . This request to the judges after several trials had been held would indicate that such service was not being rendered to the accused persons . That // this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of acting as counsel for the prisoners , the judges usually performed more nearly the part of prosecuting attorneys , and cross-examined the accused , often in a broivbeating manner . These sisters also asked that witnesses in their behalf might be examined . They especially named the pastor and others of the church in Topsfield . If those persons previously tried had been allowed their rights in this particular , why did Mary Easty and Sarah Cloyse petition thus to the court ? After conviction , and while in the jail awaiting execution , Mary Easty petitioned the governor , judges , and ministers , " not for my own life , for I know I must die , and my appointed time is set , but the Lord he knows it is that , if it be possible , no more innocent blood may be shed , which undoubtedly can not be avoided in the way and course you go in . By my own innocency , I know you are in the wrong . . . . I would humbly beg of you that your honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep them apart some time , and likewise to try some of these confessing witches , I being confident there is several of them has belied themselves and others , as will appear , if not in this world , I am sure in the world to come whither I am now agoing . ' Sarah Cloyse , who was convicted and sentenced at the same time , was never executed . No record or tradition remains to tell us why she was saved from the slaughter . Hutchinson says , speaking generally of the seven persons sentenced at this time , but not executed : " Those who were condemned and not executed , I suppose all confessed their guilt . I have seen the confessions of several of them . " Mary Easty was hung on Thursday , September 22 . " When she took her last farewell of her husband , children , and friends , she was , " says Calef , " as is reported by them present , as serious , religious , distinct , and affectionate as could well be expressed , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice Parker , Mary Parker , Wilmot Reed , Margaret Scott , Ann Pudeator and Sarah Wildes not much that is new can be said . The documents which have come down to us in their cases are less voluminous than those in many others . What record we have indicates that theirs was the old , old story . Their accusers were the same as in other cases . The testimony was substantially the same . The conduct of the accusers and the treatment of the prisoners by the court and the officers of the law differed only in detail from that in the cases already so fully explained in the preceding pages . Wilmot Reed was wife of Samuel Reed , a Marblehead fisherman . " Mammy Red , " as the Marbleheaders used to call her , had long been counted a witch , but her performances never troubled her neighbors in the least . They did not think of complaining of her . It remained for the girls of Salem Village to do that . This woman , so runs the tradition , used to wish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain children , and whenever the wish was uttered , of course , the cleaver was found there and the child sickened and died . She would " cause milk to curdle as soon as it left the cow , " which might indicate witchcraft powers or a very sour disposition . " Newly-churned butter turned to wool when it came in contact with Mammy Red . " As we have already seen , Martha Carrier and Mary Parker were of Andover . So , too , was Samuel Wardwell . Andover was particularly unfortunate during the rage of the witchcraft delusion . It suffered more than any place save Salem Village . The outbreak there , although closely connected with that in the Village , was yet somewhat independent of it . The wife of Joseph Ballard of the town had been ill some time , and the local physician could not help her . In the spring of 1692 Ballard , hearing of the " cases of torment " at the Village , sent down there to have Ann Putnam come up and see if she could discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by one of her companions . They were received with much pomp and solemnity , almost with superstition befitting a tribe of barbarians . The people gathered in the meetinghouse , where the Rev. Mr. Barnard offered prayer . The girls then proceeded to the home of Mrs. Ballard and at once named certain persons who , they alleged , were tormenting Mrs. Ballard . Those persons were forthwith arrested and sent to jail . // Before the excitement ceased , nearly fifty persons had been arrested . Among them were Mary Osgood , wife of a deacon of the church ; Abigail Faulkner and Elizabeth Johnson , daughters of Rev. Francis Dane , the senior pastor of the church ; two of Mrs. Faulkner 's daughters , and one of Mrs. Johnson 's ; Mrs. Deliverance Dane , daughter-in-law of the minister ; Samuel Wardwell and Ann Foster , besides Carrier and Mary Parker . Intimations were made that Mr. Dane himself and Justice Dudley Bradstreet , Mrs. Bradstreet , his wife , and his brother John , were not free from suspicion . John was charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was another in the same town said to be bewitched . The Bradstreets fled the colony . Ann Foster died in prison . Abigail Faulkner was tried , convicted and sentenced , but subsequently reprieved . ' Samuel Wardwell was found guilty and executed . Sarah , his wife , Elizabeth Johnson and Mary Lacy were tried the following January and convicted . They were sentenced to be hanged , but the proclamation of Governor Phips set them free . Wardwell 's wife and daughter appeared to testify against him , probably to save their own necks , which they succeeded in doing . He , however , repented of the false confession he had made and retracted . The retraction cost him his life . At some subsequent time the daughter retracted her 5nfession against her father and mother . Probably it was after Wardwell had been hung . This case of Wardwell 's is the only instance , so far as we know , where a husband or wife accused each other . Cases of children accusing parents and parents accusing children were , as we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eight which suffered on Thursday , September 22 . When he stood on the gallows and was speaking to the people , a puff of tobacco smoke blew in his face and caused him to cough , wherec*d*f says because she was pregnant . ( Fowler 's ed. , 260 ) Upham says she made a partial confession , and that Sir William ordered a reprieve , and after she had been thirteen weeks in prison , he directed her tn be discharged on the ground of insufficient evidence . lIe adds that this is the only instance nf a special pardon granted during the proceedings . ( Salem Witchcraft , II. , 332. ) upon the accusers said the devil hindered him with smoke . XIII . ACCUSED AND TRIED BUT NOT EXEcUTED . I PURPOSE in this chapter , briefly to sketch some of the more peculiar and interesting features connected with a few trials of persons accused of witchcraft in 1692 , but not executed , and in several cases not convicted . The case of Mary Perkins Bradbury of Salisbury , is one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seventy-five years of age . Some of those living near her had spoken of her as a witch long previous to 1692 . In July of that year she was examined and committed to jail . Her trial took place at the early September session of the court . Two indictments against her have come down to us . To these indictments Mary Bradbury answered : " I do plead not guilty . I am wholly innocent of any such wickedness . " Here is a piece of testimony that illustrates the condition of mind of the people in 1692 . It shows how everyday occurrences , as we should call them , were attributed to supernatural agencies . We may not wonder that a rough sailor should sometimes believe in other than human agencies as the cause of unusual events ; but not only did the rough sailor believe in them , but the judges and the highest officials in the province believed in them enough to admit the evidence to convict , and to pass sentence of death on the strength of that evidence . The testimony to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age . She was convicted . He testified : " About eleven years ago , being bound upon a voyage to sea with Capt . Samuel Smith , late of Boston , deceased ; just before we sailed , Mrs. Bradbury of Salisbury , the prisoner now at the bar , came to Boston with some firkins of butter , of which Captain Smith bought two . One of them proved half-way butter , and after we had been at sea three weeks , our men were not able to eat it , it stunk so , and run with maggots , which made the men very much disturbed about it , and would often say that they heard Mrs. Bradbury was a witch , and that they verily believed she was so , or else she would not have served the captain so as to sell him such butter . And further , this deponent testifleth , that in four days after they set sail , they met with such a storm that we lost // our main mast and rigging , and lost fifteen horses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast , and that very night there came up a ship by our side and carried away two of the mizzen shrouds , and one of the leaches of the main sail . And this deponent further sayeth that after they arrived at Barhadoes and went to Saltitudos and had laden their vessel , the next morning she sprang aleak in the hold , which wasted several tons of salt , insomuch that we were forced to unlade our vessel again wholly to stop our leak . There was then four feet of water in the hold . After we had taken in our lading again , we had a good passage home , hut when we came near the land , the captain sent this deponent forward to look out for land , in a bright moonshining night , and as he was sitting upon the windlass , he heard a rumbling noise under him . With that he , the said deponent , testifieth that he looked on the side of the windlass and saw the legs of some person , being no ways frighted , and that presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of a woman from the middle upwards , having a white cap and white neck cloth on her , which then affrighted him very much , and as he was turning of the windlass he saw the aforesaid two legs . " The story of the arrest and examination of Phillip English and his wife Mary , if we had all the documents in the case , would , no doubt , be exceedingly interesting . The papers have not come down to us save in the most meagre form . Phillip English was a wealthy merchant of Salem , and , in 1692 , lived on Essex street , between what are now Webb and English streets . He occupied one of the finest mansions of the town , and perhaps of the colony . English owned fourteen buildings in Salem , a wharf and twentyone vessels . How charges of witchcraft came to be made against him and his wife has always been a mystery . Dr. Bently intimates that his controversies and lawsuits with the town , and the superior style in which the family lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusing children to name them . We are indebted to the same authority for our information about the arrest of Mrs. English . She was in bed when the sheriff came for her . The servants admitted him to her chamber , where he read the warrant . Guards were then placed around the house until morning , when she was taken away for examination . It is related that the pious mother attended to family devotions as usual that morning , kissed her children good-by , and calmly discussed their future in case she never returned to them . She then told the officer she was ready to die . Mrs. English was examined on April 22 d , and committed to jail . The warrant against her husband was issued on April 3oth . It was returned May 2d , with the indorsement by the sheriff ; " Mr. Phillip English not to be found . " His arrest was not effected until May 3oth . He was then examined and committed to jail along with his wife . They soon escaped from jail and went to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They then returned to Salem and resumed their customary life . The record of the prosecution of the Hobbs family constitutes an interesting chapter of witchcraft history . Abigail , the daughter , was the first to be arrested . The warrant against her was issued on April i8 . She was taken into custody and examined the following day , at Ingersoll 's house in Salem Village . Upham says she was a reckless , vagabond creature , wandering through the woods at night like a half-deranged person . The arrest of her father , William Hobbs , and her mother , Deliverance Hobbs , was effected three days later , mainly on the strength of statement made by the daughter . She charged that both of them were witches . Hobbs was about fifty years of age and lived on Topsfield territory . Abigail was examined in Salem prison on April 20 . On May 12 , she was again examined in prison . " Did Mr. Burroughs bring you any of the poppets of his wives to stick pins into ? - I do not remember that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by you ? I do not know . " She testified that she stuck thorns into people whom she did not know , and one of them , Mary Lawrence , suggested to her mind by the court , died . " Who brought the image to you ? - It was Mr. Burroughs . " How did he bring it to you ? - In his own person , bodily . " This is one of the most remarkable statements made in the whole history of the delusion . At the time Abigail Hobbs made it she was in jail , and had been since before the arrest of Burroughs . // IPrevious to her arrest he was in Maine , eighty miles distant . Yet , she declares that Burroughs came to her in his bodily person , bringing images of a half dozen girls for her to afflict by sticking thorns into them , and that when she pricked them thus the real girls cried out from pain and she heard them . That there might be no mistake about this , seemingly , the magistrate asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus afflicted : " Was he ( Burroughs ) there himself with you in bodily person ? " Her answer was : " Yes , and so he was in ye tvoods alon she told me she was not afraid of anything for she told me she had sold herself body and soule to ye old boy . In the Governor 's proclamation freeing all the accused , William Hobbs was included and went at liberty . Abigail Hobbs was convicted in the higher court and sentenced to be hanged , but the sentence was never executed . Deliverance Hobbs lay in jail a long time . *I*i She does not appear ever to have been tried , and it is certain that she was not executed . when he appeared to tempt me to set my hand to the book ; he then appeared in person and I felt his hand at the same time .

At her trial in September , the following testimony was given : " Lidia Nichols aged ahout 7 years testifieth and saith that ahout a yeare and a half agoe I asked ahigaile hobs how she durst lie out a nights Dorcas Hoar of Beverly , a widow , was arrested on a warrant issued April 30 , and examined at Lieutenant Ingersoll 's on May 2 . Not satisfied with charging her with pinching , etc. , the accusers told her she killed her husband , and charged her with various other crimes . They said they saw " the black man whispering in her ear . " These calumnies were too much for her to endure in silence , and she cried back to them indignantly : " Oh , you are liars , and God will stop the mouths of liars . " " You are not to speak after this manner in the court , " chided Hathorne . " I will speak the truth as Joan Putnam 3d 's Place . - j .  - -  . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiant reply . She was committed for trial , and subsequently convicted and sentenced . Notwithstanding her courageous words , Dorcas Hoar was brought to a confession . Judge Sewall , under date of September 21 , says : " A petition is sent to town in behalf of Dorcas Hoar who now confesses . Accordingly an order is sent to the sheriff to forbear her execution , notwithstanding her being in the warrant to die to-morrow . This is the first condemned person who has confessed . " During the trial of Dorcas , Abigail Williams declared that she saw the appearance of this woman before ever she saw Tituba Indian or any one else . This , if true , would make Dorcas Hoar the first of the witches of 1692 . She escaped from jail in the same mysterious manner that so many other of the accused did . These escapes were numerous during the witchcraft trials . Whether the jails were weakly constructed , or the jailers did not guard the prisoners closely at all times , it is not possible to say . It is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . Most of these escapes were from the Boston jail , which would naturally be as strong as any . 1 On the other hand , the Ips5 Phillip English and wife were allowed the freedom of the town under bonds , being required only to sleep in jail . Essex Inst . Hiss. col. , I. , s6s. wich jail was a very primitive structure , and escape from it must have been easy , yet no one , so far as is known , ever escaped from it . Mary Warren was , as I have mentioned in preceding pages , one of the early and persistent accusers . She was twenty years of age and a servant in the family of John Procter . She gave testimony against some of those first charged , but afterwards became skeptical and began to talk about the deceptions of the afflicted , and said they " did but dissemble . " The other accusing girls then cried out against her , and she spoke still more emphatically against the whole business . A warrant for her arrest was procured on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Parris kept the official record of that examination . He says , when she was coming towards the bar , the afflicted fell into fits . The magistrates told her she was charged with witchcraft , and asked : " Are you guilty or not " ? To this she replied : " I am innocent . " When the afflicted were asked if she had hurt them , some were dumb , and Hubbard " testified against her . " All the afflicted soon had fits . At her examination she fell into a fit , and some cried out that she was going to confess ; " but , " continues the report , " Goody Corey and Procter and his wife came in in their apparitions , and struck her down , and said she should tell nothing . " Then followed one of the most dramatic scenes in the whole witchcraft history . The official record of the examination says : " After continuing in a fit some time she said , I will speak . Oh I am sorry for it , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another fit . Then attempting a little later to speak her teeth were set . She fell into another fit , and shouted , Thomas Haine 's House . // o Lord help me. 0 good Lord , save me . And then afterwards cried again , I will tell , I will tell , and then fell into a violent fit again . " And afterwards cried I will tell , I will tell , they did , they did , they did , and then fell into a violent fit again . " After a little recovery , she cried , I will tell , I will tell . They brought me to it . And then fell into a fit again , which fits continuing , she was ordered to be led out , and the next to be brought in , viz. , Bridget Bishop . " She was called in again , but immediately taken with fits . " Have you signed the devil 's book ? - No . " Then she fell into fits again , and was sent forth for air . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hut could not give account of things by reason of fits , and so sent forth . " Mary Warren was called in afterwards in private before magistrates and ministers . She said I shall not speak a word , but I will , I will speak , Satan . She saith she will kill me . Oh , she saith she owes me a spite , and will claw me off . Avoid Satan , for the name of God , avoid . And then fell into fits again , and cried , Will ye ? I will prevent ye , in the name of God . " It will be understood that iViary Warren , all this time , was struggling to confess and the devil sought to prevent her . At least , that is what she was pretending . Whether it was a piece of the most perfecting acting , we do not know . Yet we do know now that there was no reality about the witchcraft business from beginning to end . Mr. Parris notes that not one of the sufferers was afflicted during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that the whole performance with Mary Warren was a part of the conspiracy between her and the other accusing girls , and the older prosecutors . She made a second and circumstantial confession , in which she turned Thomas Fufler Jr . s , Hous .. ddl&amp;toe. state 's evidence , so to speak , and told all she had seen and heard . She was immediately released and returned to her former occupation of testifying against persons accused of witchcraft . The impression which her case made on the credulous people at Salem was to convince them that there was no fraud about the witchcraft accusations and prosecutions when members of the accusing circle were " cried out against " by one of their companions , and that if she could tear herself from the devil 's snare , the others could do the same if so disposed . Jonathan Carey , whose wife was charged with witchcraft , has left a circumstantial account of her examination before the magistrates . It gives a clear idea of the mode of procedure , which did not differ in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old shipmaster , and a man whose word was not to be doubted . He says : " May 24 . I having heard some days , that my wife was accused of witchcraft ; being much disturbed at it , by advice went to Salem Village , to see if the afflicted knew her . We arrived there on the 24th of May . It happened to be a day appointed for examination , accordingly , soon after our arrival , Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Corwin , &amp;c. , went to the meeting - house , which was the place appointed for that work . The minister began with prayer ; and , having taken care to get a convenient place , I observed that the afflicted were two girls of about ten years old , and about two or three others of about eighteen . One of the girls talked most , and could discern more than the rest . The prisoners were called in one by one , and , as they came in , were cried out // at , &amp;c . The prisoners were placed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusers were between the justices and them . The prisoners were ordered to stand right before the justices , with an officer appointed to hold each hand , lest they should therewith afflict them And the prisoner 's eyes must be constantly on the justices , for , if they looked on the afflicted , they would either fall into fits or cry out of being hurt by them . After an examination of the prisoners , who it was afflicted these girls , and c. , they were put upon saying the Lord 's prayer , as a trial of their guilt . After the afflicted seemed to be out of their fits , they would look steadfastly on some one person , and frequently not speak , and then the justices said they were struck dumb , and after a little time would speak again . Then the justices said to the accusers , " Which of you will go and touch the prisoner at the bar " ? Then the most courageous would adventure , but , before they made three steps , would ordinarily fall down as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken up and carried to the prisoner , that she might touch them , and as soon as they were touched by the accused , the justices would say : " They are well , " before I could discern any alteration , - by which I observeri that the justices understood the manner of it . Thus far I was only as a spectator . My wife also was there part of the time , but no notice was taken of her by the afflicted , except once or twice they came to her and asked her name . " But I , having an opportunity to discourse Mr. Hale with whom I had formerly acquaintance , I took his advice what I had best do , and desired of him that I have an opportunitytospeak with her that accused my wife ; which he promised should be , I acquainting him that I reposed my trust in him . Accordingly , he came to me after the examination was over , and told me I had now an opportunity to speak with the said accuser , Abigail Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that we could not he - in private at Mr. Parris s house , as he had promised me ; we went , therefore , into the ale-house , where an Indian man attended us , who , it seems , was one of the afflicted ; to him we gave some cider ; he showed several scars that seemed as if they had been long there , and showed them as done by witchcraft , and acquainted us that his wife , who also was a slave , was in prison for witchcraft . And now instead of one accuser , they all came in , and began to tumble down like swine ; and then all three women were called in to attend them . We in the room were all at a stand to see who they would cry out of ; but in a short time they cried out " Carey " ; and immediately after a warrant was sent from the justices to bring my wife before them , who was sitting in a chamber near by , waiting for this . Being brought before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife declared to the justices that she never had any knowledge of them before that day . She was forced to stand with her arms stretched out . I benjamin Fuller 's House , Middleton . // requested that I might hold one of her hands , but it was denied me . Then she desired me to wipe the tears from her eyes and the sweat from her face , which I did ; then she desired she might lean herself on me , saying she should faint . Justice Hathorne replied she had strength enoogh to torment these persons , and she should have strength to stand . I speaking something against their cruel proceedings , they commanded me to be silent , or else I should be turned out of the room . The Indian before mentioned was also brought in to be one of her accusers , being come in , he now ( when before the justices ) fell down and tumbled about like a hog but said nothing . The justices asked the girls who afflicted the Indian : they answered , she ( meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The justices ordered her to touch him , in order to his cure , but her head must be turned another way , lest , instead of curing , she should make him worse by her looking on him , her hand being guided to take hold of his , but the Indian took hold of her hand and pulled her down on the floor in a barbarous manner ; then his hand was taken off and her hand put on his , and the cure was quickly wrought . " Captain Carey said he had difficulty to get a bed for his wife that night . She was committed to jail in Boston , and subsequently removed to Cambridge . " Having been there one night , next night the jailer put irons on her legs ; the weight was about eight pounds . " These irons and other afflictions threw her into convulsions , and he tried to have the irons taken off , but in vain . When the trials came on Carey went to Salem to see how they were conducted . Finding that spectral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his wife she had nothing to hope for there . He procured her escape from jail and they went to New York , where Governor Fletcher befriended them . In reviewing the story presented in the preceding pages I confess to a measure of doubt as to the moving causes in this terrible tragedy . It seems impossible to believe a tithe of the statements which were made at the trials . And yet it is equally difficult to say that nine out of every ten of the men , women and children , who testified upon their oaths , intentionally and wilfully falsified . Nor does it seem possible that they did , or could , invent all these marvellous tales - fictions rivalling the imaginative genius of Haggard or Jules Verne . Neverthe less , we know that the greater portion of their depositions were without foundation in fact . Many of them we may attribute to the wild fancyings of minds disordered by the excited state of the community . Others can not be thus explained satisfactorily . In order to form a correct judgment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put ourselves in the place of the men and women of 1692 . They believed in witchcraft ; that there was such a thing , no one doubted . As we have seen , the wisest jurists , as well as all the ministers , believed in the existence of witches . Books were written upon the subject as upon insanity and kindred topics . People had been arrested and executed for the alleged crime in all Christian countries . For nearly half a century previous to 1692 , prosecutions were made for witchcraft in New England . Men like Governor Endicott , Governor Winthrop , and even the liberal-minded Bradstreet , had passed sentence upon its unfortunate victims . Shall we , then , wonder that the people of Salem Village attributed to the demon witchcraft the strange performances of Abigail Williams , Elizabeth Parris , Ann Putnam and their associates , in February , 1692 . Rather shall we not record our admiration that there and then the belief in spectral evidence , and , necessarily , witchcraft , received its death blow ? The refusal of the Essex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the end , not only in Salem but in the world . The conclusion , therefore , which seems most rational is that which attributes the unfortunate affair to a species of neighborhood insanity , a wholesale delusion . It was like a cyclone that sweeps over the land , or a conflagration that wipes out of existence *41ole sections of a city . We do not realize the awful drama which is being enacted around us . Only when the storm has passed and we awake to a thorough comprehension of the calamity , do we appreciate its force ; then , the hour of its raging seems like a dream . Such , I judge , was substantially the case with our ancestors two centuries ago . They did not realize , during the summer of 1692 , the awfulness of the tragedy they were enacting. // They believed that they were casting out devils , and that any measures , however severe , were justifiable . Their language after the storm was passed and a calm had settled over the land , implies as much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been doing , dawned on them only after all was over . The witchcraft tragedy must then have seemed to them like a horrid nightmare . We of the present generation shudder at the intolerant persecutions and superstitions of our ancestors . Let us do nothing in politics or religion that will cause our descendants to blush for us . It is well to review the unwise or unjust acts of our ancestors sometimes , as we would place a beacon on some shoal or reef where a ship had been wrecked , to warn others of the danger .
