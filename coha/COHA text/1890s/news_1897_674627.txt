txt The Recent Registration of Voters Indicates that They Are in an 0-verwheiminx Majority . From The Honolulu Independent , Aug. 18 . No wonder is it that the Government withheld to the latest hour the publication of the total vote registered on the Hawaiian Islands for the next election . Where formerly 14,000 was the total vote the oligarchy in the fourth year tf : tsexistence can only find 2,687 males willing to register their votes and aid the Government 's plans at the polls , and only Sld votes on the Island of Oahu with the capital city having an estimated population of 25,000 . And out of this number of 2 , CS7 more than two-thirds are probably receiving directly or indirectly Government pay . One thousand , It is credited , are citizens ' guards and about 500 In the uniformed army , and then there is a number of Government employes not bearing arms , except , perhaps , as sharpshooters or on the reserve list . Now let us turn to our last census and remember that the voting population has probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it was taken . We rind there that we have a population of Hawaiian and " white " males numbering 34,200 ; this would give us under the ordinary rules of suffrage at least 6,0410 votes , and in this country nearly double the number , considering that the proportion of males to females is more than double . And yet representing a population of 110,000 souls , the Government can find only 2.687 registered voters . Well may they bow and hang their heads with shame when this news goes forth to the ' United States as a proof of how much the oligarchical republic , " our best Government , " is beloved by the people . One vote accorded in proportion to more than fifty population . But let them imbibe a little " Dutch courage " and then dare to call a ** to be voted by those entitled to register in 1887 and since , including their own " special service " men , and what would be the result ? A vote of at least 15,000 , with 2.000 for annexation and 1:4000 against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended their " thrones " by rebellion and treachery , so must they consummate their political , : al ruin at all hazards , irrespective of the people 's will , and leave to the United States the legacy of controlling these islands by the iron hand of an armed despotism . A minority can not always govern except by force , and that also is a dangerous thing in the long run ,
