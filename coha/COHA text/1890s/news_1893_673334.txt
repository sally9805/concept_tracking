txt Every farmer knows how very tough may sometimes be the roots that spread in shallow soil , and the same phenomenon is to be observed in the minds of politicians . Senator CULLOM , for instance , can not dislodge from his mind the notion that our present financial difficulties are largely due to the popularity of tariff reform in 1890 and 1892 . Tariff reform is Democratic policy , everything Democratic is mischievous and may be disastrous ; the people elected a Democratic House in 1890 , a Democratic President in 1892 , and a Democratic Senate in the meantime . Then oame the panic . He concedes that the Sherman law may have had something to do with it , but he is sure that there can be no security until tariff reform is abandoned . The fact is that the panic , from which there are now happily signs that we are slowly recovering , was purely a financial panic , and not a commercial or industrial one . Had it been the latter , it would have followed a period of overproduction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know that we have had none of these . The beginning of the policy which finally awakened acute alarm was away back in 1878. when the BlandAllison act was passed over the veto of President HAYES by a combination of Republican and Democratic votes in both houses . This was not finance , but politics , and very bad politics at that . It is a striking instance of the evil consequences of trying to mix the two , and the Republican Senators would do well to take warning by it . Their party was badly demoralized by the first experiment , and have nothing to gain by a repetition of it . Let us get the Sherman bill out of the way . The tariff can then be taken up and settled in the proper and regular way .
