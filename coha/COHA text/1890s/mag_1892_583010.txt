A New England Boyhood . August , A NEW ENGLAND BOYHOOD . NOTE . - The Editor of the Atlantic Monthly , having observed the interest with which Miss Larcom 's A New England Girlhood was received , asked Mr. Hale if he would bring together some of his memories of the same period in a series of papers on a New England boyhood , with special reference to the conditions of life in Boston in the early part of the second quarter of this century . The chapters which follow form the first number of this series . I. T IS SEVENTY YEARS SINCE . THE reader and I ought not to begin without my reminding him that the Boston of which I am to write was very different from the Boston of to-day . In 1825 Boston was still a large country town . I think some one has called it a city of gardens ; but that some one may have been I. As late as 1817 , in a description of Boston which accompanied a show which a Frenchman had made by carving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some triumph , that there were nine blocks of buildings in the town . This means that every other building stood with windows or doors on each of the four sides , and in most instances with trees , or perhaps little lanes , between . To people in this neighborhood to-day , I may say that the upper part of the main street in Charlestown gives a very good idea of what the whole of Washington Street south of Winter Street was then . And , by the way , Washington Street was much more often called Main Street than by its longer name . The reader must imagine , therefore , a large , prettycountry town , where stagecoaches still clattered in from the country , and brought all the strangers who did not ride in their own chaises . Large stables , always of wood , I think , provided for the horses thus needed . I remember , as I write , Niles 's stable in School Street , a large stable in Bromfield Street , afterwards Streeter 's , the stables of the Marlborough Hotel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stables in Hawley Street , - all in the very heart of the town , and on a tract which can not be more than twelve acres . When , in 1829 , it was reported that the new Tremont House was to have no special stables for its guests , the announcement excited surprise almost universal ; and to ns children the statement that there was to be a tavern , or a hotel , without a sign was still more extraordinary . We were used to seeing swinging signs on posts in front of the taverns . Thus I remember " The Indian Queen " in Bromfield Street , " The Bunch of Grapes " in State Street , " The Lamb " I think where the Adams House now is , " The Lion " where the Boston Theatre is , and nearly opposite these the Lafayette Tavern . This means that large pictures of an Indian queen , a bunch of grapes , a lamb , a lion , and of Lafayette swung backward and forward in the wind . There was a sign in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Milk Street , but I do not remember what these were . All these inns would now be thought small . They were then called taverns , and to New Englanders seemed very large . Of course they were large enough for their purpose . When I was nine or ten years old , my father , who was thought to be a fanatic as a railroad prophet , offered in Fanenil Hall the suggestion that if people could come from Springfield to Boston in five hours , an average of nine people would come every day . This prophecy was then considered extravagant . When he came to Boston for the first time , in 1805 , the Northampton passengers // joined the Springfield passengers at Brookfield . There was room in the carriage for six only . He therefore gave up his seat to a lady who had pressing duties , and waited in Brookfield twenty-four hours to take his chances for the next stage . The more important business streets of this little town were paved in the middle with round stones from the neighboring beaches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why ; but an accomplished friend , who reads this in manuscript , says that the lapstone on which a cobbler stretches his leather is a cobblestone . I recommend this etymology to Dr. Murray and Dr. Whitney . The use of bricks for sidewalks was just coming in , but generally the sidewalks were laid with the fiat slates or shales from the neighborhood , which were put down in any shape they happened to take in splitting , without being squared at the corners . Bromfield Street , Winter Street , Summer Street , and Washington Street ( old Marlborough Street ) between School and Winter seem to us now to be narrow streets , but they have all been widened considerably within my memory .. Bromfield Street was called Bromfield 's Lane . On the other hand , so far as I remember the houses themselves and the life in them , everything was quite as elegant and finished as it is now . Furniture was stately , solid , and expensive . Carpets , then of English make , covered the whole floor , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way , in all houses of which I knew anything , these carpets were always taken up , and India mattings substituted in the " living-rooms . " Observe that very few houses were closed in summer . Dress was certainly as elegant and costly as it is now ; so were porcelain , glass , table linen , and all table furniture . In the earlier days of which I write , a decanter of wine would invariably have stood on a sideboard in every parlor , so that a glass of wine could readily be offered at any moment to any guest . All through my boyhood , it would have been matter of remark if , when a visitor made an evening call , something to eat or drink was not produced at nine o'clock . It might be crackers and cheese , it might be mince pie , it might be oysters or cold chicken . But , something . would appear , as certainly as there would be a fire on the hearth in winter . Every house , by the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking was done by an open fire . I doubt if I ever saw a stove in my boyhood , except in a school or an office . Anthracite coal was first tried in 1824 . Gas was introduced about the same time . I was taken as a little boy to see it burning in the shops in Washington Street , and to wonder at an elephant , a tortoise , and a cow , which spouted burning g*s in the windows . Gas was not introduced into dwellinghouses until Pemberton Square was built by the Lowells , Jacksons , and their friends , in the years 1835 , 1836 , and later . It was a surprise to every one when Papanti introduced it in his new Papanti 's Hall . A handsome parlor then differed from a handsome parlor now mostly in the minor matters of decoration . The pictures on the walls were few , and were mostly portraits . For the rest , mirrors were large and handsome . You would see some copies from well-known paintings in European galleries , and any one who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean that most walls were bare . In good houses , if modern , the walls of parlors would invariably be painted ; but in older houses there would be paper hangings , perhaps of landscape patterns . rrhe furniture of a parlor would generally be twelve decorous heavy chairs , probably hairseated , with their backs against the walls ; a sofa which matched them , also with its back against the wall ; and a heavy , perhaps marble - topped centre a // table . There might be a rocking-chair in the room , also ; but , so far as I remember , other easy-chairs , scattered as one chose about a room , were unknown . Try to recall , dear reader , or to imagine , the conditions of a town without any railroads , and without any steam navigation beyond fifteen miles . The first steamboat in Boston harbor went to Nahant and back again , about 1826 . The first steam railway ran trains to Newton , nine miles , in 1833 . Please to remember , then , that everybody lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich people who had country places in Dorchester , Roxbury , Newton , Brookline , Watertown , Waltham , Brighton , Cambridge , Charlestown , or Medford , accessible by a horse and chaise . What we call buggies were unknown2 and a gentleman and lady would certainly ride in a chaise , which was not the English chaise , but a two-wheeled covered vehicle , hung on C-springs . In such a town , the supplies of food , unless brought from the immediate neighborhood , came from the seaboard or the Western rivers , in sloops or schooners . We drew our flour from points as far south as Richmond . I remember more than one winter , when my grandmother , in Westhampton , had sent us a keg or two of home apple-sauce , that the sloop which brought the treasure was frozen up below Hartford , so that it . was four or five months before we hungry children enjoyed her present . Great wagons with large teams of horses brought from the interior such products as did not come in this way . For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and beyond , great sheds and stables . The country teamster left his horses and his load there while he came into town to make sure where it was to be delivered . To pick up the stray corn which was scattered in these sheds great flocks of pigeons congregated , of whom a wretched handful survive to this day . I mention these little details to give some idea of the country fashion of our lives . Two or three weeks out of town in summer was a large allowance of vacation . Nobody dreamed of closing a church in summer . The school vacation was a fortnight and three days in August , to which , in later days , was added first one week , and then two weeks , in June . The summer break-up which now divides everybody 's Boston year was then wholly unknown . II . SCHOOL LIFE . After studying with great care Mr. Howells 's A Boy 's Town and Miss Larcom 's A New England Girlhood , I have determined not to follow a strict order of time . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one chapter a set of school memories which range from about 1825 for ten years . At my own imprudent request , not to say urgency , I was sent to school with two sisters and a brother , older than I , when I was reckoned as about two years old . The school was in an old-fashioned wooden house which fronted on a little court which led off Summer Street . We went up one flight of narrow stairs , and here the northern room of the two bedrooms of the house was occupied by Miss Susan Whitney for her school , and the southern room , which had windows on Summer Street , by Miss Ayres , of whom Miss Whitney had formerly been an assistant . Miss Whitney afterwards educated more than one generation of the children of Boston families . I supposed her to be one of the most aged , and certainly the most learned , women of her time . I believe she was a kind-hearted , intelligent girl of seventeen when I first knew her . I also supposed the room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nearly so large as our own // parlors at home . It may have been eighteen feet square . The floor was sanded with clean sand every Thursday and Saturday afternoon . This was a matter of practical importance to us , because with the sand , using our feet as tools , we made sand pies . You gather the sand with the inside edge of either shoe from a greater or less distance , as the size of the pie requires . As you gain skill , the heap which you make is more and more round . When it is well rounded , you flatten it by a careful pressure of one foot from above . Here it will be seen that full success depends on your keeping the sole of the shoe exactly parallel with the plane of the floor . If you find you have succeeded when you withdraw the shoe , you prick the pie with a pin or a broom splint provided for the purpose , pricking it in whatever pattern you like . The skill of a good pie-maker is measured largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pie is better if the sand is a little moist . But beggars can not be choosers , and while we preferred the sand on Mondays and Fridays , when it was fresh , we took it as it came . I dwell on this detail at length because it is one instance as good as a hundred of the way in which we adapted ourselves to the conditions of our times . Children now have carpets on their kindergarten floors , where sand is unknown ; so we have to provide clay for them to model with , and put a heap of sand in the back yard . Miss Whitney provided for the same needs by a simpler device , which I dare say is as old as King Alfred . I can not tell how we were taught to read , for I can not remember the time when I could not read as well as I can now . There was a little spelling-book called The New York Spelling-Book , printed by Mahlon Day . When , afterwards , I came to read about Mahlon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man who had the same name as the man who published the spelling-book . My grandfather had made a spelling book which we had at home . Privately , I knew that , because he made it , it must be better than the book at school , but I was far too proud to explain this to Miss Whitney . I accepted her spelling-book in the same spirit in which I have often acted since , falling in with what I saw was the general drift , because the matter was of no great consequence . For reading-books , we had Mrs. Barbauld 's First Lessons , " Come hither , Charles , come to mamma ; " and we had Popular Lessons , by Miss Robbins , which would be a good book to revive now , but I have . not seen it for sixty years . The school must have been a very much " go-as-you-please " sort of place . So far it conformed to the highest ideals of the best modern systems . But it had rewards and punishipents . I have now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize . My brother Nathan had Rasselas for a prize , and my sister Sarah had a silver medal , " To the most amiable , " which I am sure she deserved though the competition extended to the whole world . But these were the great prizes . In an old desk , of which the cover had been broken off , in the closet at the left of the fireplace , were a number of bows , made of yellow , pink , and blue ribbon . When Saturday came , every child who had been good through the week was permitted to select one of these bows , choosing his own color , and to have it pinned on his clothes , under his chin , to wear home . If , on the other hand , he had been very bad , he had a black bow affixed , willy nilly . I hardly dare to soil this page with the tale , but there was an awful story that a boy , whom I will call Charles Waters , unpinned his black bow and trod it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add that in that innocent community no one believed this dreadful story . Indeed , it was whispered from one to another // rather as an index of what terrible stories were afloat in the world than with any feeling that it could possibly be true . It is certainly a little queer that in after years one remembers such trifles as this , and forgets absolutely the weightier matters of the law : how he learned to read and write ; how he fought with the angel of vulgar fractions and compelled him to grant a blessing ; how , in a word , one learned anything of importance . But so it is , and thus , as I have said , I have no memory of any time when I could not read as well as I can now . Perhaps that is the reason why I am too apt to rank teachers of elocution with dancing-masters and fencingmasters , and other professors of deportment . Dear Miss Whitney must have taught us well , or we should have remembered the process more sadly . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my crimes , and one sin I certainly committed at Miss Whitney 's school . But alas , I do not know what it was , and I never did . Only this I know . We were all too small to go home through Main Street alone . Fullum came for us at twelve , and again at five in the afternoon . Who Fullum was shall appear by and by . One day , when Fullum came at noon , he found me seated in a large yellow chair in the middle of the schoolroom . I was reading a book with perfect satisfaction . So soon as Fullum appeared I was lifted from the chair and my " things " were put on . When we were in the street , Fullum said , " What have you been doing that was naughty , Doctor ? " I told him , with perfect sincerity , that I had done nothing wrong . But this he did not believe . He reminded me of what I then recollected , that that yellow chair was always a seat of punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before - unless it were Miss Whitney herself - excepting the sinners of the school , placed there for punishment . But alas , it had not occurred to any one to tell me why I was put there ; and as my own conscience was clear , I have not known from that day to this what my offense was . I could probably , without much difficulty , make a volume on Miss Whitney 's school , and the various aspects of life as they there presented themselves to me . But these papers must be severely condensed , and I omit such details . To me personally they have a little value , as bearing on the question how far back our memory really runs . There is a Frenchman who says that he recollects the relief produced on his eyes when he was a baby , thirty-six hours old , and a nurse lowered a curtain to screen him from the light . I am not able to fix any facts as early as this ; but I am interested in the observation that , among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest memory of my first interviews with her . I had a brother and two sisters older than myself , who were my home playmates . I saw them go to school from day to day , and I finally cried because I wanted to go with them . Miss Whitney was therefore persuaded to receive a pupil two years old at the schoql . It speaks well for her , I think , that she found it possible to adapt such a young gentleman to the exercises of the academy . That makes me think , as I have said , that those exercises must have been conducted on the individual plan . But my chief memories of the school are of conducting observations , similar to Tyndall 's , on the effect produced by sunlight upon dust floating in the air . Such luxuries as window shades or blinds were unknown ; if the sun shone in on the south side of the room , you shut an inside shutter . This reminds me that inside shutters are almost wholly unknown to the rising generation , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the top of this shutter , which was of paneled wood , a heart was cut , so as to let a 4ittle light into the room when the // shutters were closed . It will readily be seen that this heart made very curious forms on the floating dust in the schoolroom . What with the manufacture of sand pies and other enterprises going on , there must have been a good deal of dust in the schoolroom , and I remember far better the aspects of this dust , as the sun lighted it and as it floated in different currents , than I do* any single lesson which I acquired from books . It will give some idea of the simplicity of manners and of the quietness of the little town if I tell how " we four " - by which I mean the four oldest children of my father 's family - went to school and returned , in the winter . In winter , Fullum put my two sisters , my brother , and myself into a little green sleigh which he had had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . I believe that if any Fullum of to-day should start from the upper door of the Parker House , and drag four little children down School Street , through Washington Street , to Summer Street , and stop at a door opposite Hovey 's , he would attract a fair share of attention . But there was room enough for all then . The " main street " was what the chief street of a good country town would be now , and this equipage seemed strange to nobody . School kept only in the morning on Saturday , and Thursday afternoon was always a holiday , in memory of the " Thursday lecture . " But as the lecture was delivered at eleven o'clock in the morning , and every school kept until twelve , there was , of course , no real connection between the holiday and the lecture . The half-holiday was changed to Wednesday , a few years later than the time I am speaking of . It is on this account that Wednesday and Sa*urday appear to me , to this moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well say , first as last , that school was always a bore to me . I did not so much hate it as dislike it , as a necessary nuisance . I think all my teachers regarded it as such ; I am sure they made me so regard it . Just before I was six years old I was transferred from Miss Whitney 's school to another school which was in the immediate neighborhood , being in the basement of the First Church , which was then in Chauncy Street . It stood , I think , just where Coleman &amp; Mead 's great store is to-day . There were three or four large rooms under the church , which were rented as schoolrooms ; and it being thought that I was large enough to go to a man 's school , I was sent there , to my great delight , with my friend Edward Webster . We were very intimate from days earlier than this , of which I will speak in another chapter , and it was a great pleasure to us that we could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to a public school . My father and mother had both very decided , and I have a right to say very advanced , views on matters of education ; and advanced education was then a matter everywhere in the air . The Boston Latin School had been made a first-rate school for preparing boys for college , under the eye and care of Benjamin Apthorp Gould , some ten years before . But there was no public school of any lower grade to which my father would have sent me , any more than he would have sent me to jail . Since that time I have heard my contemporaries talk of the common school training of the day , and I do not wonder at my father 's decision .. The masters , so far as I know , were all inferior men ; there was constant talk of " hiding " and " cowhides " and " ferules " and " thrashing , " and I should say , indeed , that the only recollections of my contemporaries about those schooldays were of one constant low conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a boy was sent to the Latin School - and he was sent there at nine years of age - all this was changed into the life of a civilized place . Why the Boston people tolerated such brutality as went on in their // other public schools I do not know , and never have known ; but no change came for some years after . For the next three years , the only object , so far as I was concerned , was to have me live along and get ready for the Latin School . I have always been glad that I was sent where I was , - to a school without any plan or machinery , very much on the go-as-you-please principle , and where there was no strain put upon the pupil . I disliked it , as I disliked all schools ; but here , again , I regarded the whole arrangement as one of those necessary nuisances which society imposes on the individual , and which the individual would be foolish if he quarreled with , when he did not have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such power , and therefore went and came as I was bidden , only eager every day to exchange the monotonies of school life for the more varied and larger enterprises of the playroom or of the Common . I have said that advanced education was in the air . It will be hard to make boys and girls of the present day understand how much was then expected from reforms in education . Dr. Channing was at his best then , and all that he had to say about culture and self-culture impressed people intensely , - more intensely , I think , than was good for them . There were rumors from Europe of Fellenberg 's school at Hofwyl . At Northampton , the Round Hill School was started on somewhat similar plans . In England , Lord Brougham and the set of people around him were discussing the " march of intellect , " and had established a Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge , whose name has lived after it . Mr. Webster , Mr. Edward Everett , my father , and other gentlemen in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing . The reign of Lyceums and Mechanics ' Institutes had begun . Briefly , there was the real impression that the kingdom of heaven was to be brought in by teaching people what were the relations of acids to alkalies , and what was the derivation of the word " cordwainer . " If we only knew enough , it was thought , we should be wise enough to keep out of the fire , and we should not be burned . So it was that any novelty , when it was presented at a schoolroom door , was even more apt to be accepted than it is now ; and , as every reader of these lines knows , such things are accepted pretty willingly now . So I remember that I was taught " geometry " when I was six years old , - or that I thought I was , - from a little book called The Elements of Geometry . I could rattle off about isosceles triangles when I was six as well as I can now . And I had other queer smattering bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the same way . At school there was a school library , from which we borrowed books , because we liked the mechanism of it . We had much better books at home ; but of course it was good fun to have your name eiitered on a book , and to return them once a week , and so on . My father was one of the best teachers I ever knew , and had broken into life , as most educated young men in those days did , first as a private tutor in the city of Troy , and afterwards as teacher of mathematics in Exeter Academy . When he had a moment , therefore , from other affairs , to give to our education , it was always well used and we doubtless owed a great deal to him which we afterwards did not know how to account for . Among other such tenefactions , I owe it that for these three or four years , when really I had nothing to do but to grow physically , I was , placed with a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the drivers , who had plans and would want to make much of us . Among other notions of my father , right or wrong as the case may be , was this , that a boy could pick up the rudiments of language 154 August , // quite early in life . So the master was told that Edward Webster and I , and perhaps some other boys , were to be taught the paradigms of the Latin grammar at once . We also had given to us little Latin books , which we spelled away upon . One was a translation of the German version of Robinson Crusoe into Latin . It was thought that the interest of the book would induce us to learn the meaning of the words . But the truth was , we were familiar with Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe , and regarded this as a low and foolish imitation , of which we made a great deal of fun . All the same , the agony with which some boys remember their first studies of " amo , amas , amat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those things simply , and , by the time I was sent to the Latin School the point had been gained , and I knew my " penna , penn*e , penme , " and my " amo , amas , amat , " as well as if I had been born to them . The Latin School stood , at that time , where the lower part of Parker 's Hotel is now , in School Street . School Street received its name from this school . At the beginning the school was on the other side of the street , where the Franklin statue now stands . But when the King 's Chapel people had increased so much that they wanted to enlarge their little wooden tabernacle and carry their church farther down the street , about the middle of the last century , they applied to the town for the use of the schoolhouse lot . I rather think the matter became a battle between the Episcopalians and their " liberal " allies on the one side , and the old-line Puritans on the other . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the change prevailed only by a very few votes . The King 's Chapel people had to build a schoolhouse on the south side of the street . That schoolhouse was well remembered in my day , but the building was enlarged , I think , in 1814 . It had been only one story high , and it was then made three stories , with a granite front and a cupola on the top . In this cupola was a bell with a cross on it , about which we boys told many lies . I believe , in truth , it had been the bell on the Huguenot church , lower down on the same street . I entered the school in 1831 , being then nine years old . That was the minimum for the entrance of boys at that time , and the course was five years . I saw Mr. Leverett , who was the principal when I was admitted , but in the course of a few weeks he left the school to the charge of Mr. Charles Knapp Dillaway , who is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with education in Boston for the last sixty years . I may say in passing that I was permitted to speak at his funeral , and I could not but remember then that , from the time when he entered the Latin School , in 1818 , till he died , in 1889 , he had been personally connected , more or less distinctly , with our system of public education . He had therefore seen the working of that system for more than a quarter part of the period since it was established by Winthrop and his companions , in 1635 . The system of the school was rigid , but I do not think boys object to rigidity . It carried to the extreme the cultivation of verbal memory . We had a very bad Latin grammar , which I suppose was the best there was , made by Mr. Gould himself from Principal Adam 's Latin Grammar , which was used in all English schools . " Principal Adam " is the Edinburgh Adam of whom you read in Walter Scott and such books . The late Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said to me , " I can remember the block on which I was standing , in the Place Yend6me in Paris , when , as by a revelation , it occurred to me that Andrews and Stoddard 's Latin Grammar was made from the Latin language , and // that the Latin language was not made from Andrews and Stoddard 's Grammar , as up till that moment I had always supposed . " I am quite clear that I went well through the Latin School with the distinct feeling that that grammar stated the eternal truth with regard to language , and that Cicero and the rest of them had had to adapt themselves to it . I can not think that the masters thought so , but certainly they left that impression on the minds of the pupils . The first year of the little boys was spent in committing the words of this grammar to memory . Unless a boy was singularly advanced , he had no schoolbook in hand from September to the next August excepting this Latin grammar . I can not conceive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in fact about half the boys withdrew from the school , as not having " a gift for language , " before they had been there two years . These were generally the boys of quick and bright minds , who went off " into business , " as it was called , because they were not fit to be scholars . The professional lines of life lost those who would have been ornaments in whatever profession they had chosen , simply because those lads had not the verbal memory to remember and recall long lists of words , which Adam had noticed , which had or had not an i before urn in the genitive phiral . But I do not propose to go into the niceties of education in these papers . Thanks to the prescience of my father , of which I have spoken , I was put in with the ten-year-old boys , who had ground through this mill . Till this moment I am their inferior in certain details of the words to which I have referred , but I enjoyed life at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march of intellect " fad had not swept over Boston without bringing in the German notions about gymna smums . Dr. Lieber arrived , an exile from Germany , with Dr. Beck , who was also an exile , and they established a swimming-school where Brimmer Street is now , and a gymnasium in Tremont Street , - then called Common Street , - at the corner of West Street . That place was then called the " Washington Gardens . " Mr. Hartwell , in his recent interesting essay on gymnastics in Boston , says that the first year Lieber 's gymnasium in the Washington Gardens had two hundred pupils , which increased to four hundred in the second , and in the third year he had four pupils . These figures show only too fatally what was the fall of the athletic thermometer . More learned people than I must say whether the system of gymnastics carried on by ' fixed machinery ever maintains its popularity for a long time , unless it is seconded by athletics such as we now class under that name , and by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe most of what I am and have been in the world , was entered as one of the pupils in the Washington Gardens gymnasium . It must have been in the year 1827 , or possibly 1828 , that he took me with him there . All that I remember about it is my terror when I had climbed up a ladder and cut off my retreat . I had seen the other boys climb between the rounds and slide down the pole which supported the ladder , and I wished to do this . I got through the rounds , and then was afraid to slide . But a competent teacher came up , instructed me in the business , and I won the high courage by which to loosen my feet from fhe rounds and slide safely down . I went home to tell this story with delight , but never repeated the experiment . At the same time - and I think this shows the courage with which our education was carried on - I made my first essays in riding on horseback . My father owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and some one of the children out to ride on halfholidays . On some occasions , another horse , which was called the " Workbench " from his quiet habits , - white , I recollect , - was taken with us , saddled . This was that " we boys " might learn to ride . We were not permitted to ride in the streets in town , and father would ride the horse out so far , while my mother drove the chaise . But once in the country , we mounted , and followed the chaise for the afternoon tour . At five years old I was so small that my feet would not reach the stirrups , and I rode with . my feet in the straps which sustained the stirrups . All went well till , in South Boston , as we came home , some boys stoned my horse , and he ran and I was thrown . I remember repeating the experiment , with the same success and failure , and it ended in my poor father having to ride the " Workbench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I had started . The drift for athletics had swept over the Latin School , also , and the square yard behind the school , which seemed immense , but must have been only thirty feet in each measurement , was fitted up with a vaulting-horse , parallel bars , and so on . But as the fad wore itself out the boys were permitted to destroy these things , and when I entered the school , in 1831 , there were only the vaulting-horse and perhaps a pair of parallel bars left ; and these gradually disappeared from the curriculum . This playground was the only playground of the school , and was accessible only to the boys in the lowest room . Upstairs , we were confined to a very limited passageway , I might call it , at recess , in which we used to play " tug-of-war , " though we never called it by that name . Practically , the recesses were very short , for the simple reason that they did not like to have us in the street . Earlier than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five years old , that we looked from the windows of the house out upon the street , to see the sports of the boys there , when rather more liberty was granted them . I think it will amuse the schoolboys of the present day to know that in summer all boys then wore calico gowns during the hot months , cut exactly as a minister 's gown is cut now , though without the large sleeves . But this custom had gone by before I was a pupil at the school . I remember distinctly , however , seeing the boys kick their pails to pieces at the end of the school term . They would subscribe for pails in which to keep the water which they wanted to drink in the hot days ; and when the term was done , not wishing to leave their pails to their successors , they kicked them about the sidewalk and street until they were ruined . To this school we repaired at eight o'clock in the morning for the months between April and October , and at nine o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . School lasted till twelve o'clock , excepting for the little boys , who , in the latter part of my time , were " let out " at eleven o'clock . School began again at three , and lasted , in winter as long as there was light , and in summer till six o'clock . I remember the bitter terror which we had one summer afternoon , which must have been in May , 1833 , when we were to go and see Fanny Kemble in the evening . As it happened , the school committee chose to come that afternoon for an examination , and we were kept in for the completion of the examination after six o'clock . We sat there terrified , for fear the examination would last until the play began in the Tremont Theatre , hard by . I am afraid the boys of to-day would consider it rather hard lines if they were ever kept at school till the beginning of their theatrical entertainment . In Mr. Freeman Clarke 's autobie // graphy there is a charming passage about his stay at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable democratic effect of the whole thing . We were side by side with the sons of the richest and most prominent men in Boston ; we were side by side with the sons of day laborers , I suppose . The odd thing about it is that we did not know , and we did not care , whose sons they were . They were all dressed alike , they spoke equally good English , their hands were equally clean , and all we knew of them was that one fellow was at the head of the class , and one was not . I wish I knew now what was the family or origin of a charming boy named Carleton , - Charles Muzzey Carleton , - who was at the head of my class . He was a pure , manly , upright , gentlemanly fellow , a much better boy than any of the rest of us were , and we therefore chose to nickname him " Piety Carleton . " I am afraid we made him very unhappy by the nickname , but he bore himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If these words happen to fall under the eye of anybody who remembers that boy , I wish I might be told what was his after career . It was a queer transition time for schools . The present murderous and absurd system of " examinations " was wholly unknown . Each master got along as well as he could with his boys , and the boys got along as well as they could with the master . There was one head - master , a sub - master , and two others , who were called ushers on the printed catalogue , but were never so called by the boys . Whatever the age of these gentlemen , they were always called " old . " It was " old Dillaway , " " old Gardner , " " old Streeter , " or " old Benjamin . " I now know that the oldest of them was not thirty-five , and that most of them were not twenty-five . We were changed from room to room , seldom staying in one room more than three months , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember one occasion - I was about ten years old - when , to our delight , we were ordered upstairs from the " English room . " We were pleased because it was known that the new master there was very easy , and that the " fellows did as they chose . " It was so , indeed . I recollect my amazement when I saw Hancock cross the room without leave , make a snowball from the snow in a pail , and carry it back ostentatiously to place it on the front of his desk . The snow was provided for use on the stove . From this he then made little snowballs with which to pelt the other boys , all without interruption from the master . But other things went on with the same freedom , which were of more import . I was seated next to Hayward , whom I then met for the first time , and who has since been a lifelong friend . They were reading Cicero s orations . He asked me what I knew about Cicero ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly went into a somewhat elaborate history of his life and analysis of his character as they appeared to a boy of his age .. He has forgotten this , but I remember it perfectly . It seems to me that this extempore private lecture must have lasted the whole afternoon . The poor master made no sort of interference with it , probably glad if two of his scholars were doing nothing worse than talking . But alas , and alas ! this paradise of King Log came to an end in a day or two . This amiable gentleman , whose name I have forgotten , was removed , and Francis Gardner was put in his place . For forty years after , he was master in that school , and is now well known as a distinguished classical teacher and editor . That was his baptism in a schoolmaster 's life , and a baptism of fire it was . We were afterwards intimate friends , and he told me once that his first month , when ho // was bringing those wild-cat boys into order , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , according to the absurd theory of many schools , the whole class was kept together , without any reference to what they knew of the subject . That is to say , we were classed for our knowledge of Latin , and nobody seemed to care how much or how little we knew of arithmetic . I used to do " the sums " and write down the numerical answers in advance , so far as my slate would hold them . I was fond of arithmetic , and so I would be days ahead of the class , which was also the case with Richard Storrs Willis , the eminent musician , who sat by me . He brought to school Kettell 's Specimens of American Poetry , a book of that time , in three closely printed octavo volumes . We read the three volumes through , and a deal of trash there is in them . Still , it was better than doing nothing ; and so I suppose the master thought , for he never interfered . To me this was all a curious double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellows in school , in recess and in the few minutes before school . But as soon as school was over I rushed home , without these companions , to join my brother Nathan , who has been spoken of , for the occupations vastly more important , which I will describe in another chapter . The other fellows would urge us to go down on the wharves , as they did . The fathers of most of them were in mercantile life , for Boston was still largely a shipping town . I can remember asking one of them what we should do on the wharves , with a horrified feeling which I have to this day about any vague future entertainment of which the lines are not indicated . He ' said , " Oh , we can go about the vessels , we can talk with the men . " Perhaps they would be landing molasses , and we could dip straws in the bungholes ; or once a cask had broken open , and the fellows had gathered up brown sugar in their hands . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anywhere else in search of an undefined amusement , I imagine them dipping straws into casks of West India molasses , and then drawing those straws through their mouths . For me and my brother such temptations were idle . Till the last year of my school life we had more attractive work at home . In that year , Edward Renouf , afterward the well-known preacher , told us that he had access to the wood wharves on Front Street , about where the United States Hotel now stands . He said there were no other fellows there . For some reason not known to me , there were no wharfingers or other attendants . With him , and possibly with Atkins , we used to spend hours on those wharves . The Boston reader will please observe that Beach Street means a street on the beach , and that Harrison Avenue , then called Front Street , was the front of that part of the town . Why there were no keepers on those wharves I never asked , and do not know . Whether what we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know . I do know that it was morally and eternally right , because we thought it was . That is one of the queer things about a boy 's conscience . I do not remember that , till the time when I dictate these words , for nearly sixty years , it has once occurred to me to ask whose was the property we used on these occasions , or what the owners would have said to our use of it . But they did not suffer much , if at all . There were great stacks of hemlock bark , which was then coming into use in winter as kindling for anthracite coal . You could take one of these pieces of bark , three or four feet long , bore three holes for masts , and fit this hull with three masts made from shingles or laths . Stiff wrapping-paper made good sails , and writing-books were big enough for topsails . Then you could // sail them from wharf to wharf , on voyages much more satisfactory than the shorter voyages of the Frog Pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable western wind , one might come out at Sallee , on the coast of Morocco , with the location of which we were familiar from the experience of Robinson Cru*oe and Xury . But this is an excursus which belongs rather to the chapter on amusements . The home rule was absolute , and always obeyed , that we must report at home as soon as school was done . This rule undoubtedly interfered with excursions to the wharves , which , indeed , had my father been a shipping merchant , might have been more frequent . School life of itself had little to relieve it of its awful monotony . Saturday was better than the other days , because we all went upstairs into the master 's room to hear the declamations . Every boy spoke from the stage once a month . And here I have heard Willjam Evarts , Fletcher Webster , Mayor Prince , Thomas Dawes , - ah ! and many others who have been distinguished since as orators . Phillips , Hillard , Sumner , and the Emersons were a little before my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them among the treasures of the school . I remember perfectly the first time I spoke . It must have been in September , 1831 . At my mother 's instigation , I spoke a little poem by Tom Moore , long since forgotten by everybody else , which I had learned and spoken at the other school . It is a sort of ode , in which Moore abuses some poor Neapolitan wretches because they had made nothing of a rebellion against the Austrians . As Tom Moore was himself an Irish patriot who had never exposed a finger-nail to be hurt for the Irish cause , I have since thought that his . passion was all blatherskite . However that may be , I stepped on the stage , frightened , but willing to do as I had been told , made my bow , and began . " Ay , down to the dust with them , slaves as they are ! I had been told that I must stamp my foot at the words " down to the dust with them , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid . Naturally enough , all the other boys , one hundred and fifty of them , laughed at such an exhibition of passion from one of the smallest of their number . All the same , I plodded on ; but alas , I came inevitably to the other line , " If there linger one spark of their fire , tread it out ! " and here I had to stamp again , as much to the boys ' amusement as before . I did not get a " good mark " for speaking then , and I never did afterwards . But the exercise did what it was meant to do ; that is , it taught us not to be afraid of the audience . And this , so far as I know , is all of elocution that can be taught , or need be tried for . In college , it was often very droll when the time came for one of the Southern braggarts to speak at an exhibition . For we saw then the same young man who had always blown his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own estimation , - we saw him with his knees shaking under him on the college platform , because he had to speak in the presence of two hundred people . I owe to the public school and to this now despised exercise of declamation that ease before an audience which I share with most New Englanders . This is to say that I owe to it the great pleasure of public speaking when there is anything to say . I think most public men will agree with me that this is one of the most exquisite pleasures of life .
