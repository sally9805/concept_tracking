Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES from Last poems 1895 What know we of the world immense Beyond the narrow ring of sense ? What should we know , who lounge about The house we dwell in , nor find out , Masked by a wall , the secret cell Where the soul 's priests in hiding dwell ? The winding stair that steals aloof To chapel-mysteries ' neath the roof ? It lies about us , yet as far From sense sequestered as a star New launched its wake of fire to trace In secrecies of unprobed space , Whose beacon 's lightning-pinioned spears Might earthward haste a thousand years Nor reach it . So remote seems this World undiscovered , yet it is A neighbor near and dumb as death , So near , we seem to feel the breath Of its hushed habitants as they Pass us unchallenged , night and day . Never could mortal ear nor eye By sound or sign suspect them nigh , Yet why may not some subtler sense Than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Into our own , past hearing , seeing , As men , if once attempered so , Far off each other 's thought can know ? As horses with an instant thrill Measure their rider 's strength of will ? Comes not to all some glimpse that brings Strange sense of sense-escaping things ? Wraiths some transfigured nerve divines ? Approaches , premonitions , signs , Voices of Ariel that die out In the dim No Man 's Land of Doubt ? Are these Night 's dusky birds ? Are these Phantasmas of the silences Outer or inner ?  --  rude heirlooms From grovellers in the cavern-glooms , Who in unhuman Nature saw Misshapen foes with tusk and claw , And with those night-fears brute and blind Peopled the chaos of their mind , Which , in ungovernable hours , Still make their bestial lair in ours ? Were they , or were they not ? Yes ; no ; Uncalled they come , unbid they go , And leave us fumbling in a doubt Whether within us or without The spell of this illusion be That witches us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And hath such wonder-working skill That what we deemed most solid-wrought Turns a mere figment of our thought , Which when we grasp at in despair Our fingers find vain semblance there , For Psyche seeks a corner-stone Firmer than aught to matter known . Is it illusion ? Dream-stuff ? Show Made of the wish to have it so ? ' T were something , even though this were all : So the poor prisoner , on his wall Long gazing , from the chance designs Of crack , mould , weather-stain , refines New and new pictures without cease , Landscape , or saint , or altar-piece : But these are Fancy 's common brood Hatched in the nest of solitude ; This is Dame Wish 's hourly trade , By our rude sires a goddess made . Could longing , though its heart broke , give Trances in which we chiefly live ? Moments that darken all beside , Tearfully radiant as a bride ? Beckonings of bright escape , of wings Purchased with loss of baser things ? Blithe truancies from all control Of Hyl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct led , Draws from its womb a slender thread , And drops , confiding that the breeze Will waft it to unpastured trees : So the brain spins itself , and so Swings boldly off in hope to blow Across some tree of knowledge , fair With fruitage new , none else shall share : Sated with wavering in the Void , It backward climbs , so best employed , And , where no proof is nor can be , Seeks refuge with Analogy ; Truth 's soft half-sister , she may tell Where lurks , seld-sought , the other 's well . With metaphysic midges sore , My Thought seeks comfort at her door , And , at her feet a suppliant cast , Evokes a spectre of the past . Not such as shook the knees of Saul , But winsome , golden-gay withal ,  --  Two fishes in a globe of glass , That pass , and waver , and re-pass , And lighten that way , and then this , Silent as meditation is . With a half-humorous smile I see In this their aimless industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funeral urns , This ever-seek and never-find , A mocking image of my mind . But not for this I bade you climb Up from the darkening deeps of time : Help me to tame these wild day-mares That sudden on me unawares . Fish , do your duty , as did they Of the Black Island far away In life 's safe places ,  --  far as you From all that now I see or do . You come , embodied flames , as when I knew you first , nor yet knew men ; Your gold renews my golden days , Your splendor all my loss repays . ' T is more than sixty years ago Since first I watched your to-and-fro ; Two generations come and gone From silence to oblivion , With all their noisy strife and stress Lulled in the grave 's forgivingness , While you unquenchably survive Immortal , almost more alive . I watched you then a curious boy , Who in your beauty found full joy , And , by no problem-debts distrest , Sate at life 's board a welcome guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; But Property 's dividing line No hint of dispossession drew On any map my simplesse knew ; O golden age , not yet dethroned ! What made me happy , that I owned ; You were my wonders , you my Lars , In darkling days my sun and stars , And over you entranced I hung , ( Too young to know that I was young . ) Gazing with still unsated bliss , My fancies took some shape like this : " I have my world , and so have you , A tiny universe for two , A bubble by the artist blown , Scarcely more fragile than our own , Where you have all a whale could wish , Happy as Eden 's primal fish . Manna is dropt you thrice a day From some kind heaven not far away , And still you snatch its softening crumbs , Nor , more than we , think whence it comes . No toil seems yours but to explore Your cloistered realm from shore to shore ; Sometimes you trace its limits round , Sometimes its limpid depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds at set of day ; Erelong you whirl with sudden whim Off to your globe 's most distant rim , Where , greatened by the watery lens , Methinks no dragon of the fens Flashed huger scales against the sky , Roused by Sir Bevis or Sir Guy , And the one eye that meets my view , Lidless and strangely largening , too , Like that of conscience in the dark , Seems to make me its single mark . What a benignant lot is yours That have an own All-out-of-doors , No words to spell , no sums to do , No Nepos and no parlyvoo ! How happy you without a thought Of such cross things as Must and Ought ,  --  I too the happiest of boys To see and share your golden joys !

Diminished creature , I no more Find Fairyland beside my door , But for each moment 's pleasure pay With the quart d'heure of Rabelais ! I watch you in your crystal sphere , And wonder if you see and hear Those shapes and sounds that stir the wide Conjecture of a world outside ; In your pent lives , as we in ours , Have you surmises dim of powers , Of presences obscurely shown , Of lives a riddle to your own , Just on the senses ' outer verge , Where sense-nerves into soul-nerves merge , Where we conspire our own deceit Confederate in deft Fancy 's feat , And the fooled brain befools the eyes With pageants woven of its own lies ? But are they lies ? Why more than those Phantoms that startle your repose , Half seen , half heard , then flit away , And leave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Know to be substance ; tell me why My visions , like those haunting you , May not be as substantial too . Alas , who ever answer heard From fish , and dream-fish too ? Absurd ! Your consciousness I half divine , But you are wholly deaf to mine . Go , I dismiss you ; ye have done All that ye could ; our silk is spun : Dive back into the deep of dreams , Where what is real is what seems ! Yet I shall fancy till my grave Your lives to mine a lesson gave ; If lesson none , an image , then , Impeaching self-conceit in men Who put their confidence alone In what they call the Seen and Known . How seen ? How known ? As through your glass Our wavering apparitions pass Perplexingly , then subtly wrought To some quite other thing by thought . Here shall my resolution be : The shadow of the mystery Is haply wholesomer for eyes That cheat us to be overwise , And I am happy in my right To love God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : TURNER 'S OLD TMRAIRE UNDER A FIGURE SYMBOLIZING THE CHURCH from Last poems 1895 Thou wast the fairest of all man-made things ; The breath of heaven bore up thy cloudy wings , And , patient in their triple rank , The thunders crouched about thy flank , Their black lips silent with the doom of kings . The storm-wind loved to rock him in thy pines , And swell thy vans with breath of great designs ; Long-wildered pilgrims of the main By thee relaid their course again , Whose prow was guided by celestial signs . How didst thou trample on tumultuous seas , Or , like some basking sea-beast stretched at ease , Let the bull-fronted surges glide Caressingly along thy side , Like glad hounds leaping by the huntsman 's knees ! Heroic feet , with fire of genius shod , In battle 's ecstasy thy deck have trod , While from their touch a fulgor ran Through plank and spar , from man to man , Welding thee to a thunderbolt of God . Now a black demon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , dismantled dream , And all thy desecrated bulk Must landlocked lie , a helpless hulk , To gather weeds in the regardless stream . Woe ' s me , from Ocean 's sky-horizoned air To this ! Better , the flame-cross still aflare , Shot-shattered to have met thy doom Where thy last lightnings cheered the gloom , Than here be safe in dangerless despair . Thy drooping symbol to the flagstaff clings , Thy rudder soothes the tide to lazy rings , Thy thunders now but birthdays greet , Thy planks forget the martyrs ' feet , Thy masts what challenges the sea-wind brings . Thou a mere hospital , where human wrecks , Like winter-flies , crawl those renownd decks , Ne'er trodden save by captive foes , And wonted sternly to impose God 's will and thine on bowed imperial necks ! Shall nevermore , engendered of thy fame , A new sea-eagle heir thy conqueror name , And with commissioned talons wrench From thy supplanter 's grimy clench His sheath of steel , his wings of smoke and flame ? This shall the pleased eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God long even as we ; Earth listens for his wings ; the Fates Expectant lean ; Faith cross-propt waits , And the tired waves of Thought 's insurgent sea . 1888 . Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : ST . MICHAEL THE WEIGHER from Last poems 1895 Stood the tall Archangel weighing All man 's dreaming , doing , saying , All the failure and the pain , All the triumph and the gain , In the unimagined years , Full of hopes , more full of tears , Since old Adam 's hopeless eyes Backward searched for Paradise , And , instead , the flame-blade saw Of inexorable Law . Waking , I beheld him there , With his fire-gold , flickering hair , In his blinding armor stand , And the scales were in his hand : Mighty were they , and full well They could poise both heaven and hell . " Angel , " asked I humbly then , " Weighest thou the souls of men ? That thine office is , I know . " " Nay , " he answered me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the power of choice began , In the world , of good or ill . " Then I waited and was still . In one scale I saw him place All the glories of our race , Cups that lit Belshazzar 's feast , Gems , the lightning of the East , Kublai 's sceptre , Csar 's sword , Many a poet 's golden word , Many a skill of science , vain To make men as gods again . In the other scale he threw Things regardless , outcast , few , Martyr-ash , arena sand , Of St. Francis ' cord a strand , Beechen cups of men whose need Fasted that the poor might feed , Disillusions and despairs Of young saints with grief-grayed hairs , Broken hearts that brake for Man . Marvel through my pulses ran Seeing then the beam divine Swiftly on this hand decline , While Earth 's splendor and renown Mounted light as thistle-down. 1888 . Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : A VALENTINE from Last poems 1895 Let others wonder what fair face Upon their path shall shine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maiden shape of tenderest grace To be their Valentine . Let other hearts with tremor sweet One secret wish enshrine That Fate may lead their happy feet Fair Julia in the lane to meet To be their Valentine . But I , far happier , am secure ; I know the eyes benign , The face more beautiful and pure Than Fancy 's fairest portraiture That mark my Valentine . More than when first I singled thee , This only prayer is mine ,  --  That , in the years I yet shall see , As , darling , in the past , thou ' lt be My happy Valentine . Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : AN APRIL BIRTHDAY  --  AT SEA from Last poems 1895 On this wild waste , where never blossom came , Save the white wind-flower in the billow 's cap , Or those pale disks of momentary flame , Loose petals dropped from Dian 's careless lap , What far-fetched influence all my fancy fills With singing birds and dancing daffodils ? Why , ' t is her day whom jocund April brought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is her vision lights my lonely thought , Even as a rose that opes its hushed surprise In sick men 's chambers , with its glowing breath Plants Summer at the glacier edge of Death . Gray sky , sea gray as mossy stones on graves ;  --  Anon comes April in her jollity ; And dancing down the bleak vales ' tween the waves , Makes them green glades for all her flowers and me . The gulls turn thrushes , charmed are sea and sky By magic of my thought , and know not why . Ah , but I know , for never April 's shine , Nor passion gust of rain , nor all her flowers Scattered in haste , were seen so sudden fine As she in various mood , on whom the powers Of happiest stars in fair conjunction smiled To bless the birth of April 's darling child . Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : LOVE AND THOUGHT from Last poems 1895 What hath Love with Thought to do ? Still at variance are the two . Love is sudden , Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comes as swift , as swiftly goes , And his mark as surely knows . Thought is lumpish , Thought is slow , Weighing long ' tween yes and no ; When dear Love is dead and gone , Thought comes creeping in anon , And , in his deserted nest , Sits to hold the crowner 's quest . Since we love , what need to think ? Happiness stands on a brink Whence too easy ' t is to fall Whither 's no return at all ; Have a care , half-hearted lover , Thought would only push her over ! Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : THE NOBLER LOVER from Last poems 1895 If he be a nobler lover , take him ! You in you I seek , and not myself ; Love with men ' s what women choose to make him , Seraph strong to soar , or fawn-eyed elf : All I am or can , your beauty gave it , Lifting me a moment nigh to you , And my bit of heaven , I fain would save it  --  Mine I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take of me is yours to serve you , All I give , you gave to me before ; Let him win you ! If I but deserve you , I keep all you grant to him and more : You shall make me dare what others dare not , You shall keep my nature pure as snow , And a light from you that others share not Shall transfigure me where'er I go . Let me be your thrall ! However lowly Be the bondsman 's service I can do , Loyalty shall make it high and holy ; Naught can be unworthy , done for you . Men shall say , " A lover of this fashion Such an icy mistress well beseems . " Women say , " Could we deserve such passion , We might be the marvel that he dreams . " Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : ON HEARING A SONATA OF BEETHOVEN 'S PLAYED IN THE NEXT ROOM from Last poems 1895 Unseen Musician , thou art sure to please , For those same notes in happier days I heard Poured by dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me delight the keys : Ah me , to strong illusions such as these What are Life 's solid things ? The walls that gird Our senses , lo , a casual scent or word Levels , and ' t is the soul that hears and sees ! Play on , dear girl , and many be the years Ere some grayhaired survivor sit like me And , for thy largess pay a meed of tears Unto another who , beyond the sea Of Time and Change , perhaps not sadly hears A music in this verse undreamed by thee ! Christmas , 1885 . Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : VERSES INTENDED TO GO WITH A POSSET DISH TO MY DEAR LITTLE GODDAUGHTER , 1882 from Last poems 1895 In good old times , which means , you know , The time men wasted long ago , And we must blame our brains or mood If that we squander seems less good , In those blest days when wish was act And fancy dreamed itself to fact , Godfathers used to fill with guineas The cups they gave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catechism . No millioner , poor I fill up With wishes my more modest cup , Though had I Amalthea 's horn It should be hers the newly born . Nay , shudder not ! I should bestow it So brimming full she could n't blow it . Wishes are n't horses : true , but still There are worse roadsters than goodwill . And so I wish my darling health , And just to round my couplet , wealth , With faith enough to bridge the chasm ' Twixt Genesis and Protoplasm , And bear her o'er life 's current vext From this world to a better next , Where the full glow of God puts out Poor reason 's farthing candle , Doubt . I 've wished her healthy , wealthy , wise , But since there 's room for countless wishes In these old-fashioned posset dishes , I 'll wish her from my plenteous store Of those commodities two more , Her father 's wit , veined through and through With tenderness that Watts ( but whew ! Celia 's aflame , I mean no stricture On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' t is the soul Of all I 've dropt into the bowl , Her mother 's beauty  --  nay , but two So fair at once would never do . Then let her but the half possess , Troy was besieged ten years for less . Now if there 's any truth in Darwin , And we from what was , all we are win , I simply wish the child to be A sample of Heredity , Enjoying to the full extent Life 's best , the Unearned Increment Which Fate her Godfather to flout Gave him in legacies of gout . Thus , then , the cup is duly filled ; Walk steady , dear , lest all be spilled . Lowell , James Russell , 1819-1891 : ON A BUST OF GENERAL GRANT from Last poems 1895 Strong , simple , silent are the steadfast laws That sway this universe , of none withstood , Unconscious of man 's outcries or applause , Or what man deems his evil or his good ; And when the Fates ally them with a cause That wallows in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reefs and sands Of shallow counsels , this way , that way , tost , Strength , silence , simpleness , of these three strands They twist the cable shall the world hold fast To where its anchors clutch the bed-rock of the Past . Strong , simple , silent , therefore such was he Who helped us in our need ; the eternal law That who can saddle Opportunity Is God 's elect , though many a mortal flaw May minish him in eyes that closely see , Was verified in him : what need we say Of one who made success where others failed , Who , with no light save that of common day , Struck hard , and still struck on till Fortune quailed , But that ( so sift the Norns ) a desperate van Ne'er fell at last to one who was not wholly man . A face all prose where Time 's benignant haze Softens no raw edge yet , nor makes all fair With the beguiling light of vanished days ; This is relentless granite , bleak and bare , Roughhewn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naught for dreams , The Present 's hard uncompromising light Accents all vulgar outlines , flaws , and seams , Yet vindicates some pristine natural right O'ertopping that hereditary grace Which marks the gain or loss of some time-fondled race . So Marius looked , methinks , and Cromwell so , Not in the purple born , to those they led Nearer for that and costlier to the foe , New moulders of old forms , by nature bred The exhaustless life of manhood 's seeds to show , Let but the ploughshare of portentous times Strike deep enough to reach them where they lie : Despair and danger are their fostering climes , And their best sun bursts from a stormy sky : He was our man of men , nor would abate The utmost due manhood could claim of fate . Nothing ideal , a plain-people 's man At the first glance , a more deliberate ken Finds type primeval , theirs in whose veins ran Such blood as quelled the dragon in his den , Made harmless fields , and better worlds began : He came grim-silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in his master-grip Our sword flashed joy ; no skill of words could breed Such sure conviction as that close-clamped lip ; He slew our dragon , nor , so seemed it , knew He had done more than any simplest man might do . Yet did this man , war-tempered , stern as steel Where steel opposed , prove soft in civil sway ; The hand hilt-hardened had lost tact to feel The world 's base coin , and glozing knaves made prey Of him and of the entrusted Commonweal ; So Truth insists and will not be denied . We turn our eyes away , and so will Fame , As if in his last battle he had died Victor for us and spotless of all blame , Doer of hopeless tasks which praters shirk , One of those still plain men that do the world 's rough work .
