txt The Secretary of War has seen fit through Mr. DEFER- to make a statement clearly intended to meet the scathing criticism to which he has been subjected . He is not successful . The criticism has found its way to the public through the press . It did not originate in the press , but from competent and often official observers in the camps where the effects of Mr. ALGER 'S management unfolded themselves . The Secretary seems to think that he is accused of not doing enough . He is mistaken . He is accused of doing far too much which he ought not to have done at all , and of doing very badly some of the most important things he had to do . No one needs to be told  --  certainly Mr. DEPEW does not  --  how many troops were raised , how many hats and shoes they required , or how many miles they were transported . Every one knows that the task imposed on the War Department was a vast , difficult , complex , and trying one . Mr. ALGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . But he was expected to intrust it to the best men that could be found , and to supervise and aid their efforts with judgment , energy , and absolute fidelity to duty without regard to personal or political interests . These things he has not done . In his statement to Mr. DEPEW he does not even pretend to have done them , and practically confesses that he has not done them . He says that " many staff officers from all the departments had been promoted and ordered to the field , " leaving " a reduced force . " This of itself was a great blunder . The trained men were needed in the departments , and not in the field , and the force should have been increased , net reduced . It was much more urgent to have the work of preparation of the troops for the field thoroughly and carefully done by men who knew how to do it than it was to add to the officers in field service , of whom there has been no lack . The business branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent their lives in them . Why ? So far as motives can he inferred from acts , in order to make place for political favorites , who have shown by the character of their work that they were unfit for it . The very best men would have been none too good ; some very inferior ones were taken Instead . It was a characteristic piece of machine politics , and it cost the Nation thousands of precious lives . Can Mr. ALGER point to a single instance of a man taken from civil life because of proved and eminent fitness as an organizer and administrator of difficult work in transportation or supply , and set to do that kind of work for the Government ? Not one . The trained officials were sent away ; incompetent politicians were dumped into the service ; able men , equal to the arduous task , were ignored . This is the gravamen of the offense of Mr. ALGER , and the offense is heinous . He tries to throw the blame on field officers or on the unfortunate volunteers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ashamed of himself . The supervision of field officers in order that the troops may be saved from the consequence of their own ignorance or carelessness ip one of the chief duties of the War Department . It had a corps of experienced officers devoted to that work . Some of them were promoted to command ; civilians were added ; the trained members did well , and where they were stationed there was the minimum of trouble . Elsewhere disease was actually invited , and its ravages were sure and terrible . We shall not go Into the minor features of Mr. ALGER 'S statement . Some of them are impertinent . Others are misleading as his account of the Santiago horrors and those of the transport ships . He says that if he could send details to Mr. DEPEW they " would bewilder " him . Mr. ALGER speaks from experience . The work of the department has bewildered him to the verge of insanity . It has been far too much for his feeble brain . ' That would have been so stupendous and shocking havoc in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame , he would flee to private life . Since he will not he should be dismissed .
