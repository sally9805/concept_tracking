IV. - REVELATION AND FAITH . IE term " revelation " is commonly used to denote religious truth , supernaturally communicated , as distinguished from the knowledge of God obtained by natural means . In this use of terms , revealed religion stands in contrast with natural religion . But all our knowledge of God , through whatever medium derived , is from one ultimate source . That source is a revelation , or disclosure , which God makes of himself . And all truth respecting things divine and supernatural is apprehended by faith . Faith is the word descriptive of the mind 's reception of it . Hence , in speaking of faith , and illustrating its nature , we may fitly take into view the fundamental truths of natural theology as well as Christianity . It is often said , and the same thing is more often insinuated , that faith is something independent of evidence . It is looked upon as belief for which no reasons - that is to say , no valid reasons - are to be assigned . The individual himself , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nothing that he can say constitutes an adequate ground of conviction for other minds than his own . One occasion of this impression is the failure to distinguish between the sources and the proofs of religion . The genesis of religion as a fact of experience is one thing ; the proofs of its reasonableness and the vindication of faith against skepticism are another . The genesis of religion is primarily from within , and not from without . As Aristotle styled man a political animal , it may be affirmed with even more emphasis that man is a religious being . Religion is not something foreign to his nature , imported into it from the external world , inculcated as a piece of information by his elders ; nor is it , in its origin , an inference from the marks of design stamped upon things about him . The roots of religion are not in any process of the understanding . The idea that religious faith is a delusion of the imagination , a superstition engendered by dreams or by the fancied sight of ghosts of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too deeply embedded in human nature , it is too powerful a factor in the history of mankind , tobe accounted for by any of these superficial conjectures . Faith in the Being above us , the Author of our being , springs out of the sense of dependence and the feeling of obligation and of law ,  --  law felt as the manifested will of another , even the Infinite Spirit in whom we live ,  --  and it is born of that yearning for a higher fellowship with him which alone can fill the soul with peace and joy . This primal revelation of God in the soul is the fountain-head of religion . However vague this impression may be in the beginning , however obscure the perception , and however dim it is rendered by the absorbing quest for earthly pleasure , it is the light of all our seeing . There is a ; ziszs in the souls of men - a tendency to " seek God , if haply they might feel after him , and find him . " This implied recognition of the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in unison with the most profound philosophers of all ages , expresses it - " the propensity to religion proceeds . " Here is the germ of our distinct and defined religious convictions . The latent anticipations of our nature are met and matched by the manifestation of God in the material world , in history , or the providential succession of events , and in Christ . These manifestations constitute the objective proofs of religion . They are real proofs . Drawn out into explicit statements , they constitute the arguments for Christian theism . It is true that no constraining efficacy belongs to them . But the same is to be said of all reasoning that is not strictly demonstrative . No other interpretation of the phenomena is so satisfactory to the unbiased reason of thoughtful inquirers . At the same time , another interpretation of the phenomena is always possible . Here it is that the primal disclosure of God in consciousness , the native " propensity to religion , " when it is not dulled or stifled , avails to banish doubt . Let it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which we are inwardly drawn to God , correlated as it is to objective manifestations , constitutes an argument for the verity to which it points . The great church historian Neander , whose living experience of religion opened to his mind its true philosophy , has these noble words respecting Socrates : " Socrates stands at the head of those men of supreme distinction in the world 's history who , in the times when faith in anything divine and in objective truth has been shaken and shattered by the sophistry of an understanding that disintegrates all things and the power of an all-embracing spirit of denial , have led men back into the depths of 720 // their soul which is akin to God , and have caused them to find in the immediate consciousness of the true and the divine an assurance lifted above all doubts . From the speculative questions , in answering which the spirit ever anew tires itself out , he turned their glance within upon their own moral nature . From the external world he called the spirit back to its own inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to be at home . It is the weighty know thyself ' which the oracle at Delphi praised as the characteristic merit of Socrates . The great impulse that went forth from him worked on for centuries , and in later times was continually renewed by the agency of men who carried down his spirit to after ages ; and this influence it was which directed attention to that in man which is immediately related to God and to the moral element in the human soul , as well as from this , as the starting-point , to the religious . " What skeptical minds need in this age , as in every other , is to remember that man has a soul as well as an understanding . Conscience , sensibility , affection , aspiration are a deep and indestructible part of human nature . As there is a soul , there is a life of the soul . There are presages and inchoate beliefs native to human beings , existing by their own right , entitled to respect , needing , it may be , light and direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is to fling away that which is most precious in man . In the depths of the spirit religion has its birth . It is a flame kindled in the soul by its divine Author . Keeping in mind that the grounds of faith are in the connection of the subjective and objective manifestations of God , each throwing light upon the other and each serving to corroborate the other , we may glance at certain leading proofs of theism which thus address us from without . Nature is pervaded by an intellectual element . That nature is intelligible is the prime assumption in all study of natural phenomena . As Professor Huxley remarks , in substance , at the beginning of a recent essay on the progress of science in the last half-century , to discern the rationality of nature is the comprehensive aim of science . This affinity of nature with our own minds , this mind in nature , implies an intelligent author of nature . It is possible to conclude otherwise , but not reasonable or natural . Materialistic atheism must begin with the impossible task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness and thought with the molecular movements of the brain . It must build a bridge which can never be built . The doctrine of the conservation of energy affords no help in this direction . Clerk Maxwell , one of its most authoritative ex pounders , says : " There is action and reaction between body and soul , but it is not of a kind in which energy passes from one to the other - as , when a man pulls a trigger , it is the gunpowder that projects the bullet , or when a pointsman shunts a train , it is the rails that bear the thrust . " " The conservation of energy , when applied to living beings , leads to the conclusion that the soul of an animal is not , like the mainspring of a watch , the motive power of the body , but that its function is rather that of a steersman of a vessel - not to produce , but to regulate and direct the animal powers . ' ' No modern discoveries have weakened the force of the argument from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher and the peasant . Evolution is a method , not a cause . It does nothing to account for the ongin of things or the energy exerted in all progressive development . " It is plain , " says Mr. Sully , " that every doctrine of evolution must assume some definite initial arrangement , which is supposed to contain the possibilities of the order which we find to be evolved , and no other possibility . " Until that initial arrangement , involving all that issues out of it , is accounted for , not a step is taken towards explaining the world . The outcome of all the past history of nature is undeniably an orderly system - a cosmos . To introduce an element of " chance " in the succession of steps leading to it is a philosophical absurdity . Such a meaningless notion might seem to be countenanced in the terms used to describe the promiscuous variation which was a part of Mr. Darwin 's theory . But even Mr. Darwin had no thought of denying that there are laws of variability . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation is profound . " This , of course , implies that there are such laws . The constitution of the being that varies is an essential factor , and , with Mr. Darwin , the prime factor in producing the variations which constitute the materials on which the so-called selective agency of nature acts . But according to many evolutionists , like Asa Gray , variation moves along definite lines and its range is limited . If this were not the fact , as the physiologist Dr. W. B. Carpenter cogently argues , the chances to be overcome in building up an organized species are infinite . " On the hypothesis of ' natural selection ' among aimless variations , " says Dr. Carpenter , " I think that it could be shown that the probability is infinitely small that the progressive modifications required in the structure of each individual organ to convert a reptile into a bird could have taken place without disturbing the required harmony in their combined action ; nothing but intentional variations being competent to bring such a result . " The proof of this pre-arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following definite lines of advance . The evidence of final causes is not impaired . We simply , ' to use the language of Whewell , transfer the notion of design and end from the region of facts to that of laws ' ; that is , from the particular cases to the general plan . In this general plan the production of man is comprehended . In him , the final product , the meaning and aim of the entire scheme of creation are fully discovered . " There are naturalists , among them Mr. Wallace , who are in more full accord with Darwin 's particular view , and ascribe more to " natural selection . " Generally speaking , even these are not so rash as to undertake to rule out teleology , and to explain the phenomena of vegetable and animal life on a mechanical theory which excludes design . How inadequate the mechanical view is , regarded as an explanation of nature , has been demonstrated by Lotze and other philosophers , who are not in the least averse to the doctrine of a genetic relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wider extension of evolutionary theory . It is easy for naturalists to become absorbed in the search after the links of causal connection which bind together the phenomena of nature . There is an exposure , the antipode of that false use of the idea of final causes which stifled iiiductive investigation , and against which Bacon protested . But even to naturalists of the present day , who are chargeable with this error , the teleological aspect of nature , the design that runs through all , will at times come home with an irresistible force of impression . Darwin is himself an example . The Duke of Argyll , speaking of the phenomena of nature , which " our mind recognizes as mental , " writes as follows : " I have the best reason to know that Darwin himself was very far from being insensible to the evidence of this truth . In the year preceding his death he did me the honor to call upon me in London ; and in the course of our conversation , I said to him that to me it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so laboriously traced and described to any other agency than that of mind . His reply was one which has left an ineffaceable impression upon me ; not from its words only , but from the tone and manner in which it was given . XVell , ' he said , that impression has often come upon me with overpowering force . But then , at other times , it all seems - ; and then he l ) assed his hands across his eyes , as if to indicate the passing of a vision out of sight . " The admission of a first cause - that is , of a cause which is not itself an effect - is unavoidable unless the principle of causation is to be utterly discredited . The agnostic theory of an " Unknowable " is self-destructive . To ascribe to the infinite being fower is open to whatever objection is imagined to lie against the ascription to that being of intelligence . It is assumed that there is a revelation of *ower : because of this revelation the existence of that being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clear . How shall we be assured of the moral attributes of God , of his holiness and love ? We are in a world that abounds in suffering . How shall this be reconciled with benevolence in the Creator ? Much weight is to be given to the consideration of the effects flowing of necessity from a system of general laws , notwithstanding the advantages of such a system . The suggestions relative to the occasions and beneficent offices of pain and death , which are presented by such writers as James Martineau , in his recent work , " A Study of Religion , " are helpful . Especially is the fact of moral evil to be taken into the account when a solution is sought for the problem of physical evil , its concomitant and so often its consequence . Let it be freely granted , however , that no explanations that man can devise avail to clear up altogether the mystery of evil . It is only a small part of the system of things that falls under our observation in the present stage of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by showing a preponderance of good over evil in the arrangements of nature , that the mind is set at rest . There is no need of an argument of this kind . There is need of faith , but that faith is rational . We find in our own moral constitution a direct and full attestation of the goodness of God . Our moral constitution is affirmed , by a class of evolutionists , to be a gradual growth from a foundation of animal instincts . Let this speculation go for what it may be worth . The same theory is advanced respecting the human intellect . Yet the intellect is assumed to be an organ of knowledge . There is no avoiding this conclusion ; else all science , evolutionary science included , is a castle in the air . If the intellect is entitled to trust , so equally is the moral nature . Are the righteousness and goodness of God called in question on the ground of perplexing facts observed in the structure and course of the world ? Where do we get the qualifications for raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be from ideals of character which we find within ourselves , and from the supreme place accorded to the moral law which is written on the heart . But whence come these moral ideals ? Who enthroned the law of righteousness in the heart ? Who inscribed on the tablets of the soul the assertion of the inviolable authority of right and the absolute worth of love as a motive of action ? In a // word , our moral constitution is itself given us of God , and if it be not the reflection of his character , it is , for aught we can say , a false light ; in which case all the verdicts resting upon it , with all the queries of skepticism as to the goodness of God , may be illusive . The arraignment of the character of God on the ground of alleged imperfections in nature , or of seemingly harsh and unjust occurrences in the course of events , is therefore suicidal . The revelation of God 's character is in our moral constitution . The voice within us , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of love , is his voice . There we learn what he approves , what he requires , what he rewards . When this proposition is denied , we lose our footing . We cut away the ground for trust in our own capacity for moral criticism . Man has not one originating cause and the world another . The existence and supreme authority of conscience imply that in the ongoing of the world righteousness holds sway . If there is a moral purpose underlying the course of things , then a righteous being is at the helm . What confusion , worse than chaos , in the idea that while man himself is bound to be actuated by a moral purpose , the universe in which he is to act his part exists for no moral end , and that through the course of things no moral purpose runs ! It is not my object in these remarks to draw out in full the proofs of the existence and the moral attributes of God . It is rather to illustrate the relation in which these proofs stand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul , which are the ultimate subjective source of religion , and on which the living appreciation of the revelation of God in external nature is contingent . Let it be observed , moreover , that these native spiritual experiences of dependence , of obligation , and accountableness , of hunger for fellowship with the Infinite One , wherein religion takes its rise and has its root , are themselves to be counted as proofs of the reality of the object implied in them . They are significant of the end for which man was made . They presuppose God . It is true that all our knowledge rests ultimately on an act of faith which finds no warrant in any process of reasoning . We can not climb to this trust on the steps of a syllogism . We are obliged to start with a confidence in the veracity of our intellectual faculties ; and this we have to assume persistently in the whole work of acquiring knowledge . Without this assumption we can no more infer anything or know anything than a bird can fly in a vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds , which implies and includes faith in the Author of the mind . This primitive faith in ourselves is moral in its nature . So of all that truth which is justly called self-evident . No arguments are to be adduced for it . In every process of reasoning it is presupposed . We can prove nothing except on the basis of propositions that admit of no proof . But if we leave out of account the domain of self-evident truth , which is ground common to both religion and science , religious beliefs , as far as they are sound , are based on adequate evidence . It may be well , however , to explain somewhat more definitely what is denoted by faith ; to say enough , at least , to guard against certain misconceptions . At the opening of one of the noblest passages in the New Testament , faith is defined as " the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen . " A more correct rendering of the verse would be , " The firm assurance of things hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that is , of their reality . Faith makes real to the mind objects of hope ; things in the future ; it makes real , also , things not cognizable by the senses . It takes these things out of a kind of dreamland ; and , further , it gives to them a substantial being , so that they exercise a due control in the shaping of conduct . It is superfluous to remark that faith creates nothing ; makes nothing different from what it is already . This is evident of that sort of faith which is exercised in relation to mundane affairs . I believe in the virtue of a medicine ; but , if my faith is well founded , the virtue is in the medicine quite independently of any idea or feeling of mine in regard to it . I believe in a physician ; but my belief does not give him the knowledge and the tact in *ich I con-* fide . He is just the same - just as competent , or incompetent , as the case may be-whether I trust in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith of a discoverer . Columbus believed that he could reach a continent by sailing westward on a path which Europeans had never taken . His faith urged him onward , week after week , and month after month , never turning his prow , regardless of the discontent of his men , until faith was rewarded by sight . He descried at last the green shores and heard the singing of the birds . The poet Schiller , indeed , referring to the ardor of his faith , says that had Columbus not found a continent he would have created one . In truth , if he had not found the land , had there been no real object answering to his belief his faith would have been merely a fancy . It is equally obvious that nothing is added to the sum of religious truth by believing in it ; nothing is subtracted by indifference or disbelief . As well might one think of creating or destroying the visible universe by opening or shutting the organ of vision . When a per- // son comes to believe in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that being with whom " is no variableness , neither shadow of turning . " He simply discerns that which he had failed to see before : he finds God . No one imagines that the Prodigal Son created his father by returning to him . The forsaken father was always there , waiting for him . Faith in the gospel is simply the practical acknowledgment of a fact . The Apostle Paul reminds his readers that they have not to climb into heaven and bring Christ down , or to descend into the grave and bring him up . He has already lived among men , and he has risen . The victory of Jesus Christ over sin and over death is a finished achievement . Faith is that recognition of the fact which carries in it appropriate fruits in feeling and conduct . No one has understood better what faith is than Martin Luther , himself a great believer . " By faith , " says Luther , " man sees into the heart of God . " " God , " says Luther , " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oppressed , and the desperate , and of those that are brought even to nothing ; and his nature is to exalt the humble , to feed the hungry , to give sight to the blind , to comfort the miserable , the afflicted , the bruised , the broken-hearted , to justify sinners , to quicken the dead , and to save the very desperate and damned . For he is an almighty Creator , and maketh all things of nothing . " Luther was not wrong in considering that the one essential thing in religion is faith . For without faith there is no real approach to God ; and what is religion but converse or communion with Li*d ? Religion is a relation of person to person . The reveries of Pantheism are not religion in the proper sense of the word . He that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is the rewarder of those who seek after him . To speak to a being in whose existence one has no belief is little short of lunacy . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something held to be void of consciousness , incapable of hearing , is to bid farewell to common sense . So of the character of God ; it has no practical influence on a man 's thoughts or conduct except as he believes in it . Luther , moreover , was right , and only followed the Scriptures when he insisted that the source of all wrong-doing as well as of irreligion is the lack of faith . If men believed in God and in a hereafter as truly and as vividly as they believe in the reality of material things around them , temptations would be stripped of their power , sinful pleasure would have no chance as a rival of the higher good . Men sin because they mistake shadow for substance , and substance for shadow . They deify creatures of God , believing in them with an idolatrous faith . Not seeing them in contrast with an equally clear view of things of imperishable value , they magnify their worth . They are drawn to them by an irresistible attraction , because they are cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slake the thirst of the spirit for the moment , striving to forget that " whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again . " We started with the thesis that the truths of religion rest upon good and sufficient evidence . Comparing these truths with well-grounded beliefs of a different species , where the things believed are within the circle of every-day life , we shall find that the first difference is in the kindof proofs presented , not in the comparative degree of weight that belongs to them in the two cases . As regards religious truth the proofs are not experimental . We can not apply to them the tests of the measuring-rod and the crucible , and other criteria , of a tangible kind , which appeal to the senses . The evidence is , to say the least , equally xveighty , but is not of the same sort . Among recent theological writers no one has set forth this not unfamiliar distinction with more force and originality than Mozley . Even in astronomy , not only is the reasoning in great part of a demonstrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the advantage of being verified by the observed fulfillment of prediction . The eclipse draws a curtain over the disk of the sun at the very moment set down in the almanac . The comet makes its appearance , fulfilling with absolute punctuality a prophecy recorded centuries before . It may be doubted whether astronomical truth - truth so amazing and almost bewildering in its nature - would gain the assent of the common mind were it not verified to everybody in this visible and astonishing way . Now the only thing in religion analogous to these external tests is the miracle , including prophecy , which is one form of miracle . The miracle is a sign , a kind of experimental proof , an appeal to the senses as an aid to faith . Jesus wrought miracles only where there was already a germinant faith . He said to Thomas , " Blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed . " Jesus manifested himself to the senses of the doubting disciple and that disciple believed . It is a higher thing to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal probability of the fact is thrown into the scale and avails to carry the mind 's assent . It is therefore an error , either undesigned or intentional , of skeptical writers to describe faith as an arbitrary , groundless acceptance of doctrines in behalf of which no proof is possible . This is to confound faith and credulity . It makes religion the equivalent of superstition . Mon // taigne , in his " Essays , " in his genial way of avoiding whatever might give offense or raise a dispute , affords an example of this practice of relegating faith to a province quite apart from reason . The open rejection of religious truth is avoided by this urbane method of remanding the creed to a department where it is presumptuous for plain mortals to intrude . Hume , in his " Essays , " Gibbon , in his history , following a common practice of freethinkers in the last century , in an ironical or sarcastic vein , not unfrequently refer to faith as something too sacred to rest on proof . Thus religious beliefs are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the foundation of these beliefs is no less solid for the reason that empirical tests are not applicable to them . The data on which they rest are real , and the inferences from the data are fairly drawn . The first peculiarity of the truth accepted by faith is , then , the absence of the external or experimental sort of proof in confirmation of it . In addition to this peculiarity , the truths of religion , while they are of the character just described , summon the mind to a forth-putting of energy in an extraordinary degree . An exertion of will is requisite . Take the fundamental truth of religion , the existence of a personal God . The proofs of the being of God are so strong that they would suffice to produce conviction in every reasonable mind if the proposition were not one so amazing in its nature . To accept it and rest in it requires a certain energy of trust . " This principle of trust , " says Mozley , " is faith - the same principle by which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a marvelous occurrence - so marvelous that the trust in his testimony has to be sustained by a certain effort of the reasonable will . " The timidity of reason has to be overcome by a courageous exercise of will . In appropriating , or making our own , the things of faith , there is a venture to be made on the ground of the evidence , without the stimulus and support of an appeal to the senses . In matters of the highest moment , which affect our destiny , we have to go upon trust ; a reasonable trust , to be sure , yet requiring to be maintained even in the face of impressions , seemingly adverse to it , which come in through the senses . Now , unless the phenomena which are the reasonable ground of faith , and which pertain on the one side to our moral and spiritual experience , are vividly apprehended , the soul will be too timid to make the venture . The stake is too great , the issue too momentous . We are called upon to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet are to touch . There is proof enough , but there is a seeming conflict with the senses . The elements of uncertainty are at once exaggerated . Courage VOL . XXXIX. - io8. gives way . Many people are afraid in the dark , out of doors and in their own homes , even when they know that there is no rational ground for apprehension . Infidelity is a species of cowardice . In a charming passage of the Phredo , Socrates , after much wise talk about the future life , says : " To affirm positively that all is exactly as I have described would not befit a man of sense . But , since the soul is evidently immortal , that this or something like it is true of our souls and their future habitations - this I think it does befit him to believe , and it is worth risking his faith upon , for the risk is a glorious one indeed . " And then , later , when Crito inquires , " How do you wish us to bury you ? ' Just as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of me and do not let me escape you . ' And quietly laughing and glancing at us , he said : I can not persuade Crito , my friends , that this Socrates who is now talking with you and laying down each one of these propositions is my very self ; for his mind is full of the thought that I am he whom he is to see in a little while as a corpse ; and so he asks how he shall bury me . " ' The eleventh chapter of Hebrews enumerates a list of heroes of faith- Abraham , Moses , and the others . Their faith nerved them to risk everything without fear as to the result . It was not an irrational confidence . Had it been a groundless trust , their bravery would have been mere foolhardiness . Their distinction was that they had the energy to act upon an expectation which , though reasonable in its character , ran counter to all the appearances . Not without truth has it been said of heroism in general , that it partakes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read an account of a visit made by the Prince of Wales , in company with an eminent man of science , to a great iron foundry . They stood together by a stream of red-hot iron , flowing slowly out of the smelting furnace . " Do you believe in science ? " said his companion to the Prince . " I do , " was the reply . " Then thi*ust your moistened finger into that stream . " The Prince at once divided the stream with his finger , and the finger was not harmed . Whether this particular incident occurred or not , the same thing is not unfrequently done by workmen in foundries . On the instant of the contact of the hand with the fiery liquid there ensues what the scientific men call the " spheroidal state . " The sudden evaporation is somehow attended by a repellency that perfectly shields the flesh , for the moment , from contact with the burning substance through which it passes . A learned professor has related to me that having had occasion to refer , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to ex // plain how a stream of molten iron could be thus parted by the naked hand with impunity , a lad among his hearers informed him that his father , a workman in a foundry near by , had often done it . The lecturer repaired to the place , and the workman repeated the experiment in his presence , but , in reply to an inquiry , informed him that the other workmen were afraid to do it . The professor to whom I refer has more than once cut with his finger the glowing stream as it flowed out in a slow current from the heated furnace . We may suppose a person to understand the principle of the spheroidal state , and how it is that the hand , with only the ordinary amount of natural moisture upon it , can be safely passed through such a current . Nevertheless , he might shrink from making the experiment . The sight of the red-hot liquid might induce a recoil which his faith in the principle would not suffice to overcome . Even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw one of their companions try the experiment again and again were kept back by a certain timidity from following his example . An unwonted energy , an unwonted boldness , are requisite to neutralize the impression made on the mind through the senses , let reason say what it will . It follows that there are grades of faith . We read in the Gospel of Mark that a father who had brought his poor diseased child to Christ " said with tears , Lord , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief . " ' The Evangelist Luke records the fact that the disciples of Jesus came to him with the prayer , " Increase our faith . " The petition implies that there is a difficulty in believing . Many Christian disciples of later times have found it to be so , both in respect to that general faith in God 's presence , power , and love which the Apostles then had specially in mind , and in respect to trust in the revelation of his mercy through Christ .

Why do we not feel that if we are stripped of all earthly good , he can more than make up the loss to us ; that in his favor there is life in the highest sense - true joy ? In a word - why is not God more real to us ? How near is the power on which we depend for life and breath and all things !

We live in a world of sense and the world of sense abides with us , early and late . We live in the midst of things seen and temporal . The material aspect of human existence is constantly before us . On every hand is the appalling spectacle of human decay and death . The generations come and go - carried away " as by a flood .

Of the fact of sin there can be no question . In one of Professor Huxley 's recent excursions into the field of theology he drops for a moment from his usually confident and almost hilarious mood into a more pensive strain . I quote the para // graph , printing , however , two or three words in a type that xviii call to them special atten-tion : I know no study which is so unutterably saddening as that of the evolution of humanity as it is set forth in the annals of history . Out of the darkness of prehistoric ages man emerges with the marks of his lowly origin strong upon him . He isabrute only more intelligent than the other brutes ; a blind prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destruction a victim to endless illusions , which make his mental existence a terror and a burden and till his physical life with barren toil and battle . He retains a degree of physical comfort , and develops a more or less workable theory of life , in such favorable situations as the plains of Mesopotamia and of Egypt , and then , for thousands and thousands of years , struggles with varying fortunes , attended by INFINITE WICKEDNESS , bloodshed , and misery , to maintain himself at this point against the greed and the ambition of his fellow-men . He makes a point of killing and otherwise persecuting all those who first try to get him to move on ; and when he hasmoved on a step , foolishly confers post-mortem deification on his victims . He exactly repeats the process with all who want to step yet farther . And the best men of the best epochs are simply those who make the fewest blunders and commit the fewest sins . How much truth there is in this vivid picture of the past of mankind is plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that along with what is said of the " evolution of humanity , " and notwithstanding the apparent sanction given to that unproved type of evolutionary theory which makes man at the start nothing but an intelligent brute , there is still a perception that his career is something more than a chapter in natural history . That is , moral history is not completely metamorphosed into natural history . There has been " INFINITE WICKEDNESS . " Nay , more ; the most that can be claimed for the " best " of men is that they " commit the fewest sins . " Has the brilliant naturalist ever pondered what is involved in these unquestioned facts ? Has he ever grasped them in their full purport , and sought to understand what they presuppose respecting the race of mankind ? Is he wise enough to be sure that the solution of them in the Scriptures , and the Christian explanation of the radical source of the " bloodshed and misery , " the " greed and the ambition , " the " endless illusions " on which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most philosophical and satisfactory of all solutions ? Grant that sin , in its origin and diffusion , and the union of individual responsibility and guilt with a common moral depravity coextensive with the race , involves mystery . May it not be , as Coleridge has said , the one mystery that makes all things else clear ? Grant that even when sin is perceived to be the root of misery , it is hard fully to explain the slowness of the divine process of recovery and redemption , yet the gravest difficulty is taken out of the way . A dark shadow is removed from the character of God and his administration . The paragraph which I have quoted from Professor Huxley recalls a striking passage from the pen of a most gifted man , but a man quite different in the cast of his thoughts from the distinguished naturalist . The passage which follows is extracted from the " Apologia " of John Henry Newman . After speaking of the certainty which he has of the being of God , on the ground of the inward testimonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for this voice , speaking so clearly in my conscience and my heart , I should be an atheist , or a pantheist , or a polytheist when I looked into the world . I am speaking for myself only ; and I am far from denying the real force of the arguments in proof of a God drawn from the general facts of human society ; but these do not warm me or enlighten me ; they do not take away the winter of my desolation , or make the buds unfold and the leaves grow within me , and my moral being rejoice . The sight of the world is nothing else than the prophet 's scroll , full of lamentations and mourning and woe . " To consider the world in its length and breadth , the many races of man , their starts , their fortunes , their mutual alienations , their conflicts ; . . . the greatness and littleness of man , his far-reaching aims , his shortduration , the curtain hungover his futurity ; the disappointments of life , the defeat of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish , the prevalence and intensity of sin , the pervading idolatries ; the dreary , hopeless irreligion , that condition of the whole race , so perfectly yet exactly described in the Apostle 's words ( having no hope and without God in the world ) - all this is a vision to dizzy and appal ; and inflicts upon the mind the sense of a profound mystery , which is absolutely beyond human solution . What shall be said to this heart-piercing , reasonbewildering fact ? . . . Did I see a boy of good make and mind , with the tokens on him of a refined nature , cast upon the world without provision , unable to say whence he came , his birthplace , his family connections , I should conclude that there was some mystery connected with his history , and that he was one of whom , from one cause or other , his parents were ashamed . . . . And so I argue about the world ; if there be a God , since there is a God , the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of joint with the purposes of its Creator . This is a fact ; a fact as true as the fact of its existence ; and thus the doctrine of what is theologically called original sin becomes to me almost as certain as that the world exists , and as the existence of God . I have not quoted the whole of these impressive paragraphs of Newman , but I have quoted enough to show the points of strong resemblance between this description of the feelings excited by a calm survey of men and their history , and that given in the citation // from Professor Huxley . If Newman inserts in the dark catalogue " the prevalence and intensity of sin , " the phrase is equivalent to the " infinite wickedness , " the contemplation of which saddens the mind of Huxley . But the difference is that the theologian does not suffer that most terrible fact of evil involving guilt , which exhibits itself everywhere in human history - a fact in its very nature abnormal ; the abnormal character of which can not be denied without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . He sees in it , in the universality of transgression , proof that in some inscrutable way the race has made shipwreck of itself . There is a source  --  however incapable it may be of full explication-of this corruption , which , be it never forgotten , is not physical , but is moral and culpable . There must be a fons et origo meilorum . Writers of the class of Professor Huxley can see and acknowledge the " infinite wickedness " of the world , and designate it by its right name . They can see that the only merit of " the best men of the best epochs " is that they " commit the fewest sins . " They call them " SINS " and distinguish them from " blunders . " They confess with pain that immoralities and crimes make up a great part of the annals of mankind . Theorizing about " the evolution of humanity " has to reconcile itself , somehow or other , with human responsibility and with the appalling moral depravity which has spread over the race . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any hocus-pocus of speculation , whether physical or metaphysical , evil into good , to transmute sin into something not base or blameworthy , is to undertake to paralyze conscience and to undermine the moral basis of society . So here remains the awful fact of sin , and of a common sin , or of sin that is common . Here is the fact which Professor Huxley terms the " infinite wickedness " that is and has been in the world since men began to exist in it . Here is the reason why Professor Huxley , and every other man who honestly goes through an act of self-judgment , is obliged to bow his head like the publican in the parable . Sin being an undeniable fact , and being in its nature an element of disorder , that our perception of God and of things spiritual should be to a certain degree darkened by the perversion of the will in its inmost inclination , by the " infinite wickedness " which Professor Huxley deplores , and of which he truly says that the " best men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected . Light is thus thrown on the psychology of doubt and disbelief . We have to take account of the fact that we have fallen into a habit of mind discordant with our nature ,  --  that better nature which is affiliated to God ,  --  and one effect of this perversion is to obscure the discernment of things supernatural . The life of self which we lead , and which Christ under took to destroy ,  --  the habit of living to the world and of placing our chief good , and seeking the satisfaction of the spirit , within the bounds of created nature ,  --  is the radical source of unbelief . We have not liked to retain God in our knowledge . Herschel remarks of the cosmic system as revealed by astronomy , that it is directly opposed to the ordinary conception of men . To them the earth is the center ; the sun moves in a circle around it ; the starry heavens are a canopy stretched overit . Science contradicts and upsets this natural view of things . But not more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul is self-centered and the world is looked upon as tributary to its gratification . It is a dictum of common sense , as well as a word of the Lord , that the heart will be where its treasure is . Can it be considered strange that the course of our mental life - the currents of thought and feeling-should be adjusted to the natural order within which , exclusively , our affections find their chosen objects , and above which our desires and aspirations do not rise ? The laws of association by which the process of our thoughts is determined keep the attention upon the object of the heart 's love . As to all that lies beyond , the vividness of our ideas , and , eventually , even our beliefs , are subject to the same influence . The perceptions that engender faith are wanting . The sense of dependence , humility in the room of self-assertion , the craving for something higher than earthly good , the sharp rebukes of conscience , are absent . Faith is a plant that can not spring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to impart science to one void of curiosity and without any true sense of the value of knowledge . Receptivity of one kind or another is the door of access for all higher good . If there be such a hindrance to the exercise of faith in general , a peculiar obstacle interferes with trust in the revelation of the love of God in the religion of the gospel . In this branch of the discussion it is pertinent to refer to the well-known phenomena of Christian experience . There is an abundance of testimony , in the history of the Church and in Christian biography , to sustain the remarks which are to follow . To facts of this nature the class whom Newman somewhere denominates " mere men of letters " may think it beneath them to attend . Not so will judge wise and candid students of human nature , be their creed what it may . It often happens that when the habit of worldliness is partly broken up , and self-reproach is awakened , the feeling of unworthiness makes it hard to look upon God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Luther , in his earlier days , we are inclined to think of Christ as having come into the world to condemn rather than to save . He seems to be a second Moses ; only tenfold more rigid and austere than the first . We read the Sermon on the Mount , and find no difficulty in believing what he says of the rigor of the law , the ideal of obligation - penetrating to the inmost thought of the heart-finding in unrighteous anger the seed-principle of murder . We believe all this ; but we do not so easily believe in the assurance that he is meek and lowly in heart ; that " the bruised reed he will not break . " The invitation to come unto him and find rest is heard with a kind of distrust . There is a common saying that it is hard to forgive those whom we have injured . Certainly we are apt to imagine them to feel unkindly towards us . A sense of ill-desert banishes men from God the more effectually because they know it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they condemn their sin God condemns it even more . Such is the effect of the moral ideal , brought within the pale of consciousness . But the law reveals man to himself ; it does not reveal God to man save partially and in one relation . He is more than law and justice and holiness . There is a mercifulness deeper than all . He loves his enemies ; and we are exhorted in the Sermon on the Mount to copy his example by doing good to those who treat us ill . " God commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us . " Yet , notwithstanding this manifestation of the love of God , and of his willingness to forgive the ill-deserving , the sense of guilt and of shame at the lives we have led may hinder us from believing in him . The Prodigal Son , when he resolved to go back to his father , only thought to apply for the place of a servant . " Make me as one of thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the extent of his hope . But when , weary , footsore , and famished , he caught sight of his father , hastening to meet him , and saw that his heart was full of love and pity , he forgot this part of his intended petition . He did not beg to be made a servant . All his dread was dispelled . Now that we have glanced at the principal hindrances in the way of believing , it will not be wandering from our subject to inquire by what means faith may be increased . Not by the mere exercise of the understanding - the inquisitive and reasoning faculty . The understanding , it has been all along implied , has its rights in matters of religion . We can not be required to believe anything in conflict with the dictates of sound reason . But when men talk of reason and of a supposed conflict between Christianity and reason , it is impor tant to inquire what precisely is signified by the term . Whose reason is meant ? Is it the reason of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated by passion , or blinded by conceit and self-admiration ? A conflict between reason as thus described and the Christian system is of no significance in opposition to the latter . When we speak of the accordance of Christianity with reason , we mean the reason of a right-minded man whose intellectual vision is purified . We mean reason regenerated . The Christian cause need not shrink from answering to a tribunal thus qualified for passing judgment . In the case of an historical religion like Christianity we have a right to examine the testimony to the facts offered to our credence . To attribute all sorts of doubt and questioning to an evil heart is quite unwarrantable . To condemn dissent from the tenets or interpretations of a particular sect or school , as if it were infallible , is arrogant . At the same time our convictions of religious truth do not take their rise in the understanding . Define it as you will , there is such a thing as spiritual discernment . A quickened receptivity develops an insight analogous to higher perceptions in the domain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own light . They impress the soul directly with the evidence of their reality . They will sometimes flash on the mind after long waiting and fruitless groping in the dark . Christ did not say : Blessed are men of talents ; blessed are those who have the ability and leisure for investigation ; blessed are the keen logicians . But he said : " Blessed are the poor in spirit " ; " Blessed are the pure in heart " ; " Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness . " He took a little child , and placed him in the midst of his Disciples , as an example of the humility required for admission into his kingdom . His first followers were not distinguished for their intellectual powers . They were unlearned men . It is found in these days , not unfrequently , that men eminent for their intellectual powers and acquirements are unbelievers . Numerous examples , to be sure , of faith on the part of men equally eminent , men like Kepler , Leibnitz , Newton , Faraday , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of Christianity to convince the most powerful minds , no Christian believer has any occasion to be disquieted for the reason that men excelling in science or scholarship stand aloof from the gospel , or even if they profess atheism . If the secret of unbelief , or its inmost source , be the alienation of the heart from God , what is there in mere intellectual culture to furnish a remedy ? A man may not be cured of a moral distemper by getting knowledge , any more than by getting fame , or getting money . // Two things are to be borne in mind . In the first place , there is abundant evidence that an awakening of conscience , or a quickening of moral sensibility in any form , will often dissipate doubt , and create an inward assurance in another way than by the solving of intellectual problems . It is frequently seen , also , that the understanding , even when its path is made smooth , its difficulties cleared up , its hard questions answered , does not engender faith . A negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark is all ready to move on the waters , the sails are spread , but there is no breeze to fill them . To break through the bonds of nature , and lay hold of the supernatural - that all our reasonings do not lend us the power to do . Fetters have been shaken off which held us to the earth , but no wings have been given on which to soar aloft . Light has come , but not life . Logic alone can not develop faith . But more is to be hoped from that kind of thoughtfulness which tends to detach the heart from earthly good . He who learns how insufficient the world is for the soul will be prepared to turn to something higher . For this reason , in a multitude of instances , trouble has proved to be a school of faith . One who has trusted in riches , but who is despoiled of them and reduced to poverty , looks about for something more substantial to rest upon . One who has made a god of reputation , but becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odious , or obscure and forgotten , is naturally prompted to seek for a good more satisfying and more lasting than the breath of human praise . How many have learned more of God in one hour of bitter sorrow , when bereaved of those who made a part of their life , than they had learned in years of study ! They open the Bible , and hear there messages from the Unseen which before had fallen on listless ears . Bowed down with grief , they hear the sweet and majestic words , " He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted . " When the light goes out on the hearthstone , when nothing meets the eye but tokens left behind by those gone from us , no more to return , then , perchance , we lift our eyes from the darkened earth , and lo ! like the patriarch of old , we see the heavens radiant with stars not seen in the glare of day . Out of anguish that seemed unbearable , out of paroxysms of grief , out of the long hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outweigh the suffering which they cost . The soul is brought a little nearer to God . Saints there have been who have welcomed pain . Pascal prayed : " If the world filled up the affections of my heart while I was in bodily vigor , let that vigor be laid low if my spiritual good require it I " " Dispose of me altogether as thou shalt see best ! Replenish or impoverish me as thou wilt ! But conform my will to thine ; and enable me , in an humble and entire submission , and a holy confidence , to wait thy providential guidance , and to acquiesce in thy gracious disposal ! ' * It is sometimes made a reproach to religion that it is the refuge of the weak , the disappointed , the desponding . But the question is whether the realities of existence are not more truly discerned from the point of view gained by such - whether the mental vision is not clearer . Not long after the death of his wife , Thomas Carlyle wrote to his friend Erskine of Linlathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hallowed be thy name , thy kingdom come , thy will be done - what else can we say ? The other night , in my sleepless tossings about , which were growing more and more miserable , these words , that brief and grand prayer , came strangely into my mind , with an altogether new emphasis , as if written and shining for me in mild pure splendor on the black bosom of the night there ; when I , as it were , read them , word by word , with a sudden check to my imperfect wanderings , with a sudden softness of composure that was most unexpected . Not perhaps for thirty or forty years had I ever formally repeated that prayer ; nay , I never felt before how intensely the voice of man 's soul it is ; the inmost aspiration of all that is high and pious in poor human nature ; right worthy to be recommended with an After this manner pray * How did Carlyle come to see what he had never seen before , and to feel what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all ages been so far astray , when , following Christ and the Apostles , they have talked of a blindness of mind and of spiritual light ? Another effective mode of promoting faith is obedience , even if , owing to the dullness of the organ of hearing , one hears but faintly the voice of him who commands . With obedience there begins a rectification of the will , and a quickening of the power of discernment will follow . We are then steering by the right star , albeit we dimly perceive it . No man has any assurance that he will discover religious truth unless he has first made up his mind to live by it . It is ordained that we shall feel our way in religion . The truth of religion is bread for the hungry ; we must " taste and see " that the Lord is good . Even more important is it to bear in mind that the gates of light are shut to him who is not bent upon walking in the light . " If any man will or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself . " // Here not thinking , but doing , is made the road to knowledge . Another means of increasing faith is the contemplation of Christ . Wherever men are to be lifted above the ordinary plane of character and achievement there is need of the inspiration of personal leadership . The history of every nation 's deliverance from peril or from degradation illustrates this truth . The highest of all illustrations is afforded in Christianity . Christ came to draw men out of the life of unbelief into a fellowship with himself ; a fellowship in his own spiritual life of communion with the Father . Here on earth he himself lived by faith . XVe are invited to look to him as the Author and Finisher of our faith . The word here rendered " Author " is the same as that which stands for " Captain " where he is called " the Captain of their salvation , " and means both example and forerunner . He is the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to the joy set before him , he endured the cross , despising the shame . His victory on the cross was by faith ; a faith which he would fain impart to us . He replied to the Tempter that man does not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . He thanked the Father for choosing humble men to be his disciples , because it seemed good in the Father 's sight . Faith upheld him in the garden when he said , " Nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt " ; and on the cross when he said , " Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit . " He is the vine , we are the branches . By looking to him we become partakers of his inward life ; the life of faith as well as of holiness and peace . If his communion with God was a real thing and not a mockery and a delusion , then all that is presupposed in that communion is also real . He inspires with faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deepening faith to be adverted to is prayer . The Disciples came to Jesus with the supplication , " Increase our faith . " Mere thinking and striving will not avail . Christ thanked the Father for the faith of the Disciples , because it was the Father who had hidden these things from . the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes . Of Peter 's fervent avowal of faith in him as the Son of God he said , " Flesh and blood bath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father which is in heaven . " Whoever seeks to enliven his own faith , or the faith of others in whom he is interested , finds out by exuenment that thought and argument and entreaty do not suffice . Light must come from the source of light . Nothing is left but to resort directly to God . 79 ' No help but prayer , A breath that fleets beyond this iron world And touches him that made it . And here there is a well-founded assurance that none apply to God in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute certainty that the very thing sought for will be granted . With respect to everything else , in our limited knowledge of what is best for us , we have to connect with each petition an acknowledgment of submission to the divine will and wisdom . We implore God to givebut to withhold , should it seem to him best . But to the prayer for the enlightening Spirit of God no proviso need be appended . The doctrine of a divine influence even the most enlightened heathen have found no difficulty in accepting . It is declared without qualification in the Scriptures that God is willing to give his Spirit to them who ask . We can apply to him , if there be in us faith enough to go to him at all , confident that we shall receive the very thing that we desire for ourselves . He can open the eyes of the blind . He can touch the soul with his own mysterious , life-giving Spirit , and quicken it to a perception of realities now dim and shadowy . He is willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you . " Whoever is baffled by mysteries that he can not unravel , and confused by problems that he can not solve , can approach God as a child , and ask the Father to teach him . Poor Hartley Coleridge wrote these lines , out of a heart surcharged with suffering : Be not afraid to pray- to pray is right . Pray , if thou canst , with hope ; but ever pray , Though hope be weak or sick with long delay ; Pray in the darkness , if there be no light . Pray to be perfect , though material leaven Forbid the spirit so on earth to be ; But if for any wish thou darest not pray , Then pray to God to cast that wish away . The truly great poets are the profoundest preachers . These are words of Tennyson : More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of . Wherefore I voice , et thy Rise like a fountain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sheep or goats That nourish a blind life within the brain , If , knowing God , they lift not hands of prayer Both for themselves and those who call them friend ? George P Fsker . THE END . // An Object Lesson in Municipal Government . THERE is much to interest thoughtful Americans in the article upon the city of Glasgow and its government which we publish in this number of THE CENTURY . A graphic picture is given therein of a model municipality , ruled and guided by its highest intelligence and morality for the health and benefit of all its members . It is scarcely necessary to say that this method of government is diametrically opposite to that which prevails in the large cities of America . Municipal misrule in the United States is a byword the world over , chiefly because intelligence and morality as guiding forces give place to political chicanery , cupidity , and ignorance . Our cities are not ruled wisely and economically for the benefit of all their inhabitants , hut unwisely and extravagantly for the benefit of the politicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shall be radical and lasting till we change our leadership to the European models . Mr. Shaw gives the explanation of all the benefits which Glasgow has reaped from her many years of To*vn Council rule when he says early in his paper that the " councilors come chiefly from the ranks of men of business , and are upright , respected , and successful citizens " ; that " party lines are seldom very sharply drawn in municipal elections " ; and that " an efficient councilor may , in general , expect reelection for several terms if he is willing to serve . " What American city would fail to prosper under the rule of a body of fifty of its citizens of like character ? The Glasgow council of fifty have absolute control of all branches of the city government , the streets , water-supply , sanitary arrangements , police , fire department , markets , gassupply , street railways - everything . They manage all upon strict business principles , with precisely the same results which competent business men everywhere secure in the management of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the private courts of the thickly settled quarters are cleaned once and sometimes three times a day . The care and paving of the streets , the construction and regulation of sewers , and public construction of all kinds have been for forty years in charge of one of the most distinguished of British architects and civil engineers . The health department has for nearly or quite as long a period been in charge of an equally distinguished member of the medical profession . The clerk of the town , who occupies much the same position as city attorney or corporation counsel in an American city , has held the office for many years , and is a high authority upon all questions of municipal history and law . So it runs all through the municipal organization . From top to bottom there is intelligence and character in every party . The result is the model city which Mr. Shaw describes . The primary results set forth by him are similar to those attained in other British cities , like Manchester and Birmingham , in which rule by Town Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs are managed by a municipal assembly of safi of its most eminent statesmen , scholars , and merchants . In each case the rights and welfare of the citizen are protected and advanced in every possible way . He has clean and well-paved streets , cheap gas , excellent public schools for his children , every precaution taken to preserve his health and that of his family , public libraries and picture galleries for his education and delight , perfect police protection at all hours of the day and night - all secured for him at the lowest possible cost . In fact , the poorest citizen of Glasgow , or Birmingham , or Manchester , or Berlin is as well guarded and his interests are as well protected as if the city were his club whose officers and servants had no other duty than to minister to his best welfare and comfort . His expenses are reduced in every direction ; his burdens from taxation are put at the minimum point ; his houserent is not only thus reduced , but the character of his dwelling is improved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened , also at the public expense , to give him better air and light . The contrast is striking between this situation and that of the average inhabitant of an American city . The latter , instead of having all his rights protected , comes in most cases very near to being in the position of having no rights which the municipal authorities are willing to respect . He is ruled by ignorance and cupidity , and he pays heavily for this rule . There can he no relief till the character of the rulers can be changed , and bow to secure that change has been a problem for discussion for many years and will continue to be for many more . Our greatest obstacle is the enormous influx of European immigration , which puts our proportion of ignorant voters immeasurably beyond that of any of the European cities whose model governments we have been considering . Next to it is the pernicious habit of intermingling State and national politics with municipal affairs , thus dividing the intelligent portion of the voters into two nearly equal parts and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no city in the United States in which the intelligent and upright voters do not outnumber the others , and in which they could not by uniting secure and maintain complete control of the municipal government . Sooner or later such union will be effected , for the instinct of self-preservation , aroused finally by constantly increasing public scandals , by insufficiently punished crime , and by the accumulation of municipal indebtedness , will compel it
