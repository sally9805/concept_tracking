txt Only a few weeks ago a number of the English papers were speaking in a tone , sometimes tart and in the case of the most friendly a little patronizing , regarding the enthusiasm manifested in this country over the return of Admiral DEWEY . Their columns , both of news and of comment , now show plainly enough that their readers are at least as excitable when the matter of national heroism or of national conflict is involved as are our people . Of this we have no criticism to make . We are far from thinking that stolidity or even stoicism is a national virtue , or that a people is any more likely to be brave or generous or just or determined because it is unexcitable in such matters . We should not admire the English a whit more if the spectacle of their army embarking for a distant : war or the news that their men and officers have fought well and faced death with coolness and courage and had won a victory over a race that had once inflicted defeat on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare the work now doing in the Transvaal with that done in Manila Bay or about the City of Santiago . We concede frankly that a high degree of emotion can not fairly be judged by those that do not share in it , and that a. philosophic Frenchman or German might find both our recent manifestation of feeling and that of our kinsmen across the sea a little excessive , a little beyond ' what might have been expected from two peoples who had seen events of so much greater moment in their history . What is , however , worth noting is the essential error of the common notion that either the English at home or their descendants in other parts of the globe are by nature unemotional . On the contrary , they are quite the reverse . They are not excited by the same things that ex11 cite the French or the other Latins , and 6 they have a rooted reticence as to many matters that - are freely expressed by other ' peoples , nut they are capable of quite as-deep feeling and are radically incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of expression than in the thing expressed . Your average after-dinner orator of the English race surrounds his rhetoric with elaborate qualifications and delivers it in a tone of carefully developed commonplace , but he is apt at any moment to give utterance to sentiments that would make the average Frenchman eivrithe at their extravagance . And their most gifted orators , men of the type of BRIGHT in the last generation and SALISBURY in this , have given to their language some of the noblest and most impressive flights of fervid and imaginative . eloquence . And as for the mass of the people of English race , especially when they are in crowds , it would be no exaggeration to describe them as rather sentimental than otherwise . They are in ordinary circumstances cool-headed , but they are in unusual conditions hot-headed , and at all times they have a large reserve of heat in their hearts . In that respect they are not unlike the Americans , and if we seem so unlike it is because we are apt to judge each other by incidental or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train there are plenty , of differences in our manner , but in a battle or a yacht race we are very much the same sort
