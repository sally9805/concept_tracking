txt The Tribune yesterday gave plain and strong expression to the sentiment of the great body of the Republican Party on the duty of the State Government with reference to the civil service . That paper has a right to speak for its party on this subject . It is , read far more widely and with greater approval by the Republicans of the State than any other journal . Whatever may be its position in regard to factional differences in the party , its course with reference to the reform of the civil service has been in close and obvious sympathy with the sentiment of the whole party . It was active and efficient in advocating the embodiment of the . merit system in the new Constitution , and the powerful support received in the convention and at the polls by the reform principle was largely due to its influence . The Tribune now demands the adoption of the revision of the rules " so as to include a much larger number of subordinate officials and employes than are now covered . " To this it declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Republicans who sincerely believe in the principle involved in the general system , or , indeed , of any Republican who believes that his party ought to fulfill its own promises and honestly carry out its own doctrines . " This plainly includes Gov . MORTON himself . It may be added that the Governor has full power in the premises , and whatever may be the advice of a majority or minority of his Commissioners , he must act for himself . Some of the politicians who have injured the Governor 's reputation by wetending to know his action in advance and even to guide it have been saying that the Governor will not treat the revision of the rules in the spirit The Tribune shows . We do not believe it . and shall not unless we are forced to do so . On the threatened legislation to " beat " the reform and the Constitution The Tribune speaks lb no uncertain tone : " As to proposed . change in the law with the view of facilitating appointments to vacant places on purely partisan grqunds , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called political leaders who do not now , nor ever did , believe /11 the Republican.principle of civil service ' reform , or in the enforcement of any system of rules which interferes with the prosecution of their trade . The motives of these men in urging such legislation are perfectly transpatent . They are at heart opposed to the existing system in principle and in detail . They never speak of it but in terms of derision and contempt . Their obvious present purpose is to procure legislation that will serve as an entering wedge for its ultimate destruction . They are active , agile , and persistent , and will leave no stone unturned to accomplish their object . They have not the assurance to propose openly any radical measure in that direction , but they mean to do it by stealth and indirection . Can the Republican Party of this ? State afford to stultify itself and falsify its professions by giving them their way ? That is the question the Legislature will have to answer . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
