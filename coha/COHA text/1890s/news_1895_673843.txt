txt The indictment of Messrs . Clausen , Straus , and Tappen for their participation in the spending of a special appropriation of $1,000,000 raises several serious questions . Of course , they are not indicted for being in the wrong about the speedway , but they are indicted for an offense which does not seem to be much more properly within the purview of the Penal Code . They are indicted for an evasion of the law which required them to advertise for bids and make purchases by contract for supplies exceeding $1,000 in value . What they did was to make a long series of purchases , without competition and without contracts , of quantities each just under $1,000 , but in the aggregate many times that sum . To arrive at a fair conclusion regarding the moral and legal aspects of this act , it is necessary to recall the circumstances . The Legislature appropriated $1,000,000 for , the Park Department to spend , avowedly and ostensibly to g1 Val emptoyrnent to men out of employment . It was a dangerous and objectionable experiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a foregone conclusion that the money would be spent to help Tammany , and , in fact , the ** of the city under this precious scheme were the Tammany " district leaders . " As soon as the bill had passed , the Board of Estimate summoned the Park Commissioners , and asked how they proposed to spend this money . When they suggested that they might make contracts for the improvement of the parks , the Mayor fell into a. rage and gave Mr. Tappen a wigging for not being ready to put the men at work at once . He told the President of the Park Board that this money was for the relief of distress , that it was to be spent on day 's work , and not on contractors , and that he ought to have brought a plan of spending it on day 's work . A few days afterward , Mr. Clausen appeared before the Board of Estimate with a scheme for spending the appropriation and a little more , and this was at once adopted . It was in pursuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of buying which forms the substance of the indictment against the Commissioners . Pretty plainly the law was evaded , but it was evaded at the urgent demand of the Board of Estimate and in order to put the largest number of men at work at the earliest moment . The Legislature and the Board of Estimate , and not the Park Board , were really responsible for the evasion . Unless corruption is indicated , the case does not seem to be a proper one for indictment . Even an abuse of discretion is not properly punishable unless it be corrupt . Moreover , it does not tend to the proper use of a discretionary power to let it be known that a use which does not commend itself to a Grand Jury may be made the subject of a criminal prosecution . Upon the whole , the indictment of these Park Commissioners has an appearance of oppression and persecution .
