Sill , Edward Rowland , 1841-1887 : AFTER MANY DAYS . from After many days ( 1896 ) 1 Not out of any cloud or sky 2 Will thy good come to prayer or cry . 3 Let the great forces , wise of old , 4 Have their whole way with thee , 5 Crumble thy heart from its hold , 6 Drown thy life in the sea . 7 And ons hence , some day , 8 The love thou gavest a child , 9 The dream in a midnight wild , 10 The word thou would'st not say ,  --  11 Or in a whisper no one dared to hear ,  --  12 Shall gladden earth and bring the golden year .
