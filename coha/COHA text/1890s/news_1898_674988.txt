txt The Federal Civil Service Commission must be without any sense of humor if its members do not perceive the ridiculous contrast between the executive order as to the political activity of officers to which they call attention , and the actual behavior of office holders . Unquestionably the order of Mr. CLEVELAND , issued in 1886 , was a sound one , and ought to be rigidly enforced , and , as the Postmaster General declared as late as last August , the order has never been revoked or modified . Equally unquestionably , the order is as dead as the edicts of the Roman Senate . It is not obeyed ; it is not enforced ; it is openly and defiantly violated , and the violations are absolutely ignored . For the first time in a dozen years the Collector of the Port of New York is actively engaged in partisan work at the party headquarters , by his example giving his subordinates to understand what is expected of them , and , by inference , what is likely to happen if they fail to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reported by Federal office holders , not because it is exceptional , but in the ordinary reporting of what is going on in local politics . In Pennsylvania the Federal place holders , under the greatest obligations to QUAY , are swarming throughout the State using their utmost efforts to save him from the just fate with which he is threatened . The general spectacle is not pleasing to persons of any sensitiveness . The notion of public office as simply a public trust is flouted . Public office as the reward of partisan activity is the practical standard among the officers themselves . But the Civil Service Commission has , nevertheless , done a perfectly proper thing in setting forth the sound rule which the President dares not revoke and will not enforce .
