txt One of the gunners of the battleship Brooklyn came in contact with a Columbus Avenue line conductor last night . The result was that the man who had passed unharmed through some of the fieres.st fight- " ing of the war was first insulted , then Pitched headlong from a car to be picked up unconscious . After this brutal act , the conductor got away , avoiding arrest . The gunner is Patrick . He is a slightly built but athletic appearing man of twenty-two years , whose home is at 443 West Twenty-sixth Street . Just after 8 o'clock last night he and a friend , James Bowden , left an Amsterdam Avenue car at Sixty-sixth Street , and took transfers there for a Columbus Avenue line . The men had been drinking some , but were not intoxicated . They had been discussing the war , and , no car being in sight when they received their transfers , they continued their talk and walked up the street . The car overtook them after they had gone half a block , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly after they got seated on the last seat , facing the rear dashboard . The conductor , big and burly , scowled at his passengers when they presented their transfers . " They do n't go here , " he jerked out . " You got on the wrong place for those . " Then the gunner and his friend tried to explain their walk , but the conductor would not have it . He insisted on fares being paid , and took them , though all the passengers in the car cried " Shame ! " and one man yelled " Remember the Maine . " But the conductor refused to remember anything but his fares . Even when he got them he was not satisfied . " You fellers , " he said , speaking to the gunner , " think you own the earth since you got up here . " And the gunner said : " I 'm proud of what we have done . " Proud , hell ! " growled the conductor . Then he grew bitterly insulting ; then profane . The gunner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things on the same line . The conductor talked louder and louder . Finally , just as the car reached Seventy-sixth Street , he pulled the benrope and the car stopped . With a fierce oath he grabbed , and , lifting him bodily , hurled him from the car . The gunner shot through the air and landed in a heap on the stone pavement . A cry of rage went up from the passengers . But even that did not satisfy the conductor . In an instant he was by the gunner 's side . The man lay as though dead , and there was not even a groan from him when the conductor kicked him squarely in the face with his heavy shoe . The passengers were in an uproar by this time . The conductor only swore at them when he went back to his car . and grasping the collar of Bowden , the gunner 's friend , dragged him from his seat and sent him reeling into the gutter . Then the car went on . Besides the passengers half a dozen persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 60 West Seventy-sixth Street ran and jumped on the car . He is a member of the Seventh Regiment , and an athlete . " I want your number ; you ca n't put me off , " he yelled at the conductor . But the man tilted his hat back , so that the number could not be seen . Half a , dozen passengers yelled , " He 's No. 133. " , however , snatched the man 's hat , and saw the number for himself . Then he jumped from the car and went back to . The gunner ' had been picked up unconscious and carried to a drug store at the Seventy-seventh Street corner . Patrolman Baxter of the West Sixty-eighth Street Station , appeared just as he was being carried in . He was hurriedly told what had occurred , and dashed after the car . By that time it was out of sight , and the policeman gave up . the pursuit after a chase of two blocks . It was several ' minutes before the gunner was revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered : " This is more than I got at Santiago . " The cut on his head was dressed , and although he admitted that he felt badly , the gunner would n't hear of an ambulance being called for or of going to a hospital . " I guess I 've got to stand it , " he said . After half an hour 's wait his friends took him home . The policeman was anxious to make an arrest . The cable line inspector for the district said he was anxious to help him , and told him to wait for the car on its return trip . But , somehow , either the number obtained was not the correct one or the car got by , for the conductor could not be found . , with Al . Hussey of 17 West Twenty-fourth Street , and half a dozen others who witnessed the assault , constituted themselves into a committee , and agreed to go to the West Side Court to-day to tell what they had seen , and ask that the conductor be found and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
