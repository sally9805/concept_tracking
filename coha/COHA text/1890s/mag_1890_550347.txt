THE INDIAN QUESTION PAST AND PRESENT . By Herbert Welsh . Secretary of the Indian Rz*hts Association . THE charge of a Century of Dishonor , a term which has been applied to our century of national dealings with the Indian , is a serious indictment to bring against a nation and an age . How far is such an indictment just ? The American people , the colonists of the original states and their decendants , inherited much of the world 's best civilization , of humane sentiments , of sound education , and of free institutions . As men go , they were religious , conscientious , and enlightened people , the majority of whom were of English origin , with a minority of French , Dutch , and German ; but all , broadly speaking , had left the land of their birth from the desire partly for religious and partly for civil liberty . The Puritans of New England , the Dutch of New York , the Friends or Quakers of Pennsylvania , the Scotch-Irish and Germans of the same state , the Huguenots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightenment and morality as could then be found in the civilized world . Can it be true that the dealings of these men and of their descendants , who inherited their traditions and institutions , with the native people , whom they found on the shores and in the forests of the new land , were such as to justly taint them with the stain of dishonor ? It is generally conceded that the public men developed by the colonial period in America were of a very high order of private and of public virtue , men who as patriots and as statesmen rank with the great men of the world and of time . Washington , the Adamses , Jefferson , Madison , and the patriots with whom they were associated , and of whom they were representative , were the men who lifted the colonies into the dignity of a nation and left the impress of their political genius and their exalted public virtue upon the nation 's future life . If a nation of whom these men were the founders could be guilty of a century of dishonor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in our own or in other times ? Just what is the responsibility of the nation in the more remote and in the nearer past , for the undoubted wrongs and outrages which have been inflicted upon the Indians of our seaboard states , and of our western and more recently developed territory , is a question of historical and practical interest . A right understanding of this matter is necessary both to a just decision upon oui national responsibility for the incessant troubles occurring between the white and the red race in the // past , and also for a clear judgment as to what our duty is toward the Indian population which still remains upon our hands . We are concerned with this past of our Indian history principally because of the light which it throws upon the present , - that present in which we live and move , the duties and the opportunities of which to conscientious and intelligent men and women are of supreme importance . The most positive and conspicuous cause of trouble between the white colonists of America and the native tribes lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually of hostile , nationalities , bringing with them to these shores the sharpest and most irreconcilable differences of religious belief , sensitiveness as to national honor , and desire for the acquisition of territory . Those Indian wars which were among the most bloody , and massacres which did most to inflame the minds of the colonists with an extreme and inextinguishable hatred of the Indian , were inspired and guided by the whites themselves . In the long struggle for mastery in the new world , which lasted with varying fortunes for a century , and culminated in Wolfe 's and England 's victory over Montcalm on the heights of Abraham , France did not hesitate to employ savage allies . French tomahawks and scalpingknives struck down and mutilated English women and children in the exposed settlements of Massachusetts , of Pennsylvania , and Virginia . French officers were in command at Deerfield , at Fort William Henry , at Braddock 's defeat ; nor does history record that they put forth any effort to prevent the horrors perpetrated by their Indian allies . As in the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , it was doubtless the judgment of these courteous and in many respects excellent French gentlemen , that America was well worth a scruple of humanity . Nor was England , . in her moment of need , notwithstanding the eloquent and indignant protest of Chatham , more scrupulous . The savage Iroquois were called to her aid to subdue the colonists struggling for independence . English tomahawks and scalping-knives were red with our fathers ' blood at Wyoming , at Oriskany , at the Minnisink ; nor does history record that the British or Tory officers then in command sought to restrain their murderous use . Indeed , the colonists themselves in some instances employed Indian allies in their struggle with England . In a word , no moral reproach falls upon the Indian for the perpetration of many of the worst atrocities committed through the colonial history , which does not rest with equal or greater weight upon two of the most civilized and Christian nations of modern times . It was this difference of the colonists in race , and this desperate struggle for supremacy , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the civilization and Christianization of the Indian impossible . Indeed , such were the conditions of colonial his tory that any other result than that which actually occurred would have been surprising . Even if it had been a question of a single powerful and civilized nation dealing with a large number of savage tribes , it would have been extremely difficult to have maintained continued peaceful relations between the two bodies so widely separated in interests and customs . The Indian could not be expected to accept the destruction of his food-supply and the occupation of his land by an invading race , without making a strong effort to prevent the catastrophe . He could look to no other tribunal in the contest but that of force , and to that he appealed . It would have required a clear understanding of the obligations of a civilized nation upon the one hand , with the steady fulfilment of its promises of compensation to the savage tribes for lands relinquished by them , and on the other an equally steady acquiescence in the necessity for retirement further and further from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter life . It would have been remarkable even under such favorable conditions as these , if the desired result of friendship between both races and the elevation of the weaker had ensued ; but in view of the constant occupation of Indians by whites of varied hostile nations of Europe , contending for the possession of the continent and led continually to appeal to the savage tribes to effect the ruin of each other , and to advance rival European interests by violence , it is not wonderful that the result was what it has been , deplorable as that result is . For such a result no one man was responsible ; it was the outcome of // the varied and complex conditions of humanity and civilization , in which good and evil passions struggled in neverending conflict . It is only by the wide , deep , unprejudiced study of history , and by the equally careful investigation of the facts and experiences of life , that we can come to a clear understanding of the truth in this matter . All the wrong , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor on the side of the white man . There were conspicuous instances of the noblest Christian devotion and self-sacrifice upon the part of faithful missionaries , who sought to lift the darkened and undisciplined savage mind out of the misery of heathenism into the liberty of Christian light and conduct . These efforts on the part of different bodies of Christians , though in most instances they have left but few permanent results , are full of instruction and encouragement for those who will consider them carefully and without bias . The most conspicuous and important of these efforts to convert the Indians to the belief and morality of Christianity were those of the Jesuits among the Algonquin tribes of Canada and the Iroquois or Six Nations of Central New York , Eliot among the Pequots of New England , and the Friends or Quakers and the Moravians among the Delawares of Pennsylvania . Nothing could exceed the heroism and picturesque devotion of those early Jesuit missionaries . They endured frightful tortures at the hands of the Iroquois with unabated desire to win converts to their faith . They won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they understand nor did the conditions permit that sort of training necessary to change the savage to the civilized man . Certainly the brightest spot in all our dark dealings and struggles with the Indian tribes was the unbroken treaty of William Penn with the Delawares of Pennsylvania . That distinguished man , righteous and wise beyond his time , determined upon a policy of friendliness and fair dealing with the Indians , which was so successfully carried out that for seventy years the peace between the two races was unbroken ; during that period neither the blood of the red man nor of the white was shed . Eliot had gathered from among the Pequots and others in the neighborhood of the present town of Newton a large number of converts who were known as " the praying bands " ; but King Philip 's War so exasperated the colonists against the Indians that these bands were broken up and disperseul . Of all the efforts to Christianize the Indians , none were undertaken in a wiser and more Christlike spirit , and none met with greater present success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moravians among the Delawares . The converts of these devoted men , who of all Christian bodies manifested conspicuously zeal without bigotry and earnestness without intolerance , were converts in deed as in profession . Indeed , they seem to have shown a far truer appreciation of the purpose of the gospel than many nominal Christians by whom they were surrounded . These innocent people , as in the case of Eliot 's converts , suffered for the misdeeds of their wild brethren ; for the losses which the frontier whites sustained through the outbreak of Pontiac so incensed the rough white population near them , that they murdered many who had sought refuge in the jail at Lancaster ; and one year later a similar massacre was perpetrated at Gnadenhiiten on the shores of the Ohio . Those who escaped this first brutal butchery , in which women and children as well as men were driven into a pen and murdered , were forced to fly with their missionaries to seek the protection of the British governor and garrison at Philadelphia . They were pelted with mud and stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the barrack doors to open . When some one inquired how they endured such treatment with so much patience they answered simply , " We thought of the sufferings of Christ upon the cross , and believed that if he endured so much for us we could endure a little for him , " - a practical application of the gospel by the weaker race that might well have taught the stronger a lesson . There are obvious and valuable lessons to be drawn from the history of Christian missions among the Indians , from Penn 's treaty and friendly relations with them , and from the equally remarkable but little known relations existing between Governor Oglethorpe , the founder of Georgia , and Tomachichi , chief of the Yomacraws . History proves beyond a doubt that justice and love have found a way to the hearts of savage men , and that the re // sponse which Indians have given where such treatment has been shown them has been quite equal to that usually expected of a civilized race . The histories of the Moravian missionaries show many incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their general good faith . Had theirs uniformly been that wise and just treatment which they received in a few isolated instances , the results would have been far different and far happier . In considering the whole colonial period of our dealings with the Indians , we can only conclude that the general morality of the times was wholly unequal to the task of maintaining just and peaceable relations with a savage , and consequently weak , people . Nor in pursuing our subject down to the present day can we reach a less humiliating conclusion . And now what are we to say of this Indian question after it has passed from the colonial period into that of our nationality ? To attempt more than a sketch of its history would be impossible here ; but it will , I trust , be possible to give a clear idea of its general nature . The situation from the start was hopeless . It was an irrepressible conflict , the seeds of which had been planted far back in the early days of white occupation . To prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of hunters and then of settlers was impossible . Washington earnestly desired to accomplish this result , and recommended to Congress that no settlements should be made west of a clearly marked boundary line , and that no purchase of land from the Indians except by the government should be permitted . This recommendation was disregarded , and another Indian war was the result . In the earliest treaties made by the United States with Indian tribes , where boundaries were distinctly marked , the lands designated were given to the Indians forever , and whites were to be left to the mercy of the Indians for punishment . Such was the case in the treaty of January 21 , 1785 , between the United States and the Ottawas , Chippewas , and Delawares , and such were the provisions of other treaties made at this period . The utter disregard of these treaties upon the part of the whites led to the Indian wars which resulted in the defeat of General St. Clair and the massacre of his troops , and in the victory of General Wayne over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has occurred between the Indians and ourselves from that time to this . The same miserable story has been repeated with unbroken similarity through all the terrible border conflicts of the century . A treaty would be made promising such and such lands to the Indians , to be theirs as long as " water ran and grass grew . " Such and such goods were to be given them in return for land taken . The ink in which the treaty was written was scarcely dry before our unrestrained and unrestrainable settlers would proceed to violate its terms . This invariably led to irritation and to individual acts of revenge on the part of the Indians , - and then followed war . All along our advancing line of western settlement there ran a red fringe of blood and fire . It was this which led to St. Clair 's Indian war and his defeat , to Wayne 's victory over the Miamis , to the troubles between the United States and Tecumseh , the battle of Tippecanoe , and to the losses which our people suffered from Tecumseh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Failure to pay annuities due the Sioux Indians by the government was one of the causes that led to the awful Minnesota massacre of 1862 . The Sitting Bull campaign , which culminated in the Custer massacre , was the direct result of violation of treaty agreement , through the invasion of the Black Hills by prospectors in search of gold . The removal of the Cherokees from Georgia by United States troops and their settlement in the Indian territory was one of the most unjustifiable outrages that our history records , and one of the few that provoked no bloodshed . The Cherokees had made great advance in civilized ha.bits ; they cultivated their lands , they had built school-houses , and for years had been under the influence of Christian missionaries . The demand for their removal by the United States on the part of Georgia was dictated wholly by greed , was contrary to treaty provisions , and was without excuse . The discussion agitated the whole country , but finally Congress yielded , and General Scott was ordered to remove these unhappy people from the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was beginning to bear fruit . The march through the wilderness caused the death of at least half of the tribe . It is // unnecessary to do more than glance at the long list of cases of injustice , cruelty , wretchedness , and folly , which the history of our national dealings with the Indians reveals . As I have said , these transactions are nearly all of the same kind . Their essential nature does not vary materially . What are the plain , reliable lessons that we may learn from this unhappy record of a century ? Of what may we be really sure , and what will serve us in forming a clear view of the present aspect of the Indian question ? This much , at least , is wholly trustworthy - 1st . There was no sound and settled policy which looked toward winning an enduring friendship with the Indian tribes , establishing confidence between the two races , and eventually securing the civilization of the Indians . It is extraordinary that the government should continue to make promises in treaty after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept . It is by no means extraordinary that the Indians , finding how utterly unworthy of trust were the promises made them , how continually they were deceived , how constant were the invasions of their territory , and , moreover , having no redress by law , should have taken the only course left them - frantic hate , violence , and murder , and having exhausted brief passion , should have sunk into apathy , debauchery , and despair . 2d . The individual , unrestrained character of our people , their remoteness from the seat of government , the enormous extent of our frontier , the weakness of national authority , made it very difficult for our government to control the action of its citizens . To a greater or less degree it made every man to become a law unto himself , and made him both ignorant and regardless of national promises . 3d . In the nature of things , the average man of the civilized race can have but little sympathy for or understanding of the uncivilized man . Language , habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s i great gulf fixed . There is a natural tendency for the civilized man to be a barbarian to the savage . It is the same instinct which prompts in a boy cruelty to helpless animals . The bad , weak side of human nature gets the upper hand . It requires imagination , Christian principle , and an unusually strong sense of justice , to triumph over these baser instincts . There were good and humane men who saw plainly the injustice and wickedness with which the Indians were treated , who deeply regretted it , and did what they could by their own personal exertions to change the course of things ; but they were too weak and too few to produce an appreciable result . The stream of tendency was too swift and too strong to be breasted . The nation was too busy with material development and with questions of another nature to afford the luxury of a conscience . Then , too , the belief that the Indian belonged to a doomed race , and that he was incapable of civilization , was so prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to make them palliate national injustice as the inevitable adjunct of a conclusion that was unavoidable . The general popular view of the Indian was one of aversion and horror . He was always associated with the scalping-knife and tomahawk , and the murder of women and children . He was believed to be no better than a wolf or panther , wholly cruel , blood-thirsty , and irreclaimable . I have sketched two periods in the history of the occupation of America by the white race , and of our dealings with the Indian tribes - two periods distinct and yet related . The first is the colonial period , in which I have shown how the seeds of future trouble and violence were sown by the occupation of Indian lands , by the struggles of the colonists and various nationalities for supremacy on the American continent , and by their employment in these struggles of Indian allies , by their failure , except in isolated cases , to treat the Indians with justice , and by their wanton murder of those native converts who had been redeemed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national period , during which the injustice of the colonial period continued in the constant making of treaties which from their nature could not be kept , and which were constantly broken , in the pressure of the uncivilized Indians westward , and even in the removal of Indians rapidly progressing in civilization , such as the Cherokees of Georgia . We now come to the consideration of the third and last period of the Indian question , the period in which a large number of thinking and // conscientious people in the United States have come seriously to consider whether it is not incumbent upon the nation to take prompt and comprehensive measures for the protection and civilization of the remaining Indians , to consider carefully the mistakes of the past , and to take steps for their avoidance in the future . What are the causes which originated this movement , what is its present aspect , and what are likely to be its results ? The movement for the humane solution of the Indian question originated partly in the changed position of the Indian tribes , and partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that such a change had taken place , and that there was pressing need , both from the white and from the Indian point of view , for consideration of its nature and for meeting its demands . During the colonial and early national period , civilization drove the Indian from the sea-coast westward - west of the Ohio and west of the Mississippi . There were great open tracts west of them . So long as they had the deer of the forest and the buffalo of the prairie to subsist upon , there was no urgent practical necessity either for the white man or for the Indian to consider the question of civilizing the Indian , of teaching him the essentials of religion and morality , a knowledge of systematic labor , of farming , of trades , of domestic life , of giving him the protection of law , and of according him a right to own his land as an individual . But when the deer , the antelope , and the buffalo no longer existed as a food-supply , when all the western wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian had no West to retreat to , but was surrounded on all sides by the dominant race , when he was faced with the alternative of starvation or work , and when the United States was equally confronted with the problem of his civilization or his permanent pauperism , then it was apparent that a new condition of affairs had arisen . We may fairly assume that the beginning of the third period of our dealings with the Indians dates from General Grant 's second presidential term , when he called the attention of the country to the helpless situation of the Indian tribes , and asked the Christian bodies to come forward and assist in the work of their civilization . This call at once aroused popular attention . It ushered in a better and brighter period - a dawn that has even yet not fully broken into day . Important preparatory work had been accomplished among the great Dakota or Sioux people of the Northwest by the Congregational and Presbyterian missionaries , Dr. Riggs and Dr. Williamson , whose greatest work was the translation of the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop Whipple , which had reached far beyond the church walls of his communion , did much to awaken popular sympathy for the Indian . General Grant 's appeal immediately led to new and important steps . Representative and humane men from many of the large cities went in a body to Washington , to thank President Grant for his words and to offer their services to him in carrying his plans into effect . This visit led to the formation of the Board of Indian Commissioners , composed of philanthropic gentlemen who served without pay and acted as an advisory board to the President and the Secretary of the Interior . This board was without executive power , and was only expected to assist the administration by information and advice . Its members accepted their duties with enthusiasm , but soon found that they had undertaken a Herculean task . The Indian Bureau at that time was a nest of corruption . Jobbery , speculation , and inefficiency flourished . Contractors for provisions and all sorts of supplies swindled the government and the Indian . Indian agents were largely selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duties , and were in : many instances flagrantly corrupt . A governor of one of our great states laughingly said , " Whenever a man comes to me for a place in the government service who is fit for nothing else , I give him a place in the Indian service . " The impudence of some of these men was so great that one of them , who had robbed the government of 8o , ooo , excused himself in a public address by saying that all the money had been spent in Dakota - the territory in which he afterward lived ; - as though this benefit to the locality excused his crime . The Board of Indian Commissioners , by visits to the Indian country and by careful inspection of supplies , accomplished much in the line of // reform ; but they had small sympathy from the heads of the Indian Bureau , who frequently thwarted their efforts to expose and punish guilty men . Suit for libel to the amount of $100,000 was brought against one member of the board by a dishonest timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that amount of money , for having written to the Secretary of the Interior his opinion that the contract was fraudulent . The Secretary placed this letter - a letter written for his information for the protection of the government - in the hands of the contractor , thereby enabling him to bring suit . Nor was the P.resident himself willing to remove officers of the Interior Department , when such action was necessary to protect the credit of the administration . It was the corruption of American politics which hampered the efforts of the Board of Indian Commissioners for reform and caused some of its most active and earnest members to resign their positions and thenceforth to labor for Indian civilization through the medium of churches and as individuals rather than assume an official responsibility without power to discharge it . Probably nothing has done so much to change the current of public opinion as to the possibility of civilizing Indians as the experiments in the education of Indian youth at the Carlisle and Hampton schools . The great work which these institutions have since accomplished grew out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indian prisoners who were confined by the government in the old Spanish fort at St. Augustine , Florida . These men , taken redhanded on the war-path and imprisoned far from the scene of their crimes , as being especially dangerous outlaws , were so changed by Captain Pratt 's judicious treatment and by the efforts of a few Christian women for their instruction , that many of them became anxious to learn trades and to adopt habits of civilized life . In order that a fair opportunity might be given them to make this new departure , a few of their number were for a while taken to the Hampton negro training-school at Hampton , Virginia , and were there set to work along with negro boys. * As these efforts promised success , the old government barracks at Carlisle , Pennsylvania , were fitted up as a training-school , and the work of Indian education was there definitely begun under the superintendency of Captain Pratt . The work for the negro at Hampton was also supplemented by the addition of two hundred Indian pupils . These two great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawn from every tribe have been gathered , have been an object lesson of the highest value to the Indian cause . Doing their work openly in the heart of eastern civilization , they have shown our most intelligent people , what they may be pardoned for not having believed before , that under favoring circumstances the Indian can be taught all that is necessary to fit him for at least an humble position in civilized life . The efforts of no single laborer in the Indian cause have been more faithful than those of Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson , who during the closing years of her life devoted her literary talents and strong human sympathies to making known to her countrymen and women the story of Indian wrongs . A century of Dishonor and Ramona have spread knowledge and aroused sympathy where ignorance and indifference to our Indian policy existed before . The Indian question was further brought to public attention , in the year 1876 , by the enforced removal of the Ponca Indians from their homes in Dakota to the Indian Territory . This was done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indians were bitterly opposed to this banishment from their homes , and some of them made their way back to Dakota on foot , often suffering great hardships . They were arrested , and were about to be returned , when their case was brought into the courts through the exertions of Mr. T. H. Tibbles , a western newspaper editor , whose sympathies had been aroused in their behalf . His exertions were successful . Judge Dundy , before whom their case was tried , made his memorable decision , that their forcible removal was unlawful . They were set at liberty and , accompanied by Mr. Tibbles and Bright Eyes , a Ponca Indian woman of remarkable intelligence and education , several of these Indians visited eastern cities , made their wrongs known through a series of public meetings , and aroused much popular sympathy in their behalf . One of the most important results of // the Ponca case was the formation of the Boston Citizenship Committee , composed of philanthropic men , who assisted the unfortunate Poncas with money and counsel , and who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal of this single case . The Citizenship Committee has since continued its work in a more extended form for the benefit of all Indians , and especially has it labored to secure them their political and civil rights . Another important organization for securing the rights of the Indian is known as the Woman 's National Indian Association , which was originally organized for securing the fulfilment of treaties , but has since largely turned its attention to the establishment of mission stations among the various tribes . This association has pressed its work so vigorously that it has branch associations in upwards of thirty states . It has widely disseminated information among the people and done much to influence the action of Congress at critical moments in favor of just treatment of the Indians and for the increase of education . Another positive factor in that marked improvement which has characterized the management of Indian affairs within the last decade has been the Indian Rights Association . With a view to showing the general nature of the work which this society has accomplished , I will briefly sketch its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association resulted from the chance visit of two young men , of whom the writer was one , to the great Sioux reservation of Dakota , in the summer of 1882 . This visit was made in company with Bishop Hare of the Protestant Episcopal Church , whose , mission field lay in this region , and it gave the first opportunity to those who made it to see the Indian as he really was , eye to eye , and not through the medium either of the sentimental or the adverse prejudices of others . There is a unique value in truth at first hand . This visit resulted in a revolution of many preconceived opinions and in fixing in our minds clearly and firmly two important truths - ist . That the Indians were capable of civilization ; and 2d . That it was largely due to the injustice or inefficiency of the government 's dealings with him that the Indian had attained to civilization so imperfectly . Everywhere during this journey we were astonished by what Christian missionaries had accomplished . Congregations of Indian converts in many chapels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools that were in moral atmosphere and discipline ideal Christian homes , educated Indian ministers earnestly engaged in the work of civilization among their people , left an impression on the mind that it was impossible to forget . It said more forcibly than could be expressed in words : The civilization of the Indian by these methods is possible . The devoted heroism and selfsacrifice of the missionary have shown that there is a humane solution of this problem . By just dealing , by kindness , by patient training , the missionary has won the Indian 's heart , and has taught him the lessons of love , of labor , and of moral responsibility . It is true the number of those who have been reached by this means is small compared to that of those who are beyond its influence ; but enough at least has been done to show what may be done . The thought was constantly in our minds , How few of our people at home know of this work , and how many of them know nothing of it at all ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . or the injustice of the government . Peaceful and industrious Indians , who had long asked to have their land given to them in severalty , and to whom it was due under treaty promises , had for years asked in vain , while their white neighbors clamored for the farms which had grown productive under Indian labor . There was no one to represent these men at Washington , and to plead their cause effectively . This is the brief summary of the impression which this visit to the Indian country made upon our minds . The Indian was a human being , fully capable of civilization . Enough had already been done to prove this . He could understand kindness and justice , he had human affections , he could be taught to labor , to live in civilized ways , and to serve God . But his position was an unusual one , unlike that of other men . He needed to be taught everything that belongs to civilization , - how to speak English , to cultivate the ground ; he must have the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must be duly cared for and protected // in his rights by the United States government . Congress must vote money for his education and pass laws for his protection and the people of the country must ask Congress to do these things . The black , dense ignorance which now exists on the subject must be dispelled . The Indian must have just and faithful friends , who will plead his cause with the people , who will represent him in the East and at Washington , until his rights are accorded , and his days of tutelage are over . With such thoughts as these in mind , though without any definite plan by which they could be carried into execution , these two young men returned to their homes in Philadelphia . The intense impressions which their first glimpse of the Indian and of his wrongs had produced on their minds bore rapid fruit . To one of them large and wholly unexpected opportunities for public speaking were presented , and influential churches opened their doors to him for addresses upon the Indian question ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope that any wise and well-directed effort to redress Indian wrongs would meet with popular support . It was determined to form an organization to carry out the work which I have sketched as absolutely demanded by the helpless situation of the Indian . In December , 1882 , a few gentlemen gathered in a private parlor in Philadelphia , where they organized the Indian Rights Association . Branches of this parent tree rapidly grew in different parts of the country , but particularly in the eastern and middle states . The association to-day numbers about i , 6oo members . Its object was to co-operate with the government in the work of civilizing the Indians , whenever co-operation was possible , but never to hesitate in criticism or conflict when it was necessary to expose wrong or defeat efforts to defraud . The great object of the association has been to make constant investigations upon Indian reservations , and there to ascertain the actual conditions and needs of the people , to represent these needs by public addresses , by publications , and through the newspapers , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone could public sentiment be formed and guided . The next great purpose of the association was to direct this newly aroused force of public sentiment upon Washington - to make the Executive feel the force of this public pressure , to induce Congress to pass much needed legislation which had long lain dormant because there was no one to urge its passage , or to vote money for the education of Indian children ; and to purify and stimulate to higher and more intelligent action the whole Indian service charged with the administration of Indian affairs . Space will admit no detailed account of what has actually been done from 1882 to the present time , on the lines marked out , but certainly a most positive and wholesome influence has been exerted . The association has collected a large and valuable mass of information regarding the Indians , which has been of great service both in enlightening the public mind and in guiding Congress to adopt sound Indian legislation , and to prevent the passage of iniquitous measures which interested persons are always seeking to introduce . The association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land in Severalty Bill , which it urged for several years . This bill secures to the Indian the right to own land in individual allotments , and opens to him the door to the full rights of citizenship . The greatest difficulty with which the association has had to contend has been the spoils system in the Indian service , by which appointments to the various posts in the Indian service are made at the dictation of partisan politicians and not upon the grounds of merit and fitness . Indeed , this vicious system , which has been so strongly intrenched in all parts of our civil service , is to-day the greatest practical hindrance in the government 's work of civilizing the Indian . The association has long struggled for the complete divorce of the Indian service from partisan politics . It ha* done much to bring about a better condition of things , but the evil is by no means yet overcome . The point which I would like to impress in concluding is one which is valuable to remember in connection with all the workings of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian can never be done but by the personal endeavor and self-sacrifice of the people of the United States . The machinery of a representative government becomes but the tool of oppression and // wickedness , unless the good people of the country guard it jealously , unless they feel that a personal responsibility rests upon them for its healthful , beneficent operation . Let us remember that it is our government , - yours and mine , - the outward expression of the dignity and majesty of the nation , for which our fathers labored , fought , and died . Their honor and ours is concerned in our making the best and fullest use of it , and in attaining the high purposes for which it was intended , and of which it is abundantly capable . The right use of government is vital to the welfare of the Indian ; it is one of the principal , indeed , I may fairly say , the principal means for securing his civilization . That the government of this country owes to the Indian full care and protection until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is undeniable - it is admitted . The Indian stands to the government in the relationship of ward to guardian , but the duty which this relationship implies can never be fulfilled unless the intelligent , good people of the country are determined that the government shall do its duty . Remember just what the government is , - a varied , heterogeneous collection of men from all parts of the country , sitting for a brief space , it may be , in Congress , - in the Senate and the House , - making or not making laws , voting or withholding money , sitting in the President 's chair , at the Secretary of the Interior 's or the Indian Commissioner 's desk , attending to the operation of these laws or the expenditure of these monies . Remember that these men are coming and going , changing all the while . They can not know enough to handle this tremendous power over the Indian wisely and well , unless steadily out of the people comes an influence , a voice telling them to do their duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Rights Association has aimed to do for these past nine years , and that it has done more or less perfectly . It has aimed to express the better sentiment of the people , and to make that sentiment a steady practical power for good at Washington , to counteract the influence on legislators and officials of evil men and evil designers , to free the Indian service from the corruptions of politics , to secure good men for the administration of Indian affairs , and to prevent criminals , dissolute or inefficient persons from being sent to Indian agencies or to take charge of Indian schools . The practical lesson which I would here enforce is that an agency of this sort is essential to the work in hand ; that work can not be done without an organization , philanthropic , non-partisan , permanent , unpaid , which speaks for the people . The best Christian sentiment of the country is needed to redeem the Indian , to stimulate and guide the constantly changing functionaries of the government who are charged with the task of his civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Indian Rights Association , and in the performance of that duty it appeals to the individual conscience and the personal sense of responsibility of the good men and women of the land . I have tried to sketch the history of a century of dishonor , a century as it relates to the unhappy dealings of a strong with a weak people , by which the displacement and ruin of the latter was brought about , and trouble and bloodshed , for which there was no reason , were inflicted upon both . I would leave my readers with the belief that , while such a result was inevitable under the circumstances by which that history was wrought out , it was a result mainly due to ignorance , prejudice , and wrong upon the part of the stronger race , and not to any unalterable law . Human folly and wickedness are responsible for at least the larger part of these consequences , as human wisdom and virtue , had they existed in force to guide the past , might have been praised for very different and happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were brilliant , though rare , illustrations of love , self-sacrifice , and devotion shown by the dominant to the conquered race , harbingers of infinitely stronger and more hopeful efforts in our own time that these later efforts have developed into organized life ; that if this life is nourished by a strong , continuous , public sentiment , the century of dishonor , while its record can not be effaced , may be atoned for by coming years of justice , and of successful effort to absorb the Indian into our national life . Each one of us is responsible for the advent of this better future . The power of the United States for the accomplishment of this work was never so great as now ; and power is the measure of responsibility .
