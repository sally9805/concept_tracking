txt The Rev. Maltbie Davenport Babcock , pastor of Brown Memorial Church , has decided to accept the call from the Brick Presbyterian Church of New York in succession to Dr. Henry Van Dyke , and to-night handed his resignation to the Board of Trustees of Brown Memorial Immediately after the usual Wednesday night prayer meeting , a meeting of the deacons and Elders of the church was called and assembled in the chapel . As he handed his resignation to the Chairman of the meeting , Dr. Babcock was visibly affected . He said : " I am forced for your sakes and mine to end the strain of these days , the hardest days through which I have ever lived as a minister . I can not trust myself to say more than a few words . " I can not escape the conviction that it is my duty to give myself to God 's work in New York City . There is nothing I can say of what this decision means that you do not know . We must help each other now as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please unite , therefore , with me in requesting the Presbytery of Baltimore , at its next meeting , to transfer me to this new field of labor . " I shall set no date for leaving you , since I wish the pastoral relation to remain undisturbed for the present , while I do all that I can in helping you to find the man whom God has somewhere to carry on His work here . " After the meeting Dr. Babcock said it would probably be six weeks or possibly three months before he could sever his connection with Brown Memorial and assume the more responsible charge in New York City . In the meantime a committee of five was appointed to look about for a successor to Dr. Babcock.
