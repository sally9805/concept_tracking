txt Although no cable advices to that effect had been received at the War Department up to the close of office hours to-day , the opinion was expressed by officials that Gen. Miles 's advance guard of 3,000 men , which landed in Puerto Rico on Monday , probably already has been reinforced by Brig . Gen. Ernst 's brigade , which left Charleston the day before Gen. Miles shipped from Guantanamo . Ernst 's brigade , composed of the Second and Third Wisconsin and Sixteenth Pennsylvania Regiments of Volunteers , was accompanied by Major Gen. Wilson , commanding the First Division of the First Corps . When it took its departure from Charleston in the transports Obdam , Mobile , and Grand Duchess 3.500 strong , its orders were to proceed direct to Fajardo , on the northeast coast of the Island of Puerto Rico . Gen. Miles is understood to have sent the cruiser Dixie to intercept this expedition and turn it in the direction of Guanica , where , in the opinion of War Department officials , it probably already has arrived . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's command numbers about 6,500 , including five volunteer infantry regiments , four batteries of light artillery , hospital , and signal detachments , and a company of engineers . As understood here , Gen. Miles 's purpose is to seize and occupy the City of Ponce as soon as possible . It is presumed that after taking possession of Yauco , which is the home of Matted , the insurgent leader of the province , where little if any opposition is expected , he will take charge of the railroad leading to Ponce , fifteen miles away , and after having his engineers make such repairs as the Spaniards may have rendered necessary , use it for forwarding the troops to the vicinity of Ponce itself . Whether Gen. Miles will advance on Ponce ' with his present force depends , it is believed here , on the information he receives of the strength of the Spanish forces in the town . If his calculation does miscarry he will have the aid of 2,000 or 3,000 insurgent natives , who are expected to join the American forces at Ya.uco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided to attack Ponce without waiting for any further reinforcements . Unless the garrison of Ponce has been greatly strengthened recently , the force there is inconsiderable , and as it is not a fortified town , little difficulty is expected in its capture . According to the last reports received by the Bureau of Military Information , the only guns mounted there are a few howitzers and fieldpieces placed in the hills behind the city so as to command the road leading from Ponce to San Juan . The understanding here is that the infantry , artillery , and cavalry which left Tampa last Saturday and Sunday , under orders to go to Fajardo , will either be intercepted at sea by one of the ships of Gen. Miles 's naval escort or after its arrival at Fajardo notified to repair to Guanica by a vessel stationed there for the purpose . The tugs and lighters intended for the construction outfit called for by Gen. Miles , which were to leave Newport News for Fajardo , have been ordered to Guanica instead . An official of the War Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Guanica would now be the final landing place of the entire expedition , and the orders to divert the Schwan and Wilson detachments there would seem to bear out that assertion . On the contrary , it is known that when Gen. Brooke telegraphed from Newport News to-day to know where he was to go , he was instructed to follow his original orders ; that is , to proceed direct to Fajardo . He was told , however , that he would probably be met before he reached there by a vessel which would inform him of any change in his destination . should any be made . This is taken to mean that it is still contemplated to land his force at Fajardo , or , at least , to make a demonsration there , so as to distract and divide the Spanish forces . Gen. Brooke 's force is made up of infantry , artillery , and cavalry , and will go well prepared for independent movement .                    @
