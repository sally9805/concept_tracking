txt The Rev. Dr. Robert S. preached last evening on the events of the Week , his principal topics being the assassination of President Carnot , the Pullman strike , Sunday observance , and the police investigation . " Last Sunday , " he said , " will go down into history as an epoch-making day . The whole world mourns with France in her sorrow for her noble President , cruelly.assassinated by the hand of a vile Anarchist . The act was as cruel as it was senseless , and as senseless as it was satanic . " He denounced Anarchy and Anarchists , and con- ? tinued : There am more Anarchists to-day in Chicago than in St. Petersburg , and more in New-York than in Moscow . These men have fled from Russia , Germahy , and Italy . and have come to a country where the Government is republican , but they must be taught that beneath the velvet glove of the Republic there is an iron arm and hand of justice . There are many in this city to-day who should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the American flag , and they are not worthy to become American citizens . Dr. then said that immigration should be restricted and Anarchists excluded from the United States . Then he discussed the great Pullman strike , which he denounced in violent terms . He said : It fs not a strike ; it is a boycott , and a boycott is unmanly and un-American . It is not for me to justify the company against which the first overt act has been taken , but it is for me to condemn the manner in which these rioters have struck at the rights of the public . Because some men have quarreled with their employers , why should they involve large numbers of workingmen Who are perfectly Fattened with their posi-tions ? The next topic that Dr. touched upon was Summer excursions . He said : Some excursions may be justifiable , but I believe the average excursion on the Lord 's Day is an occasion for drunkenness , riot , and immorality . No man who has a regard for his goo : I mun4 would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that such accidents occur , but it is sadder when they occur on the Lord 's Day , and occur under circumstances so suspicious . It is sad to me that Carnot was assassinated , . but sadder still that he was assassinated on a Sunday night when he was on his way to a theatre . Dr. referred to the Police Department of New-York and spoke about the revelations that have come to light before the Lexow committee . Continuing , he said : Mr. Goff said that religion alone was exempt . from the blackmail of the police . Well , I know . that the ministers of religion have not been excepted . There has been for years a system of blackmailing the clergy by the Police Department of this city . They have sent around the ward man or some other man with an illustrated book , entitled " Our Police Protectors , " and , for the honor of accepting the book , at least $10 was always expected . I am not surprised so many young men , when they are married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wealthy men make their home in Great Britain , where , though they are under a monarchy , they have more rights and privileges than when they are controlled by the ignorant , bigoted , blackmailers who condescend to rule over this city . The preacher declared that the time had come to get rid of this system and to have every citizen do his duty . He said public opinion was fast paving the way , and that justice and right would soon be triumphant .
