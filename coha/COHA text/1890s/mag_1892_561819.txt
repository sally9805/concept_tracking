txt THE northern part of Mexico , along its border line with the United States , there extends a strip of land which is governed by trade regulations wholly different from those of the rest of the republic . This strip is known as the Free Zone , or , in Spanish , Zona Li/ire , and it is , it seems to me , an institution wholly misunderstood in this country . The general opinion seems to be , first , that it was established by Mexico as an act of antagonism , it not of unfriendliness , towards the United States , and , second , that its main , if not its sole purpose was to encourage smuggling , to the prejudice of the fiscal interests of this country . I wish to show how unfounded such impressions are ; and , prompted as I am by a due regard for a fair understanding and harmony between the two countries , I believe it will not be considered presumptuous on my part to offer some statements concerning that subject . I will not be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official records of Mexico show that , far from being its friend , I have ever been its most earnest opponent , and I am the only Mexican Secretary of the Treasury who has so far officially advised its abolition . I intend to consider the matter impartially and fairly , and to do this I will first state how the Zonct Li/Ire originated in Mexico , and then define what we mean by that term . When , in pursuance of the treaty of February 2 , 1848 , the Rio Grande River , from El Paso del Norte to the point where it flows into the Gulf of Mexico , was accepted as the boundary line between Mexico and the United States , new settlements sprang up on both banks of the river , and things began to take their level under the new conditions . The two nations , which so far had been separated by a desert , were at once brought into close contact with one another , and it was found that the economical and commercial conditions on the north and south banks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the towns of the United States along the north bank no taxes were levied and no restrictions of any kind were imposed upon internal trade . The import duties on foreign goods brought into the United States were at that time relatively low , and this country was then at the beginning of its unexampled career of material progress and prosperity . On the opposite bank , in Mexico , the towns were loaded down with the onerous system of taxation which had come down to us from the Spaniards . The heavy taxes which were levied on internal commerce had largely increased the cost of foreign and domestic goods , and the collection of these taxes made a system of interior custom-houses , with all their attending evils , a necessary institution . There were many and very onerous restrictions both upon foreign and domestic trade , and the import duties on foreign goods were so high as to be , in many cases , practically prohibitory . Many commodities were actually excluded from the country under the plea of protection to our national industries , and among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provisions . The result of this condition of things was that radically different prices prevailed in the towns on both sides of the river . At Brownsville , Tex. , for instance , on the north bank of the Rio Grande , all sorts of domestic articles and the necessaries of life , such as provisions and clothing , were bought at a low price , while in Matamoras and other Mexican towns , on the south bank , the same articles of domestic production and often of an inferior quality cost twice and even four times as much as at the stores just across the river . A still greater disproportion existed in the price of foreign gooas on either side of the river , and the cheapest commodities were always sold on the left bank of the Rio Grande . This difference of taxation and consequently of prices on the frontier , necessarily brought about one of two results . It either caused the inhabitants of the Mexican towns to emigrate to the settlements on the other side of the river , in order to enjoy the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it induced them to purchase in the United States the goods which they needed and to smuggle them across the Rio Grande to their homes in Mexico . In 1849 , the year following the adoption of the new boundary line by the two countries , the situation on the Mexican frontier // 461 became so untenable and disquieting that our federal congress was obliged to pass ; on the 4th of April of that year , a law authorizing for three years the importation through the frontier custom-houses of the state of Tamaulipas of such provisions as were needed for the use of the people of the frontier . Such goods had up to that time been prohibited by the existing tariff , or had been subject to almost prohibitory duties . This law did not meet the exigencies of the situation , because it was restricted to provisions , and these were not the only things that men require for their life and comfort . On August 30 , 1852 , the United States Congress passed a law by which the contrast between the conditions of the two sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of things on the Mexican side became worse than ever . By that act foreign goods could be sent in bond to Mexico over certain routes specified in the law and others to be authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury . These goods could be held on the frontier in the United States until a favorable opportunity caine for their exportation into Mexico , and they were free of all duties on the part of the United States . There was no similar privilege within the territory of Mexico , as all foreign goods , of whatever kind they might be , were there subject to the payment of duty upon their importation . The result was that the inhabitants of the Mexican side of the river were placed under such disadvantages that the public men of Tamanlipas , the only state which at that time had towns on the border facing the border villages of Texas , came to believe that they must have privileges similar to those existing in the United States , to enable them to live on the frontier . It was this belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled condition of Mexico , such men soon found an opportunity to bring about what they desired . This statement of facts shows that the Free Zone was not really an invention of the Mexican authorities of the state of Tamaulipas , but an imitation on a larger scale of a similar measure enacted more than five years previously by the United States Government for the benefit of that portion of its territory bordering on Mexico . On February 5 , 1857 , we adopted our present constitution , which went into operation on the 16th of the following September . On the 1st of December of that year , General Don Ignacio // Comonfort , who had just been elected President under the new constitution , was inaugurated . Two weeks later he unfortunately issued a pronunciamento against the very constitution to which he owed his election and consequently the legality of his powers , and he thereupon dissolved the Federal Congress then in session . Almost all the Mexican States refused to consent to such a daring violation of the constitution , and many of them , specially those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their legislatures granted extraordinary powers to the governors , in order to enable them to defend their institutions against those who had betrayed their trust in trying to overthrow the constitution , acting very much as some of the Brazilian States recently did when the president of that republic , Marshal Diodoro Da Fonseca , attempted to assume the Dictatorship . By virtue of such powers the Governor of the State of Tamanlipas issued on March 17 , 1858 , a decree designed to afford a remedy for the hardships from which the frontier population of that State were then suffering . This decree established what has since that time been known in Mexico as the Free Zone . It permitted all foreign goods intended for the use of the frontier towns of that State , for the ranches in their jurisdiction , or for trade between those towns , to be exempt from all federal duties , but not from municipal or State taxes . Such goods could remain in bond in the same towns either at the house of the importer or at the public warehouse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all packages had to go , of course , to the house of the importer . Thus , goods imported into the frontier towns could remain stored indefinitely without paying any storage or any other charges , to the FederalTreasury , an ( l they only paid import duties when they were taken from the frontier towns to the interior of Mexico . Nothing could furnish a better idea of the true object of the ordinance issued by the Governor of Tamaulipas , if there were room for any well-founded doubt , than the grounds on which he based his action , which he stated in the preamble of his decree in the following words " The citizen Ramon Guerra , Governor ad-interim of the State of . Tarnaulipas : whereas , our towns on our northern frontier are in a state of actual decadence for the lack ot laws to protect their commerce ; and , where- // 463 as , being situated in close proximity to a commercial nation which enjoys free trade they need equal ad vantages in order not to lose their population , which is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desiring to put an end to so serious an evil by means of franchises which have so long been demanded by the frontier trade ; favorably considering the petition of the inhabitants of Matamoras , and using the extraordinary faculties with which I am invested by the decree of December 28 , of the Honorable Legislature of the State , with the advice and consent of the council , I have seen fit to decree as follows , " etc . The articles of the decree which I give below contain the main provisions about the Free Zone and show exactly how far it was intended to go ARTICLE 1. - Foreign goods designed for the consumption of the city of Matamoras and of the other towns on the bank of the Rio Bravo , Reynosa , Camargo , Mier , Guerrero , and Monterey Laredo , and for the trade which these towns carry on among themselves , shall be free from all duties , with the exception of municipal duties and such taxes as may be imposed , to the end that the burdens of the State may be borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in warehouses belonging to private individuals , in the said towns , shall be free of duties so long as they are not conveyed inland to other towns of the State or of the Republic . The terms on which this trade is to be conducted are laid down in the following articles : ARTICLE 7. - Foreign goois leaving the privileged towns to be conveyed into the interior of the Republic shall , at the time or so doing , become subject to the duties laid upon them by the tariff , and they shall never be conveyed into the interior without having paid , at the custom-house of their place of departure , all duties which are required to be paid in the port , and without the observance of all the requirements and provisions of the laws in force , in order not to be molested or detained on their way . The Governor of Tamaulipas foresaw that his decree would naturally facilitate smuggling , to the disadvantage of the Federal Treasury of Mexico ; but I am sm-c he little imagined that the Treasury of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly recommended the citizens of the State to try and prevent such a result by all means in their power , as appears from the following article of his decree ARTICLE 8 -- As the privilege granted by this decree ought not to cause any detriment to the national revenue , it is the duty of the inhabitants of the frontier to prevent , by all the means in their power , this privilege from being converted into a shameful smuggling traffic ; it is , therefore , the duty of every Inhabitant of the frontier voluntarily to become a sentinel , constantly on the watch to prevent smuggling ; otherwise , the Government will be under the painful necessity of withdrawing this privilege , by revoking the present decree . // The Governor 's decree ended with this article : ARTICLE 9. - This decree shall be subject to the revision and approval of the legislature of the State at its next meeting in ordinary session and to that of the Federal Congress when constitutional order shall be restored , although it shall go into force as soon as published in the privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , published , circulated , and duly enforced . Done at Ciudad Victoria , March 17 , 1858 . RAMON GUERRA . Josh MARIA OLVERA , C'hief Offtcia* . The foregoing decree was confirmed and amplified under the plea of establishing regulations for its execution by another decree of the Governor of Tamaulipas , bearing date of October 29 , 1860 . The former decree was submitted , in compliance with the provisions of its last article , to the legislature of the state , and also to the Federal Congress for its approval , and was sanctioned by the latter body July 30 , 1861 . This brief statement will , I think , be sufficient to show that the establishment of the Free Zone was a step taken in fulfilment of the duty of self preservation , so to speak , and imitating similar measures adopted by the Congress of the United States , and that it was by no means a measure approved in a spirit of unfriendliness , much less of hostility , towards the United States , as has been generally believed in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zone is equally unfounded , as I will try to show . The events connected with the foreign intervention in Mexico did not permit the natural effects of the Free Zone to be felt in the country until the Republic returned to its normal condition , that is , until after the downfall of the French intervention and the so-called Empire of Maximilian , events which took place during the year of 1867 . In January of 1868 1 was called to the Treasury Department by President Juarez , and in my annual report to Congress , September 16 of that year , I stated that one of the causes of the then depleted condition of the Mexican Treasury was the large contraband trade that was carried on through the Free Zone and enjoyed by the frontier towns of Tamaulipas ; further remarking that the customhouses of those towns were scarcely able to meet their clerk and office expenses , and that this fact showed that the Free Zone had not made that region prosper ; and that , in my opinion , that insti // tution was not the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true that the privilege granted by the Free Zone to the inhabitants of the northern portion of Tamaulipas to import and consume foreign goods without paying federal duties , to store them in their own houses , and to keep them in bond for an unlimited time , was a powerful incentive to smuggling from the Free Zone either to Mexico or the United States ; and that Mexico , which has suffered greatly by that result , has been obliged , with a view to the repression of smuggling , to establish a costly , oppressive , and complicated system of inspection ; but protection to smuggling was not the object of the creators of the Free Zone , nor is it possible that smuggling should have been carried on to the prejudice of the United States , to the same extent to which it has been done to the disadvantage of Mexico . As the duties levied by the Mexican tariff are much higher than those collected in the United States , it is evident that the most lucrative contraband trade , and the easier one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detriment of the Mexican Treasury . Smuggling is more easily done in Mexico , because the Mexican frontier is very sparsely populated , and therefore the difficulty of guarding it is greatly increased , while the frontier of the United States is more thickly settled and better protected against illicit traffic . It does not seem to me reasonable to imagine that the Free Zone was established for the purpose of encouraging smuggling , to the detriment of the United States Treasury , when in fact it harms Mexico to a much greater extent than it does this country , as , in order to injure the United States , the Mexicans would not be willing to injure themselves ten times as much ; and if the contraband carried on under the shadow of the Free Zone was a sufficient reason for its suppression , the interest of Mexico in this matter would long since have settled the question . Any human institution can be abused by men . The goods stored in the frontier towns of the United States , in accordance with the act of August 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the United States Congress passed that law , they did not intend , of course , to encourage smuggling , to the detriment of Mexico , although such was practically its result . In the same manner the Governor of Tamauhipas at first , and the // Mexican Congress afterwards , did not intend , in establishing the Free Zone , to encourage smuggling , to the detriment of the United States . To prevent smuggling from the Free Zone , as far as this was possible , the Mexican Government has been obliged to duplicate its frontiers of inspection with the United States , at great expense and considerable inconvenience to bona-fide merchants , as it has , besides the custom-houses right on the boundary line with proper inspection between each of them , some distance further south , under the name of fiscal police , another system of custom-houses and inspection to prevent smuggling between the Free Zone and the rest of the country . What would the people of the United States think if Mexico should charge that such provisions of the tariff of this country as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States to encourage smuggling , or if they should demand that the tariff be changed because it did encourage smuggling ? What would the people of this country think if we should ask them to repeal the act of August 30 , 1852 , because it encouraged smuggling in Mexico ? The Mexican people feel exactly as the people of the United States would feel if the circumstances were reversed . I think it will not be amiss to make a few remarks about the different phases that the Free Zone question has assumed in Mexico , since the restoration of the Republic in 1867 . The Committee of Ways and Means of the Fifth Mexican Congress reported , in its session of 1870 , a tariff bill which sanctioned the Free Zone , and this matter was fully discussed during the latter part of October and the beginning of November of that year . Members of the Cabinet have in Mexico , not only the privilege of the floor in both houses , as in the United States , but the right to participate in the debates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treasury of Mexico , I made a thorough study of this important and complicated subject , and I took part in that debate in the sessions of the House of the 28th and 29th of October , and 4th and 5th of November , 1870 , making extended remarks against the Free Zone , and I recommended its abolition to Congress , in behalf of the Executive . The reasons which led me to this conclusion were mainly of a constitutional character , namely , that the Free Zone constituted a privilege in favor of a State , forbidden by our constitution ; and that although I was aware that the situation of the frontier towns // 467 of Mexico required the adoption of suitable remedies , I thought that one could be found of such nature as would embrace the whole country , and be divested of the odious character of a privilege . My efforts were in vain ; Congress voted in favor of the maintenance of the Free Zone ; and although that vote never became a law , the tariff then under discussion nevertheless exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it showed what was the opinion of the representatives of the people on that question . The abolition of the Free Zone was not agitated in Mexico after I left the Treasury Department in November , 1872 . When four years later , in 1878 , I was again at the head of that Department and saw that it was not possible then to abolish the Free Zone , because the frontier influences were then stronger than ever , I thought that we ought at least to make proper regulations , with a view to prevent , as far as possible , any abuses of its franchises , and the regulations of June 17 , 1878 , were then issued . After that there was a strong reaction in favor of the Free Zone , especially when General Gonzalez , a citizen of the State of rfamaulipas became President from 1880 to 1884 . General Diaz succeeded General Gonzalez on December 1 , 1884 , and in a new tariff act issued by him , January 24 , 1885 , the Free Zone , which had been up to that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole frontier , namely , to the States of Coahuila , Chihuahua , and Sonora and to the territory of the Lower California , for a distance of 20 kilometres from the boundary line , thereby placing it on a better footing than it was before , when it appeared as a privilege confined to a single State and denied to others which were exactly in the same condition . But the same tariff act , which so extended the Free Zone , limited considerably its franchises by the regulations contained in Chapter XII . of the tariff of January 24 , 1885 . The frontier towns and the representatives in Congress , however , exerted such pressure in the Federal Congress that by an act dated June 19 , 1885 , the limitations established in that tariff were suspended , and very liberal regulations were again adopted in the succeeding tariff of March 1 , 1887 , which remained in force until the present one of June 12 , // goods coming to the Free Zone , which heretofore had been free of all import duties , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Mexican ports , excepting cattle of all kinds , which will pay full duties . I consider this provision as the beginning of a new system which will finally result in doing away with that institution . As I have already remarked , the opinion of Mexican statesmen on the Free Zone question has been divided , some entertaining the belief that it should be abolished because it grants to one section of the country privileges which are not authorized by the constitution , and others , by far the largest number , holding that , under the circumstances , it was an imperative necessity , as its abolition would be equivalent to the destruction of the frontier . The friends of the Free Zone represented that the frontier towns of Mexico owed their prosperity to that institution , and that they could not exist without it . There was a coincidence , which is one of the causes that induced a great many Mexicans to attribute to the Free Zone more beneficial results than it has really produced , and this circumstance , to which I shall refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension . The situation of the Mexican frontier up to the beginning of the Civil War in the United States was , as I have already remarked , one of poverty and even of misery , and formed a striking contrast with the one existing on the other side of the Rio Grande . That war broke out almost simultaneously with the establishment of the Free Zone , and the situation of the Mexican frontier changed very materially as a consequence of the war , during which , and for some time afterwards , welfare and prosperity crossed from the left to the right bank of the Rio Grande , on account of the general prostration then prevailing in the South . Superficial observers attributed that prosperity not to its true cause , which , in my opinion , was the war , but to the Free Zone ; and feeling convinced that it had been productive of extraordinarily favorable results , they naturally considered it as a panacea for all evils , and its extension as one of the country 's most imperative necessities . The latter opinion finally prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1885 , and this led to the extension of the Free Zone to all the boundary States . There is another point of view of this question , which , in my judgment , has so far passed entirely unnoticed . The Free // 469 Zone is really an advantage to the United States , since , as I have already stated , the Mexican system of legislation concerning customs and excise duties has generally been restrictive and even prohibitory , both by reason of the high import duties and of the existence of inferior custom-houses , and also of State and municipal taxes on foreign goods , which require vigilance and restrictions that can not but hamper business transactions . Any relaxation of such a system of restriction can not but be favorable to foreign nations trading with Mexico , and specially to a neighboring country like the United States , whose manufactures are mainly , if not exclusively , consumed on the Mexican frontier . If the Free Zone has inconveniences for this country much less serious than those which it has for Mexico , it possesses , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto unnoticed . It practically makes of a portion of Mexico a free market for all products and manufactures of the United States , since merchandise of all kinds from this country may be imported into and consumed on Mexican territory duty free , and be warehoused in the region of the zone for an unlimited time . No greater privileges can be asked for the commerce of a nation , and the only drawback in this respect that I see to the Free Zone is that it does not embrace the whole of Mexico . Supposing its privileges were extended to the whole of Mexico , would the United States consider the free admission of their products in my country as prejudicial to their interests ? How strange it appears under this view of the question  --  the idea prevailing here that the Free Zone brings only harm to the United States and has been established to the advantage of only European goods , when the largest amount of goods imported there under its franchises are from th' United States The Government of the United States has been recently trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and specially from the American republics , the free entry , or the admission at a reduced rate of duties , of a limited number of its products and manufactures , and they naturally feel pleased when a new agreement is made . And yet the liberal terms provided by Mexico in favor of the free admission of all the products and manufactures of this country into our Free Zone , has been taken here as an unfriendly act on our part towards this country . There can be no doubt as to the right of the Government of // Mexico to establish such duties and regulations on the foreign trade of the country , even in case they would harm in any manner the mercantile interests of any other foreign nations , and I therefore think it unnecessary to establish the right of Mexico to adopt and maintain the Free Zone . I think it proper on this occasion to state that the misunderstanding which has prevailed here with regard to the object and tendencies of the Free Zone and the manner in which that misunderstanding has been expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a powerful argument to the Mexican defenders of the Free Zone who accuse their opponents of subserviency to this country , attributing to them a design to sacrifice the interests or Mexico to the demands of the United States . It may not be out of place for me to quote here certain views regarding this aspect of the question that I expressed as Secretary of the Treasury of Mexico , in my annual report submitted to the Federal Congress under date of September 16 , 1870 , and which are * follows : " The friendly representations made by the United States Government to that of the Republic in relation to the injury accruing to the United States from the Free Zone are also worthy of being taken into consideration by Congress not that it may seek to please the neighboring nation in a spirit of servility , at the expense of the rights and interests of the Republic , which it is under obligations to care for and uphold above everything else ( which spirit would be unworthy of our national representatives ) ; but as a neighborly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard and treated with consideration in case that in the process of time some difficulty may arise on our northern frontier of such a nature as to possess , regarding Mexico , the character which the Free Zone possesses as regards our neighboring nation ; in order , moreover , that Mexico may acquire a new title to be heard and considered in a cordial and friendly , as well as just and equitable , manner when she may have occasion to offer remonstrances with a view to the protection of her interests . A nation 's dignity is not so well upheld by refusing to consider the moderate and amicable remonstrances of a neighboring nation , as it is by hearing and considering such remonstrances and then acting according to the requirements of justice . " For more detailed information on this subject , and especially for the English translation of some of the official docu ments bearing on the same , I refer the reader to a message which the President of the United States sent to the Senate on March 16 , 1888 ( Senate Exec . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and to the report and accompanying document8 of the Co inni // on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives , on the relations of the United States with Mexico , presented by Mr. Schleicher on the 25th of April , 1878 ( House Report , No. 701 , House of Representatives , Forty-fifth Congress , 2d Session ) . I sincerely hope that the foregoing remarks will in some incasiire contribute to dispel the wrong impressions prevailing in the United States as to the Mexican Free Zone , and that thereby , when the agitation on this subject shall have completely disappeared , it will be then easier to adjust this matter in such amanner as will be honorable and satisfactory to all concerned.
