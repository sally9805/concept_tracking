txt A bold , ingenious , and successful robbery was perpetrated at the Yonkers Savings Bank , at noon to-day . In the very heart of the town , on South Broadway , stand the four banks of the place  --  the Citizens ' National , the First National , the People 's Savings , and the Yonkers Savings Bank , in a row on the east side of the street . The last named is the furthest south , and nearly opposite St. John 's Episcopal Church . South Broadway is the most elevated business street in Yonkers , and the four banks literally overlook the police station and all the more populous part of the city . The street is usually crowded during business hours , and two policemen are kept on patrol in that neighborhood at all hours , with special instructions to keep watchful eyes on the banks . The Two Visitors . In such a situation as this , three unknown men , evidently experts in their line , made the Yonkers Savings Bank the object of their attack in broad daylight to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank and asked Cashier Lyman Cobb , Jr. , to change a dollar bill . Mr. Cobb took the bill and handed out a dollar in fractional silver currency . There was nothing unusual in the transaction , and in less than ay minute the stranger walked away . As he opened the door and stepped into the little vestibule , which is a part of the bank entrance , another unknown man came in . If the two spoke or exchanged any signal Cashier Cobb failed to observe it , and when the second man stepped up to the counter the official greeted him with a nod . " I was to meet a gentleman here at 12 o'clock on a business matter , " said the stranger . " As he does not seem to be here I will wait a few minutes . " " Very well , " responded Mr. Cobb , pleasantly . The visitor , in a perfectly cool and natural way , turned to one of the front windows and stood there , looking out upon the street . Mr. Cobb was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window at the south end of the bank-room , remaining behind the counter all the time . He was there three minutes when the stranger , who stood by the window near the front door , said that he would not wait any longer . " The gentleman that I am expecting is named Williams , " he said . " If he comes in , tell him that I will meet him here at 2 o'clock . " With that he went out . Mr. Cobb walked back to the central part of the bank office , intending to make a memorandum at the counter . Close to where the teller stands is a table about five feet long , which appears to be somewhat in the way when a person is moving across the office . As Mr. Cobb was passing this table he saw under it something that looked like a dog . As he stepped back , he could see that the object moved . He stooped to get a clearer look , and as he did so a man sprang from the floor to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all done in an instant , and Mr. Cobb was completely at the mercy of the robber before he had time to realize what was going on . Facing a . Revolver . " If you say a word or make a move you are a dead man ! " said the intruder , and he kept the weapon pointed in a threatening manner . In one hand the man held a large bunch of bank bills . Mr. Cobb is seventy years of age , and is not in good health , though he has been able to attend to his duties at the bank . He was so completely unstrung at the occurrence that for a moment he had not strength to move or cry out . In this moment the robber backed out of the office door . Then he wheeled and bolted into the street As he left the front door Mr. Cobb sprang to the counter and pressed a button which rang an alarm in the police station , a couple of hundred yards away . Then he followed the robber into the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , on Hudson Street , toward the New York Central Railway station . There was no policeman in sight , but there were a dozen people moving along South Broadway , and at a new building facing the south end of the church four or five laborers were sitting on boxes and boards , eating their dinner from tin pails . The bare-headed old cashier waved his arms and called for help . Mr. Cobb is patriarchal in appearance . He is tall and slender , and his long hair is as white as snow . His face , which is an intellectual one , is almost as white as his hair . His black garments have a clerical cut , for he is in fact a deacon in St. John 's and sometimes occupies the pulpit . Flight of the Robber . His excited manner , rather than any words that he was able to utter , attracted attention , but the robber had fled past the workmen and was down the hill and out of sight before anybody could be made to understand that the bank had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of money into his clothes . The cashier knew that his bank had been robbed , but his ideas at the moment regarding the extent of the loss were vague . What energy he possessed was directed toward raising an alarm and capturing the robber . In a very few seconds it was apparent to the old man that the thief would not be caught then , and he returned to the bank , followed by an eager throng . It did not take long to ascertain that the robber had seized a lot of the bills out of the money drawer , which was partly open and in confusion . A hurried estimate showed that the loss would not be far from $5,000 , and it subsequently developed when the cash remaining in the bank had been counted and the accounts made up , that the amount taken was $4,420 . This included checks for a couple of hundred dollars , which can hardly be negotiated by the robber . The electric alarm brought a number of policemen to the scene on a run , but they were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be done was to hurry men in all directions and telegraph to all nearby railway stations . As there was no train out of Yonkers for thirty minutes , it was concluded that the miscreant and his accomplices were in hiding in the town , or had escaped by the use of horses or bicycles . Mr. Cobb could not give a clear description of any of the three strangers who had been in the bank . They were young men , he said , and his impression was I that they were all medium or under sized . All the movements had been made so rapidly and he was so astonished at the boldness of the crime , that the appearance of the culprits was not well fixed in his mind . Acting on the best clues obtainable the detectives and police went to work with a will . How He Got Into the Bank . All who inspected the bank agreed that the man who took the money from the drawer must have entered while Mr. Cobb was looking out of the window . The cashier agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to the second man who came in , no one could have entered the bank office without being seen . There was only one way to get into the bank , and that was by the front door . There was but one way to get behind the counter also , and that was by a door at the north end of the counter . The furniture is like that in the general run of banks . The room is 35 feet square , and the high black walnut counter runs from the south wall to within a few feet of the north side . There is a curve toward the north end of it , and then it extends eastward so as to inclose the bank office . Along the passage by the north wall is a door in the counter through which people enter the bank proper . A person entering through the front vestibule could easily slip into the jog at the north end of the counter without being noticed by a person standing in the extreme south part of the room . Taking Mr. Cobb 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Acting Chief of Police Frederick H. Woodruff came to the conclusion that there were three men in the crime . He is satisfied that they are " professionals , " and is inclined to believe that they , axe Western men . He said to the correspondent of TEE NEW YORK TIMES that the detectives on his force are pretty well acquainted with New York criminals , and that none of that class from New York have been seen about the place . Theory of the Pollee . His theory is that the three men must have been watching the movements of the bank officials for several days . Mr. Cobb 's son , who is teller in the bank , leaves for dinner usually a few minutes before 12 o'clock , and if there are any of the other officers or employes about , they are in the Directors ' room , in the rear , or in other parts of the building . As a rule , the aged cashier has been the only person behind the counter . J. Henry Williams . Treasurer of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on his papers in the rear room when the robbery was committed , but heard no sound . He was oblivious to the exciting circumstances transpiring around him until half the town had been aroused . The janitor of the building was on an upper floor eating his dinner . The careful calculations with reference to the best time for the robbery and the skill ' of the man who got behind the counter were proof in the Acting ( Thief 's eyes that the culprits are exeperienced criminals . Another thing bearing on this point is the fact that the robber who did the print ' work , in the minute or two that he had behind the counter , grabbed the bills that were in the two end compartments of the money-drawer . It must have been within his knowledge that banks usually keep the bills of large denomination in one end of the drawer . In the Yonkers Bank the onedollar bills were at one end of the drawer and the hundreds at the other . By grabbing at both ends the thief got the ones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the bills were rumpled somewhat . There was a single one-thousand-dollar bill in the end apartment with the hundred-dollar bills , and this the robber made away with also . That the robbers were strangers , the police , as well as the bank officials , were confident , but that was about the extent of the clue that they had to start with . Five Useless Arrests Made . Five arrests were made by dark . The first man who was brought in gave his name as John H. Bush . He was arrested at Mount Vernon an hour or two after the robbery was committed . He had been in Yonkers , selling notions and looking for a situation as clerk . He was able to prove to the satisfaction of the police that he was in another part of the town when the robbery took place . A little later , two photographers , who had been in the bank taking pictures , were arrested , but they were soon released . Toward night a couple of book agents were brought in , but as there appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime they were liberated after a thorough examination . Cashier Cobb saw all of the men , and said they were not the criminals . Mounted policemen scoured the surrounding country all the afternoon . After the five arrests and other futile efforts the authorities were forced to the conclusion that the robbers were still in the city . The utmost vigilance is being exercised to apprehend them , and to-morrow the bank will offer a reward of $1,000 for the arrest or information that will lead to the arrest of the criminals . History of the Bank . The Yonkers Savings Bank was chartered in 1854 , and Mr. Cobb has been with it from the first . He has been cashier for thirty years . His brother , George W. Cobb , is Treasurer of the People 's Savings Bank . Their father was Lyman Cobb , the lexicographer , whose school books were widely used . Cashier Cobb 's son is well known in military circles from his connection with the Fourth Separate Company of Yonkers , of which he was Captain at one time . Robert P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yonkers Savings Bank . The institution has a surplus of $216,000 and deposits of nearly $3,000,000 , so that the loss is not one that will in any degree affect its standing . Its building is a fourstory brownstone , and very handsome and substantial . The bank has experienced two runs within the past sixteen years , both of which , , erved to demonstrate its strength . The bank never keeps very large sums in its vault . It has connections in Albany and New York , where it keeps most of its cash on deposit . A large portion of its resources are in Government , city , town , and school district bonds . The bank associates of the venerable cashier , as well as his family and immediate personal friends , feel that he had a lucky escape . The robbers undoubtedly expected to get a much larger amount of money , and if Mr. Cobb had ? remained at the window long enough to enable the intruder to pocket all the cash in the drawer the loss would have reached about $10,000 . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood open in the same room . Mr. Cobb was nervous to-night , but showed no serious effects of the great strain through which he had passed .
