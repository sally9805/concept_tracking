txt It looks as if Vice President MORTON had distinguished himself , an event that was hardly expected by his most intimate friends . In the coarse of the proceedings on Wednesday in the Senate , Mr. MORTON being in the chair , exercising the modest functions attributed by the Constitution to the Vice President , made a decision on a point of order which was appealed from . Mr. MORGAN of Alabama began to discuss the principle involved in the decision and in the appeal from it , Mr. SHERMAN , with that icy indifference to the feelings of his fellow-members that has made him more feared than beloved , undertook to suppress Mr. MORGAN , informing him and the Vice President that an appeal from a decision of the presiding officer was not open to debate . To the utter amazement of the Ohio Senator , the Vice President in his most affable manner  --  and no manner is more genuinely affable  --  announced his decision that Mr. SUE RM AN was wrong , that Mr. MORGAN was right , and that discusEdon on an appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever may be the custom of the Senate , on the merits of the case Mr. MORTON is clearly correct . If a body like the Senate is asked to overrule a decision of the presiding officer designated directly by the Constitution , as is the Vice President , it is plainly a requirement of common sense that the grounds of both the decision and the appeal should be laid before it . But if Vice President MORTON 'S ruling holds , the death of the Force bill and the gag rule is only a question of time . There is now a question whether Mr. MORTON can be made to reverse his own ruling , but we shall be much disappointed if the Senate do not find this polished gentleman sluzeiter in mode , fortiter in re .
