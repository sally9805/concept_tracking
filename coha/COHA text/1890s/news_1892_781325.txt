txt The Empire State Express , which flies from New-York to Buffalo , is soon to b entirely eclipsed by an electric express traveling at thunderbolt speed over a road as straight as an arrow 's course , if the story be not a dream Which Dr. Wellington Adams unfolded last night to the members of the Electric Club . This wonderful train of the future , according to Dr. Adams , is to run between St. Louis and Chicago . and in comparison with it all of the present " thunderbolt " and " lightning " vestibuled expresses will fade into the insignificance of way trains , fit only for third-class traffic . Dr. Adams is the engineer of the proposed road , and as a company of St. Louis capitalists has raised $6,000,000 to build the road , the dream-stage of the proiect , at least in their minds , appears to have been passed . The tremendous speed of this new railroad is not its only curious feature . The shape and nature of its cars . the track , the roadbed , the mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been accustomed to steam railmade , and not the least curious thing about the whole scheme is the calculation which Dr. Adams made to the effect that one-tenth of all the visitors to the World 's Fair are expected to pay $5 apiece for a round trip on the road . " The plan of the road was suggested to me while in Europe last year . " the doctor said , " and my original plan was to run it from NeviYork to Boston . After returning to America investigated this route and found it to be impracticable for high speed and a straightaway and level track , because of the great number of towns on the way and the hilly nature of the country . Between Chicago and St. Louis we found the courlitions to be perfect . We have surveyed an air line , an absolutely straight line , between the two cities , and the distance is 248 miles . By the Chicago and Alton Railroad it is 282 miles , and by the Wabash Road it is still further . Our route lies between these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alton . We have already acquired over 60 per cent , of the right of way , and we will soon have the rest . The road will cost $6,000,000 , and will he in operation whrn the World 's Fair opens . For 200 miles of the distance the country is as flat as the surface of a billinrd table . Our maximum grade will not exceed ' 2 feet in 100 , and that will occur at only two points , in Madison . County . At present there are 1,200 through passengers between Chicago and St. Louis ou the railroads , and the transportation of the through mails costs $105,000 per annum . We expect to transport 3,000,000 World 's Fair vie , itors at $5 apiece for the round trip . We will have two central stations on the line  --  one at Wilmington or Fairbury , Ill. , and the other at Edinburg . At the latter we have bought a coal mine , and at Wilmington there is a 10,000-horse power waterfall which we will lease , so that we can furnish our Dower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into four Sections , or equal circuits . At first we will build two heavy tracks for through express trains . They will travel at the average rate of 100 miles per hour , and will make no stops between the two cities . We will build spurs out to Springheld . Decatur , Bloomington , and other latge towns . " From Springfield and Decatur through trains will run to Chicago without stop , at the same rate or speed . Eventually we will have a four-track road , with the two outside tracks lot local traffic . The local trains will stop every mile . and will constitute practically a continuous street oar service between Chicago and St. Louis . - Our trains will run into the Union Station at St. Louis over an elevated railroad , and the Chicago terminus will be at the fair grounds . We have secured the right of way for twentynine miles out of Chicago , and we are all right at the St. Louis end . The roadbed will be sloping with a permits bottom , and there will be a ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each set . This will prevent the see tling of the tracks . We will use the seventy-pound California continuous , overlapping rail , with stone ballast , and all crossings will be overhead out road The trolley , or overhead wire system , will be used . The wire will run along about on a level with the side of the roof of the car . " The car will weigh only fifteen tons , and will carry forty passengers . The roof will be only ninety feet above the top of the rails . Every oar will be a motor oar and passenger coach combined . The passenger compartment will be in the middle section of the car . The forward end of the oar will have the shape of a half cone , and will come down to a point near the ground and between the centre of the tracks . The motor man will stand in the front compartment . There will be a pilot wheel on each side of the ear at the front and rear , and a driving wheel 6 feet in diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the car is calculated to decrease the atmospheric resistance , and It will also serve as a cowcatcher . " At the rear of the car will be a compartment for mall and baggage . On each driving wheel will be a motor weighing 6,132 pounds , and capable of 200-horse power at a speed of 500 revolutions of the wheel per minute . The armature will be mounted rigidly on the axle of the driving wheeL Each car will be equipped with air and electric brakes . " The poles for the trolley wire will be so constructed that the wire will not sag and thus interfere with the speed and motion of the train when traveling at a high velocity . There will be but a single wire for each set of tracks , and through this wire we can develop an electric power of 25,000 voltage . The trolley wheel will be twelve inches in diameter . The entire road will be fenced In and will be divided into twenty-five sections . with a transforming station at the centre of each section . By our system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we will need no conductors or brakemen . " Dr. Adams illustrated his lecture with many stereopticon views of the abposed road , oars , motors , Sc . At its conclusion several members of the club expressed mild regret that he had not given away the actual secrets of his motors and the method by ' which be tranamittted so much power through a single wire . Dr. Adams smiled , but did not further elucidate . Civil Engineer George Forbes of London commended the scheme of the proposed road , but confessed it puzzled him .
