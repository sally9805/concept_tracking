txt The relations of the different portions of the English-speaking race to each other and the common mission of the race , if it has one , are subjects which Americans generally , trained on panegyrical history , have hitherto seen too much through the eyelet hole of an antiquated feud with the memory of a King for whose misdeeds no living man is any more responsible than for the misdeeds of the Pharaohs or Sennacherib . That liberal spirits are now rising to a worthier point of view Mr. Carnegie 's article , " A Look Ahead , " in a recent number of THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW was a proof . Anglo-phobia is slowly giving way in American literature to moral breadth and historical justice , though its traditional force is still great , and in the writings of politicians it is apt to be affected , whether it is felt or not , as a tribute to conventional sentiment . Its last and not least strange manifestation is the work of an anglo-phobiac who labors in two bulky volnines to widen and prolong the schism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not from the mother country of New England , but from the mother country of New Amsterdam , in which it seems they had been studied by a party of religious peasants , who , during their brief sojourn , shrank , as we are expressly told , from the contagious influence of Dutch society and departed because they feared that it would absorb their children and that their English nationality would be lost . A common language is in itself a most important bond of union . As few men comparatively read or speak any language but their own , the ideas and sentiments of the race must , so far as they are formed by reading , be cast into the mould of the common literature , in which the character of the mass is sure to prevail . While the American has been nursing ancestral hatred of England he has been undergoing the influence of the English authors upon his table . But all communities of British origin also show a marked and peculiar tendency to parliamentary government , // personal liberty , and freedom of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other races by their respect for law . If the race has a distinct mission it would seem to be to extend the reign of law . Wherever the British flag advances , in ilindustan , Egypt , or elsewhere , the dominion of law advances with it , and beneath it no Hindoo ryot or Egyptian fellali can be deprived of the smallest article of property without due legal process , or of life or liberty without regular and open trial . France may be making her tn-color , we are making our Great Charter , go round the world . Despite is done not only to the dignity of the race but to its collective duty to hnmanity when one portion of it helps a race less law-abiding in setting its neck upon another portion . A moral reunion of the race , with a common pride in its common history and a consciousness of the part which collectively it has played and may yet play in the development of humanity , seems not very far from realization . By the opening prospect and the warm sense of returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been generated in some minds . A vision of this kind floats through Mr. Carnegie 's paper . But such a thing as a political or even a diplomatic unity of the English-speaking communities scattered over the globe is surely inconceivable . Supposing such a union possible , what definite object would it have ? Where would its centre be ? Who would direct its policy ? By its irresistible power , we are told , it would impose peace upon the world . Unfortunately , consciousness of irresistible power is more apt to incline to aggression than to the enforcement of peace , while the jealousy which such combination would excite could hardly fail to lead to counter-combination and call the rest of the world to arms . Besides , while there are important elements of nuity in the race , there are also important elements of diversity arising from the local admixture in unequal proportions of alien blood , from variety of circumstances attendant on dispersion over two hemispheres , and from the shades of character prodnced by living under institutions radically , perhaps , the same yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalization laws might not be impracticable ; otherwise to nothing beyond a moral reunion , it would seem , can we rationally aspire . To a moral reunion of the English-speaking race , assuming , // as we probably may , that the influence of the Irish vote is transitory , there is apparently but one serious impediment . That impediment is the intrusive presence of Great Britain as a political power in this continent , with the constant irritation and frequent disputes which her presence inevitably breeds . For this the men of the American Revolution have to answer , since , when they expelled the loyalists , they constrained Great Britain to provide the exiles with a new home , and bound her in honor to keep her flag flying over them there . The question of the relations between Canada and the United States has been brought up for practical discussion not only by the tariff and the McKinley Act but by the movement in favor of Imperial Federation , which aims at finally severing Canada from this continent and incorporating her in a federation , the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmanship can not blink the issue . The question wlmcther this continent shall be nnited or whether it shall be divided , and a power antagonistic to the American Republic shall be formed to the north of it , is surely the one subject of external policy which is of vital importance to the American people . The American people expended , as it is reckoned , eight billions of money and a million of lives to rectify their relations with five millions of whites at the South , though the five millions of whites brought with them four millions of blacks amid a problem still defying solution . Will they treat as a matter of imjdifference the cheap and bloodless rectification of their relations with five millions of whites at the North unencumbered with any fatal appendage ? If the South commanded the mouth of the Mississippi , the North commands the mouth of the St. Lawrence . I have said " a power antagonistic to the American Republic . " Where separation is natural it may be friendly ; where it is unnatural it is pretty sure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . England and Scotland being in the same island , so that separation was unnatural , there was constant hostility between them , and Scotland was always leaguing herself with England 's enemies , until they were united . The connection of Canada as a dependency is morally with that party in England which is distinctively imperialist and unfriendly to American institutions , as was shown by its course at the time of the American civil war . The Toronto Ern*pire is the recognized // organ of the Tory and Imperialist party in Canada , and of the recent utterances of this journal one of its contemporaries says : These are days of wild joy about the office of The Empire . The daily bulletin that tells of commercial stringency and financial disaster in the United States it rolls as a sweet morsel over its tongue . Each piece of news that tells of distress and business shipwreck across the line is hailed with enthusiasm , and gloatingly enlarged on , and exaggerated with a malicious delight which can he accounted for on no reputable ground that suggests itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the misfortunes of a neighbor , the editorial columns of the paper for months past have contained an almost daily discharge of venom against the people of the United States . The Columhian Exposition in Chicago has afforded a splendid opportunity for a diurnal outpouring of spleen , petty enough , it is true , but , nevertheless , indicative of the spirit that prompts it . This , it will be observed , is at a time of perfect outward amity ( for the Behring Sea controversy hardly touches easter Canada ) , when Mr. Cleveland , whom Canadians regard as a friend , is President and when Canada is looking for tariff concessions at his hands . At the last general election the Conservative party distinctly appealed to anti-American feeling , as Americans failed not to note . They will have noted also that efforts have been made of late to revive old antipathies by celebrating events in the war of 1812 , and by decorating the graves of those who fell in the Fenian raid . Of the Canadians themselves few , probably , believe that things can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twenty years in Canada I have seldom met with a Canadian who , if he had thought at all freely on these matters , did not in private avow or betray his conviction that a change must some day come . The perpetual dependence of a free community on one side of the Atlantic upon a community on the other side is an arrangement which , though some may be personally willing to prolong it , few would pronoun*e reasonable or eternal . It is but the lingering shadow of what once was imperial sway . Its only assignable advantage to the dependency is the military protection of Great Britain , and this is needed only because Canada , as a British dependency , is involved in BritIsh quarrels , while , if Great Britain were engaged in a war with maritime powers , it would hardly avert the destruction of Canadian trade . Imperial federation , independence and continental // union are the courses among which many , perhaps most , Canadians feel that a choice must presently be made . That the question of their destiny is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to see . By the Imperial Federationists themselves the subject is pressed on the ground that the supreme moment has come , and that the cable , now worn to the last strand , must be replaced by a fresh cable or the connection will cease . Imperial Federation as a generous dream is entitled to sympathy and respect , but at present it is an aspiration without form and void . Its advocates conjure us not to ask for a plan , but to cultivate the sentiment , which in the case of Canada means cultivating such feelings as will estrange us from the United States . I have elsewhere endeavored to state the objections to any assignable form of a union , the general object of which has not been stated any more than the means by which it is to be brought about , the structural difficulties of which are enormous , ariA which runs directly counter to the prevailing tendencies of the age . There has been much outpouring of eloquence in favor of Imperial Federation , with free denunciation of unbelievers , but no practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme . During all the years when Lord Beaconstield , the high priest of Imperial aggrandizement , was in power , not only was nothing done by government , but no serious motion was brought forward in Parliament . Lord Salisbury , another strong Imperialist , was approached in vain . He sanctioned a convention , but confined it to questions of postal arrangements and other matters of that kind , which had no more to do with Imperial Federation than they had with the nebular hypothesis . If Imperial Federation meetings are numerously attended in Canadian cities it is largely by protectionists , who are ready to embrace anything that offers itself as a bulwark against American competition , but dread British competition just as much , and would at once fly off if they were asked to consent to free trade between the colonies and Great Britain , which is an essential part of the Federationist idea . By the French Canadians , tenacious of their separate nationality , the name of Imperial Federation is abhorred . Nor does the scheme of a fiscal federation of the Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies and dependencies differ from each other so widely in their com // mercial circumstances that there can be little hope of devising a fiscal system which will commend itself to them all . To independence , I must confess , I was myself at one time inclined . At all events I felt a strong sympathy with the band of young Canadians who , inspired by the achievement of confederation and by the appeals addressed to their patriotism on that occasion , were setting out to make Canada a nation . But the movement found little support , and though it is now being revived in opposition to continental union it seems not to have much strength in itself . In some quarters , probably on the part of its ostensible advocates in Quebec , independence is only a cover for continental union , for which there is a timorous reluctance in face of tradition and conventional sentiment openly to declare . It could hardly be anything but a half-way house . The provinces are too totally wanting ifl unity , geographical , economical and even ethnological ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being equal to its absorption , gains instead of losing intensity , and is thrusting out the British population from every part of the Province except the commercial quarter of Montreal . There is little inter-provincial trade , except what is forced by a stringent system of protection . Nor is there any barrier , of language or of any other description , to keep the Dominion separate from the mass of population to the south of it , with which its own population is rapidly commingling , with which its commerce and its banks are wound up , with which it is connected by an identical railway system , which contains its winter ports , from which it receives its periodical literature , with which it has churches , brotherhoods , and societies of all kinds in common , and to which it is increasingly attracted by social influences and family ties . If there were anything special to be conserved in Canada , a Canadian or a social philosopher might , for the sake of it , be willing to bear the expense of a separate government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all events for which the elastic liberality of the Federal system would not leave free scope . That the best relation between the two sections of the race on this continent and the only one on which they can permanently rest is that of equal and honorable union is the conviction to which I have been led not without consideration of the arguments on the other side , or even , as I have said , without at one // 176 time inclining to a different view . That it is the natural relation , and that separation is artificial , a glance at the map will show . Suppose those four blocks ef territory , advancing separately from the habitable continent into the region of ice and snow , had never been divorced from the main mass , would anybody dream of divorcing them now ? Would he not be deemed a lunatic who should propose it ? The severance was the wd4k of pure historical accident and of a quarrel as devoid of any permanent significance as a quarrel can be . Can we imagine that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both parties are manifest and are hardly denied by those who , on what they think higher grounds , oppose the measure . It would exclude war from North America and dedicate the whole continent securely to peaceful industry and progress . It would remove all internal customs lines and impediments to trade . It would make the St. Lawrence , the fisheries , the sealing grounds , and all the privileges which are now the subject of perpetual disputes , the undisputed heritage of all . It would open the whole field , including Manitoba and the Canadian Northwest , to the free flow of population . It would call forth the mineral wealth , now dormant , of the North by admitting Canadian capital and enterprise to a region which they are now prevented from freely entering by mistrust of a foreign jurisdiction . The commercial benefits which it would confer on Canada by putting an end to the commercial atrophy necessarily attendant on her present state of isolation need not be rehearsed . Not only is the home market of Canada small as a whole , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freights , between them . Commercially the position of Ontario and Quebec is what that of two not very wealthy American States if taken out of the Union would be . The existing States of the Union on the other hand would gain commercially by the accession of Canadian States , just as they have gained by the admission of any other new States , say of Minnesota or Dakota . Those who protest against giving a market of sixty-five millions for a market of five millions fall into the singular fallacy of imagining that an addition is a subtraction when the less is added to the greater . Another advantage of union which presents itself strongly at the present moment is the power which it would afford of // dealing uniformly with continental problems . Of those problems the most urgent is immigration . We need not here discuss the Chinese question . It is sufficient that , as nobody will deny , the question whether the Pacific coast of this continent shall be opened , with a prospect of its being at last socially ceded , to a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on any hypothesis one of the most vital kind . But it can not be solved , nor can an immigration of Chinese or of any other alien nationality be effectually controlled unless the whole continent is brought under one jurisdiction . At present , when the front door is closed by Congressional legislation , a back door is opened in Canada , and the practical result of American interdiction is that the Canadian Government raises a small revenue by the transmission of Chinese through its territory into the United States . It is more to the purpose to estimate the objections to union than to proclaim the advantages of its accomplishment . When the subject is mentioned to Americans two bugbears present themselves . One of these is the Roman Catholic population of French Canada , which , it is supposed , would from its religious character and its reactionary tendencies form a dangerous element in the Republic . The continent would be fortunate if it were not likely to receive any worse addition to its inhabitants than the French of Quebec . They are backward , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial activity , because they have been kept back by the influences , ecclesiastical and social , to which they are subjected in their state of isolation . But they are good people , kindly by nature , courteous , eminently domestic like the country people of France , frugal and generally moral , their clergy having , to do it justice , taken great care of their morality . Politically , they have been the victims of systematic corruption which has not failed to affect their character . But they are free from any tendency to political conspiracy or cabal . They are also free from the tendency to industrial wars , and make , it appears , good and tractable workmen in the factories of New England . Though the forces of Canada are inadequate to the assimilation of the French , by the forces of the United Continent they would probably be assimilated , for all essential purposes , not less easily than the French of Louisiana ; more easily , perhaps , since they are closer to the centre of influence , and are not estranged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is , that the Roman Catholic French of Quebec are not to be kept out of the United States by keeping them out of the Union . Into the Northeastern States they are annually pouring , and the volume of immigration will increase with the continuance of the fiscal isolation , the pressure of which is specially felt by Quebec , as her natural products are unfit for exportation to Europe . In fact , the present arrangement is the worst for the United States that could be devised , since separation keeps the people of Quebec under the dreaded influences , and , when they have been trained under those influences , drives them into the United States . Union would bring the nest from which the swarm goes forth under the liberalizing influences of the Republic . If we turn from French Canada to the Canadian Northwest we find that there , while the natural inflow of American immigration is barred by the political line , the region is being artificially filled with Mennonites , Icelauders , Roman Catholic crofters from Skye , colonies from the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , but which , if manifest destiny ever prevails , must be incorporated in the American commonwealth . An American will , perhaps , be pleased when he reads in Canadian papers that there is a perpetual exodus into the United States of the flower of Canadian youth* but his satisfaction might be diminished if he knew the sort of immigration from Europe by which tbe void is partly filled , and which some day may be incorporated in the United States . The second bughear is the Canadian vote , which , it is imagined , would be solid , and would upset the balance of the American party system . This fear is baseless . As has been already said there is among the provinces no natural unity , geographical , commercial , or ethnological . They have been held together and made to form the basis for the Ottawa government by the continual exertion of government influence , Each of them , when it was in the Union , would be drawn to the States which it would adjoin and with which it would be identified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , or between Ontario and those maritime provinces which French Canada cuts off from it , would be the most unlikely thing in the world . Whether the majority of Canadians would go into the Republican or IDemocratic party only astrology can undertake to fcretell , That a recollection of their separate existence with // their local traditions and feeling would dispose the Canadians , or at least the British part of them , to cherish local self-government and repel the encroachments of central power is most probable . Little else can be predicted . Solid Canadian vote , Americans may be assured , there will be none . That extension of territory should be rather dreaded than desired is a proof of the wisdom and morality of the American people . But the extension in this case would be not only peaceful but natural . It would be the manifest dictate of nature . The recent admission of six new States is not felt to have been attended with the slightest fear of disruption . No such danger can there ever be till there is formed a line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Free ; and when the tariff question has once been settled there will remain no prospect of anything of the kind . The elasticity of the federal system renders it capable of indefinite extension so long as geographical unity is maintained , and federal government , while it observes its proper limits , will be known only as the source of benefits and immunities against which nobody is likely to rebel . If three hundred millions of Chinese can live under one government so surely can a hundred millions of Anglo-Saxons . Some Americans , feeling that American democracy is after all not the last word in politics , think two experiments bettee than one . That they should prefer political instruction to territorial aggrandizement or commercial gain shows that they are profoundly wise . But there is not in reality a double experiment . The two democracies , though one has a vice-regal coronet on its head , are in all essential respects identical . There is no material difference in the suffrage . Organized party is the real power undci both constitutions , and its machinery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So is the relation between political morality and that of common life . The distinctive part of the Canadian arrangement is the adoption of the British system of cabinet government , with a legislature subject to dissolution at the pleasure of the Prime Minister , who advises , and if his advice were not taken , would depose the representative of the Crown . But British institutions , especially when they rest not on written laws but on traditional understandings , require British statesmen for their oneration . Otherwise the result is a disappointment , likG that of my lord who bought the puppet show without the // showman . Of the dependence of the executive on the vote of the legislature the practical result is a constant effort on the part of the executive to corrupt the legislature and the constituencies by which it is elected . Municipal government and its liabilities are the same on both sides of the line . So far as political affinity is concerned Canada would fall at once with the greatest ease into the party system of the United States . Hardly a wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , perhaps , presented by the difference between the two banking systems of the two countries and the relation of the American system to government securities . The day will , perhaps , come when governments will understand that their duty is simply to stamp the coin , or to provide any special safeguards in the case of banks of issue which circulation may require , and that they have no more business to interfere with the money trade or to appropriate a share of its profits than they have to interfere with the dry-goods trade or to dip their hands into the till of the dry-goods firm . The change of flag again is a point which , whenever negotiations for reunion are set on foot will call for considerate treatment . Strong feeling , however , on this subject , like the anti-unionist sentiment generally , has its chief seats in Toronto and one or two other cities where the flag is daily seen and of late has been industriously displayed . In the rural districts the flag is not often seen . The shock caused by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , Scotch , and Irish flags underwent great changes at the unions , and half a dozen of the great European powers at least , besides France , have , within the last century , changed their flags , adopting in place of their ancient standards mostly varieties of the tricolor . The Canadians , nearly a million in number , who are now south of the line , have all come under the Stars and Stripes apparently with little compunction or suffering . That an inclination towards union with the rest of their continent is spreading , in rural Canada especially , seems to me a fact , which anxious and vehement denial only cQnflrms . That the sentiment is commercial rather than political and arises from a desire of the American market rather than of American institutions is tine . But political change is seldom sought for itself or without the belief that it will bring some material benefit // or relief from some material evil . By the agitations for commercial union and unrestricted reciprocity the minds of the people have been awakened to the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reciprocity treaty has taught them that there is no security for permanence but union . On the other hand , it may safely be said that the political abhorrence of union , of which much has been said by one of our ex-Governors-General and others who have discussed this question in the American press , has hardly any real existence so far as the mass of the Canadian people is concerned . That a Continental Unionist can not hope to be elected to Parliament is true only in this sense , that the nominations in Canada , as in the United States , are made by the party conventions , and neither of the Canadian parties has yet declared for continental union . It is most untrue if it means that a man well known to be personally in favor of continental union finds it impossible or even difficult on that account to get his election . Continental Unionism has no metropolitan organ , because the cities are the chief centres of the opposite party , and the advertising is in protectionist hands . But it has a good deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press . At the same time there is a powerful opposition , political , commercial , and social , besides that vis inerliw , which , whether it be a real force in physics or not , is a real force in politics . There is the Governor-General with his court at Ottawa , and the LieutenantGovernors of the Provinces . There is the official class , naturally desirous of keeping the government at Ottawa . rfhere are the members of the Ottawa Legislature in both Houses who do not feel sure of translation to Washington . There are the protected manufacturers who form a powerful and compact phalanx , how powerful and how compact Americans know full well . There is a body of government contractors and others connected with government works . There are lawyers looking to governrnent for judgeships and holding government briefs . There is the Anglican Church , monarchical in the colonies , as well as at home . Nor is the influence of British titles and of admission to the British court and aristocratic circles on the rich trifling ; it is surprisingly great considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of gentility is cultivated by the assumption of superiority to Yankees . In Canadian cities , as in every commercial community , // there is a love of holiday soldiering , the Yankee being the imaginary foe . The strength of all these elements combined and uniting their powers of influence or intimidation in addition to the force of traditional or conventional sentiment can be easily understood ; and it will be readily believed that in face of it the expression of sincere opinion is much restrained , and that a visitor or a reporter seeking to gauge Canadian sentiment may be greatly led astray . Those who have watched the course of Canadian opinion during the last twenty years will not believe that the obstacles to reunion are insurmountable ; but to overcome them the concurrent efforts of its friends 011 both sides of the line will be required . Something in the nature of a plebiscite will also be necessary in order to take fairly the verdict of the Canadian people . At a general election questions of all kinds are thrown together and all sorts of influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British or Anti-American sentiment , there can hardly be said to be when a truly Canadian nationality has not been formed , Quebec , which is geographically the keystone of the confederation , having a French nationality of its own . Nor , for the same reason , would there be any loss of grandeur by incorporation with a nation which it may fairly be assumed will before long be the greatest in tile world . On the other hand , to the list of impediments is now to be added the overmastering power of the Canadian Pacific Railway . This corporation , though its road was built by public money for a public purpose , does not scruple to make an open and streminous use of its influence in politics on the Tory side . The growth of local influence at tile expense of national policy in the United States has been marked of late years . The case of Quebec , which though alien in race forms geographically the keystone of the confederation , stands by itself . In that Province there is no British influence and the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as remain is slight . Here the force adverse to union has been the priesthood , which wished to keep Quebec to itself , looking on American liberalism as dangerous both to souls and to tithes . But the immense exodus from the Province , which is the result of commercial atrophy and which is likely to render the collection of tithes more difficult as well as to reduce the numbers of the // flock , together with the awakening in the Province itself of in - fluences such as wait on railways and other progressive agencies , has of late been relaxing the sinews of clerical reaction ; and if the I*oman Catholic clergy of the United States show themselves favorable to union it is not likely that the resistance of their brethren in Quebec will be very strong . Among the serious obstacles to reunion need not be reckoned British opposition , if once the decision of Canada in favor of union is declared . Canada has been almost officially told that she is at liberty , whenever she thinks fit , to become independent ; and if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forbid her making use of her independence by uniting herself politically to the continent of which she forms a part . It is true that of late there has been in England a wave of imperialist sentiment . But it is confined to a small and imaginative class . Among the democracy , which has now the upper hand , the desire of checking democratic progress in this hemisphere by means of a monarchical and aristocratic Canada does not exist . Friendship and trade with the American people are what the British democracy desires , and its leaders would be perfectly open to the argument that these objects could be secured only by resigning a political supremacy which is dangerous as well as barren and ceasing to interfere with the development of humanity on a continent with which Great Britain has politically nothing to do . It is always taken for granted that in any negotiations for union the authority of the mother country as well as Canada 's freedom of choice will be duly recognized and her sanction sought for any change . The dealings of the Government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been a cause for pride . First , by the denial of amnesty to the Loyalists a hostile community was formed in the north , and Great Britain , who very likely would have retired , was compelled in honor to retain her position here . Natural affinities , however , at length prevailed , and by 1812 , as we learn from the dispatches of Preyost and Brock , the American connection had so far taken hold on Canada that Canadians were extremely unwilling to obey the call to arms . By that miserable war all was thrown back . Before 1837 a party favorable to American connection had again // formed , but the people of the United States left it to its fate , permitting on that occasion just enough of filibustering on the border to revive ill feeling between the two communities . In 1854 there was a strong movement in favor of union on commercial grounds , and a manifesto was signed by a large number of leading men in the colony , including the late Premier of the Dominion . This Lord Elgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , the Democratic party playing into his hands because they feared that Canada , if brought into the Union , would turn the balance against slavery . The next stage in the history was the Fenian raid , which the American Government permitted in its resentment against the British aristocracy , of whose offences Canada was entirely innocent . At the same time the reciprocity treaty was denounced . Once more the evil spirit was evoked . The other day a movement was set on foot on both sides of the line in favor of commercial union , which , though it would have left the political question untouched , would have been pretty sure , from the intimacy of the connection which it would have formed , the general relations of the two peoples being what they were , to lead in the end to union pure and simple . This policy received the nnanimous support of the house of IRepresentatives and failed by only one vote of unanimous support in the Senate . We were beginning to build on its success when suddenly it was not only renounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the McKinley Act . Now another change of policy looms in view . In face of such gyrations how can unionist combination and effort be carried on ? The first thing needed if continental union is to be brought about will be something like a steady and consistent policy on the part of the Washington administration , combined with a bearing perfectly friendly towards Canada . President Harrison was little studious of sentimental effect and he never showed Canada the friendly side of the shield . Is a steady and consistent policy possible for a democracy , the government of which is always changing hands ? Can party , where it is the ruling power , be so far restrained within the bounds of patriotic duty as to refrain from factions maneuvring when vital objects of external policy are concerned ? Has the American people in renouncing immoral aggrandizement also re // nounced national aspiration ? Can local interests , when a great question presents itself , be kept in subordination to the interests of the whole country ? These are queries which the treatment of the Canadian question by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to answer , and the answer will not be devoid of instruction as to the probable future of government by the people.
