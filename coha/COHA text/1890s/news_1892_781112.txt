txt Now that the authoritative announcement has been made that a new Republican morning newspaper is to enter the field here some time next month , independent Democrats and Republicans are earnestly discussing the advisability of starting a morning paper to be conducted on the same lines as THE NEW-YORE TIMES , a paper to be run in the interests of the public , and in pronounced opposition to all political gangs . In conversation to-day with Mr. Harris Van Nes , a wealthy Gars man-Ameriean Independent , on the floor of the Produce Exchange , County Clerk Peasley , an Independent Democrat of high social standing and also a warm admirer of Grover Cleveland . said : " If we had had a Democratic morning paper in this city like THE NEw-YORE Trams we should have carried Hamilton County , and Ohio would have been in line for Mr. Cleveland . Our candidates did not receive any assistance from the morning papers . " Lawyer Charles T. Greve said : " I think ts two-oent Democratic morning- newspaper starts ed Cincinnati would be a big success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able young lawyers who was nominated by the local Demooratie machine for Congress in the First District , apparently that he might be slaughtered at the polls . He is known throughout the county a an ardent supporter of Mr. Cleveland . A friend of Mr. Greve , in referring to the recent campaign , said : " The Democratic machine in Hamilton County did not command the confidence of in ? dependent Democrats and Republicans who voted for Mr. Cleveland , and so the machine could not raise any money of any account . The ' goal Democratic paper , which is in accord with the machine , was for seven weeks silent editorially concerning the nominations of Messrs . Greve and Bowler , two . Cleveland men who were nominated for Congress . For weeks the paper was silent editorially concerning the candidacy or Greyer Cleveland . " " If an Associated Press franchise could be secured for Cincinnati , " said Mr. Van Nes , " I believe that alone I could secure $200,000 toward the amount necessary to start a twocent morning Democratic newspaper , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to political gangs . Hamilton County has a population of 400,000 souls . Within a radius of less than 100 miles of Cincinnati a new morning newspaper conducted after the style of Tun NEW-YORK TIMES could appeal to over 500,000 people . We have no Democratic morning newspaper in Hamilton County . In the last campaign Mr. Cleveland did not have the support of a Democratic daily in this city . " Similar statements were made to THE TIMMS 'S correspondent by various solid men of Cincinnati . One of the number said : " There are ten daily papers issued in this city , six printed in the German language . There are two evening newspapers and two morning papers printed in English . We want badly not a mere morning paper , but a morning newspaper , for social as well as political reasons . We want a newspaper that will not be offensive to good taste . Let me illustrate and here the speaker picked up a newspaper " Here is a specimen of the way Cincinnati papers treat local events . The envier Club had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dinners . In Newyork oysters are not regarded with reverence , nor are they here , except by the papers . Yet the Cincinnati scribe grabs his pen when oysters are served , and picturesquely writes as follows : First on the menu were the oysters , fat , solemn , and silent . They lay in artistic confusion in a circular depression in a huge block of crystalline ice , quietly taking on a delicious degree of frigidity that was soothing to the palate , hot and dry with anticipated delight . ' " Glancing again at the description of the Cavier dinner , the speaker said : " From a reading of this sort of thing , people East would be apt to think that oysters and snipe are groat delicaoles in Cincinnati , and that we are very ill-bred persons . Hear what our local historian says about broiled snipe : " ' The punch finished , the servers came forth with tiny plates , each bearing a triumph of the chef 's art In the form of a snipe , broiled , laid on a bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine sauce . The gourmands smiled as they tore the tender little breasts and tasted the glorious flavor of the tiny little hire , and , as they smacked their lips , passed a favorable verdict , ' " Imagine a party of gentlemen smacking their lips in unison after eating snipe , " ex- ' claimed the irritated critic , of the Cincinnati historian . He paused for a moment as if to take breath , and then resumed : " If an Eastern newspaper man wrote in that style about a Manhattan Club dinner , I have no doubt his paper would fire him out . I road in the NewYork papers a pleasing series of reports about the chrysanthemum show in your pity . Well , we had a flower snow here , and how did the papers treat it 2 Everything that the reporter here sees suggests something to eat , and so in writing . of our chrysanthemum show a local scribe said : " There is no valid reason why the chrysanthemum , either as a hot vegetable or a cold salad , should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there would seem to be every probability in this country at least , should chrysanthemums become popular as an adjunct to our bells of fare , of a very extensive supply of the flowers being available for the delight of a novelty-socking and hungry public . Boiled and eaten hot , chrysanthemum flowers are said to be delioloue . Why not 1 ' " What was the result of this tom-fool advice " exclaimed the oritie , when he finished reading . Why , a party of young women residing on Walnut Hills boiled and ate a potful of chrysanthemums , and a physician had to be called to attend to them . Fortunately for the young women , the newspapers did not get on to the case . These young women can not look at a chrysanthemum now without feeling faint We can place no confidence in what we read . Let me illustrate again . Cincinnati has within its borders a large number of cultivated lovers of music . Wo want to patronize good singers and good musicians . In reading the musical noticee I often find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in New-York could not earn enough to pay for her washing by singing . Lot me read : " We will have a genuine treat this week in hearing Miss Blank sing . She has the finest voice of any woman in America , and it she had not been born in this country would have been acknowledged the equal of Patti in her beat days . " " A few days ago , " said the critic , as he lighted a fresh cigar , " Jack Chinn , a Kentucky turfman , drew a dirkknife and tried to disembowel a St. Louis man . In the report of the uncommon incident our papers announced somewhat regretfully that Chinn had been shot , and then in a most respectful way told how he had used his dirk on former occasions . Having described China 's bloody exploits , and probably feeling that ho might be offended 9ver the references to his little eccentricities , the local historian said admiringly : " Chinn is a man of desperate courage , a terrible enemy , and a devoted friend . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pew men . have more fast friends than Jack Chinn , because he made it a point to deserve them . ' " And now , in conclusion , let me read you an extract from a letter , which is printed *weekly for the alleged edification of women in one of our leading papers : " ' As to the style or shoulder-showing corsage , illustrated in the first picture , I wrote descriptively enough last week . I may add , however , that to the girl of the present period It will bo given to experience a kiss long out of fashion . The kiss of respect and formality has always been that upon the hand . Respect and formality have been out of fashion some time in our society , yet the purport of such a salutation is always evident .. The kiss upon the forehead Lae always been that of calm affection and good-will . A kiss between these two . in sentiment as well as geographlosdlY , has lone been consigned to ( Maim that upon the round of the shoulder . Doubtless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulder lends itself only to a kiss animated by an affection that is tempered . and that Is prompted by respect rather than ardor .
