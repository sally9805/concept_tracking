// prised to find that she was carrying out some ideal , some fancy or whim , possibly nothing more , but springing from some generous , youthful impulse . Perhaps she is working for that little sister at the Blind Asylum . How did she come to understand French ? She did certainly blush , and betrayed every sign of understanding the words spoken about her in that language . Sometimes she sings while at her work , and we have all been struck with the pure , musical character of her voice . It is just such a voice as ought to come from that round white throat . We made a discovery about it the other evening . The Mistress keeps a piano in her room , and we have sometimes had music in the evening . One of The Teacups , to whom I have slightly referred , is an accomplished pianist , and the two Annexes sing very sweetly together , - the American girl having a clear soprano voice , the English girl a mellow contralto . They had sung several tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is our Delilah 's real name . She whispered to the young girl , who blushed and trembled . " Do n't be frightened , " said the Mistress encouragingly . " I have heard you singing Too Young for Love , ' and I will get our pianist to play it . The young ladies both know it , and you must join in . " The two voices , with the accompaniment , had hardly finished the first line when a pure , ringing , almost childlike voice joined the vocal duet . The sound of her own voice seemed to make her forget her fears , and she warbled as naturally and freely as any young bird of a May morning . Number Five came in while she was singing , and when she got through caught her in her arms and kissed her , as if she were her sister , and not Delilah , our table-maid .

EVERYBODY knows that a fire-engine horse is a large , strongly built , handsome animal , with a broad forehead and an intelligent eye . He wears neither check nor blinders , and is never blanketed , except when he stands out in the street ; but his coat is nicely groomed , his hoofs are well oiled ; he is usually in the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly cultivated ; interested looks follow him when he takes his daily exercise ; and , seen in full progress to a fire , he is an object of respect and admiration , almost of terror . His work is different from that of any other horse in the world , and it requires a peculiar combination of qualities . The fire steed must be able to // draw an extremely heavy load at a smart gallop ; in short , his function is that of a running draft-horse . Engines , with the men who ride on them , usually weigh about 8000 pounds , or four tons : some are a thousand pounds lighter ; others as much , or nearly as much , heavier . The chemical engines are less ponderous , varying from 2500 ( this kind employs but one horse ) to 7500 pounds . The hose carriages attached to the fire engines , and drawn by one horse , are , as a rule , about half the , weight of the engines , but sometimes much more . Twowheel carts were formerly used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston and in most other cities , by four-wheel wagons , which , though not so picturesque , are much easier for the horse , inasmuch as none of the weight comes upon his back . Hook and ladder trucks , with their men , vary in weight from 4350 to 10,600 pounds , the only truck which reaches these last-mentioned figures being hauled by three horses , harnessed abreast . There is another very heavy one , weighing 9535 pounds , which is kept on Harrison Avenue , and is drawn by two huge grays , - one of the largest spans in the department . The engines usually fit the horse-car tracks , which is a great advantage ; whereas the hook and ladder trucks are too broad for this , and they are so extremely long that a large part of the weight is far from the horses , which of course makes it harder to haul ; but , again , the load is more " springy , ** not so dead as that of the engine , and the two kinds of apparatus are , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the longest trucks , as most of my readers know , are provided with a sort of steering apparatus for the hind wheels , so that the helmsman , who sits immediately above the axle , is able to turn them sharply in going around a corner . By this device the necessity of a " wide " turn is avoided , and the driver is able to " cut " the corners as closely as if he had an ordinary length of vehicle behind him . Sometimes a tough spiral spring , made of steel , is inserted in the trace of a fire horse 's harness , near the whiffietree , the object being to lessen the strain at starting . This extremely ingenious device enables the horses to exert their strength against a yielding connection , instead of against a dead weight , - a certain momentum be-. ing acquired by them before the whole load moves . It is on the same principle that the couplings which unite a train of loaded cars must be somewhat loose , in order that the locomotive may start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car to the second , and so on ( as the spectator may readily perceive ) ; whereas , if all the couplings were tense , the whole train would have to start at once . In the city proper , where most of the runs are short , the whole distance is usually covered at a gallop , except where some hill or obstruction intervenes ; and this performance tries the animal of whom it is required through and through , so that if there be a weak spot in him it is soon discovered . In the first place , he must be big and heavy . Boston fire horses vary from 1200 to 1600 pounds ; very few , if any , quite reaching the maximum , and most of them weighing about 1400 pounds , - rather less than more . But the fire horse must also be active , as well as big and strong ; he must have good feet , good wind , and finally , to execute his ordinary task , he must be in hard condition . When the horses are first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are immediately assigned to a station , without any training or preparation . Consequently , they must be humored , and , if need be , restrained somewhat , during their first months of service . Should they be driven hard at this timne , they might easily become " touched in the wind , " or otherwise disabled ; and this sometimes happens through careless or // unskillful driving . The best and strongest horse in the world , if out of condition , can not safely be called upon for an extraordinary effort . ( There is a hint here , by the way , for fat or elderly people who persist in running for trains . ) Elsewhere the weight of fire horses is commonly about the same as it is in Boston . In Cambridge , in Lynn ( which ha* an excellent department ) , and in Providence they have none over 1400 pounds ; in Chicago the limit is given as 1450 ; but in Brooklyn comparatively light horses are used , their weight varying from 1150 to 1350 pounds ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those approaching the minimum . As a rule , short-legged and shortbacked horses are the best for drawing engines . It is indeed a general equine principle that " weight-pullers " should be formed in this way : they are more nimble , take shorter steps , recover themselves more easily , than longer-legged and longer-striding animals . The trotters who make fast records to skeleton wagons ( much heavier than sulkies ) are almost invariably of such a construction . I have been told of a pair of tough roans built thus , and weighing not much more than 1200 pounds , who could pull a heavy engine at wonderful speed ; but , unfortunately , the near horse had a habit of balking on the threshold of the engine house , when harnessed for a fire , which so delayed the apparatus that his subsequent speed did not make up for the time lost , and he was retired to private life . One of the best , oldest , and lightest engine horses in Boston is also built on this model . He is a rather plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong , short back , splendid shoulder , and stout limbs , with big knees and short cannon-bones . His expression is extremely gentle and intelligent . At present he serves as the off horse on the chemical engine in Bulfinch Street , his mate being a handsome dapple gray , with white flowing tail . The brown horse is reckoned by the engine men to be twenty-two years old , having been in the service for many years . I suspect that there is some exaggeration in this statement , but he is certainly an old horse . His mate is ten , and considerably larger , but the two step well together , and make a fast team . Their driver assured me that he had once given the protective company a fair beating on Washington Street , in a race to a lire . Of the gray horse , a good and , I believe , on investigation , a true story is told . In the same building with the chemical engine is an ordinary fire engine , the two " houses " being connected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other engine , and put in one of the stalls behind it . In the middle of the first night after this change had been made , an alarm of fire was sounded . The men tumbled out of bed , rushed down to the engine floor , and found the othet ' I*orse standing in his place by the pole , ready to have the collar fastened about his neck ; but the gray was missing . They looked in his stall , but it was vacant ; " neither hide nor hair of him " could be found , and it seemed clear that the animal had been stolen by some bold thief . Presently , however , a horse was heard moving about in the adjoining house , and it proved to be one belonging to the chemical engine , which had already gone to the fire . He was of course immediately put in the place of the missing beast , and the engine finally got under way . The fact was that when the alarm sounded , and the doors of the stable flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chemical engine , and pushed aside the horse already standing there , who , finding that he was not wanted , returned to his stall . The men , in the hurry of the moment , harnessed such animals as offered themselves , and were off without discovering the mistake . // There is a reason why ladder-truck horses should be taller than engine horses : the apparatus which they draw is at a much higher level from the ground than is the bulk of an engine , and consequently a low-standing animal would waste part of his efforts in pulling downward instead of pulling f orward . Some ladder-truck horses are shaped in one important respect like Maud S. , Sunol , and other fast trotters and runners , namely , higher at the rump than at the withers , and with long hind legs . This is not considered a good conformation for a cart horse ; but it seems to answer well where , as in the case of a ladder truck , horses are required which have strength , height , and speed . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us now visit a new recruit in his quarters . The weather being warm , the doors of the house are open , a rope being stretched across the entrance . Directly in front of us stands the engine , a polished mass of copper and nickel , with scarlet wheels . The driver 's seat is a small box , just big enough to hold him , and behind it , rolled up separately , are strapped the blankets . The harness is suspended from the ceiling in such a manner that it can be let down when the horses stand under it . Back of the engine , and some yards distant as a rule , a partition , composed chiefly of doors , runs across the house . Behind this partition are the stalls ; the horses facing the engine , and the front of each stall being a door , with a window in it . Bridles are worn night and day , the bits being slipped out when the animals eat their oats , but kept in while they chew their hay . Some few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stables , with the bit hanging loose . Now , then , we will suppose that an alarm of fire strikes , the hour being midnight . The horses are lying down , out of sight and fast asleep ; the men are upstairs in bed , - all save one , who dozes in a chair beside those mysterious telegraphic instruments , grouped in a corner near the front door . The gas burns brightly , but there is not a sign of animation about the place . It is all so miraculously clean , so neat , well ordered , burnished , and polished , so nearly deserted , so absolutely quiescent , and yet so brilliantly lighted , that it appears rather like an illusion than a reality . The engine might be the huge and magnificent toy of a giant . It looks much too fine for real use . But , as we were saying , an alarm sounds , and the scene changes . In a corner of the ceiling , near the front door , is a circular opening , through which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole . When the men are called out , they throw themselves on this pole , and come down like a flash of lightning ; the feet of the second man almost touching the head of the first , and so on . The horses scramble on their legs , the doors in front of them fly open , and out they rush , their heavy iron-shod hoofs thundering over the floor . Each horse goes to his proper place ; the driver , from his seat , lets down the harness ; two or three men standing at the pole snap the collars together , fasten the reins to the bits , and off they go . There is nothing more to be done : the girths are not used in running to a fire ; the traces are already attached to the whiffle trees and the polestraps to the collars , so that the fastening of two collars and four reins constitutes the harnessing . Often , perhaps commonly , the horses are harnessed and everything is ready for a start before the gong has finished telling the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for companies in a firstclass department to make ready arid leave the house ; and the ordinary time is , I believe , fifteen or twenty seconds . The fire marshal of the Chicago department informs me that , " on the test of a certain engine , with men in bed and // horses in stalls , the hind wheels of the apparatus crossed the threshold in eleven seconds . " For the Brooklyn department the time is given as " from four to eight seconds , according to distance of horses from the engine . " To teach a green nag to come out of his stall at the signal and range himself alongside the pole is not so difficult as might be imagined . We will suppose that a span of new horses are assigned to a certain engine , the old pair , as is the custom , being taken away at the same time . The surroundings are strange and more or less terrible to them , but they are handled very gently and carefully , and gradually lose their fears . The schooling begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . The ordinary signal is given , as if for a fire ; the stall doors open ; the horses are led out , put in position , harnessed , and in a few minutes led back ; and then the process is repeated perhaps half a dozen times . Great pains are taken that the animals shall not strike against anything , or by any means become frightened . The unusual spectacle of a harness suspended in the air is apt to disturb them at first , but they are led slowly up to it , induced to smell of it , to inspect it on all sides , and thus to learn that it is perfectly harmless . In the same way they are accustomed to all the other objects about them , being continually patted and encouraged . The chief traits of the horse are the great strength of his memory , especially of his faculty of association , and his timidity . The fireman 's task , therefore , is first to convince his pupil , by gentle treatment , that no harm threatens him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper signal , the opening of the stall door , and a progress thence to his station by the engine pole . After being led to their positions what it is thought may prove a sufficient number of times , the horses are allowed to come out at the signal , of their own accord , a man standing behind to touch them up a little if they do not start promptly when the gong sounds and the doors open . Of course no two horses learn with equal rapidity , and the difference between them in this respect is greater than might be supposed . Two weeks constitute about the average period of instruction , during which time two or three lessons a day are given : but horses have been known to learn in one lesson ; and others , again , have been months in arriving at the same proficiency . A pair of gray horses , newly purchased for the East Street engine , in Boston , were led out three times in the manner just described . They were then left to themselves : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pair trotted out , each going to his place alongside the pole . They had caught the idea at once . These horses are remarkable not only for intelligence , but for strength and speed . They are both , and the off one especially , of a type different from that of any other fire horses* that I have seen , being very tail ( the off one is seventeen hands ) rangy , slightly wasp - waisted , and having fine , thin necks and small , well-bred heads . They are great gallopers , and the hose-wagon horse has hard work to keep up with them ; but this too is a remarkable animal . He is one of the oldest horses in the department , having served ten years , and being , naturally , a little stiff in the legs ; but his strength is so great and his courage so good that even these powerful , flying grays can not draw away from him . He is a big brown horse , with a great shoulder , the best of short legs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large sum of $450 , but the bargain has proved a good one for the city . Old as he is , being sixteen or seventeen years at least , he is thought to have made the best run of his life a few weeks ago , galloping all the way from East Street // to Battery Wharf , a distance of a mile , or more . A little blood trickled from his nostrils when he pulled up behind the engine , but otherwise he seemed none the worse for the immense exertion . Another big horse , of the greyhound type already described , - that is , having long hind legs and standing higher at the rump than at the withers , - was four months in learning the business . He is a gray , with a long , rather coarse head , and small " mouse " ears out of proportion to his size , for he weighs 1380 pounds ; but this evidently mongrel beast is not altogether devoid of intelligence , being steady enough on the street to serve as a leader when three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whiffletree to fall on his legs without starting to run . This horse is used with a ladder truck , and his education was finally accomplished by fencing in his path from the stall to the pole with ladders , a method often employed . Sometimes , it is not want of mind , but nervousness , which makes a fire horse slow to learn the trade , just as some nervous children have difficulty in am plying their minds . Such was the case with Peter , a well-bred black horse , used for many years in Boston with the ladder truck in Fort Hill Square . Peter was a noble , strong , spirited animal , and , once taught , he became as prompt and trustworthy as any horse in the department . On one occasion , shortly after his purchase , Peter , exasperated by the schooling , broke away from his instructors , jumped cleanly through an open window without touching the sash , and ran down the street in search of amusement . At another time , while waiting in the blacksmith shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced , Peter heard the twelve o'clock alarm strike . This , he knew , indicated the hour of his dinner , and accordingly Peter made off , without saying By your leave to the smith , and presently appeared at the ladder-house door , neighing for admission . This fine animal met with a sad fate not long ago . While running to a fire , he came into collision with one of the protective wagons , and his leg was broken in two places , so that he had to be shot where he fell in the street . Something even worse happened several years ago to a fire-engine horse in Boston . He was struck by the pole of another engine , which came out of its house just as the first engine dashed by ; the force of the blow , unknown to his driver , broke the animal 's leg , but he kept on , traveling , of course , on three legs only , and pulling his share of the immense weight behind him , till the place of the fire was reached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the poor beast dropped to the ground , never to rise again . The fire horse is subject to accidents like these , but we must remember that the fireman 's danger is greater yet . It happens occasionally that a horse is bought who proves to be altogether too nervous for the business : he is in a continual state of tension , will not eat unless taken out of his stall , and is so worried with apprehension of an alarm that it is impossible to use him as a fire horse . In a few other cases , the nervousness , though not so extreme , is sufficient to disturb the animal 's health , to impair his digestion , to prevent his taking the needed amount of rest , so that , eventually , he too , after being doctored , perhaps , for an imaginary disease , is transferred to some more peaceful occupation . Now that we have seen how a fire-engine horse is instructed and where he lives , it might be interesting to know in what manner his daily life is ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or half past , in some houses as late as six o'clock , - the meal consisting , as a rule , of two quarts of oats . After breakfast he receives a thorough grooming , and about // ten o'clock he goes out to walk for an hour , with an occasional trot , one horse of a pair being ridden and the other led . At half past eleven or twelve he has dinner , - two quarts of oats again , which also is the allowance for supper , at half past five or six . Some old and delicate horses have nine quarts of oats per day . Usually a bran mash is given once a week , and in some houses a little bran is fed every day . In the afternoon the horse has another hour of exercise , supposing that no fire has occurred . Hay is allowed at night only , and in most of the houses it is fed from the floor , so that the horse can eat it while lying down . For several reasons this method is far better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , who takes a long while to eat his hay , inasmuch as the bit remains in his mouth . In most cities the grain allowaiice is about the same as it is in Boston , although in Chicago the horses are fed just twice as much , twelve quarts per day , and in Brooklyn , as I am informed , the allowance varies from twelve to eighteen quarts , which is excessive . In Chicago , it would seem , the fire horses do more work than is required in Boston . Ten companies in the heart of that city average thirty-six runs per month ; whereas in Boston the average varies , according to the situation , from eight or ten to twenty-five runs per month . In the suburbs many companies do not go out more than once a week , on the average . The hour for bedding down varies from half past five to eight i ' . M. , at the discretion of the driver . It would be better to make this duty obligatory at the earlier hour , and better yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as by night , especially in the case of those companies which do the most work . The more a horse lies down , the longer his legs and feet are likely to endure ; and by the supply of a soft and perpetual couch he can often be induced to lengthen his hours of repose . At eight * . M. , it is the custom all over the city to call the horses out and harness them to the engine , and at this time visitors are apt to drop in . Both firemen and horses are always well known in the vicinity , and many civilities pass between the neighbors and the occupants , human and equine , of the engine houses . The children especially are friends with the horses , calling them by their names , and often treating them to candy and other luxuries . In fact , whenever a fire-engine horse is introduced to a stranger , he expects to receive some dainty , and will poke his nose into the visitor 's hands and pockets ; nor is he easily discouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody would be quite so mean as to enter his stable without bringing at least a lump of sugar or the fraction of an apple . There is a handsome gray horse in the Mason Street station , in Boston , who has a great liking for ice , and , when out for exercise , he can never be persuaded to pass an ice wagon without first thrusting his head in behind and helping himself to a small piece . It is needless*to say that the firemen ( whom , by the way , I found invariably civil and intelligent ) make great pets of their four-footed companions , and are a little inclined to exaggerate their good qualities , - " the finest pair in the department " being discovered in almost every engine house . There is , too , a favorite horse at each station , - not always the strongest or handsomest , but the most affectionate , docile , and sociable ; and the visitor is always taken first to this animal 's stall , whose virtues are thereupon extolled with generous enthusiasm . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as an extra horse for making up a " spike team , " in case the streets are blocked with snow . Usually this horse is not owned by the department , but is loaned by an ice company or a contractor , - // his keep being reckoned as payment for his services . The new-comer does not serve as a leader : one of the regular team is put in that post , the extra horse taking the other 's place at the pole . Some of the engine horses show great intelligence and discretion as leaders . On one occasion a spike team was dashing through a narrow street , where there was barely room to get between a wagon on one side and a light carryall , with women and children in it , on the other . The driver found that he had no control over his leader , and feared a bad accident ; but the horse threaded his way so carefully and accurately that the engine swept past the carriage without touching it . When the engine stopped , it appeared that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had served as his own river . This same animal - a big bay horse on Fort Hill Square - is also credited with some clever work in his own interest . Immediately in the rear of his stall was a sllde where the oats came down , as he had full opportunity to observe at feeding-time . But how could he . get them ? He was confined in his stall , not of course by a halter , but by a rope stretched behind him , and fastened by an ordinary open hook . First , he discovered that , with some difficulty , he could turn in the stall far enough to get hold of the rope with his teeth , and after many attempts he succeeded in unhooking it . It was then an easy task to step across to the slide , pull it open with his teeth , and thus set running the reservoir of grain above . Two or three times he was found , after achieving this feat , staiiding in a deluge of oats , and industriously stowing them away in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by putting on the rope a snap hook , closed by a spring ; and there it may be seen , at once proving the occurrence and preventing its repetition . There is another sagacious leader , called John , one of a span of large , handsome , dark mottled grays , used on the Dudley Street ladder truck . These are among the very finest horses in the department : they are strong and symmetrical , with small , clean-cut heads , large eyes , and courageous but gentle expression . John , especially , is as kind as a dog , a favorite with the women and children of the neighborhood , a great pet of the firemen , and quiet as a mouse in the stable , but on the street full of life and animation , and playful enough to have thrown , at one time and another , everybody who has ridden him to exercise , except the captain . John 's sense of discipline is so strong that he draws the line there . While used as a leader his stall is different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having occupied it for some weeks , the third horse was dispensed with , and John was put back in his old quarters , he rightly and sagaciously concluded that his former place on the engine should be resumed , and accordingly , at the next alarm , he ran to the pole , instead of going in front . The finest engine horse that I have seen is , I think , the near one of a dark gray team used on the Salem Street engine , in Boston . This is what horsemen call " a big little un ; " that is , a stout animal on short legs . He is a comparatively small horse , standing 15 hands 3 inches , and weighing 1320 pounds : but he is big where bigness is required . He has a broad chest , a tremendous shoulder , deep lungs , a big barrel , a short back , and strong hind quarters . His legs are fiat and clean , his feet of just the right size , and he has a broad forehead and an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is a suspicion of hollowness in his back , but otherwise he seemed to me an ideal engine horse . His mate is handsomer in some respects and more gentle , but a trifle too long in the back and legs . // Beside the engine , hose-wagon , and ladder-truck horses , there are others , used to haul coal and supplies , to carry men and tools for the repair of wires , etc . These are chiefly old , partly brokendown animals , no longer fit for the hard and rapid work of running to fires . Then there are smaller nags , weighing from 950 to 1050 pounds , employed by the engineers in their light wagons . These horses , especially such as are used by the chief engineer , get more practice in running to fires than any others , and they become very clever in picking their way through a crowded street ; breaking into a gallop whenever they see an open space before them , and pulling up promptly to avoid collisions . The tough , intelligent , short-stepping Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that breed has been used for eight years past by the veterinary surgeon connected with the department . At least , this animal came from Vermont , and bears all the marks of the Morgan strain . Another , used by the district engineer on Dudley Street , is of about the same size and pattern , and of the same gamy disposition . The protective ( insurance ) wagon steeds , though not , strictly speaking , belonging to the fire department , should not be disregarded in this account . They show more " quality " than fire-engine horses , weigh less ( about 1150 pounds ) , stand higher in proportion , and would look , if their tails were docked , like powerful coach horses . There are two protective wagons in Boston : one in Hamilton Street , in the heart of the city , which weighs , with the men , about 7800 pounds ; and the other , which is much lighter , at the South End , on Broadway extension . One or both of these wagons respond to every alarm of fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them do a great deal of work . On a certain Fourth of July , one of these companies was called out on nineteen different occasions in the twenty-four hours ; the horses not becoming cool enough throughout that time to be fed , and being supported by draughts of bran and water . The arrangements in the protective houses differ , for the worse , from those of the fire department . The stalls are in the main room , where the wagon is kept , and at the back of the building is an entrance , the doors of which are apt to be open . The animals are thus exposed to strong and frequent draughts , very bad for horseflesh ; and they are also continually annoyed by the noise , by the glare of lights kept burning all night , and by the coining and going of visitors and officials . The object of this arrangement is , of course , to save time ; but if the horses stood six feet farther back , and were protected by a partition , probably only one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole . Moreover , they are so often out at night that the suggestion already made in regard to engine horses applies with more force to those engaged in this service , namely , that bedding should be left under them at all times . In the South End house the stalls are open at both ends , so that the horses stand in a thoroughfare for cold breezes ; and this was formerly the case in the Hamilton Street station . In the latter house there were for eight years a very fine pair of grays , who were sold , not for unsoundness , but because they were worn out by want of rest . One of them also became vicious . The fact is that , with the possible exception of man , the horse is the most nervous animal in the world , and the least able to endure continual and multiplied annoyances . These grays were last seen drawing a hack , and they have probably long since passed to some lower and more painful stage of equine degradation . Their places were taken by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedy horses . At the South End station there is another cross-matched // pair : an oldish gray , a very fine animal still ( whose mate fell a victim to pleurisy ) , and a handsome young black . In fact , the horses of this department seem to have been selected with great judgment . Connected with a fire department there is usually a veterinary hospital , and in Boston this is situated on Tremont Street ; being a part of the building in which ladder truck No. 12 is stationed . It consists of a single boxstall and several straight stalls , but the health of the horses is looked after so carefully that these accommodations are quite sufficient . When I visited the place it contained but two patients . One was a fine gray engine horse , who , while running to a fire , came in collision with a " tow " horse , and was thrown down . His knees and hind legs were badly cut , but none of these injuries proved serious , and he was soon on the road to recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suffering from a bad leg , caused partly by improper shoeing , and partly by the state of his blood . With the exception of these two , all the horses in the department , numbering about two hundred , were in working order , - an excellent showing . Fire horses , as a rule , give out first and chiefly in their feet . Standing so much as they do on wooden floors , their feet have a tendency to become dry and hard , but this is counteracted by a permanent stuffing of tar and oakum , held in place with a leather pad . Almost all the fire horses of Boston wear these pads , and usually on the hind as well as the fore feet . In other cities , the same result is accomplished by periodical stuffing of the feet with some one of the many materials which horsemen use for this purpose . Possibly this result might be accomplished satisfactorily by the Charlier process , which consists in channeling the wall of the foot at its base , and inserting in the circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls The worst trouble , however , arises from the concussion produced in the foot by the hard paving-stones of the city . This is bad enough for any horse , but especially bad for the fire horse , because , owing to his great weight , his galloping speed , and his heavy load , he pounds his feet with tremendous force . Often a pair of engine horses whose feet have begun to give out are transferred to a suburban station , where , the roads being less hard and alarms less frequent , they go on very well for some years longer . Great pains are taken with the shoeing , which is under the direct charge of the accomplished " vets ' employed by the department . Horses used in the city proper wear corks on all their feet , to give them a better grip on slippery pavements , car-tracks , etc. ; but in the suburbs corks are dispensed with , the shoes without them having this advantage , - that they let the foot down lower , so that it supports the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog of the foot is intended by nature to lessen the concussion by receiving part of the blow itself ; but with an ordinary shoe , especially with one having corks , this function of the frog is very imperfectly discharged , the frog being kept off the ground by the shoe . What the city fire horses ( perhaps I might say , what horses in general ) need is some method of shoeing which will protect the wall of the foot , and at the same time allow the frog to come in contact with the ground.tm Fire horses also throw their shoes very frequently , catching them in car-tracks and other projections . In fact , a team can hardly go to a fire without losing at least one shoe between them ; and the continual re-shoeing tends , of course , to wear away the hoof . It is desirable , of the foot are protected as with the ordinary shoe , but , the foot not being raised from the ground , the frog comes into play , just as if no shoe at all were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as possible , and for this purpose it is kept well oiled . Every driver has his own specific , upon the peculiar and wonderful properties of which he will descant with much enthusiasm ; but the best of them is probably not more efficacious than a rag tied about the coronet , and kept well moistened with cold water . Despite the severity of their occasional labors and the hard usage to which their feet are subjected , fire horses in Boston last a considerable time . They are bought , usually , at the age of five or six years ( costing about $325 ) , and they remain in service , on the average , about seven or eight years . In other cities their duration and cost are about the same . In Cambridge , where few of the streets are paved , fire horses are said to last from seven to ten years ; but in Brooklyn this period is put as low as six years , - about the length of time that a car horse endures . In Boston there are at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some who have served as fire horses even longer than that . The old hosecart horse in East Street , of whom I have spoken already , has a record of at least ten years service . There is another seasoned houyhnhnm on Harrison Avenue , - a dark chestnut , of the same heavy , low-standing shape , who has seen twelve winters in the business . About five years ago it was thought that he ought to have an easier life , and accordingly he was transferred to an outlying station , where fires seldom occur . But on the occasion of the first alarm to which he responded the old fellow bolted , and made a complete wreck of the hose cart by dashing it against a stone wall . This was his protest at being removed from the house to which he had become accustomed , and from the society of his familiar friends , human and equine ; and so he was put back in the old place , where he still remains in full employment . He is reckoned to be seventeen years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station , also a hose horse , who entered the department in the same year . This is " Grief , " so named because of his melancholy aspect . He has a way of standing with his fore legs wide apart , his head hanging down between , and a doleful expression of the face . A visitor , who saw him once in this attitude , remarked that he would make a good image of Grief , " and the name seemed so appropriate that it was adopted by common consent . " Grief " is duly inscribed in large letters over his stall , and as " Grief " he is known through the department and to all the neighbors . Grief is a remarkable horse ; in color a rich mottled brown , and in shape much resembling the other old horses already described . He has a massive , wellformed shoulder , strong , straight fore legs , powerful hind quarters ( too long a cannon - bone , however ) , a good neck , slightly arched , a rather intelligent , cleancut head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phlegmatic disposition . He has a hearty appetite and a sound digestion , but he never shows the least impatience for his meals . Other horses paw and neigh when they hear the premonitory rattle of the oat-box , but Grief never betrays the least sign of curiosity or interest . The children of the vicinity often come to this house to give the horses candy , and the span of bays who draw the engine always recognize their benefactors , and will follow them about the stable . But Grief , though glad enough to be fed , never takes the slightest notice of any visitor beyond swallowing what is offered to him . He sleeps a great deal , ruminates still more , and allows nothing outside of business to disturb or excite him ; and hence , no doubt , his excellent state of preservation . But Grief wakes up when the alarm strikes . However long or steep the road , however fast may gallop the stout young // bays in front , he always keeps up with the engine . The strength and nervous force that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to a fire . His eye is then full of spirit ; his expanded nostrils display the red glow within ; his neck curves to the task ; his splendid shoulder strains against the collar . He looks twice the size of the horse that was dozing in his stall a few minutes before . Arrived at the scene of action , he draws up as close as possible to the engine . Grief likes to get where the sparks fall in showers about him , and there he will stand , shaking his head to dislodge the burning particles , pleased with the shrieks and roar of the engine , with the shouts of the men , with the smoke and flame of the conflagration . At the fire in Boston on Thanksgiving Day of last year , the engine which he followed was burned within twenty-five minutes after it left the house ; but Grief stood by it , firm as a rock , till the flames came near and he was led away . The patriarch of the department is , however , not Grief , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Joe . His age is variously estimated , but I gather that it is at least twenty years , and possibly twenty-four . Joe is not so impassive as Grief ; he is more like the rest of us , being swayed by curiosity , touched by social affections , and dependent upon society . He has a gentle , intelligent , courageous eye and a good head and ears . His great age is indicated by an extremely hollow back , but otherwise he is still a grand - looking horse . He , too , is a mottled bay or brown , and not unlike Grief , except that he is even larger . In fact , the four old fire horses whom I have particularly described would have made a great team in their youth , - broad-chested , deep - lunged , rather low - standing , short - backed fellows , with immense shoulders , roomy stomachs , and strong hind quarters . Joe is now an engine horse . His mate , though in comparison with him a mere colt , is , in truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago that they would trot out no more from their stalls when the alarm sounded ( having , as it seemed to them , done that sort of thing quite long enough ) , but would proceed from the stable to the pole at a dignified walk . This resolution has been kept . The firemen have tried to hurry them , but without success . Rattan rods ( such as schoolboys used to be whipped with ) are hung behind their stalls , and descend automatically when the alarm strikes ; but the old horses laugh at this gentle flagellation ; they refuse to hurry their pace , and , alone among the fire horses of Boston , they advance with slow and measured step from the stable to the engine house . The only remaining question which we have to ask is this : What becomes of them all ? What fate is in store for Old Joe , for Grief , for that veteran hosecart steed in East Street , who gallops with his heavy load till the blood runs from his nostrils ? When thoroughly worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly , handed over to a dealer in part paynient for new animals . In some cities , in Brooklyn , in New York also , I believe , they are disposed of at auction ; and inasmuch as a certain distinction attaches to them even in decrepitude , they always bring a little more than they are worth as beasts of burden . At most , however , they sell for a song . Broken-down horses are bought by poor men ; they have scanty fare , little or no clothing , hard boards to lie on , and , commonly , severe toil to endure . The castoff fire horse must sadly miss his good oats and hay , his clean , warm stable and comfortable bed , his elaborate grooming and gentle treatment , his companions , brute and human , the caresses and sweetmeats to which he was daily treated . Removed from all these luxuries , his life broken up by a sudden and painful
