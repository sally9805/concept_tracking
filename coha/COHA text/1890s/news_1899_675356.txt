txt Two cases of what is believed to be bubonic plague reached this port yesterday on the Lamport &; Holt steamer J. W. Taylor , coffee laden , from Santos , Brazil . Three weeks ago the Health Officer 's agent at Santos cabled that the plague had broken out in that city . Health Officer Doty , who was and is still abroad , was notified . All of the precautions , the result of several years of study lay the Quarantine official.s , were at once taken . This was mainly a matter of extra care in making examination of vessels from ports which have trade With Santos and of having proper apparatus ready . When . the Taylor arrived yestei4day , Dr. L'Hommedieu , the Deputy Health Officer on duty , was ready for  --  the emergency should she fail to show a clean bill of health . He found Capt . Waters and the cook , Charles J. Allison , both ill , though up and about , and Capt . Waters reported that on Nov. 7 the steward , Robert Hope , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was buried at sea . Hope , the Captain said , had been in the hospital at Santos for about two weeks suffering from an eruption thought to be eczema . He was able to return to duty just before the steamer sailed on Oct. 24 , but after one week at sea he was taken down again , complaining of pains in the head , limos , and back . He was put to bed in an exhausted condition , and on the second day developed fever . The Captain and cook tended him , administering such medicines from the ship 's chest as seemed required , but he grew steadily worse until he died . Dr. L'Hommedieu made an examination of the Captain and the cook , and found on them the evidences of the dreaded black plague , as it has been called . There were the black-headed pimples at the feet , and the swelling of the glands of the groin and armpits . He ordered the ship detained . It was decided to send the sick men to Saanblrne Island , and all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the steamer should be thoroughly disinfeca-d and all clothing sunjected to the process of steam disinfection . In conformance with the plan inaugurated by Dr. Doty when he appointed an Advisory Board of leading New York physicians , Dr. L'Hommedieu at once notified all members of the board and arranged a meeting for the afternoon at the house of Dr. H. M. Biggs . The purpose of the council is to advise as to the proper steps to be taken in any serious case , such as this . CAPTAIN AND COOK EXAMINED . Dr. E. E. Sanborn , with is Acting Health Officer in the absence of Dr. Doty , but who had not been on duty when the J. W. Taylor arrived , then sent the disinfecting boat James W. Wadsworth alongside the steamer to begin the work of disinfection . Every corner of the ship , it was said , would be subjected to live steam , not excepting the cargo-filled hold . One of the main features of the disinfecting of the vessel would be , it was said , the effort that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rats are credited with having been the medium of carrying bubonic plague in many of its worst invasions , and as nearly all ships have their colony of rats , it will devolve upon the disinfectors to kill the rodents by steam . Coffee is not a medium of contagion , but the bags in which it is held will in this case be burned . The disinfecting process will be continued until Monday . Late in the afternoon yesterday Drs . Parke and Lawrence of the New York Board of Health boarded the J. W. Taylor with Dr. Sanborn and made a careful examination of the Captain and cook , who had not at that time been transferred . They found the swellings very large in the groins and under the arms . Dr , Parke , with a hypodermic needle , extracted diseased matter from both patients , and this will be- subjected to bacteriological examination and the result made known today , when it will be announced whether the bubonic plague diagnosis is correct . The Captain 's wife , who was aboard the vessel , accompanied him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after the examination , they were taken there . Both patients were comfortable , and the doctors said that there was every reason to believe that the cases were so slight that the men would soon recover . Twenty-eight , of the crew were taken to Hoffman Island . The vessel had no passengers . The Quarantine Advisory Board is composed of Drs . E. G. Janeway , T. M. Prudden , J. D. Bryant , G. L. Peabody , W. M. Polk , H. M. Biggs , W. H. Draper , J. H. Girdner , R. H. Derby , and J. W. . Drs . Derby and Draper were not able to be present , but besides the members of the board present was Dr. John B. Cosby of the Board of Health . At the conclusion of the conference , which lasted two hours , this statement was issued : " It was said that the nature of the disease seems to be established by the history of the cases and the evidence that the plague exists at Santos . WOULD BURN THE SHIP . " Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to provide for the removal of the sick to Swinburne Island ; the well to Hoffman Island , and the discharge of the cargo under the strictest sani ' tary precautions , while the still ) itself is still held in quarantine . " In the opinion of the committee there is absolutely no reason for alarm . " After the meeting Dr. Cosby said that Dr. Parke would make the examination to determine if the bacillus ' of the plague was present , and that the result would be made public at 1 P. M. to-day . He said that the crew would of course be held until the expiration of the period of incubation , or ten days ; but the Board of Health might take stringent measures even after the Quarantine officials had taken such precautions as might seem to them necessary . His own disposition would be not to permit the vessel to dock at all . While he did not think there was any danger , he yet thought that it was too serious a matter to take any chances . The coffee , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to remove it to some lighter or other craft , the bags being burned immediately and the coffee . then brought ashore and put in new bags . The roasting of the coffee . he said , would kill any germ that might attach to it . So strong were the doctor 's views on the subject of removing all possible danger that he said he would , if necessary , advocate the burning of the ship , no matter what the cost , but he evidently , did not think that any such drastic measures would be necessary . STRANGE PEATURES Or THE PLAGUE Anciently Known as " Black Death " - Rats Convey It . In an article written by Dr. Doty for The American Journal of the Medical SCiences . in 1807 , commenting on the antiquity of the bubonic plague which had been written of for 2,000 years under the various names Levantine , Oriental , or bubonic plague , and the Black Plague or Black Death , he said : " The appearance of the bubonic plague in the East during the past two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientifically the cause of its development and indicate the means of relief . " The bacillus was discovered by Kitasa to and Yersin during the plague at , Ho.ngkongin 1804. and the fallowing year Yersin , Calmette. and Burrell succeeded in making a serum which was ** applied . In the East the natives think- that the germ is contained in the ground , and Dr. Doty in his paper said that if this view was confirmed , it might in a measure explain why the infection of rats precedes or is present during an outbreak among human beings . The rats are frequently stricken first and found dead in living apartments . Hot , dry air is fatal to the disease , while moist , warm air is favorable to it . It may be active in cold weather , while it is unknown in the tropics . It thrives on filth and famine , and its ravages have always found fertile ground among the lowest classes . Dr. Doty described the period of incubation as being from three to six days , while malignant cases may show in twenty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a slight rise in temperature and a swelling of the glands of the groin and armpit , which may or may not suppurate , and such cases are not fatal . In the more common and severer form the invasion is abrupt , associated with chills , great depression , blunted condition . of the intellect , pains in the bones , and ' high fever , with frequently delirium . The lymph glands rapidly enlarge sometimes to the size of an egg . Death frequently occurs within forty-eight hours . Of quarantine precautions the doctor said that the short period of incubation was one of our greatest safeguards , as the time of passage from countries which had suffered from the infection so greatly exceeded the period of incubation that one who had been exposed could not arrive here and fall victim after landing . The case would have developed at sea , and proper precautions would follow on arrival here at Quarantine . " There remains , however , " said he , " an element of danger which unfortunately can not very well be estimated . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of merchandise , &c.; It is this possibility that confronts the health officials and constitutes a difficult and unpleasant ' problem . In view of the uncertainty which exists it would seem imperative that every precaution should be taken to disinfect carefully and properly every piece of material which may be regarded as a menace to health . " With the approved and effective apparatus for disinfection which are now available , however , no infected material should gain entrance to this country . " FOOTPAD IN FIFTH AVENUE . Mrs. George F. Hodgman the Victim of a Highway Robbery After a Shopping Tour . A bold attempt at highway robbery was made at 11 o'clock yesterday morning in Fifth Avenue , opposite the old reservoir , near the corner of Forty-first Street . The victim was Mrs. George F.

The man was recognized as an ex-convict by Capt . Price . He is Adam Walters , alias John Howe , who , on Jan. 19 , 1897 , was sentenced for highway robbery . He attempted to rob a woman in Harlem . He was not arraigned in court yesterday because ' Mrs. Hodgman was unable to appear against him . She thought she would be able to go to court to-morrow morning . STATION AGENT TODD KILLED . Run Down by Locomotive in Grand Central Yard , of Which He Had Full Charge . William L. Todd , night station agent at the Grand Central Station , was run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street last night . Todd had , it is thought , gone to a small tobacco shop , located at Forty-sixth Street , on the east side of the yard , to purchase some tobacco , of which he was very fond and a constant user . On the way back to his office he stopped to watch an incoming milk train and stepped in front of a locomotive which was backing to the round house to be turned so that it could take a train to Mott Haven . The man was knocked down , and the wheels passed over his body . The accident was witnessed by many brakemen , who called to the engineer , George E. Brown , and the locomotive was immediately brought to a stop . The body was picked up and carried on a stretcher to the Grand Central Police Station . Brown was taken to the station , and when questioned by the Sergeant he shed tears . He and Todd had been intimate friends for years and had worked together . Todd was forty-five years old , and lived with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . He had been in the ' service of the New ' York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company for twenty years . Five years ago he was promoted from conductor to night station agent , and had charge of the entire yard . Todd was extremely popular with the employes of the road , and was a member of many railroad organizations . When his clothing was examined in the station house it was found that a valuable gold watch which he carried was still running , although the case had been broken in the accident . A brother of the dead man called at the station later and made arrangements for the rernovaV of the body to its late home . He said that Mrs. Todd was completely prostrated and under the care of a physician .
