Cranch , Christopher Pearse , 1813-1892 : The mild autumnal day from The mild autumnal day ( 1890 ) The mild autumnal day Is filled with visionary forms that pass Before our sight as in some magic glass . Along the horizon gray The dim procession of ancestral shades Appears , dissolves , and fades . Grave , sad-robed fathers of the Church and State , Matrons and mothers , mild-eyed and sedate , And sober-suited youths and home-bred maids , Pledged to maintain inviolate New England 's earliest , dearest heritage ,  --  The faith and conduct of that sterner age . Westward across the rough and unknown seas We see them , an advancing , spreading host ,  --  Along the rocky coast And ' neath the forests of primeval trees Building their simple states and villages ; And in their midst , like castles of defence In medival days , to guard the tents And cottages of those who clustered round , Choosing a plot of ground Whereon they found a church , though called by a name Of more prosaic sound Than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chanting choirs Stretch their long aisles and lift their solemn spires . Here first of all they rear With pious hands and reverence austere Their house of worship and of brotherhood , Of prayer and praise and spiritual food , Symbol supreme of trust and faith sincere . Far back in shadowy lines the lives , the plans Of those old Puritans Lie sketched ; and though to us their acrid creeds Seem like the harsh and unripe fruits of spring , Fitter for ancient Hebrews than for needs Of Saxon men who fled from priest and king And rituals outworn , to seek across the sea A home for conscience and for liberty , Let us believe their virtues far outweighed Their faults , and note their sunshine , not their shade . True to the essence of the doctrines taught And to the lights they saw , they lived and wrought . Earnest and brave , in this their new abode They found amid the wilds a surer road Toward freedom , union , purer Church and State . Nothing effeminate Or base was here . No rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But like the keen salt breeze that swept along Their shores o'er rocks and sands , From unknown springs a spirit hale and strong Inspired their hearts and hands . Let not our wise noon-lighted century scorn The narrow opening of their clouded morn . The intolerance that allowed no light to shine Beside their own in their crypt-guarded shrine , Shut in and kept for future times a law Of life and duty grander than they saw . Our fathers sowed with stern humility , But knew not what the harvest was to be . More light , they said , would issue from God 's book , Not knowing ' t was the deeper , wiser look The soul took of itself that gave them eyes to see . From the rough gnarld root they planted here , Through storm and sun , through patient hope and fear , There grew a fair and ever-spreading tree , With roots fast grappling in the granite rocks , Unharmed by cold or drought or tempest shocks ; Fed by the sun and winds and seasons ' change , It reared its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper air Of thought and liberty , Loaded with leaves and blossoms rich and strange , And promise of a fruitage yet to be In the long centuries of futurity . The slow-paced years and ages have moved on , Through life and death and change , through peace and war The vast historic eras come and gone ; And from the climes afar Primeval woods and savage-haunted coasts Filled with the gathering hosts , Till strengthening , widening , great , united , free , Stretches the mighty continent from sea to sea . And with increase and change what marvels rise Before our wondering eyes ! What new-found powers , what labyrinthine clews , What heights , what depths , what vast encircling views !  --  Religion , science , art , mechanic skill , The enterprise of trade by seas and lands , The teeming farm , the factory 's whirling mill ; Steam like a giant with a hundred hands ; The all-recording press Brightening the dumb world 's dreary loneliness . The voice and tone of distant friends brought near ; Sounds packed away for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing pinions furled , Talking around a world By science , law , humanity subdued To peaceful brotherhood ; Or linked to bands and armatures of steel Compelled to tasks of lever and of wheel , Or caged in moony globes with dazzling ray Turning the night to day . No chemic power , unchallenged , undecoyed , No blind telluric force left unemployed ; All matter subject to the imperial mind , Prompt to the advantage of all human kind ; The mystic stars themselves reveal to man In prismic hues defined Their secret essence and their primal plan . All Nature stoops and serves . The very sun We apprentice as a painter . Earth and heaven are won To run the errands of man 's shrewdest thought . In this vast net the universe is caught ; While in a larger air his spirit tends Toward diviner ends , Dissolving old beliefs , affirming new , Leaving the false behind to grasp the true ; Or ranging through the sister realm of art Far from the crowded mart , Pursuing forms of beauty and of power , Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisting long The light , shut in her fortress grim and strong , Endures at last the change , And through all sects assumes a loftier range , Untangling with wise skill the threads perplexed Of fundamental truth and Bible text , Dividing the pure essence from the old Imprisoning form , the earth-dross from the gold , The frigid product from the warm intent , The transitory from the permanent ; No more mid strife of Antinomian wars , Fearing the fading of its guiding stars . From miracles and legends quaint unbound , No mud of Genesis can clog the feet Of those who tread the undisputed ground Of natural law , eternal and complete , And between science and religion see No conflict , but perpetual amity . Thus freed from close-walled alleys of the past For broad highways toward vistas grand and vast , For us the gates of knowledge open wide , And the soul 's shining leaders side by side Lead onward far beyond the clouded zone Of dogmas long outgrown . A broader faith has risen above the rim Of the horizon , sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The limits of religion , truth , and law . The frowning visage of a creed austere , The visions born of superstitious fear , The paralyzing touch that laid its ban On the free instincts of the natural man , The curse that like a shadow followed him With sure relentless pace , The imagined sins , detectives vague and grim , The dark satanic mask upon the face Of an all-loving Father , fade away In a serener day . No stern , inevitable doom forbids The guests of heaven and earth to share their feast ; No sad-eyed morning opes its heavy lids . The kindling day is all one boundless east For us , if only true To the great lights that broaden on our view . But let us not forget how firm and fast The present is still rooted in the past ; Nor , while rejoicing in our ampler space , The slow steep steps behind us fail to trace ,  --  To note how gradual is the growth of truth , How old experience dates its forms from youth . So , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear half truths they deemed divine , We know our fathers planted here the root Of which the sons possess the flower and fruit . And fitting ' t is we celebrate to-day With music , wise discourse , and poet 's lay , And floral offerings gay , The first small gathering of one little band , The simple house in a wild alien land , Whose spiritual corner-stone we trust Still stands , although its founders sleep in dust . These walls , why are they reared ? Not only for old memories long endeared , Nor to perpetuate Sacred traditions of an olden date ; But for truth loosed from tyrannizing creeds , And proved in doctrines less than in the deeds ; For weekly interludes of thought and prayer , Seclusions of release from work and care , Serene transitions from the world of sense To the heart 's inmost fortress of defence ; For upright lives , for strength and love and grace ; For service of our country and our race ; For symbols of the unseen world that lies About and in us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , amid the war Of worldly aims the soul 's unchanging star Of safety in the stress And tide of passion and of selfishness . And gladly would we note the noble lives , The names whose memory in this place survives In golden gleams along the historic thread That binds the living to the immortal dead : Those who through stormy days of battles grim The struggling nation 's counsels wisely led ; And when her pathway grew perplexed and dim , And help was far , and hope seemed almost fled , Lifted her drooping head . Those who as rulers and ambassadors maintained The strength , the truth , the honor we had gained , And through successive generations made One name illustrious , which shall never fade ; Joined with another of an old renown ,  --  The name that blends with Harvard 's classic shade , And syllables your old familiar town . Nor less should we forget the worthy sons And daughters who through centuries lived and died Unknown to fame . The muse of history shuns Their hidden records ; gathered side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the half-obliterated lines That tell their birth , their death . Yet not in vain , Fathers and mothers , were your humble lives ; Each in its turn an influence that survives , A light that shines again In sacred memories , and in hearths and homes , Vital as greater names that gild historic tomes . And here permit , if memory recalls How fifty years ago within these walls ,  --  Ah , crude and callow time !  --  The voice you hear intoned a youthful rhyme To celebrate the founding of this town , Then wearing its well-earned two-centuried crown . Ah , fleeting years of youth ! Ah , passage strange Of scenes since then ; mysterious change on change ! The venerated forms that linked my life With ancestors revered ; the joy , the strife , The blithe companionship of younger days , The opening vistas and the untried ways All fade in broken visions of the past ; Yet in the mould of later years recast They take a shape that old experience lends . Life is not loss , but gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never could foresee . And for such faith what shrine more fit than this , Where past and present meet as with a kiss ,  --  This temple consecrated in the fires Of toil and thought through a long line of sires ; Here where the old beliefs bloom out in free Full blossom in the soul 's calm liberty , And thoughts unknown to ancient Church or State Through daily life now throb and penetrate . Here may the newer faith accept and hold All sound and reverent virtue of the old ; No lamps of vital worship left untrimmed , No high ideal dimmed ; No genuine buddings of a noble life Hurt by the honest thinker 's pruning knife , While thought and feeling with united aim Kindle and keep alive the sacred flame . Be such the mission of the church , to link Young hearts that feel with older minds that think ,  --  Reason and faith fast wedded , bound yet free , Divinely human life their progeny . Here may the vital truth that supersedes The dead forgotten creeds Warm and persuade the hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noble deeds : A living church ,  --  a Christian brotherhood In all high effort for the public good . So may this temple gather in its fold , Conspiring with all agencies that mould The race to higher life , till it shall stand A beacon in the land , And in the coming centuries ever shine Steadfast , undimmed , still lit by truth divine .
