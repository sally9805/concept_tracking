txt T was down in New Mexico that I first made her acquaintance , where we were building the big reservoir at Las Conchas . Her father , Tim Mullaney by name , was a sub-contractor who had about thirty stations-three thousand feet-of the levee to put up . A melancholy kind of Irishman was Tim , industrious and well-meaning , but the thickest-headed Cdt that ever crossed the water . He would n't have lasted two days on the work , if it had not been for Nora , his wife , who was as quick to see as - well , as Tim was n't , and that 's really saying a good deal . What he had to do was the easiest thing in the world : just earthwork with a little third-class masonry here and there ; but he never could get anything right , somehow , and would mix up the simplest instructions unless his wife was by to expound them ; so finally -- I was the engineer in charge of all that part  - -  I would ride down to his camp and explain what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so things got on very nicely after a while , though they were generally broke ; but that was because Tim would insist on running the treasury end of the outfit . I had thirteen miles of work to cover , and in that dusty , desert country , with the mercury anywhere between a hundred and four and a hundred and twenty in the shade , my daily ride of twenty-six miles was apt to be a bit tedious ; and as Nora 's camp was always the neatest-  --  a great thing in that land of flies-  --  and the water in her big red ollas much cooler and more refreshing than anyone else 's , I got into the habit , finally , of making my visit to this camp the last one of the day , and stopping a while to let my horse rest , as I chatted with Nora and chaffed Madeline . Madeline was ten years old and a small edition of her mother , so her VOL . XVJI. - 16 worst enemy could hardly say her beauty amounted to a fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find . She was also her mother 's lieutenant , and an able one , too ; for while Nora was busy about the camp -- and that , of course , was pretty well all the time -- Madeline would patrol the work . Then if anything went wrong there , those who were to blame would hear from it , and very quickly . It was an odd little figure that I used to see cantering toward me as I walked my horse down the dusty length of the half - finished bank . She always rode astride , with the halter shank twisted around her pony 's jaw in lieu of a bridle , and her saddle was a square of canvas cut from an old tent , ornamented with figures drawn on it in ink , in imitation of those the Indians paint on skins . " She tuk all the ink there was in the commishary for thim there dicorashuns , " her father had told me , and I have no doubt he spoke truly ; but as no one in that camp ever wrote any letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it at all , just as it happened , it really did n't matter . The pony himself was a curiosity in his way . He could n't have stood much over eleven hands , and had hair like a goat 's . His mane was as shaggy as a Shetland 's , and so would his tail have been had not Madeline cut it away in links , so that it looked rather like a telescope . Then he seemed , as I remember him , nearly as broad as he was long . This was also owing to his mistress , for she , being exceedingly fond of her steed , and having original ideas about horse-training , persisted in keeping him in the small enclosure of the corral , where all the feed was stored , in order that he might help himself to what he most fancied ; a method which would probably have killed any other horse in the Territory . She had not gained this privilege for Bisnaga ( she had called him after the stumpy , shaggy cactus of that name , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lopes , their Mexican corral-boss , finding his sense of the fitness of things much outraged by this proceeding , took it upon him self to consign Bisnaga to the outer darkness of the main corral . Twice he did this , and attempted it a third time , but Madeline was present on this occasion , and finding her remonstrances unheeded , struck him across the face with a mule whip . He then came toward her , probably to box her ears , so she drew a pistol and cocked it , and he went away . But he always hated her after that . To return . On the animal thus caparisoned would sit Madeline , in a calico frock , very clean , a pink sun-bonnet , scarlet stockings , and tattered , dusty shoes , almost always without buttons , and held on her feet by a pair of enormous Mexican spurs . These spurs were half the pride of her life . The other half was a much-worn red silk parasol , proudly held aloft when its owner rode slowly , but when at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pony with . She wore a leather belt around her waist , fastened with a latego instead of a buckle , and in this was stuck the pistol which completed her attire . It was only a target-pistol about eight inches long ; a single-barrelled affair , throwing a ball " about the size of a homo*opathic pill , " as Mark Twain says ; but such as it was , Madeline would hold it very straight indeed . Thus attired she would come toward me at a lope , and making a sort of military salute with her parasol , would venture to hope that " everything is going right the day ; " for Madeline was not without a touch , though a slight one , of her parents ' rich brogue . Then riding gravely along by my side , she would answer my questions , and straighten out her father 's muddled replies , as we found him , swearing at his scraper-chasers at the end of the dump , and then would scamper back to the camp to let her mother know I was coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great friends . At first , though , all the friendship was on my side , Madeline disapproving of me thoroughly , and on many different counts . To begin with , I was a tenderfoot , as shown by my breeches , boots , and straight spurs , all separate grounds of offence in her eyes . Furthermore , my flat saddle was a trifling affair , not at all suited to the serious business of life . She thought no one who used such a thing could ride , and I could n't as she did . Few men could . Also , it had no thongs hanging all over it , to tie things on by , and no horn whereby to hold a lassoed steer , about all a saddle was good for , anyway . Then my guns were Smith &amp; Wesson 's and not the Colt 's to which she was accustomed . These things were surely enough to condemn anyone , but I was guilty of far more serious offences . I made fun of Bisnaga and of her affection for him , affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This filled her small soul with rage , and for a while Madeline hated me fervently . She always spoke respectfully to me , for if she had not her mother would have ascertained the reason why by a method with which she was painfully familiar ; but when I was sitting sometimes , in the thatched eating shack , she would get behind it into the corral , where , as she could n't see me , she was not obliged to take official notice of my presence , and then would make cutting remarks in technical language and sarcastic tone concerning my horse , his conformation and equipments , and occasionally about myself . One day , however , as I was riding slowly down the road , about a mile from Mullaney 's camp , Madeline suddenly went by me like a flash . I had not heard the sound of Bisnaga 's little bare hoofs on the soft sand , and neither had my horse , for the vision of a wildly flourished flame-colored parasol made him snort and shy . He was n't used to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pony 's heels . She glanced over her shoulder and began frantically to work her passage ; spurs , parasol , and halter-shank all going like mad , leaning well forward and lifting her horse , jockey fashion . I then saw that Madeline was racing with me , and really I never thought so small a pony could go so fast . His little legs looked like a mist under him . Of course he had n't much of a chance // with my long-legged black , so I pulled a bit -- gradually , so she would n't see it  - -  letting her ride in , a winner by some forty yards . The look of triumph she gave me , as she stopped her panting horse by the corral slip-rails , I would n't have missed for anything . This was repeated for the next week or so at frequent intervals , being evidently intended to lower my opinion of my judgment ; but having sufficiently humiliated me , Madeline relented visibly , and even became quite affable at times . Then she saw me jump my horse over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days later , when she took an opportunity of accomplishing the same feat . Then I learned , on inquiry , that in the intervening time she had put Bisnaga over every ditch he could clear , and tumbled him into those he could n't , for miles around . Taking this with the fact that I once killed a jack-rabbit in a manner which met her approval , placed me well in her esteem , and I was correspondingly elated . It was not long after this happy event that I met with an accident . An undermined bank gave way , bringing my horse and me down with it ; I underneath , and the horse together with a ton or so of sand on top . It squeezed me somewhat , enough to lay me up with some exceedingly painful injuries , so that I could do nothing but lie on my cot in the shade and watch the buzzards , as they lazily wheeled about above me , and wishing the while that I might get something besides bacon and frijoles to eat , and someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend to me . It was the third day , I think , when I saw a red spot far down the river trail , which , as it slowly approached , developed into Madeline 's parasoL I wondered if she was commo-to see me , for it would n't strike one that visiting the sick was much in her line , but such was her intention ; for Bisnaga 's head was turned up the path leading to the thatched veranda where I lay , and I saw that he was dressed for the occasion , wearing a bridle with a large brass army bit , and several feathers stuck in his mane . Madeline stopped him , and pulling the reins over his head as an intimation that he was to stop where he stood , came up to my cot . She replied to my salutations in rather an absent way , and looked at me sternly for some time ; but after a while she said , " Mother thought this might taste good after the beans and hog meat , " putting on the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . I thanked her as well as her mother for their kindness , but if she heard me she made no sign , so there was a pause after I had finished , until she asked " How 'd it come to be ? " I told her , and she considered some time , and then- " Bisnaga would n't do no such fool thing as that . " Anxious to conciliate , I said I was sure of it , but Madeline was above flattery and only observed , " If he did I 'd fair frazzle a blacksnake out on im . " This seemed to exhaust the subject , so I said no more , but she appeared to be ill at ease as she stood there , with one arm around the cottonwood log which served as a pillar , scratching her right leg with her left spur ; but finally , nerving herself for a desperate effort , she straightened up . " Mother says she 's sorry you 're hurted , and hopes you 'll be better soon , " said she . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and shouting back " And so do I , " threw in her spurs and vanished in a cloud of dust . I laughed , but I understood her . Though the sentiment recorded above might be justified by an extreme case , she could n't stop to listen to a reply in a like vein . That was too much . Undoing the napkin , I found a chicken , beautifully roastedone of INora 's cherished stock --   --  and it seemed to me that I had never eaten anything so good before . Every day after that , Bisnaga would come slowly up the path , bearing some delicacy , and each time would disappear at his top speed as his small mistress voiced her wish for my recovcry . I wanted to make some acknowledoment to the child for all this , but it was a difficult matter to accomplish - she did n't want no pay , she said . But she was fond of personal adornment as any other young savage , and through this my opportunity came . She was wearing , one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckles , // once part of a pair of suspenders , strung on a buckskin thong instead of a ribbon . A pendent would add finish to this ornament , I suggested , and ventured to offer to act in that capacity a little gold charm I had ; a fish , of Mexican workmanship , jointed in many places , so that it would wriggle when touched . She demurred stoutly at first , but the bewitching squirm of which the thing was capable , together with my arguments , finally prevailed , and I fastened it between the two Jzuckles with a bit of string , so that it hung , flopping as she moved in a most realistic manner . She really thought a great deal of that fish . Above her parasol , rather , I think it ranked , though somewhat beneath her spurs . Then she began bringing me bits of information  --  and very useful ones sometimes-that she gathered in her journeys back and forth concerning the work , until at length I was able to go my rounds once more . The long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days were not quite so torrid , and the nights a great deal cooler , when , returning one morning after a week 's absence on some temporary duty , I found something out of the common going on in the work . The first camp I came to , Brainard 's , was deserted , but the next few were showing a most unaccustomed activity . They were working faster , and the bosses were shorter-tempered than was usual . It was the doing of Schultze , the chief contractor , they told me . It seems that he had been much taken with an earth - moving machine he had seen somewhere  --  a sort of overgrown scraper , pulled by cables - and was desirous of resuming such sub-contracted sections as suited his purpose in order to work them with this arrangement ; therefore they , the subs , were trying to get what they could out of it before the first of the month , when they might be thrown out . It was Mullaney 's part , they said , that Schultze was most anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made it harder to oust him than the rest , so he had hired Brainard 's outfit and was working night and day to hold his contract . I was sorry for all this , Tim being rather a favorite of mine in spite of his stupidity ; for , in his way , he would try to stick to the specifications and do what he was told , while most of the rest used what brains they had in devising methods by which they could avoid doing so . Hurrying through with the work of the other sections , I galloped on to Tim s . Here was a change indeed . He had trebled his force , and the bank was alive with horses and men . Everything was pressed into the service , carts and wheelbarrows eked out the scanty supply of scrapers , and even four- and sixhorse ivagons went groaning down the levee , loaded with the sandy clay . One team was composed of a big gray Percheron horse , a black mule hardly smaller , and two tiny pintos , attached to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalked gravely behind , probably tempted by the high pay to work long enough to enable him to purchase American sardines , rifle-cartridges , canned string beans , and other things dear to the aboriginal heart . There were three or four Indians and a few white men there , but , as is always the case in that country , the great bulk were Mexicans of mongrel race - greasers . All were working feverishly under the profane oratory of the foremen , and working all wrong , too , for Tim having had a whole week in which to make mistakes , had embraced the opportunity ; but I straightened him out after a while , and rode over to Nora 's domain , the camp . The change here was as noticeable as on the dump . The corrals were crowded with tired horses from the night - shift , and the surrounding chapparal was dotted with the sleeping forms of their Mexican drivers . The little blacksmith shop had acquired a new forge , and both were blazing merrily . The eating-shack was being enlarged , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge pile of green arrow-weed was being laid on as thatch by two Indians , as it was handed up to them by a third , while close by stood Nora , vociferously superintending . The cottonwood-shaded // plaza , formed by the camp buildings and tents , was filled with Mexicans , chattering and smoking their crooked brown paper cigarettes as they considered whether or not they should go to work or rest , after having pretended to labor for half a day or so . Nora saw me coming and walked toward me , wiping her face , heated by her eloquence , as she came . She fairly beamed with pleasure , and the invitation to dismount and rest was even more cordial than usual . " Yes , sorr , " she said in answer to my comments on the turn affairs had taken , " things do be booming now for sure . They have to be . You see , sorr , that we have an oiron conthract with that little Dutch blaggard , an ' it ses we must put up twentyfoive hoondther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , ses he , that 's naught but a formality , ses he , an ' if yez goes ahead in a modherate way , sure twill be all right ; but four days gone by , who should roide down the bank but that sem man , an ' gev a warnin ' to Tim that he should requoire the turrms of the conthrac ' carried out as he said . He only wants to get that big slusher in here , that 's pulled by a shtring , an ' pulls down more durt than it can put up . Tim was going to throw everything up , but I wuddent let him , so I med him borra money on our stock an ' buy more , an ' hoire more yet , an ' greasers an ' everything . We 'll call the little divil 's bluff yet . We 're hard put to it for foremen , though . Sure we had to put the store boss on the dump , an ' so Maddy 's running the commishary . She paused to take breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was excitement in this , and contention , so Nora was in her element . They deserved to win , and I hoped they would , but doubted it , for I knew chief contractors are deep and full of guile . I looked in at the door of the little commissary-store , though , as I rode back , and saw Madeline , delighted with her new sphere of action , trying in voluble greaser-Spanish to overcharge a Mexican teamster for a pair of brogans which did n't fit him , and then set out for the home camp . There did n't seem to be much in my mental prophecy of evil at first , the force was increased day by day , and the long bank grew in a manner wondrous to behold . Tim exhausted his magnificent vocabulary in endeavoring to do justice to the shortcomings of the new foremen , and made more blunders himself than any of them , or , for that matter , than all of them ; for Nora was much too busy to take charge of her husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I had to make two visits now , one in the morning to look over what the night-shift had accomplished , and another in the evening to see if anything had been done properly during the day ; for Tim took personal charge then . For some days after this Nora 's smile grew broader and more comprehensive , for Schultze made no attempt to play his hand . No open attempt , that is , but somewhat versed in the ways of his kind , I began to see in him the instigator of the petty annoyances that now made themselves felt . Tools were requisitioned on other service foremen enticed away or made too drunk to go on duty ; commissary and cook-house supplies came irregularly ; Tim 's time-checks became hard to cash , and a thousand and one other things of the same kind , all trivial enough in themselves , met with good nature and overcome in triumph ; until at last the supply question began to be serious . Neither men nor horses can work without food , and they had come to rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laborers began to growl and leave . Day by day this became worse and Nora 's face grew longer , until in a week the crisis came . I had paid my morning visit , when things were much as usual , though I noticed as I passed that Madeline was no longer in the store-there was nothing left to selland that the feed-pen inside the big corral was almost empty . Nora said , however , with all her old manner returned , that though they were down pretty well to their last , it would be all right , for a big order of goods had come in that morning from Albuquerque , and three six - horse teams had gone over to fetch them . Schultze had been there , and had offered them // terms for their contract which had been refused , I gathered , with considerable shortness . He had just gone on down the line , so I would probably meet him . I did not , however , and it would have done no good if I had , for as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said contractor made of the subs under him lay entirely outside our province . His presence was shown by several idle sections down below , and this shortened my work , so that my second visit to Tim 's was made much earlier than was common . As I approached I saw that the overhanging cloud of dust was missing , and no shouting of foremen or teamsters could I hear , so I knew the smash must have come , and without stopping at the levee I rode into the camp . Here it was lively enough , for the little plaza was covered with bunches of excited Mexicans , all jabbering at once in some groups in others listening to the frenzied oratory of some self - appointed leaders as they recapitulated their grievances against the " Mayordomo " - Tim - -  and counselled instant vengeance against him and all " gringos . " Their looks promised evil to all -- so much so , that the knowledge that the horse I rode was able and willing to outrun anything in the county , afforded me considerable satisfaction at the time . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the flies gathered around the unwashed tin plates which still stood , from the men 's dinner , on the long tables in the newly enlarged shack , in front of which a small knot of Mexicans , with malignant faces and important manner , stood listening to iNora 's broken Spanish as she tried to explain the situation to them as the representatives of the rest , though without much success , apparently ; for from time to time they would interrupt her fiercely , with questions and rattling oaths , when her right hand would twitch nervously toward a bulge in the body of her gown which I had never noticed before . They were too much occupied to notice me until I spoke ; then the Mexicans departed to expound , with gestures and blasphemy , the informa tion they had gathered , and which their attendant brethren eagerly awaited on the plaza . Poor Nora Her nerve was gone now , and she almost broke down as she told me , her brogue richer than ever in her excitement , how the men had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little railway station , fifteen miles away , laden only with a curt note from the supply-dealer , to the effect that the goods ordered had been forwarded , and awaited them on cash payment ; but owing to unfavorable reports from Mr. Schultze as to their solvency , no credit-not even the usual thirty days - would be given . This settled matters , for Tim could as easily pay the national debt as to raise the ready money for that grocery bill , so there was nothing left to do but to announce the fact to the assembled men and abide by the consequences . The white men  --  foremen and mechanics - had grumbled a little at the delay ; but as all knew the pay would come , and as work was plenty on the other contracts , they packed their blankets and departed , but with the greasers it was different . They could n't or would n't understand anything ; they wanted payment at once , and threatened all sorts of things in case of its not being immediately forthcoming . She stopped long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , she said , though it was to have been handed me directly I came ; then she took up her story again , only too glad to have some one to talk to . I read the note ; it was an order from head-quarters to return at once , " as fast as your horse will carry you : stop for nothing . " There was no trifling with this , so I started on a gallop for home . I was not used to such orders , even from our imperious old chief , and they troubled me ; so I pushed on still faster as I wondered what their cause could be . Specks in the road quickly became men , with blanket rolls over their shoulders , plodding along in the same direction , who hailed me as I passed with questions I could not stop to answer . Then wagons , and as I flashed by I could see that they were loaded with tents , faro and craps layouts , and barrels of whis // key , all going to the broken camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle men would be but too ready to pledge their pay at an enormous discount for " artificial " whiskey , or to lose it at faro or the seductive monte . Two of these trains in one mile , five in the next , and I pulled up my winded horse at the officetdoor and ran into the chief 's sanctum . He was sitting there with his chair tilted back , softly whistling a tune as he gazed placidly into space . I had reported as ordered , I told him . He finished the air he was executing , and observing , " I know it , " commenced a new one . " What was wanted ? " I asked . He interrupted his musical performance this time long enough to say , " Nothing ; " then took it up again exactly where he had left off . Our superior wa* apt to be exasperating at times , and this was one of them . My patience was rapidly vanishing when he roused himself sufficiently to say that if I had stayed in Mullaney 's camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe , men said , to have a row down there before long , and though he did n't care much individually , my father was a friend of his , so he would prefer returning me alive if convenient . Tim 's estimate had been taken and the sheriff had been sent for , so there was nothing for us to do but to keep still and endeavor , in our poor way , not to make fools of ourselves . He had talked with Schultze , he added with a chuckle , and the small Teuton had departed in some haste for the railway station , intending to return the day after the next with the money . In the outer room , where we lesser fry were wont to congregate , I learned fuller particulars . The chief , it seems had sent for Schultze and remonstrated mildly ; but Schultze was obdurate . Mullaney must wait until the first of the month , like the rest . Then waxed our chief wroth , speaking in a manner unwelcome to contractors when coming from chief engineers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the hastily taken estimate had been worked out , our German friend had left with barely time to catch his train . " And I 'll lay odds , " finished Bailey , my informant , a fellow-assistant and an Englishman , " that the little beggar rode three stone lighter when the chief had done with him . My word though ! I would n't have taken that wigging for six months ' pay . " The messenger sent for the sheriff rode up with the news that this official was absent , but would return that afternoon or evening . We had left the little office building of gray adobe as we talked , and were now sitting on the edge of the cliff of black basalt overlooking the upper work -- we three assistant engineers and the " boys , " as the subordinates of an engineer corps , irrespective of age , are called , watching the scene below . It would seem much as usual to an unaccustomed eye ; but we could see differences . The big cable-way was still swinging great masses of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red signal flags , and the shouts of the masons working there . The pile-drivers thumped as usual at the ends of the long rows of piling which stretched across the flat bottom of the cafion , in the middle of which the river , a mere thread at this season , wound sluggishly along , its channel twisted and doubled by infinitesimal rises and hollows in the hot , white gravel through which it ran . Over against the bottom of the cliff , facing the one on which we sat , and forming the other side of the mesa , or table-land , which the caflon of the river cut in halves , we were excavating for foundations , and all day long the scrapers t6iled in endless procession down into the big pit , filling with the powdery sand , then straining up the side of the hill they had made , around its back , and down into the hole again . This procession was still there , but its order was very open now , and the horses standing in the corrals showed how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lower camps . There was idleness there and bad feeling , so there would surely be much drink , and possibly a fight as well ; a fight with all the odds on their side , and what Sonora greaser could resist such a prospect ? Not these , at all events , and so they had gone , all but a few , who were volunteering their help // in loading a saloon outfit on a big freight-wagon . The kegs of bad whiskey and stone jugs of mescal were already in ; the canvas followed , a few swarthy women of their own race , their gaudy wrappers making bright spots on the sandy stretch , were piled on top , and the whole finally creaked away down the cactus-outlined road , the attendant crowd laughing and singing as they went . Then the sheriff came by in a swinging gallop , with four deputies at his heels , all following the same path . The sun was going down now , and the whistle of the cable-way engine gave the signal for the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps and pile-drivers toward the cook-house . We had just risen to go to our own dining-room when a sound of something scrambling up the face of the mesa made us pause for a moment and then run round the point of rock which hid its cause . It was Madeline on Bisnaga , and both of them nearly at th' top of that almost perpendicular cliff where it would seem that nothing but a goat could go . As we saw them , the little pony attempted to jump up on a ledge of rock from the slope where he was standing . He failed to make it , and slid half-way down the rolling stones on his haunches , but recovering himself quickly under the influence of the big spurs , he scrambled up once more , and was gathering for another spring when one of the boys , dropping over the edge of the cliff , caught the young woman bodily off her charger , handing her up to*us like a small bale of goods ; while another , taking the pony 's head , led him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on her feet , we noticed that there was portent in her attire . She was stripped for action , so to speak , for she had left off both sunbonnet and parasol , while in her belt , balancing her pistol on the other side , hung , in a cowhide sheath of her own manufacture , a good-sized butcher-knife . She had come , she said , with a note to the chief . The greasers were getting ugly now . Lopes , their ex-corral boss , was leading them , and had tried to stop her as she left the camp ; but she had ridden hard for the ford leading to Agua Caliente and the down-river settlements , and hid herself and the pony in the dense growth of arrow-weed on the river 's edge until they had passed , and then cut across country for our camp . " I did n't dare try the trail up the mesa , " she finished ; " I could too easy be stopped there , so I had to come this way . " She looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path she had attempted , and as nearly succeeded in scaling . " Here 's the note , anyhow . I rode awful hard , and I 'm afraid Bisnaga 's all killed up . " He certainly was " all killed up , " for as he stood there with hanging head and his poor little flanks heaving hard , white with sweat , tinged red here and there where cactus thorns or spurs had penetrated , one could n't ask for a better miniature of a thoroughly played-out horse . The chief strolled up to the group , and the note was put into his hands . There were only a few words scrawled in pencil on wrapping-paper , ill spelled and ungrammatical , but very earnest , asking that help might be sent . A few would answer , but with only one white man in the camp " the greasers will surely do us up , " adding that he was very respectfully the chief 's T. Mullaney . The sheriff had already gone , we told Madeline-she would have met him had she come the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the speed and accuracy with which he handled that exponent of frontier law-Colt 's single action , calibre .45 - was well and unfavorably known to them all . Words to this effect cheered her somewhat , but she could n't stay , she said , the " childher " would need her . She must get back . Now . She did n't want any supper . Bisnaga could n't do it again , we urged , but if she would come in and have supper with us , she should see that he was fed to her liking and afterward could have the bay mare to ride , and some of us would go with her . The pony was clearly too much done up to be of any use , and she hesitated , but made no direct reply . " I 'll put Bisnaga into the corral myself , " she said , and catching his halter led him off . When , five minutes later , we went to fetch her , we found the pony placidly // enjoying his customary surfeit in our feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusty comet , rapidly growing less far down the river road . A person fond of her own way was Madeline , and this was characteristic ; but she could hardly take much harm with the sheriff and his men hard by , so we went in to supper . The chile-con-came and the situation of affairs had been duly discussed , when suddenly in the doorway stood the sheriff , his men behind him , eying our table wistfully . " Evenin ' , " he remarked in his soft Texas dialect , which always reminded me of Bret Harte 's stories . " Come down to see if I could n't get yaw men to give us a bite of grub . Been chasm ' greasah cattle thieves all the mawnin ' . Just got back an ' had to come down heah . Ai n't eat any since six o'clock . " " How 's Mullaney 's camp ? " " Oh , all right for now . Greasahs wah cookin ' theah suppuhs . They 'll be quiet enough till they get done eatin ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when I can get some moah men . Need em befoah mawnin ' , I reckon . " We made room for them at the table , which most of us were ready to leave anyway , and gave orders to Joe , our Chinese cook , and Sing , his mate , to get ready whatever could be quickly prepared . It was extra work for the Celestials and they did n't like it . It broke their routine , but they knew what happened to Chinamen who trifled with the sheriff , and so soon had food on the table which seemed very welcome to the halffamished men who sat down to it . We talked it over , a few of us , outside , in consequence of which , seeing that the sheriff was making a most excellent meal , and was presumably therefore in a good humor , I went in and spoke to him . A few of us wanted to see what was going on below , I told him , but we wanted it kept quiet . The chief might not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let us in for any trial or coroner 's jury as witnesses . He was rather a friend of mine , and consented readily enough . Said he : " I wo n't call on you , but you 'll get youah fool hides shot full of holes , like as not . " I turned to leave , but he called me back . " If you do have to pull youah guns , do n't try to club no one with the barrels . Use em the way God meant em to be used . About belt high . I 'll be than soon . " The point was gained , and communicating the joyful news to the rest , we set out , on foot ; for not only would the whole camp know if we tried to saddle horses , but though it was six miles by road , the distance was reduced to less than half if one walked across the mesa where no horse could well go , for the table-land jutted out into the river-flat in the shape of a peninsula , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark at first , but after a while the moon came up , lighting a little the narrow path over the bowlder-strewn plain . We went in single file , Barton , my rodman , who knew the country like an Indian , at the head as guide , then my instrument-man . I came next , followed by Bailey , who , like most Englishmen , being unable to hit anything with a pistol , had armed himself with one of his many shot-guns-an eight-bore ducking affair-with twenty buckshot in each barreL After him Brown , his rodman , the rear being brought up by the long , shambling form of Smiley , a masonry inspector . He was from Alabama , and also eschewed the prevalent Colts , preferring a pair of double-barrelled derringers , one of which he carried in each side-pocket of his trousers , in order , as he said , that he might , if occasion required , " nail a man through his pants , " without wasting time in drawing , such being the pleasing custom of the country whence he came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peninsula , down the steep pass on its farther side , and out on the flat . In front of us the levee showed faintly gray against the deep black of the opposite cliff , and turning sharply to the left , we skirted its base , silently , for our footsteps in the yielding sand gave no sound . As we went the outline of the bank grew more distinct , and finally stood in bold relief against the ruddy glare of a large brush fire , which we could hear crackling fiercely on its other side . Shrill voices floated over to us , speaking in Spanish , angrily . Then came a sound from the camp hard by , // followed by a dead silence ; every voice hushed . We listened , and it came again , Tim 's brogue , unmistakable even in its agonized tones . " Hands up ! " he cried . " Hands up or I'll-ahwould ye ? Drop that rifle ! Quickthere , stand back . " We broke into a run over the bank , past the fire-deserted now-around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the saloons outside had put out their lights , and Nora 's tent alone shone like pearl , as tents do when there is a light inside them . The moon was still low upon the mesa , outlining in black the sujuarro cacti that stood like giant candelabra along its edge , and throwing the shadow of the cliff far out on the plain below . The tent had the river at its back . The flaps were down , and before them stood Tim , his face white and set , with a Winchester cocked and held at " ready " on his hip . A space of forty feet or so , and Lopes stood , while behind him , on the edge of the shadow , were twenty or more of his comrades , all motionless as statues . As we came we saw that the ex-corral boss 's hands were held high above his head ; but taking advantage of the diversion caused by our advent , he dropped them to his sides , but he made no move to touch the rifle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for that would have been death . The situation explained itself : there was nothing to say , so we all lined up , with Tim in the middle , and stood by . A little stir among the forms , dimly seen in the black shade , then all was still - deathly stillness , broken only by the hooting of an owl in the brush that lined the river banks . The minutes slowly passed , then a spark winked like a firefly half-way up the mesa ; a bullet sung far over our heads , the report echoed faintly from cliff to cliff , and as it died away a coyote somewhere on the plain above began to yelp , answered by the shrill barking of a little dog from one of the tents ; then the nerve-racking silence again . Five minutes of it , probably-hours it seemed , and I could stand still no longer , so shoving back into its holster the pistol I had drawn , I turned , and lifting a flap , looked into the tent . A lantern , hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would throw no shadow on the walls , lighted the little interior . In a cot standing on one side the two younger children , a boy and a girl , of four and three years , lay fast asleep , the elder hugging a hatchet with both arms . On a camp-stool at the bed 's head sat Nora . She was crying , poor thing , and wiping her eyes with her left hand , while her right held , the butt , resting on her knee , of one of those sawed-off shotguns affected by expressmessengers , and so called Wells Fargos . In frQnt and on the other side of the tent was Madeline , trembling and white , but not crying , though her bare feet worked together nervously . She had just been going to bed , probably , when the danger came , for her frock lay on the floor beside her . In one hand she held her little pistol , a box of its tiny cartridges in the other . As I came in Nora looked up . " Gud avenin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Madeline gave me an uncertain kind of smile ; but before I could speak a movement in the crowd outside caused me to drop the canvas and turn back to my place in the line . The shadow had receded somewhat now , and many stood in the moonlight . Lopes had stepped backward into the crowd , which was increasing every second , one could n't tell just how , but simply became conscious from time to time that the cluster was extending on both sides and growing deeper . There was undergrowth on our right , and in its shadow a man stole , crouching , around our flank . Smiley stood there , and his derringer barked hoarse ly . The figure disappeared , whether hit or not we never knew . Then a sharp crack from behind , and a man howled and clapped both hands to his thigh I looked around-we all did , I thinkin time to see Madeline 's head and shoulders protruding from under the tent , just before she disappeared suddenly , exactly as though Nora had caught her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking advantage of our divided attention , stooped to pick up the rifle Lopes had dropped . Three of us fired at once , and he fell limply , with his breast across the piece which // had cost him his life , his sombrero , heavy with silver , rolling almost to our feet . A moment 's pause was broken again by a coyote on the desert above , and as if he had given a signal , was answered by the scratching of a match on the opposite side of the plaza ; then with a crackle and roar the dry thatch forming a side of the blacksmith shop blazed up , the roof caught , and all was bright as day in an instant . A man sprang away from the burning shop , and Tim fired at him  --  and missed . A shrill yell , such as greasers delight in on every occasion was raised far back in the crowd , then taken up by them all , and the whole mass surged slowly forward . Those in front had knives in their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety , and advanced slowly , without eagerness , but more as if forced forward by those behind them . One of our men -- which one I could not tell-cried out to them to halt . A shot answered him , the ball ripping the thigh of the man standing next me ; then a volley crashed from our men as if by command , and I could see a man drop here and there . The wounded man , Barton , had sunk to a sitting posture , and steadying himself by passing one arm round my leg , was emptying his pistol at the close - standing band of Mexicans . The smoke hung in a low cloud in front of us , and I remember , in a con-. fused sort of way , the brisk rattle of the pistol-shots , twice punctuated by the roar of Bailey 's big duck-gun , and of firing into the dense smoke rapidly with both hands . Our opponents stopped , then gave back a little , and the firing slacked somewhat . A wandering puff of wind lifted the thickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing ahead of his fellows . I shot at him , and he pitched forward on his hands and knees , then rolled over and lay still . The sight made me sick for one moment , but I forgot it in the next , for , as a warning yell sounded from among them , the crowd scuttled to cover like a flock of frightened quaiL For an instant the cause was not apparent , but a sharp report was followed by the sud den appearance of the sheriff from the thicket-lined road , with twelve men at his back , all riding as fast as their wiry cow-ponies could run . Most of the Mexicans had taken to the chaparral , but a few ran down the road , and , crossing our front , the officers followed these without a sound . A few scattering shots came from the brush , and the horse ridden by one of the deputies reared and fell backward with a scream . The man was up in a second , uncinching his saddle , while Brown and Smiley , running to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and led her out . She was saddled , mounted , and away while one tells of it . The field was clear , and , to my surprise , the dead and wounded were not lying around in bloody heaps as I expected . Six there were , and our rodman , seven in alL The latter had but a graze , and when we had bound it up and given him some whiskey , professed himself quite comfortable and willing to do it all over again . The posse had not gone far , and soon returned ; the sheriff rode up to where we were standing . " You want to get youah wife an ' the kids away from heah , " he said to Tim . " I ca n't spah no men to guahd this place , an ' than 's no tellin ' when them greasahs 'll be back with a lot moah from below . Go to the big camp . We 'll help you hahness up , but you must get a wiggle on . " Six snorting horses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs by many willing hands , when Madeline , fully dressed , left the tent and walked over to the corraL She stood looking into the enclosure for a minute , then sat down in a heap on the sand , and for the first time in my knowledge of her , commenced to cry . " I have n't got no horse to ride , " she wailed . It was only for a moment though , for she rose , and glancing around severely to see if her weakness had been noticed , she stalked up to the wagon , and began helping to pack the things handed into it . Everything was soon ready ; the cots , bedding , children , and Nora were bundled in ; Barton was helped to the front seat with Tim , we followed , // finding places anywhere , and the horses started in a canter over the level road toward the home camp . We had toiled up a hill at a walk , and had just reached its top , where Tim , with an oath , pulled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smothered howl , and some one started to speak , but checked himself and listened instead . We all heard it then , a sound as of many galloping horses , far away , and then a silence , which Tim broke . " For good or ill , " said he , " they 've crossed the stretch of baked clay and are on the sand now . They 'll come to rock directly . Listen . " Another moment and the clang of hoofs was plainly heard . " Them horses is shod . The Virgin be praised , they 're friends . " " Amen , " responded Nora , with a sigh ; but Smiley jumped to his feet , and putting both hands to his mouth , gave the cry , well known in that country , from which the tribe of Mexican Indians take their name . qui ! " he called , then again " yaqui ! " The shrill falsetto of this carries far , like the " coee " of the Australians . " Yaqui ! " a third time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , and in another few seconds they had rounded the point of the mesa and streamed toward us in the moonlight , sixty strong . At their head rode the handsome form of " Greaser Pete , " saloon-keeper , gambler , reputed stage - robber , and all around " bad man , " yet , withal , a very decent sort of fellow according to his somewhat limited light ; he had earned his nickname from his relentless hatred toward the race of which it spoke , and a more congenial mission than his present one could not be found . A mixed lot followed him , mechanics , saloon-men , gamblers , and cowboys ; all were represented . Mounted though they were , each on the first four-legged thing he could snatch out of the nearest corral , some with saddles , but more without , all were heavily armed and were riding fast . Our corral boss was among them , and beside his little white mare , Bailey 's roan horse and my black , both fully equipped , loped contentedly along . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , but their leader raised his hand to command silence , and having learned in a few words all there was to know , turned to his followers , and made what was , for him , a rather lengthy address . " Boys , " said he , " it seems we 're a little late , but we may see some fun yet , if we hurry . Yamenos . " Then with a yell the " committee " dashed off , and we started once more for our camp , which we reached without further incident . We saw that the Mullaneys were made comfortable in a tent , vacated by a foreman for their use , and having helped Barton to bed , turned to our own , well tired out . I had slept about ten minutes , as I thought at the time , when I became dimly conscious that I was not resting easily . I looked up , and saw that it was daylight , and that Bailey , half dressed , was shaking me violently by the shoulder . " Wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , as soon as I was sufficiently awake to understand him . " You 're wanted . That child , Madeline , has gone , and we 're afraid something 's happened her . Search parties are going out . The chief 's sending everyone . " He left me to complete his own toilet , but I was wide - awake now , and tumbling into my clothes , opened the door to find Bailey , already mounted , and holding the bridle of one of my horses , impatiently awaiting me . We went slowly to save our stock , for we could not tell how far they might have to travel before they saw their corrals again , *nd as we jogged along , he told me what little he knew of the affair . It seemed that when she woke iNora had missed Madeline , and on making inquiry had found that she had been seen by a teamster , feeding his horses half an hour before daybreak , on Bisnaga , cantering toward the camp she had left the night before . Tim and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but except that Bisnaga was standing , tied to the corral fence , no sign of the child could they find , so they returned and roused the head-camp . It was thought that she had returned after something forgotten in the hurry of leaving , and all feared that she had met with some accident . An object , nearing us rapidly as we talked , we now saw to be a buckboard , driven in a furious gallop by Selwin , one of our instru // ment men . " Found her ? " shouted Bailey , as the team came close enough for him to be heard . Seiwin nodded . " Alive ? " " Just . I 'm going for her mother now . " The buckboard rushed by , and we pushed on . hurriedly . A group of men stood around the entrance of the tent . Pete was among them , and the sheriff with some of his posse . " We found her in the brush yonder , " one of them was explaining to a new-coiner as we rode up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knife that done it , all right enough , with a greaser at the end of it . " The tent seemed to have grown smaller since I had seen it the night before , as I entered it . It was crowded with men , gathered around a cot standing in the middle of the little space , on which , partly covered with barley-sacks , lay Madeline . Her eyes were closed and she was breathing heavily . The upper part of her clothing had been cut away , and her body , throat , and right arm were swathed in rude bandages , made of bandanna handkerchiefs torn into strips , their white spots , in places , dyed a uniform color with the groundwork . Her left arm lay by her side , the hand tightly clinched . A bucket of reddened water , with a crimsoned cloth lying over its edge , stood beside the bed , flanked by a flask of whiskey . On an upturned soap-box by the cot 's head sat Tim , leaning over and fanning the child softly with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " No , sorr , " he replied , with a catch in his breath . " Just bike this . She med a little moan like eonce , that 's alL She 'll never tell who done it , I fear . " One of the men standing near turned , and with a muttered oath , left the tent . The air was stifling in there , and close with the odor of packed humanity , and seeing Madeline 's knife in its cowhide sheath , lying on the ground by my feet , I drew it , and making two long slits in the canvas , opened a triangular window there . Someone followed suit on the other side , and then the fresh breeze gushed through , and Tim , dropping his hat , rested his chin on his hands , and stared hard at the ground between his knees . The air seemed to revive Madeline a little , for she moved her left arm and opened her eyes . I was bending over her , and as she saw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her necklace-  --  the buckles with the little fish I had given her . Then her eyes closed again , and the tin buckles jingled on the ground . A cowboy who stood near lifted them , replacing them gently in her upturned palm . I could n't stand it any longer ; so I left the tent , and joined the men outside . I asked the particulars , but there were few to be told . A little dog  --  the same which had answered the coyote the night before -- had guided them to where she lay in the chapparal , and they had brought her in-that was all . A man had gone over to the station to wire for a doctor and a priest , but it was n't likely they would be in time to do any good . Some men were beating around through the brush , and one of them now walked quickly toward us . " I found this little gun out yoftder , " he said . " It 's hers , ai n't it ? " A dozen voices testified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , threw open the breech , and drew out an empty cartridge-shelL " She done her little best , " said he , holding it up so all could see . " She surely mahked him , whoevah he was . Find a greasah with a pin-hole in him , and we 've nailed the man . " " You ca n't tell by that . She got one last night , " objected Bailey . " That cuss is all right . He had one o ' those tinwah six shootahs , so somebody killed him . He did n't do no cuttin ' . " The buckboard had accomplishi*d its mission quickly , and now came rattling up the plaza , the horses-  --  a different pair from those we had seen before -- panting and white with sweat . Nora was helped to the ground , and as she entered the tent the men inside filed silently out . We began to organize now . Onehalf of the men , under the sheriff , were to go through the down-river camps , to catch the criminal in case he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , divided into small squads , were to search the country roundabout . I attached myself to the former party , for , knowing the localities through which we were to go // from my daily work , I could be of more use so . It took us a good while  - -  until well along in the afternoon -- to get through this , for the sheriff was very thorough , and each Mexican we met was put through a most rigid examination . Then , at the very last , we found what we thought was a most promising trail , and followed it , ten of us , while the rest worked on down the river . Straight across the desert it went , we following fast , and finding , at its end , an inoffensive old prospector , who , with two burros , was making for the placer grounds across the Arizona line . Tired and disgusted , Bailey and I tried to get back by a short cut , got lost , and reached our camp at midnight ravenously hungry and tired out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corned beef and biscuit for us , and as we ate , in answer to our questions , told us that we were the last of the search parties to come in except Pete and his men , and no one knew where they had gone . None of the others had found anything . The priest had come in on muleback an hour before . Madeline had rallied a little for a few minutes , just as he reached there , and had tried to speak , but could n't , though when they asked her as to her assailant , had turned her eyes toward the side of the tent where the corral lay , so they thought that Lopes was the man we wanted . Anyhow , if he was caught , we would accept that hypothesis as correct and run it out on those lines . Did n't we think that was the best way ? We did think so , and made an agreement , on the strength of this additional clew , to try it once more ; then going to our quarters , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we stood , to be ready when morning came . We had just fallen into a doze , or at least I had , when a footstep on the veranda aroused me . It was easily recognized as Selwin 's , who was lame , and I hailed him . " How is the child-have you heard ? " I asked . " She died an hour ago , " he replied , and limping to his room , threw himself on his cot , and said no more . We were not as early next morning as we had intended-we were a long time in getting to sleep the night before-and it was nearly nine o'clock when we got away . The camp was very still as we rode out from it . Not at all a Sunday stillness , for there were no drunken shouts coming from its saloons , and the voice of the faro-dealer was not heard , but a depressed sort of silence that could be felt . Preparations for the funeral were already underway , for it was to take place at noon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little grave was already opened , among the cluster of others , on a rise of ground a few hundred yards away , and two of our boys were lining it with greasewood boughs , as the best substitute for evergreen that was to be had , while Selwin was kneeling over a little cross made of heavy timber , on which , with all the skill of a practised draughtsman , he had lettered an inscription , and was now carving it deep into the wood . The sight did not foster kindness of feeling toward the absent Lopes , and we pushed on , making for the nearest ford ; for we meant to try the opposite side of the river to-day as the most likely place to find our man . When we reached it , however , we saw where the water was deepest a tired horse , drinking as though he would never get enough , while on his back sat Greaser Pete covered with dust , but wearing on his handsome and rather sad face an expression of the most complete self-satisfaction . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get him ? " I called . " I believe they did , " he replied . " Lopes ? " " Yep . Little hole in his arm . " " Where is he now ? " * " Ca n't say . Purgatory , likely , if there is such a place ; if not , he probably went straight through without stopping . " Pete was becoming facetious . This was something new . " How did they send him there ? " asked Bailey . " Cabled him , I imagine , " was the response . I looked at his saddle-bow . The lariat that had always hung there was missing now , and Pete , following my glance , smiled , and calling upon his horse , walked out of the river and cantered away . // By Charles L. Dana , MD . IT is now about two years since a band of Peruvian Indians came to this country for the purpose of amusing the American public . They were not sufficiently interesting to attract attention , so they became stranded and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribe was known as the Peruvian Giant . He was soon taken ill , and came under my observation at the hospital . I saw at once that he was not only a giant , but a victim of a peculiar disease known as acromegaly ( aKpov , extremely ; , tieyaXo* , great ) . In persons who have this disorder , the head , and particularly the face , the hands , feet , and the chest grow to enormous proportions , the total height , in most cases , not being greatly increased . However , the Peruvian Giant had not only enormous feet , hands , and head , but he measured six feet nine inches in height , and in stature and weight was genuinely gigantic . He was , in fact , both an " acromegalic " and a giant . He died , after a short illness , from the effects of his disease , and in the brain there was found a little gland known as the pituitary body , enlarged to many times its original size . Now , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlargement of this gland was the cause of the gigantic growth of the extremities in acromegaly . It occurred to me that it might also be the cause of giantism in general , and the further legitimate inference was that all giants were simply peculiar types of acromegaly , and that giantism was only a form of nervous disease . The idea that big men are not simply freaks , as has been previously supposed , but victims of a neurosis or nervous disorder , was one of sufficient interest to justify me in following up the subject of giants from the neurologist 's standpoint , and my results , I think , have justified the expenditure of some little time on the matter , as well as furnished , perhaps ,
