txt Sir William Vernon Harcourt , leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons , addressed a large and important meeting of Welsh Liberal electors this evening at Abertillery . Discussing Cretan affairs , he declared that Great Britain has never before occupied a position of which she had so much reason to be ashamed . " The union Of Crete and Greece , " he said , " is the proper ultimate solution of the difficulty . If that had been permitted , there would have been no war . The powers are only anxious to preserve Turkish integrity as long as it suits themselves . The whole integrity formula is a sham . It has been said that a ukase has gone forth to let Greece perish . If that is the decision of England , and if the concert of Europe results In the doom of freedom in Greece , it will arouse in the breasts of all Englishmen sentiments of the sternest indignation and the deepest disgust . " The Parliamentary Secretary for the Foreign Office , Mr. George N. Curzon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal Member for Northampton , said no agreement had been reached relative to the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from Crete . A majority of the Powers , he added , were of the opinion that the Greeks must leave first . Cheers . Continuing , Mr. Curzon informed the House that the Admirals of the foreign fleets in Cretan waters had decided that the deportation of the Turks would imperil 49,000 Cretan Mussulmans in Candia alone , In conclusion , Mr. Curzon remarked that the Powers had no intention of occupying any portion of Greek territory and declaring it neutral . The fact that a Cabinet meeting was held here this morning before the return  --  expected on Thursday next  --  of the Marquis of Salisbury is held to indicate that matters of urgency are under consideration .
