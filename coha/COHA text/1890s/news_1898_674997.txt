txt The Echo de Paris today expresses strong approval of the speech delivered at Worcester , Mass. , on Nov. 1 by Senator Hoar , in which he denounced the so-called policy of American expansion . The paper mentioned quotes the speech fully , and remarks that all American political men " apparently do not agree with the policy of conquest . " The Figaro says : " The peace negotiations have reached a very critical point , Up to yesterday the Spanish delegates had received no definite instructions from Madrid . Will the Spanish Government accept the American proposition ? We doubt it . " The Petit Bleu remarks : " One must admit in looking beneath the surface that the late war has completely changed the American character . Outside of being anxious merely for commercial supremacy and playing a small political part , save regarding the South American republics , the United States felt no desire to interfere in European politics . But everything changed very suddenly . After the success against Spain the American Government felt itself capable of taking part in European politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministers they could speak up . This popular feeling has Induced the Amer --  can Government to demand the whole of the archipelago , when at the outset a part of the Philippines was all that was demanded . " This new demand exceeds a war indemnity , and this is the weak point which American diplomacy has encountered . The Spanish Government is at the end of its resources , and , hopeless as it is for her to attempt to master the insurrection in the Philippine Islands , even if they were handed over to her to-morrow , it is evident that if , instead of using the word abandonment , ' ' cession , ' against a cash indemnity , is spoken of , the Spanish and American delegates may come to terms . " The American delegates have made several offers , and have at the present time proposed the sum of $40,000,000 . The Spaniards avant more , and have demanded $100. - 000,000 . " The Spanish delegates , for whose sad condition one must feel pity , had for a moment the illusion that Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have lost this illusion by now . American diplomacy has played its part with great cleverness , and has from- the outset gained an extraordinary position . At the present moment the UnAed States is taking advantage of the hatred against England which is growing upon the Continent , and offers its neutrality if Europe will leave the United States a free hand with Spain . " Besides , Europe really has no interest to interfere . The various European Governments Poi esee what will inevitably come if the United States restores the Philippine Islands to Spain . As soon as Spain had proved her inability to quash the revolt Germany would offer her interested assistance , and immediately the covetousness of French , English , and Russian diplomacy would provoke international intervention , which would raise a quarrel of exceptional gravity . " At the present moment it is because something of the sort might happen that the attitude of Europe in general toward the Spaniards and Americans is as follows : " ' Come to some agreement about the price of the Philippines . make concessions on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There are plenty of troubles floating round just now upon the political horizon without a prolongation of these dangerous negotiations of yours . ' "
