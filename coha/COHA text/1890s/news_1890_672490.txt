txt If the Democratic Congressional Committee or the leaders of the party desire to see a Democratic majority in the next Congress , it might be well for them to pay some attention to the campaign in some of the Congressional districts in Illinois , Indiana . Wisconsin , and other Western States . There are districts in the Western Territory which may properly be classed as Demooratio , while they are now renresented by Republicans , and which are now " doubtful " districts in the sense that the Republicans have no " cinch " on them by which they may expect to return the sitting members . Neither have the Democrats any possibility of carrying them unless a large amount of work is done and advantage taken of circumstances which undoubtedly favor them . The Democratic leaders in the West are inclined to feel hurt at the way their requests for assistance from the National Committee have been received . The Eastern men seem to have no conception of the situation in the Western political world . When any allusion to the farmer organization is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

What is true of Cannon 's distriet is true of other districts in this State . In one instance it is a sitting Democrat who is in danger of losing his seat to a Republican unless immediate steps are taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district Is the one referred to . The attention of the National Committee has been called to these facts , but eo far it has done nothing . There seems to be a disposition on the part of the general committees to let each Western State take care of itself . Men here realize that they are not entitled to any assistance unless they put their own shoulders to the wheel , and this they have already done . A splendid campaign is being waged in Illinois , Indiana , and Wisconsin on the State tickets . Speakers from one State are sent to the others , and a great deal of interest is being worked up . But this is not enough . With the possibilities so great the most strenuous efforts should be put forward by the Democratic Party at large , so that full advantage may be taken of them . A Democratic majority in the next Congress can be secured in the Mississippi Valley . If it is not . the Democrats here believe it will be because of the supineness of the men . at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
