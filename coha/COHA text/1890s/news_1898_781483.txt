Cabinet to share the shipwreck of a pot . Icy he never approved . Whatever may ; be the outcome , the disquieting idea is undoubtedly prevalent in Conservative circles that Mr. Chamberlain contemplates some sensational move ; and the extent to which ' this is credited shows how little Mr. Chamberlain can count upon Tory confidence ; ' The Marquis of Lansdowne , Secretary a State for War , addressing the Conservative Unions of London this evening , indorsed the recent* Birmingham speech of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chamberlain expressed the hope that the day would come when the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack would wave together over an Anglo-Saxon alliance .
