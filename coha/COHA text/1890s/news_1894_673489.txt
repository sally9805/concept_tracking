txt The latest returns from the election in Troy , though imperfect , indicate the election of Malloy , Murphy 's candidate for Mayor , by a plurality of some 581 . There . s not much room for doubt that this is fraudulent . The normal Democratic majority in Troy is not easily calculated . Last year Murphy turned in one of 5,849 for the State ticket ; the previous year he allowed Mr. Cleveland to have one of 2,507 . Whelan , representing the revolt against Murphy in his own party and indorsed by the Republicans , may be regarded as sure of a majority in a fair election with an honest count . But the Murphy machine would not have resisted watching by violence and murder if it had intended a fair election and an honest count . Every legal method to expose and correct fraud should be employed . The Lexow committee has resolved to employ John W. Goff and William A. Sutherland as counsel and to begin investigating on Friday . It has also resolved to have a bill introduced appropriating $25,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beginning of the next session of the Legislature and authorizing the committee to sit during the recess . This looks like business , but there are " contingencies " yet . Mr. Goff has asked for the assurance that expenses will be provided for before consenting to act as counsel , but the introduction of a bill is not assurance . The bill must pass and have the approval of the Democratic Governor before the expenses are really provided for , and until that is done there will be no absolute assurance . It is safe to say that the investigation will not be very vigorous until after the Legislature adjourns , and then it will depend on the appropriation . If the money is provided , we may be sure that it will be expended , and there will probably be an investigation which will have much more reference to the next election than to the reform of the police administration of the city . The proposition which was presented to the Rapid-Transit Commission by R. T. Wilson &; Co. for the construction of an underground railroad system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaned to a private corporation to the extent of two-thirds of the cost , was withdrawn yesterday in the interest of the Hewitt plan of construction on municipal account . . - New all schemes for more elevated roads in our streets should be withdrawn or thrown out , and a united effort should be made to obtain real rapid transit for the city . The way is plain . The solution lies in an underground system of railroads , constructed with funds raised on the city 's credit and used for the city and not for a private corporation , but under an arrangement whereby the work of construction and operation should be done by a corporation bound to pay the interest on the bonds and provide for the payment of the principle as a rental of the property . The ultimate cost to the city would be nothing , while the benefit would be enormous . There would be nothing in it for the politicians , but much for the people of the city . Under these circumstances , can the legislation needed to authorize and execute the plan be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . For the first time in English history it has been seen that a peerage is an actual drawback to political prefer ment . There was no opposition to th promotion of Lord Rosebery except tha he was a Lord . If he had been a mem ber of the House of Commons he would not have been opposed . The objectioi was not considered very serious by th bulk of the Liberals , but Mr. Labouch ? rl and his faction represent a real senti ment . This sentiment has been propiti ated by inspired assurances that Lon Rosebery had no illusions about his or der or prejudices in its favor , as indeec he has shown that he had not . It is probable that he will not obstruct , as Mr Gladstone would have obstructed , the movement for the mending or ending of the upper house . It is scarcely credible that any attempt will be made to govern Great Britain by a single chamber  --  and there is plenty of room for discussion about what will take the place of the House of Lords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
