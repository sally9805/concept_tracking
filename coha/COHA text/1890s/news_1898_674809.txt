txt We are not aware that Mr. NELSON DINGLEY , Jr. , has exhibited any interest in the war outside of what may comically be called his own province of providing ways and means for carrying it on . He has confined himself to powerful demonstrations that his Revenue bill , which was expressly- framed in order not to produce revenue , would nevertheless have produced abundant revenue but for " anticipatory importations . " While he was engaged in showing that the able measure with which his name is connected would both increase the revenue and prevent importations , the war broke out , doubtless to his extreme disgust . We say doubtless , because , as we have before remarked , wars can not be conducted on wind . You really must have money . In one way the breaking out of war is fortunate for Mr. DINGLEY . It is , like the " anticipatory importations , " an act of Goo or the public enemies , for the consequences of which he can not be held responsible . But it entails various disadvantages which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to make of Mr. DINGLEY , as the subject of the Protectionist fixed idea. , a peace-atany-price man . In the first place , when you have a war you must have a revenue . You can not devise a system which you may commend to public favor upon the ground that it does and also that it does not produce revenue . You must at once levy a lot of taxes of which the sole justification is that they will elicit money . Such taxes must be viewed by Mr. DINGLEY with apprehension and alarm . Because , since it will appear that they can be trusted to produce revenue without respect to anticipatory importations or other uncertainties , there will be likely to arise a feeling that they ought to be maintained , and that the kind of tariff which falla if it produces revenue , and also fails if it does not produce revenue , can properly be abandoned , . and only such duties retained as are sure of producing revenue . But this is not the whole ease . There is no doubt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial expansion of the United States . We shall insist upon doing more business than we have heretofore done With the western shore of the Pacific Ocean . A tariff which keeps European goods out of America is evidently not a tariff that will let American goods in increased quantities into Asia . We strongly object to Russia and Germany building tariff fences about their several claims in China , and insist upon the British policy of " the open door . " We have not made any official pronouncement in favor of this as yet , being moved , apparently , by consideration for the feelings of DrwaLEY . But that can not last long . The whole trading interest of the country will soon demand that we secure our share of the trade of the East , and that to that end we insist upon the open door . But how will we look if we notify France and Russia that we demand an open door China while at the same time we encourage DINGLEY to shut our own door tighter , and to fabricate new bolts and bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dingleyism and commercial expansion , evidently do not go together .
