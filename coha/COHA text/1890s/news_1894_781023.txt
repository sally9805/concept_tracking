txt The Baltimore editor who has just described the Senate as a " case of Aduleam. " fun of aerators who are " in debt , " or " distressed " or " discontented , " prepared his readers for the call issued this afternoon by Secretary Carlisle for bids for 150,000,000 , of 5 per cent . bonds . Senator Voorhees 's statement issued yesterday was an admission that there was something like a case of dullness at the Capitol , and also an admission that the Democrats of the Senate were not sufficiently interested in the party to which they were nominally attached to keep that party from starvation unless it could be Seel by some queer financial experiment that business men were unwilling to inelorse and accept . There are Democrats who feel indigelation. because Secretary Carlisle has ventured to do the thing it is now plain he should have done months ago . They are the men like Bailey of Texas , who would take away even the power lodged with the Sectary by the resumption act , and compel him to obtain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made respectful request of Congress , by the Issue of notes representing prospective profits on the coinage of silver . The Bailey sort is only a trifle less disappointed than are the Populists , who would meet the needs of the Treasury by Issuing some millions of , new promises to Pay . greenbacks without backing or any hope of a redeemer . It is the general opinion here that the Secretary of the Treasury will receive offers for the new bonds so promptly and in such amounts as to cover the eetlre $50,000 , - 000 before the end of this week . Nothing is more probable than that some Democrat who was opposed to the issue will now insist that the Secretary has no right to use the gold obtained under the resumption act to pay current liabilities . Re has been for several months using gold so obtained for just such purposes . He may choose to say that he is still drawing upon the remnant of that fund , and not upon the new stock of gold . But he must either use the fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encroaching upon the gold reserve of $ ' 1.00 , - 100,000 , the Democrats would have been wiser if they had eIrtc.rta Pet to him earlier the authority to secure gold by the issue id short-term bonds at a low rate of in-terest It is fortunate for the Administration that there was a law already made to tide it over the emergency . The Adullamites of the Senate are a pretty poor sort of reliance now for a Democratic Aerninistration . They will probably look much better when they are vainly protesting against the harmonious Republican supporters of a Republican Administration , and occasionally suspending their mechanical railing in the name of Democracy to devour the bones and crumbs tossed at them by a Republican President Following is the text of Secretary Carlisle 's circular : " By virtue of the authority contained in the act entitled ' An Act to Provide for the Resumption of Specie Payment , ' approved Jan. 14 , 1875. the Secretary of the Treasury hereby offers for public subscription an issue of bonds of the Ignited States to the amount of $50,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 550 and upward , redeemable in coin at the pleasure of the Government after ten years from the date of their issue . and bearing interest , payable quarterly in coin , at the rate of 5 per cent . per annum . " Proposals for the whole or any part of these bonds will be received at the Treasury Department , office of the Secretary , until 12 o'clock noon on the Let day of February , 1834 . Proposals should state the amount of bonds desired , whether registered or coupon , and the premium which the subscriber proposes to pay , the place where it is desired that the bonds shall be delivered , and the office , whether that of the Treasurer of the United States or an Assistant Treasurer of the United States , where it will be most convenient for the subscriber to deposit the amount of his subscription . Failure to specify the above particulars may cause the proposal to be rejected . " As soon as practicable after the let day of February , 1894 , the allotment of bonds will be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be considered at a lower price than 117.223 , which is the equivalent of a. 3 per cent bond at par , and the right to reject any and all proposals is hereby expressly reserved . In case the bids entitled to allotment exceed the bonds to be issued , they will be allotted pro rata . " Notices of the date of delivery of the bonds will be sent to the subscribers to whom allotments are made as soon as practicable , and within ten days from the date of such notice subscriptions must be paid in United States gold coin to the Treasurer or such Assistant Treasurer of the United States as the subscriber has designated , and if not so paid the proposal may be reJected . " The bonds will be dated Feb. 1 , 1894 , and when payment Is made therefor , as above , accrued interest on both principal and premium from Feb. 1 . 1894 , to date of payment , at the rate of interest realized to the subscriber on his investment , will be added . " All proposals should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D. C. , and should be distinctly marked ' Proposals for subscriptions to 5 per cent bonds . ' " Copies of the circular will be mailed tomorrow to all Sub-Treasuries . The action of Secretary Carlisle in announcing a bond issue was not generally known even to Treasury employee when the department closed to-da.y . A moeg oftivie le who were cognizant of the e.otion , the opinion was expressed that Mr. Carlisle had acted none too soon . Treasury gold is rapidly on the decline The loss to-day was $862 ; 000 , and sinee the first of the month the gold balance has declined from $80,891,000 to $70 ; 634,915 , with the present indication that it will fall below $70,000,000 to-morrow . As the bonds are to be sold for gold only , the Treasury gold will be built up to the extent of the bond issue . This , however . it is anticipated , may only give temporary relief . Gold may be paid into the Treasury eor bonds one day and the very next day the same gold may be withdrawn by presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the bond issue , however , will be to give the Treasury more money ? whether gold or currency is immaterial ? and ease up Government finances , at least for the present .
