txt The resolution passed by . the House yesterday authorizing the President to investigate the obstacles to the sale abroad of American tobacco and to open negotiations to secure their removal is a sensible mea sure and should promptly . be approved by the Senate . The real obstacles will be found to be the Government monopolies in the manufacture and sale of tobacco in European countries . Where these exist American tobacco is discriminated against for two reasons . One is that it is better and more expensive and the profit on it tothe Government factories is smaller . The second reason  --  and it is much more important  --  is that the various Governments will not buy in a country that heavily taxes all their exports . Even if the French Government , for instance , should see that it could , by buying American tobacco , add a large and profitable trade to that which it now possesses , it would not - dare to face the criticism of the Legislature . It would be accused of lacking self-respect and patriotism in buying in a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . Very much the same difficulties are created by our tariff as to all the exports of our surplus products . With decent treatment of imports and cordial trade relations with Europe , we should see the discriminating taxes on our grains and the vexatious regulations as to our meats and other products gradually disappear . All parties would . be benefited except the few who now grow rich from tariff favors.
