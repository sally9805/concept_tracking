txt Col. ROOSEVELT and his supporters avoid State issues as though they were vipers . The concerns of the State of New York were referred to less than half a dozen times in the addresses of the principal speakers at the Carnegie Hall meeting . Ex-Minister WOODFORD made a mere passing allusion to the canal frauds . President Low said if anybody was at fault in canal management Col. RooseVELT could be trusted to punish him . The candidate himself said not one word about the great business affairs which he asks the people to put into his hands , except where , as a part of . his war talk , he declared it to be the duty of the State to foster the National Guard and the Naval Militia . Lieut . Gov . WOODRUFF alone ventured to discuss State issues soberly , seriously , and with an effort to convince the minds of his audience . It was the only speech from which any citizen of New York who was present at the meeting could have got the slightest information as to what the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future in administering the affairs of the Commonwealth . It was the only speech which was not an affront to the intelligence of the electorate . No Gubernatorial campaign in the history of the State save this one was ever opened by such a meeting . The keynote was sounded there , and it rang out so true to pitch in every speech save that of WOODRUFF , who was probably not put down as a serious speaker , that we must conclude that the managers of the Republican campaign have agreed to steer clear of the real issues we are fighting about and keep up a great cry about National affairs , with which the Governor of the State of New York has nothing to do . Let us do Col. ROOSEVELT full justice . He did say this : " When I deal with any public servant I shall not be very patient with him if he lacks capacity , and short indeed will be his shrift if he lacks integrity . " That has the right ring . Nobody expected anything else of THEODORE ROOSEVELT until in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record made by the Republican administration in this State was a guarantee that the Republican Party can be trusted upon all questions affecting the rights , interests , and liberty of the citizens of New York . That is a sweeping and complete indorsement . It binds ROOSEVELT , if he is elected , to leave PAYN and ALDRIDGE in undisturbed possession of their offices . If BLACK 'S administration is so ideally perfect of course his successor will find neither sharks nor rascals in the public service . Seek where we may in the speeches of ROOSEVELT , of Low , and of CHOATE for some light on State questions , we find only National issues thrust to the fore with a calculated emphasis and unanimity . Col. ROOSEVELT assures us that we must have a larger navy .. Will it be built at Albany , with State money ? We turn to the report of his speech for his views on the starchless civil service law of Gov . BLACK and we are told that " where our flag has once floated there must and shall be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not vote for those who favor any form of fiat money , and that we shall have to increase the army . From Mr. Low we do get a discussion of State issues . Here it is : " But I promised to speak upon State issues . I think that Mr. CROKER 'S intimacy with the Prince of WALES laughter must be making him very exclusive . Laughter . I thottght that WARD MCALLISTER had figured it down pretty fine when he said there were only 400 in old New York that were the thing . But Mr. CROKER seems to believe that in the whole Democracy of the State of New Ycrk there is only a single family that is just the thing , laughter and applause ; either this , or he has taken The World ' Court Circular ' too seriously , and feels called upon to establish a royal family of VAN WYCKS . Laughter and applause . I wonder if he has a third VAN WYCK up his sleeve . Laughter . " But they say Col. ROOSEVELT is not eligible . Laughter . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he is a good deal more eligible , in my judgment , than Mr. CROKER is to be boss of Tammany Hall . He spends more of his time in this country . Laughter and applause . It is true that both of them spent their Summer of 1898 upon an island , laughter , but Mr. ROOSEVELT rode his own horses . Great applause and cheers . ' That le , , he rode until he saw his men in danger ; then he got off his horse and led them on foot . Applause. * * ? " But then the Democrats  --  say if he is eligible , then he is a tax dodger . Well , I do n't think it follows . Certainly he was not a bullet dodger , applause , and I should be slow to believe it of any man who bared his ' breast to the enemy that lie was prepared to dodge taxes which were honestly flue. ? ? * " Well , the Democrats say that the canals have been mismanaged . How do they know ? Laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap-plause has told them all that any of us Know . ' This , men and brethren , is the President of Columbia College . A string of quips , andathen a reference to the Saratoga platform pledge to correct canal wrong 's ' if any mere found , a prediction that the National Guard will be better cared for by a Colonel of Volunteers than by a . Supreme Court Judge , and an ambiguous reference to the Metropolitan elections law as a matter about which Republicans are divided . Last year Mr. Low 's supporters discussed city issues with some vigor and stuck to them even when assured by Mr. PLATT that Bryanism was the great issue . PLATT still insists that National issues are paramount , and President Low this year agrees with him . We take leave to doubt Whether the Carnegie Hall meeting and the speeches there uttered made any votes for Col. ROOSEVELT . We presume there are a great many thousand , intelligent and independent voters in the State whose minds are at present open to conviction as between ROOSEVELT and VAN WYCK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republican candidate by talking about the bravery of our troops at San Juan , about maintaining the flag wherever it has been planted , about flat money , and the increase of the army and navy , and by exhibiting a file of Rough Riders at every grand rally of the party would surprise us very much . There are State issues of grave interest and importance about which the people are thinking and talking . The Republicans dare not discuss these issues . They can not discuss them without condemning their own party and the administration of their own Governor . So they put ALDRIDGE on the Campaign Committee , get ROOSEVELT to say that the record of BLACK 'S administration is a guarantee that the Republicans can be trusted by every citizen , and then begin loudly and all together to talk about the war , the McKinley Administration , and the currency . We have no idea what speakers the Democrats intend to put into the field . But they must be a poor lot if they ca n't win ten independent votes to every onO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties and policy of the Governor of the State of New York .
