COLONIES . BY JAMES BRYCE , Author of " The American Commonwealth , " etc . YEAR ago few things seemed less probable than that the United States would become the mistress of colonies . Now , however ( November , 1898 ) , three pieces of foreign territory , lying far distant each from the others , have come under the control of the republic , and two , at least , of them will have to be administered as colonies , since few will venture to propose that they should be incorporated with the Federal Union . The problems which their administration will present are for the United States virtually new problems , on which neither the cases of the various Western Territories which have , with four exceptions , become States , nor the case of Alaska with its handful of savage Indians , throw much light . My friend the editor of THE CENTURY MAGAZINE conceives that in these circumstances the colonial experience of Britain and of other European countries may be serviceable to American readers , and that some observations upon that experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a few such observations . Let it not be supposed that what follows is intended to convey an opinion favorable to the acquisition by the United States of the territories recently conquered from Spain . Were I a citizen of the United States , I should be among those who are opposing their annexation . But as it seems now probable that they will be annexed , this article is meant merely to embody suggestions which may be of interest if annexation takes place . Most of the European states have tried their hands at colonization ; but only four have done so during any lengthened period , and of those four two have made portentous failures . Spain and Portugal were first in the field , and each of them acquired vast and wealthy domains . They divided South America between them , and in addition Portugal had large parts of eastern and of western tropical Africa , as well as flourishing establishments in India and Ceylon , while Spain had Mexico and the Philippine Islands . Spain has now lost all these territories , some by war to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the revolt of her own colonists . Portugal , too , has lost all her foreign possessions except the island of Madeira and parts of tropical Africa , with a few decaying stations in western India . Neither Spain nor Portugal gained by these transoceanic dominions , after the first few years during which the process of exploration and conquest stimulated the spirit of the nation . It would rather seem that both Spain and Portugal suffered at home from their possessions abroad , which drained their strength and may have tended to demoralize their public life . On the other hand , Holland and England have succeeded . Of France and Germany it is still too soon to speak ; their experience is too short . Thus there is no general presumption in favor of the view , now so common in Europe , that colonies are in themselves a blessing . Like many other things , they are good or bad as they are used . Everything depends on the nature of the colony itself and on the way in which it is managed . TEMPERATE , SUBTROPICAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three different kinds- of colonies . The distinction will be grounded on climate , but it will be found to correspond to an important distinction in race , and to another , not less important , in government . These three kinds of colonies are the temperate , the subtropical , and the tropical . A temperate colony is one in which the race of the mother-land can live and thrive and bring up healthy children , not needing to recruit from home the vigor of the transplanted stock , and one in which that race can do the same sort of open-air labor that it did at home . In a subtropical colony , on the other hand , the colonizing race , though it can live and maintain itself from generation to generation in health , can not do hard and continuous work . In a typical tropical colony the incoming European race is 718 // forbidden by the heat not only to support open-air labor , but also to retain its original robustness of mind and body . If it propagates itself in the new home , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tropics is to be deemed to belong to the type or class thus designated . The Hawaiian Islands , for instance , though they lie south of the tropic of Cancer , are so far favored by their oceanic position as to be a healthful dwelling-place for Americans and Englishmen ; and the same remark applies to parts of the high inland plateau of South Africa , situated north of the tropic of Capricorn . Both these places are to be classed as subtropical , hecause , though they are too hot for a North European race to labor in , they are not too hot , so far as our present experience goes , for it to thrive in physically . These climatic conditions determine the nature of the population each kind of colony will maintain . The temperate colonies are the natural home of the European races , and have been now completely occupied , though not completely filled , by those races . The Russians have taken northern Asia . They already outnumber the aboriginal races in Siberia , and will soon begin to settle on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races , with a good many Irishmen and Germans , have occupied North America . The Spaniards , with an admixture of Italians and Germans , have in the Southern Hemisphere obtained the cooler parts of South America , while the English have taken Australasia . In all these countries the great mass of the population either now is or soon will be European , and accordingly has or will develop a European type of civilization , with institutions similar to , or at any rate on the same grade of civilization as , those which exist in the mother-land . The colonies we have called subtropical will , on the other hand , have a population mainly , or at any rate largely , composed of non-European races . Since the class which does the manual labor of a country is usually the most numerous and is also the poorest , and since in these hot regions the European immigrants will leave that manual labor , or at least the outdoor part of it , to a race better able to stand heat and malaria , the industrial substratum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to a lower type of civilization . Thus the inhabitants of the country will be divided , probably sharply divided , into at least two masses , the highly civilized but comparatively small upper class and the larger body of working people . In most of such regions this population is native to the soil , though sometimes it has been brought from heyond the sea , as the African negroes were brought to Cuba , the Indian coolies to Natal , the Chinese and Japanese to Hawaii ; and in nearly all subtropical regions it is of a different color and a different religion from the color and religion of the European immigrants . Instances are to hand in Cape Colony , where the Kaffirs outnumber the Anglo-Dutch whites , in the northern parts of Australia , and in Peru and Bolivia ( which I reckon as subtropical in respect of the cool climate of their elevated plateau ) , where the native Indians remain distinct from the Spanish invaders . When we come to the typical tropical colonies , such as central Africa , Madagascar , northern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present purpose may be reckoned as a colony ) , Java , Borneo , and the Philippine Islands , we find the same phenomena of race distinction in a more marked form . Here the European immigrants are comparatively few , while the native or colored population is enormous , and its type of civilization , except in parts of India , is low . Here , therefore , the separation of the small body of civilized men from the large body of savage or semi-civilized men-in all the above cases of a different color-is sharp , and not likely to be effaced . Here the immigrant white population , at least if it be of North European stock , i. e. , British , Dutch , German , French , ( Anglo- ) North American , has no sense of being domesticated , but looks upon Its motherland as its true home , and the natives about it as strangers . INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE ON GOVEENMENT . Now let us see what light these characteristics of the three types of colonies throw on the kind of government which is fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men accustomed to a civilized administration at home , and to governments more or less constitutional , or at any rate regular , are capable of receiving and working institutions similar to those under which they lived at home . Naturally they carry these institutions with them to the new country . The Spaniards , when they conquered Mexico ( the northern part of the plateau of which has a temperate climate , and might , but for the existence of an aboriginal population , have become a purely Spanish country ) , set up there the whole apparatus of their monarchical government , as well as their monastic // orders and their Inquisition . The English , when they settled in Virginia and Massachusetts , reproduced the local organization of English counties and townships , and followed the rules of English law . More recently , in Canada , in Australia , and in New Zealand , they have adhered to the same plan , going , indeed , even further , for it has now become a settled maxim of British policy that every colony where the English race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive local self-government , and ought to have an elective legislature and a ministry responsible thereto as soon as the citizens have become numerous enough to work such a system . Britain has now two such self-governing colonies in North America ( one of them a federation with eight component provinces ) and seven in Australasia . All these communities have the complete control of their own domestic affairs , for the veto of the crown on legislation is very rarely used , so that the mothercountry is entirely relieved of responsibility for their internal administration , and is concerned only with their defense and their relations , as parts of the British empire , with foreign powers . Except for the purposes of defense , Britain spends no money on them , and she draws no revenue from them . Nor has she even any preference in their markets , unless they choose to give it to her , for each colony frames its own tariff , and may impose what duties it pleases on the exports of the mother-country or of other colonies . This system , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to one after another of her great temperate colonies , as each in turn became populous enough to receive a legislature and a cabinet , has two eminent merits . One is that the Parliament and executive at home are relieved of the enormous difficulties which would be involved in any attempt to govern , from a vast distance , large bodies of intelligent and high-spirited citizens of their own race . The other is that these self-governing colonies , valuing their freedom , feeling that their fortunes are in their own hands , and appreciating the advantages of imperial protection , continue attached to the mothercountry , and have , up to the present moment , belied the predictions of those who thought that local autonomy would be only a transient prelude to political separation . No other European country , except Russia , possesses any temperate colonies . Russia has in Siberia and the Amur regions an immense area , much of which is too cold and barren , some part of which too rugged , to be fit for settlement by civilized man , but much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support a large industrial population . She is now sending to it swarms of peasants from Europe , who are occupying the better lands , and will before long form a huge community . Being despotically governed , she has not , like Britain , given to the Siberians any representative institutions , but rules them by governors sent from home . She has not as yet experienced any special difficulties in ruling them , because the people are submissive , the population is not dense enough to combine even if disaffected , there are no enemies on the frontiers , and the country is continuous with European Russia , from which it is divided only by the low chain of the Ural Mountains . Siberia is , in fact , an eastward prolongation of older Russia , just as the Pacific States are a westward prolongation of the older United States . Like the American West , the Russian East was the patrimony of barbarous tribes ; but , as in the American West , these tribes were so small in number and backward in culture that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older land whence the settlers came . In Siberia the native tribes are being Russifled and absorbed . In the Pacific States they are disappearing . In both cases the population is virtually identical on both sides of the mountains , so that the problems Siberia presents are not , any more than those of the Pacific coast , colonial problems in the ordinary sense of the word . So much , then , for temperate colonies . We have seen that both England and Russia find them easy to manage . We know that both to England and to Russia they are valuable as an outlet for the overflow of a constantly growing population , as an increasing market for home goods ( though , in the English case , a market equally open to foreign competitors ) , and as a possible reserve of military strength . Against these advantages must be set the liability to defend vast territories . But this liability is slight in the case of Siberia , which has deserts and a feeble neighbor on her only land frontier , and it is reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all of them , except Canada , are insular or ( like Cape Colony ) quasi-insular , and therefore do not need a large land force for their protection . In the subtropical and tropical colonies the problems of government will obviously be different , because in them we find , not one // race homogeneous with that of the motherland , but two or more races , a European or white and a native ( probably colored ) race , the latter forming the majority ( in tropical colonies the vast majority ) of the population , and being already in occupation of the agricultural and pastoral land . The relations of the upper to the lower race necessarily raise many difficult questions . I will name some of those which have arisen in India , in the West Indies , in South Africa , and in Algeria . How are the social relations of the whites with the native or colored race to be adjusted ? Is intermarriage to be permitted or forbidden ? Is social intercourse to be encouraged or repressed ? Are both races to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May both alike move freely about where they will ? THE SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS RELATIONS OF SUBJECT RACES . How are the religions of the natives to be treated ? Are they to receive the same recognition that Christianity does ? Where they sanction immoral or offensive customs , are those customs to be tolerated ? In India the British power has stopped the suttee , or selfimmolation of widows , has fought against infanticide , and is gradually trying to check the practice of infant marriage . Polygamy , however , has not been interfered with . In South Africa some of the more disgusting religious rites of the Kaffirs have been forbidden . All these interferences , however , excite native antagonism , and may be dangerous . In Mussulman countries the religious devotees are sometimes preachers of sedition , and need to be strictly looked after . So in some countries do the wizards . How far may the principle of religious liberty be invoked on behalf of sects or castes which , though primarily religious , are to the eye of civilized man actually or possibly noxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any one native faith , where there are several , to be allowed the same full freedom of action which might properly be allowed in England or France ? PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION . THE disposal and management of land in a country already peopled often gives rise to trouble . European settlers want land and want to eject natives from it , the natives usually cultivating or pasturing more than the absolute needs of the tribe demand . Or if the land is , as in most parts of India , already occupied by a dense population , the difficulty arises of ascertaining and applying the land customs of the country , and of knowing how far the government ought to enforce its rights to rent or land-tax . Oriental empires have usually been " run on the single-tax principle , and have not found it so simple or easy to work as it looks in theory . Closely connected with land questions are revenue questions . The rude methods of semi-civilized countries do not suit a European government , which finds itself perplexed between its civilized notions and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . Direct taxation is often impracticable . Indirect taxation is apt to bear severely on the poor . Sometimes it is ignorantly pressed to a point at which it provokes rebellion . Barbarous countries need capital for their development ; but as they are also poor countries , government is hard pressed to find the capital . The impulse of a civilized government is to construct irrigation works arid reclaim waste lands and build railways ; but when it does , it usually finds itself before long in financial embarrassments , and the mother-country may have to come to the rescue . So , again , the wish of a civilized government is to educate its subjects . But how are barbarous races , or even semi-civilized heathens or Mussulmans , like those of Algeria or the Malays of Borneo , to be educated ? How is the cost of elementary education in India or South Africa to be defrayed ? The law under which a people live is the natural expression and product of their intellectual , moral , and social gifts and habits , whence it follows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different stages of progress . Thus where such races dwell together , the government has to choose between the objections to applying to the uncivilized the law that fits the civilized , and the objections to maintaining two diverse systems of law , with perhaps two sets of courts to administer them . Take the fundamental question of the preservation of social and political order . The law of England permits wide liberty to the citizen in the way of public meetings , of free speech , of a free press , of the carrying of arms . It encourages men to enroll themselves in volunteer corps for the defense of the country . All these liberties have been carried to and are enjoyed in the temperate self-governing colonies . But it does not follow that these liberties are equally fit to be granted to the negroes of Jamaica or the natives of India . In India , for instance , there is a species of press censorship . The law of sedition is // stricter than in England . Natives are not permitted to arm and drill as volunteers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been imposed on the colored people , and in the two Dutch republics of South Africa there exist similar but more severe restrictions . The educated part of the native population in India and in South Africa resents these disabilities , and they are repugnant to the sentiment of British Liberals ; but those who are primarily responsible for the administration of India and South Africa insist that public order demands them . Similar difficulties arise in the military sphere . The natural defense of a country is in a militia or regular army formed of its inhabitants . But in tropical colonies there are seldom enough white men to form such a militia or army , and it might be dangerous to form it from natives . In India the British government , though it has a pretty large native army , keeps the higher posts in the hands of European officers , and , warned by the experience of the mutiny of 1857 , maintains a large European army , which is a safeguard against any revolt by the native forces . Accordingly , Britain and France are obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with European troops , who suffer severely from the climate . The recruits whom Britain enlists know that they may have to serve in India or Hong-Kong or the West Indies . But the French conscript , who is forced into the ranks , hates being sent to a tropical climate , and the outburst of fury over the Tongking disaster some years ago among the French was largely due to the fact that it was a part of the national citizen army that had perished there . These are all problems of administration which arise irrespective of the form of government which the colony has received . But greater than all , and affecting them all , is the problem of the government itself . Is it to be popular or despotic ? If popular , it must be representative ; and if representative , who is to be eligible for a seat in the legislature , and who are to enjoy the electoral suffrage , and how far is the executive , constituted by popular election or dependent on the confidence of the local legislature , to be responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive or legislature of the mother-country ? This point is of so much consequence as to deserve a fuller discussion . To see what kind of government a nontemperate colony is fit to receive , let us re vert to the distinction already drawn between tropical and subtropical territories . In the latter there is , or at least there may be , a civilized European population sufficiently large to form a respectable percentage in the total population . Its ratio to that total may even rise to that borne , in a country like England or France , by the upper class , the middle class , and the skilled portion of the working class , all taken together , to the whole nation , i. e. , a proportion ranging from twenty-five or thirty to thirty-five per cent . It may , however , be much smaller . Take the best instances of subtropical colonies , British South Africa and Algeria . In Cape Colony the European ( Anglo-Dutch ) element is about 380,000 , against 1,200,000 colored people . In Natal it is only ten per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther north it is even smaller . In Algeria the " European population1 ( French , Spanish , Italian , German , with Maltese and Jews ) is roughly about fourteen per cent . of the whole , and reaches half a million . But in tropical colonies the proportion of Europeans is very much smaller . In India or the West Indies or Ceylon or Fiji , or in Tongking or Madagascar , or in the Congo State or German East Africa , the pure Europeans are only a few drops in a native ocean , hardly a larger proportion of the whole than college professors are in the United States , or fellows of the various learned societies are in England . Accordingly , the conditions for self-government are utterly different in these two sets of colonies . In some at least of the subtropical there is a body of civilized men large enough to work representative institutions . If in such colonies all the natives had votes , and used them , and combined in using them , the Europeans would no doubt be swamped . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natal scarcely any , so the Europeans enjoy all the power . In Algeria , though native Mussulmans are allowed some small share in government and administration , it is French voters and French officials who really rule . It is , therefore , possible to have a species of representative self-government in these subtropical territories . True , it is not a government by the whole people , i. e. , by the inhabitants generally . It is government by the European minority only , yet so far as this European part goes , and when viewed from the side of the mother-country , it is self-govern1 The French ( not counting the army ) constitute about half the total number reckoned as European or nonMussulman , the rest being mostly Spaniards or Italians . // ment . Cape Colony and Natal have as much autonomy as Canada or South Australia , though the latter two are pure democracies , while the former two are qualified democracies , where power resides in the upper ( i. e. , the white ) classes . Similarly , that which *s true democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a very different thing in Algeria , where the European minority rules . ' How , then , are the true tropical colonies , such as Ceylon or Tongking , to be governed ? If representative self-government is to be granted to them , it must be in one of two ways . One is to bestow a suffrage wide enough to embrace the natives , or the upper class among them . The other is to restrict the suffrage to the Europeans . The objection to the former course is that the natives are not fit for the suffrage , since even the upper class among them is totall* devoid of political knowledge and political experience . The objection to the latter alternative is that the Europeans are too few , not only in proportion to the whole population , but too few absolutely . In Ceylon , for instance , there are , besides officials , only some tea-planters or cinchona-growers , with several missionaries scattered through the country and a handful of merchants at the seaportsin all about six thousand Englishmen . It would be absurd to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituency . The same thing is true of all the tropical colonies of Britain . In some , however , a qualified form of representation has been tried . Jamaica had at one time an elective legislative assembly with some real power . It expressed the sentiment of the planter class , was found to increase the difficulty of securing peace and good feeling between whites and blacks , and was abolished some thirty-three years ago with general approval.2 In India the experiment has been tried of creating elective municipalities in some of the larger cities , and so training the natives to local self-government ; for it is the honest wish of the British authorities to intrust to the people as much power as they can use well . But this experiment has not , so far , save perhaps in Bombay ( a city exceptional in the character of its population ) , justified the hopes of its first advocates . 1 Algeria is , of course , not a colony in the same sense as the Cape or Natal ; it is for many purposes rather a transmarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russia . 2 Barbados has representative hut not responsible government , the crown possessing a veto on legislation . The English have accordingly abandoned the notion of applying self-government to their tropical dominions . They have been driven to invent other systems , and of these there is a great variety . One plan is to permit an incorporated company to acquire and rule territory , subject , of course , to the ultimate control of the crown and Parliament . Thus the British South Africa Company and the Royal Niger Company administer extensive regions in Africa , as does the North Borneo Company in the greatest isle of the East . Another is to proclaim a protectorate over territories for the administration of which the country does not desire to become directly responsible . Protectorates are under the control , not of the Colonial , but of the Foreign Office or the India Office ; and large tracts of Africa have been left in this legal position , the native chiefs retaining , as vassals of the British crown , power over their tribes . Over and above these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-nine other governments , all controlled from Britain , besides India , far larger and more populous than the twenty-nine taken together . In all of these there is a government from home the power of which is in the last resort absolute . But in many there are also local legislative councils . In some these councils are nominated by the crown , a scheme which indirectly checks the governor by requiring him to listen to advice before he acts , though his advisers have no weight of representative authority behind them . In others the council is partly nominated , partly elective . It has then somewhat more independence ; but in all or nearly all of these colonies the nominated or ex-officio members form a majority , so that the governor can usually prevail ; and in most colonies the crown has reserved the right to legislate , by means of what is called an order in Council , over the head of the local legislative council . Finally , there are a few colonies in which there is no local council at all . Thus it appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to India  --  the home methods of self-government have been rejected as unsuitable , and supreme authority has been concentrated in the hands of a minister in London and his lieutenant , the local colonial governor . This is a principle or rule of policy on which there is no difference of opinion in Great Britain . Some politicians are disposed to go further than others in the direction of extending representative institutions , of a very limited and strictly guarded kind , to local // communities in India ; but all politicians are agreed that British forms of self-government could not safely be introduced either among the negroes in the West Indies and South Africa , or among the Malays of the Eastern Archipelago , or among the more civilized races of India . No English statesman would try any such experiment as was tried in America when after the War of Secession full rights of suffrage were conferred on the lately emancipated colored people of the South . What , then , it may well be asked , is done to prevent those abuses of power by governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which may naturally be expected from the autocracy permitted to the former and the ignorance often inevitable in the latter ? The British safeguard against these faults has been found in the creation of a special colonial service and an experienced colonial office . When we had those North American colonies which we lost in A. D. 1776 , we did not need a regular service for their administration , because they were self-governing , and comparatively few officials were sent from home to posts in them . So to-day we send out to our nine temperate and our two subtropical self-governing colonies only their governors , and virtually no other imperial officers . But the growth in number , population , and wealth of our tropical crown colonies within the last hundred years has created a vast number of posts , the higher among which are sufficiently dignified and well paid to make colonial service a professional career , and to induce men of ability to enter it . It is not a close service ; that is to say , a man may now and then be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the lower grades , and the legal posts in particular are usually bestowed upon men taken from the bar at home . But it is in so far a regular service that the large majority of the places are filled by men who have made this kind of work their career in life , and have been trained by lower functions for higher ones . Thus the colonies gain in two ways . Their governors are men of long political experience , brought up in the traditions of policy which the profession has formed and which it imparts to those who enter it . They are also men who ( except the few occupying the very best places ) look forward to further promotion , and have , therefore , the strongest motives for good behavior . Accordingly , it is extremely rare for a governor to be accused of corruption or misuse of power for any sordid personal end . Mistakes are of course sometimes made , but the service as a whole maintains a high level of good sense and efficiency , as well as of honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like most departments of our public service , although now and then a man is brought in from outside to fill a post for which special legal knowledge is needed . It is the repository of the experience and the traditions of several generations , and has accumulated a stock of precedents , and a mass of special knowledge regarding the history and conditions of each colony , of the greatest utility for practical purposes . It knows the character , aptitude , and record of every important official serving abroad , and is able , or ought to be able , to advise him , to check him , to estimate aright the reports which he sends home , and the weight due to his advice . The Colonial Office in london , like the colonial officials abroad , is entirely outside party politics . The Secretary of State for the Colonies , who is at the head of it , is of course a party politician , but the rest of the staff , whatever their personal sympathies or predilections , are not permitted to mix in party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some differences of detail , have been applied to the government of India . Though under a separate office , it is virtually a crown colony , the greatest of that class , and the one which gives Britain more anxiety and involves her in heavier responsibilities than all the other colonies put together . The India Office at home is a vast establishment , with a secretary of state and a council , composed chiefly of eminent ex-officials who have served in India . The Indian civil service has at its head a viceroy , three governors of presidencies , two lieutenant-governors of provinces , and several chief commissioners , below whom there is a very large staff of civilians , chosen in Britain by competitive examination . Many of the ablest young men from our universities enter the competition , and the level of ability secured is extremely high , as indeed it needs to be , considering the rangeandthe gravityof the duties which an Indian civilian may be called to discharge before he is thirty years of age . This is the system by which the English have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as has been already explained , they are obliged to apply to their tropical colonies.1 Without such a It is also applied to some subtropical territories , such as Cyprus and Malta , and to one or two temperate , such as the Falkland Islands , where the population is deemed too small for representative institutions . // system-without a regular Indian and colonial service , without a highly organized India office and colonial office in London-great abuses and frequent blunders would be inevitable . In the early days of the East India Company 's administration in Bengal , shocking scandals did in fact occur . But for many years past the machinery just described , and the vigilant criticism of the House of Commons , to some member of which every one who thinks himself aggrieved by any governmental act done abroad may bring his complaints , have not only averted abuses , but produced a steady improvement in the administration of the outlying British empire . The mention of the House of Commons suggests a difficulty which may probably have struck the reader 's mind . Will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which few persons have personal knowledge of India or of the colonies , paralyze , or pervert and misdirect , the action of the India Office or the Colonial Office , as the case may be ? Will not Indian or colonial officials , who see in it the ultimate depository of political power , try to please it rather than their official superiors , and intrigue with its influential members to obtain promotion or to secure some other personal end ? Such things are quite conceivable , and would be very mischievous . But they scarcely ever happen , because the House of Commons has formed traditions and habits which forbid them . A minister for India and a minister for the colonies is a member of the cabinet , and is sure , unless he has committed some serious error , in which case he had better resign at once , to be supported by the whole cabinet and by the majority which it commands in the House of Commons . The house is , moreover , exceedingly chary of interfering in Indian or colonial administrative questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Instances , however , do sometimes occur in which it interferes . The cabinet may then , if it likes , modify its policy to suit the views of the house . It may , however , refuse to do so , and where it knows the house to be wrong , it ought to refuse . Two instances occurred in 1893-95 , in which resolutions passed by the Commons on Indian questions were disregarded by the cabinet , the Secretary of State for India telling the house that , as it was mistaken , its opinion would not be followed . In both cases the house acquiesced . But the knowledge that any error in policy or any wrong to any person committed anywhere in the British dominions can be brought up and discussed in Parliament is an invaluable check upon the wide discretionary power which Indian and colonial officials enjoy . The impeachment of Warren Hastings , and the debates on the conduct of the Jamaica planters during the antislavery agitation between 1820 and 1834 , are among the most remarkable instances of the use to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best justification for the despotic system described is to be found in the administration of British India . That administration is no doubt in some respects imperfect . It is accused of extravagance in its public works , while giving scant encouragement to private enterprises for developing the c*ountry . It is rigid in its pressure on its subjects , and though it seeks to protect and educate the people , it is more feared than loved . But it is incomparably better than the administration of any subject territory by an alien and distant race of conquerors has ever been before . It has in particular attained three great objects . It has established perfect internal peace and security through a vast area , much of which is still inhabited by wild tribes ; it has secured a perfectly just administration of the law , civil as well as criminal , between all races and castes ; and it has imbued its officials with the feeling that their first duty is to do their best for the welfare of the natives , and to defend them against the rapacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently organized civil service , inspired by high traditions , kept apart from British party politics , and standing quite outside the prejudices , jealousies , and superstitions which sway the native mind . Only through despotic methods could that have been done for India which the English have done . PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THE UNITED STATES . Now let me try to apply what has been said of the tropical dominions of Britain to the problems that confront the United States . Those problems are different in the Antilles , in Hawaii , and in the Philippine Islands , because the populations of these three groups are very unlike . Let us take the Philippines first . They belong to the class of tropical colonies , and they present in a conspicuous form all the phenomena which have been mentioned as rendering administration difficult and forbidding the establishment of the institutions fit for a temperate colony . The questions already enumerated are certain to arise and call for settlement . // There will be race questions , for the American conquerors find there four racesSpaniards , Chinese , Malays , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprising speculators will immediately seek to acquire and work estates and mines . There will be religious questions , for the Malays are mostly Mussulmans , and the Roman Catholic prelates and religious orders have enjoyed , and frequently abused , vast power . There will be questions of language and education , with questions of revenue , for the Spanish modes of taxation have been ineffective and their officials corrupt . There will be questions of order , for the Spaniards have not secured it even in the districts near the capital , while some of the islands are held by Mohammedan potentates said to be virtually independent . As respects government , the few Spaniards are scarcely fit to receive American institutions , while the Chinese and the vast mass of Malays are obviously unfit for any representative system *hatever . Probably no task has been presented to the English in India or in any of their colonies during the last fifty years so difficult as that to which Americans will have to address themselves when they become responsible for these islands , with their area of one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of nearly eight millions . No enterprise of like magnitude or complexity has ever lain before the United States before , for when she purchased Louisiana , and again when she conquered vast territories from Mexico , the area acquired was almost empty , and all of it was a temperate region , fit to be peopled by the overflow of her own population and to receive her own institutions . HOW ENGLAND WOULD PROBABLY PROCEED . IN order to see what methods English experiencewould suggest to Americans as likely to succeed in the Philippines , let us suppose that not America , but Britain , had vanquished Spain , and was now being called upon to govern the new conquest . How would Britain proceed ? Probably on some such lines as the following : She would begin by selecting for governor the best man she could find among persons of Indian or colonial experience . She would give him wide powers , with a large salary , and would assign to him a staff of capable officers , the chief among them drawn from the Indian or colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some political influence would doubtless be used to secure appointments , but the minister responsible for the exercise of patronage would be too much alive to the consequences , for the islands and to himself , of sending out weak men to let political influence force weak men upon him . The appointments would be permanent , except that of the governor and his chief secretary , who would probably be named for five years , the usual term in Indian appointments . A grant of money from the imperial exchequer would be made , because the local revenues , mismanaged by Spain , would not suffice to defray the expenses of setting up a new administration . There would be grumbling in the House of Commons , but the expenditure could not be avoided , and might for some time , especially if armed resistance occurred , continue to be heavy . Besides the force of British or British-Indian troops which would be sent , a local force would be raised , probably of Chinese , and would be officered by Englishmen , as we now officer the regiments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed , railways planned . A commission would investigate native land customs , and devise methods for levying land revenue and for taxation generally ; and efforts would be made to ascertain the nature of the village communities , so as to build upon them a system of local government . The police-for it is to be supposed that the Spanish government has had some sort of police-would be reformed , and placed under a British chief ; and in course of time the more settled regions would be divided up and allotted to district commissioners with , probably , some judicial as well as executive authority . For the Spaniards , Spanish law would in the first instance remain ; but as the whole Spanish population is reported to be only about ten thousand , it might in the long run be superseded by English . Native customs would be respected as far as possible . The courts would probably be remodeled , but native usages would when possible be respected , while the Roman Catholic Church , though not despoiled of her great wealth , could not be suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious freedom . In settling a financial policy much would , of course , depend on the resources which the country might be found to possess and the sources whence revenue could be drawn . The levying of import duties could scarcely be avoided , since these are the easiest mode of raising money in new countries , unaccustomed to direct taxation , and in which the // difficulty and expense of collecting direct imposts are serious . But there would be no differential duties in favor of Britain or her colonies . The products of all countries would be admitted on equal terms , the tariff being fixed as low as considerations of revenue might permit , with the object of encouraging trade and accelerating the development of the country . Lotteries , a main source of revenue under Spanish rule , would be promptly extinguished , and an effort might probably be made to restrict or stop the sale of drink to the natives . As regards government , much would depend on the capacities which the population , Spanish , mixed , and native , was found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor would receive a wide executive power , limited only by the provisions of the orders in Council which would be framed and enacted in England for his guidance and that of the officials generally . Then , after a little , a legislative council would be set up , consisting in the first instance of the chief officials and of a few nominated members , persons of weight and note who could fitly express the views of the various sections of the community . For example , one or two of the resident British , American , and German merchants would be placed on it , one or two Spaniards , possibly a Chinese merchant , probably one or two of the most intelligent and influential natives . Such a council would not be suffered to check the government , but it might furnish a useful means of bringing it into touch with the sentiments and wishes of the inhabitants generally , and in course of time it would probably be developed into a partly representative body . How Englishmen would have dealt with the problems of government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands fallen into their hands , is more difficult to conjecture and to explain , for the much larger white population in the former two , and the relatively large number of intelligent white men from free countries ( Americans , English , and Germans ) in the latter , suggest arrangements different from those which would suit the Philippines , and more complex . I must not , however , in the space that remains to me , attempt to enter on these interesting and intricate questions . It is , moreover , possible , though hardly probable , that the United States will leave Cuba to her own devices , which are likely to mean a career resembling that of Guatemala or Venezuela . Britain has had no colonial possessions to deal with precisely resembling any of those which the United States is now acquiring . North Borneo and Sarawak , which are least dissimilar to the Philippines , have a European and mixed population much smaller than that of the latter isles . North Borneo is managed by a British company , which has hitherto been more occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants have been less troublesome than the Filipinos seem likely to prove . No tropical region which we have conquered has had so large a population of European race as Cuba , nor one so difficult to govern either on the despotic principle or through representative institutions . Our experience is , therefore , not directly in point as regards either the Philippines or the Antilles . Nevertheless , the history of British rule as well in India as in the tropical colonies , the experiments Britain has tried , the errors she has had to regret , do suggest certain maxims as fit to be pondered by a free , civilized , Christian state undertaking to rule and develop barbarous regions which have hitherto been mismanaged as the Philippines have been . If we were asked to state such maxims , most of us would do so in the following way . RADICAL CHANGES NOT ADVISABLE . Go softly , go warily . Before launching out into large schemes of administration or economic reform , take care to ascertain the facts as fully and accurately as possible . ( Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , producing incorrect views . ) Let the facts be ascertained by men specially qualified-by scientific observers , by experienced travelers , by practical economists . Ordinary politicians are ill fitted for such investigations . Politicians are , indeed , not the men to send to these new countries at all : their habits of thought and action are out of place . The less the existing arrangements are at first disturbed , the better . The old officials may be bad , but they have a sort of knowledge which the best stranger can not at once acquire , and it is not well to " make a clean sweep** forthwith . The present native authorities , local chiefs or princes , may be used to keep order and collect revenue till the new government sees its way to changing them or dispensing with them . In India the English found it prudent to alter the administration of the Mogul sovereigns and of the native rajas very gradually . Some wise men think our Indian government has undertaken too much direct administration , // and that it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native rule , merely supervised by British officers . To begin by subduing the semi-independent Mohammedan sultans who reign in some of the Philippines might prove a troublesome business , as the Dutch have found their war with the Sultan of Achin , in Sumatra , a very long and costly affair . Our experience is that such potentates must in the long run be brought under control , but that they may be permitted to keep for a time their authority in a sort of loose vassalage . A firm hand needs to be kept on white adventurers . Capital must , of course , be encouraged to flow in from civilized countries , and advantages offered to those who will develop the country , will drain and improve lands , work forests , open mines . But the European adventurer is almost certain to try to defraud or to oust the native . Quarrels follow , Europeans are maltreated , their expulsion or death must be punished , order is disturbed , the natives are alienated , and government becomes unpopular . In India , and in some parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the speculative European who desires to exploit the native , and all sorts of facilities for playing tricks which at home come within the conception of " liberty** must in these new countries disappear before state necessity , lest worse mischiefs follow . Continuity of policy is essential . Changes , of course , there must be , for experience is the best teacher , and no forethought can anticipate the difficulties which will need to be overcome by new expedients . But the general lines of policy ought to be adhered to , and the promises made carried out . Specially important is it that political changes at home should not cause changes in the colony , whether they be changes of men or of measures . The only instances in which the accession of a new British ministry has affected India have been where questions of frontier policy were concerned , and these are not purely Indian questions , but parts of the general foreign policy of the empire . Home politics should not be suffered to come into colonial administration at all , nor should political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither should home notions be imported 1 It must be admitted that the English do not invariably observe this maxim . There have been some instances to show the mischief of deviating from it . into tropical colonies , always excepting those standards of honor , purity , justice , and humanity which are the best gifts a subject race can receive from its conquerors . To enforce these standards on all Europeans , official and non-official , is not only a duty , but the soundest policy , for it wins the respect and confidence of the natives . But European restrictions upon authority , European formalities in administration , the pedantic adherence to legal or official technicalities , impede progress in a new country . We hear from France and Germany that the French and still more the German colonies have suffered from these faults . The man who succeeds best is the man of initiative , the man free from preconceptions , who lets the character of the people and the conditions under which they live teach him and map out his course for him . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have belonged . No country possesses a larger supply of such men than America does , though the public service of the country has heretofore provided comparatively little field for the display of their gifts . Of the special problems which will arise under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States when the republic has undertaken the government of regions *xhich can not be turned into States , nor even into Territories ; of the question how far the Malays of the Philippines , the Chinese and the Japanese of Hawaii , will be entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizens of the United States ; of the mode in which legislation will have to be enacted for these subject regions , I have left myself no room to speak here . In these matters Britain has the advantage of possessing in her legally omnipotent Parliament a means of overcoming any and every legal difficulty which can arise in any part of the Queen 's dominions . But the ingenuity of American jurists , and that breadth of view which has always distinguished the Supreme Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot . The United States is entering on a novel course , is essaying a difficult , though a splendid , experiment . Her efforts will be watched with interest by the whole world , and by us in Britain not with interest only , but also with a fraternal sympathy , and an earnest hope that they may , while benefiting her new subjects , do nothing to distract her attention from her internal problems , and raise no cloud that can trouble her domestic peace and prosperity .
