BEHIND A CURTAIN , a Monologue , is given here , as played by Mrs. Denison ( Miss Mathilde Madison ) , of the Madison Square Theatre , at the matines of January 13th and 14th , 1887 , and during the Summer of the same year , at the Rodick House , Bar Harbor . This Monologue has also been acted by Mrs. Walter Andrews and other amateurs in private houses . The scene represents a sitting-room in a hotel in New York . A curtained bed may be used in one corner , or Mrs. Bellamy , in going to look for her burglar , may retire behind a screen , or go into an adjoining bedroom and return . It is perhaps needless to suggest that to hold an audience by a monologue requires constant action on the part of the player , and unflagging spirit . This one was rendered by Mrs. Denison with the addition of original " business , " adding greatly to its success . Main text SCENE : A room in a hotel in New York . Mrs. Bellamy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , comes in . MRS . BELLAMY ( speaking off ) .  --  There , that will do ! See that my luggage is sent up ? ( Comes forward . ) What a runaway ! When I awoke this morning I had n't the least idea of sleeping in a strange hotel in New York . The truth is , I had to come . It was the only way to save myself from that tiresome Captain Fitzhenry . Worn out with trying to keep off a proposal , I finally consented to receive him at twelve this morning . At twelve this morning I was on the train  --  " called to New York on business of importance . " Poor man ! I should have liked to see his face when my butler gave the message . ( Laughs . ) ( Sits in chair. )  --  What a long journey from my country-house to town ! I am tired to death ! I wonder if Fitzhenry believed the butler ! It 's true , I have an excuse for coming . To-morrow is Augusta 's wedding-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was married before her , three years ago , she was quite green with jealousy ; but when poor Mr. Bellamy died , six months after , leaving me all that money , Augusta was ready to tear my eyes out . Poor Augusta ! she never could stand another person 's luck ! ( Knock at door . ) Well , who 's there ? ( Goes to door , takes in letter . ) A letter ! For me ? Who possibly could know I am in town ? Captain Fitzhenry 's handwriting ! Ridiculous ! ( She tears open letter and reads . ) " Clever as you are , dear Mrs. Bellamy , you ca n't elude me . By judicious bribery of your servants , I managed to find out what train you took to town . I was , during the whole journey , in the rear car of your train . It was horribly dull there , in company with a maiden lady , who ate lozenges ; but I was comforted by thinking , if an accident occurred , I should , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My cab followed yours to the hotel . To-morrow , at eleven , I shall present myself to receive my final answer . Devotedly yours , " FITZHENRY . " What incredible impertinence ! I 'll refuse to see him . Have n't I said , over and over , that I will never marry again ! What ! sacrifice my life of enchanting independence for the sake of a man ! Here I am , free to come and go as I please  --  ( Starts . ) What was that noise ? How nervous one becomes in traveling alone ! I wish my stupid maid had not sprained her ankle yesterday . Now I come to think of it , this is the first time I was ever at a hotel by myself . It certainly is not as pleasant as it looks . Suppose a burglar  --  I 'll look under the bed . ( Goes back , returns . ) No one there . I 'd better barricade the door . ( Piles up chairs . ) If any one comes in , I 'll hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My death shall make a noise in the world , I promise you . ( Sits , takes up newspaper . ) It 's all the fault of these horrid newspapers . I never pick one up without reading some dreadful tale of robbery and murder . The villains seem to pick out solitary females ; widows especially . ( Reads . ) " Only last week a young and charming widow  --  chloroformed at  --  her hotel ! " Oh , if I had known that , I never would have come . ( Looks at curtain . ) Good gracious ! what was that ? Did n't the curtain move ? What shall I do ? Let me behave as if I noticed nothing . ( Takes up book on table , tries to read . ) What 's this  --  " Triumphant Burglary . " ( Drops book , looks again at curtain . ) I see his feet ! In great big boots , such as robbers always wear . Here I am , locked in with him . To reach the bell I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horrible ! To-morrow there 'll be a new murder to put in all the newspapers . A widow , alone , unfriended , in a strange hotel . How could he know I have my diamonds in this bag ? What will Fitzhenry say when he comes here at eleven to-morrow , and finds me weltering in my gore ? Poor Fitzhenry ! he loves me . He would have saved me from this awful fate . Oh , those feet , those feet . I dare not look at them again , and yet I must ! Stay ! If he is going to kill me for my diamonds , I 'll offer them to him . If he has a shadow of delicacy , he will accept them . ( Speaks to curtain , in a trembling voice . ) Sir , I know you are there , behind the curtain . You can not hide from me , I have seen your feet . But do not be afraid , I wo n't summon the police . No doubt you are more unfortunate than guilty . A series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earning a livelihood . Your wife , no doubt , is dying . Your children , poor little things , are gnawing crusts . I may seem to you angry and terrible , but indeed I 'm not . I am about to offer you my diamonds , every one , and all the money in my purse . Here they are ( shows jewel case ) , in this bag , most convenient for carrying in the hand . If you do n't mind , I will keep one or two necessary things . My comb and brush , and my tooth-brush . They can be of no use to you . ( Takes out articles named , tears off bracelets and rings , puts them in bag , closes it , puts it on chair , pushes chair toward curtain . ) There , take it and go out by the window as you came . I 'll shut my eyes , so as not to look at you . I could n't identify you again , no matter how hard I might try . ( Shuts eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opens eyes . ) What ! the bag still there ? You wo n't take it ? You persist in murdering me ? ( Falls on knees . ) O Mr. Burglar , spare me ! Have pity on a woman who never did you any harm ! ( Knock at door . ) Who 's there ? ah ! ( Jumps up , rushes to door , upsets chair , opens it wildly . ) ( Voice. )  --  Beg pardon , ma'am , but there 's a pair o ' boots in there , left by the gent as had the room before you . MRS . BELLAMY .  --  Boots ! Where ? ( Voice. )  --  Hunder the window-curting , ma'am . MRS . BELLAMY .  --  Boots ! Curtain ! ( She rushes to curtain , draws it aside , picks up boots , carries one in each hand to the center of the stage , and stands , flourishing them . ) Saved ! Saved ! ( Runs to door , throws out boots . ) Here , my good man , take your boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it . One thing is certain : from this time forth I shall go nowhere alone . To provide for all contingencies , to-morrow at eleven I accept that dear , big , brave Fitzhenry . Back matter Curtain .
