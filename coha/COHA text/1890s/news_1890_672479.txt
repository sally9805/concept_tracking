txt If it be true or not that the only perfect goodness and happiness ever known in the world were once the blessings of a garden in Armenia , certain it is that little trace of them is left . If the wretched inhabitants of that unhappy country may still seek refuge from the blazing sun of the Orient beneath the shade so welcome to ADAM and EVE , if their lips may still touch the fruits that nourished this sinless pair , there is nothing else to remind them of the quiet and contentment , the peace and security , that once dwelt on the banks of the Euphrates , for Satan , in the shape of " the unspeakable Turk , " now has possession of the terraced gardens , the shadowy groves , and the snow-capped peaks of that loveliest of lands ; and only by a miracle Is it that the firebrand of insurrection does not burst in flame and scorch and wither its varied charms .

The state of Moosh and the neighborhood is simply one of anarchy . The prisons of Van are crammed with Armenians who are undergoing a horrible system of flagellation and torture . The eye everywhere meets ruined villages and churches and abandoned fields . A vast country rich in resources has been turned into a desert . " Is there to be no defense against this savagery ?

" Odious , " it says , " as in many respects the Russian Government may be , and repugnant to Western ideas as are the despotic principles upon which it is founded , there can be no doubt that where it supersedes the corrupt and savage anarchy which prevails in the Ottoman Empire the change is one for the better . " That the ardent hope of the Newa is the deliberate plan of the Czar there can be no doubt . Russia is ambitious to inherit all that remains of the Sultan 's empire in Asia Minor . She lets slip no chance to foment the strife within its borders that will justify her interference . If it is her turbulent hand that keeps the Balkan peninsula in a ferment , it is to the same desperate and unscrupulous agent that the friends of Armenia trace the recent bloody outbreaks .

But is so desperate and heartless a policy needed to discredit the rule of the Turk ? Let his thousand crimes iu Europe and Asia answer the question . Does it inspire the belief that if successful Russia will be a more generous and humane master than he f Let her conduct in that part of Armenia bequeathed to her by the treaty of Berlin answer this question .

For the peace that has reigned in her Armenian provinces is the peace that reigned in Warsaw ; the rights and privileges that her Armenian subjects have enjoyed are the rights and privileges that the natives of England enjoyed under WiLmAx the Conqueror . The crimes and outrages that brigands have not committed Russia has committed herself . In the last number of the Fortnightly Review the writer of an article on " Armenia and the Armenian People " tells how brigands roam through Russian Armenia , preying upon its helpless inhabitants ; how Russian officials , under the cover of their authority , commit depredations hardly less outrageous ; how they seized the wife of a well-known land owner because she refused to pay duty on the dress she wore , and , stripping it from her back , compelled . her to " traverse the city from one end to the other  --  in returning to . her hotel  --  in her linen " ; how the same censorship described by Mr. GEOROE KENNA-NT in the Century Magazine is cramping and crushing the intellectual activity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeds that is extirpating ail dissenting organizations in Russia is operating with the same success on the Armenian Church , " which withstood the persecutions of the Sassanian Kings , the blandishments of Byzantine Emperors , the fiery onslaughts of fanatical Mussuimans , and the more dangerous intrigues of its own schismatic members " ; how " tens of thousands of Armenian peasants , whose industry , patient toil , and capital had made the district of Kars the granary of an immense area of Southern Russia " were driven from their homes after the treaty of Berlin ; how their land . was parceled out and distributed among Russians , Mat free , with remission of taxes for years ; how they were forbidden ever again to set foot in the distrust unless Um/ came to live in the cities ; how the foreign settlers , totally unacquainted with the conditions of the climate and soil , failed so completely to till the land that a famine resulted in that part of Russia dependent upon the district for its corn supply ; how the evicted tenants retired to Erivfin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superabundance of tillers of the soil ; how their arrival augmented the general misery , and how , during the famine that followed , starring women devoured their children to appease the fearful pangs of hunger . If , then , the Armenians can look neither to Russia nor to Turkey for peace and security , whither can they look for these priceless blessings ? " To themselves , " cries the Armenian Nationalist . " Let them establish a government of their own . When the hour comes far the Turkish Armenians to : throw off the yoke of the Ottoman oppressor , let them become the head of an Armenian confederation , which shall eventually include the Armenians of Russia and those of Persia . " " They have , " says the writer in the Fortnightly Review , " a vitality only equaled by that of the Jews , political aptitudes as marked . as those of the Hungarians , and a combination of European love of progress and Asiatic tact and diplomacy .
