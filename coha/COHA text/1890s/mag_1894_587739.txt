SOME EVILS OF OUR CONSULAR SERVICE . Tnrttr have been occasional rumors more or less x ague and misty , it is true , but rumors nevertheless . * of an intention to " remodel " the consular ervice of the United States . We are treated quadrennially to an abundant crop of Washington dispatches , in which van vet . txxiv. *o. 442. 16 ous cnterp ising newspaper correspondents announce with b coming gravity that the administration proposos to take a " few judicious changes " in the consular personnel , - always , of course , with an eye single to the improv ment of the service . It is given out that business // efficiency will control the selection ; but when the record is made up , it is invariably seen , curiously enough , that there has been a slight confusion of terms . It is political , and not business efficiency which has prevailed . This is in no wise the fault of the parties or of the men who happen to be charged with their direction ; it is the fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , if indeed such it can be called , is strangely suggestive of that pleasant bit of sentiment Alice was so often wont to meet with in Wonderland , - " Off with their heads . " It would be impossible , within the scope of an article of this sort , to give anything like a comprehensive statement of the duties of a consular officer . Quite apart from the powers and privileges assigned to him by international law , our tariff laws impose duties of an unusual character . The proper and intelligent discharge of this work alone requires much special information , which can be acquired only by toilsome application . Every invoice must be produced before the consular officer by the manufacturer , exporter , purchaser , or some duly an- thorized agent . The consul is supposed to control this statement , to be in possession of the facts , and to be able to furnish the customs authorities with what our system calls for , namely , the market value of the goods at the place where they are manufactured or in the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples of the merchandise to be shipped . He is expected , in short , according to the beautiful theory of the law and regulations , to be in a position to check the enormous frauds which are being constantly and successfully perpetrated upon the revenues of this country . At seaport consulates the consul is vested with a sort of police control . He is charged with the settlement of disputes between master and seamen , and with the issuance of bills of health to vessels clearing for the United States . Destitute sailors must be cared for and seiit home . Vast commercial and maritime interests , together with the public health , are within the keeping of the men who guard these posts . Questions are constantly arising , even at unimportant places , which call for decision of character and sound judgment . The effects and estates of American citizens dying abroad are entrusted to the consular representative , and must be managed by him for the benefit of the heirs . Reports upon industrial , commercial , financial , and kindred subjects are required to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These reports are issued monthly , and have a wide circulation . As all business men well know , when made by men having an accurate knowledge of a country , its language and resources , they are of great practical value . Every consular officer must have been impressed by the multitudinous inquiries , covering every conceivable subject , which deluged him during his term of office . In addition to these regular and legitimate duties , in many places , incessant and petty demands for information and assistance are made upon consuls by their traveling countrymen . To adjust all these endless difficulties calls for great tact , and oftentimes friendly personal relations with the local authorities . The performance of notarial acts is another function . Legal instruments , of whatever character , which are to be used in this country , must be attested by one of our diplomatic or consular officers . This enumeration is far from complete , but it suffices to show how infinite and varied a consul 's duties are . It shows , too , something else , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trust with success or even credit . Prior to 1856 all officers were unsalaried . The law of that year , although it has been subsequently amended and extended , is still the foundation upon which our consular service rests . By // this bill , salaries were attached to some of the principal posts , and there were various classifications made , which have since been adhered to ; although it may be remarked in passing that they have long since utterly lost whatever significance they may once have had ; they no longer furnish any index to the real importance of a post . The substitution of fixed salaries for fees ( of which , up to that time , no account had been rendered to the government ) was a needed reform . Before this , the incumbents of posts like Liverpool , Aix-la-Chapelle , and Dresden enjoyed princely revenues , in no way commensurate with the services rendered . A few of these old-time fee - paid offices survived , however , and were flourishing less than two decades ago . They are all practically abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $2500 to be turned over to the Treasury . At present there are few real plums in the consular fruit basket , and their pecuniary value is derived from the class of fees known as unofficial . Partly because of the peculiar character of our revenue laws , and partly , no doubt , owing to the necessity of providing for the faithful , the number of offices of the lower grades has increased aud multiplied of late years at an alarming rate . To many of these places salaries ridiculously inadequate have been attached . By the last annual appropriation bill , the compensation of seventyfive consulates was fixed at $1500 . There are still others where the official income is only $1000 , or where the fees are but slightly in excess of that sum . It will hardly be seriously contended that either of these amounts is sufficient , with the utmost economy , to defray the actual living expenses , especially when , as usually happens , the officer is accompanied by a family . The inevitable result is , in many cases , that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability , have been debarred from accepting this sort of preferment . By some strange process of reasoning , men whose unfitness for public service is too notorious to make it safe to name them for a domestic berth , but whose backing is too strong to be ignored , have been pitchforked into the foreign service , and there allowed to masquerade as representative Americans , to the discomfiture of their countrymen and the contempt of foreigners . Here , as in most other cases , the cheapest is not the best , and the experiment has proved a costly one in not a few instances . If the search-light of a vigorous and impartial investigation could be turned upon these low-salaried offices ( and there the greatest abuses unquestionably exist ) , the disclosures would be so damning as to make imperative some immediate and radical reform . The extent to which petty peculation prevails will never be disclosed so long as officers are responsible only to a department hundreds or thousands of miles away . It is a very easy matter to find persons unscrupulous enough to lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the return of fraudulent vouchers . Under such a system detection is next to impossible . There are a variety of methods in vogue , ingenious often , and questionable always , through which the losses of the government become the gains of some of its sworn defenders . Take the item of rent . The law provides that a sum equal to twenty per cent of a consul 's salary may be appropriated for the rent of an office devoted , in the words of the statute , " exclusively to the business of the consulate . " Further , the regulations require that the office shall be central and accessible to its patrons . Many consuls combine office and residence , which is unobjectionable in itself , and then , by a species of manipulation which falls little short of legerdemain , contrive to make the official allowance cover the rent of both . It can not be stated , of course , to // 244 Some Evils of our Consular Service . what extent the government suffers by this convenient arrangement , but it is safe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and residence , and setting forth the true amounts paid for each , would prove at least instructive . The writer knows personally of one case where , upon investigation , it was disclosed that the sum paid for consulate and commodious private residence was $350 per annum . Of this , $300 was charged to the government for " office rent . " iNor is the office always conveniently situated or accessible . In his zeal to increase his income , more than one consul has hung out the government shield in the outskirts of a city , in a quarter remote from the business section . Mr. De B. Randolph Keim , who was sent out in the early seventies , by President Grant , upon a tour of inspection , mentions one curious case , in his report to the Treasury Department , where he found that an important European seaport consulate was " perched in the loftiest corner of an exceedingly lofty building , and was only to be reached by means of a ladder , or steps , so called , extremely long , and deviating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this communication with the consulate of the United States at - was a mat. ter requiring the exercise of no small amount of skill , and the descent was certainly not without considerable hazard . " It is fair to add that in this case an inadequate allowance was somewhat responsible for the prevailing state of affairs . Another favorite practice , no less fraudulent , is the returning of false vouchers for stationery and other office necessaries . This would not seem , at first blush , to be a very fruitful source of revenue . It is probably no exaggeration to say , however , that there is scarcely a consul who has not found evidences of this kind of jobbery on the part of some predecessor . Not very long ago , an old and experienced officer of the service was waited upon , shortly after taking charge of a new post , by a local tradesman , most anxious to dispose of a lot of stationery all stamped and ready for office use . Upon inquiry , it came out that this was only one of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before . This particular order was for three hundred dollars ' worth of stationery ; and as it was not filled before the thrifty incumbent of the office was relieved of his trust , his successor refused to sanction what had been only too palpably a job . In the end the dealer was glad to accept what the paper would have been worth as old junk without the headings , and that was about twelve dollars . Instances of this kind are by no means rare . Even the postage account is not overlooked . Taking the returns as a criterion , it would seem as if correspondence at some of the most oh . scure points could be disposed of only by an expert corps of stenographers and typewriters . One accommodating official , when it was suggested by the Department that eighty dollars for stamps during the quarter was somewhat excessive for a small post , promptly wrote to inquire whether forty dollars would be satisfactory . These are merely single illustrations of a list which might be sensibly enlarged ; but however instructive , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these corrupt and disreputable practices entail is in any event very considerable in the aggregate , even allowing for the great majority of offices which are conscientiously administered . In 1891 and 1892 the deficiencies in the contingent expense account amounted for each year to over $75,000 , and had to be supplied by subsequent appropriations . Had anything like an efficient supervision existed in the consular service , neither of these items would have appeared in the deficiency bills for those years . The creation of so many consular agencies is open to very serious objec // tion . They have , broadly speaking , no valid or legitimate reason for existence , save perhaps - and this practice will not bear close scrutiny - in those cases where they help to increase the meagre salary of some consul . But the whole system , as it is at present conducted , is vicious and debauching in the extreme . The establishment of independent offices at most of the important points , in Europe at least , the excellent railway facilities which now exist everywhere , and the custoni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the consular office is situated render almost unnecessary these subordinate offices . Their total abolition , except in a few instances , would increase the efficiency of the service and improve its discipline . Upon this point there ought to be no room for two opinions . The nature of these agencies is but little understood . They are created ostetisibly for the convenience of local nierchants at points where the trade with this country is too inconsiderable to justify a principal office . The usual method is to present a petition to the Department of State , signed by many residents of the place to be benefited by the establishment of the agency . This is nominally done in most instances . In reality , the consul within whose jurisdiction the agency is to be established , and to whose fostering care it is to be committed , is mainly instrumental in having the petition drawn up . It is another case where the cat 's accommodating paw pulls the chestnuts out of the fire for some thrifty monkey . The compensation is derived entirely from fees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1000 , while the supervising consul is allowed by law not more than $1000 for all the agencies under his charge , not counting , however , certain other emoluments of an unofficial character . Very often he actually gets much more . It becomes simply a matter of private arrangement between the agent and the consul , who appoints and dismisses his subordinate at pleasure , the Department seldom interfering . But this double drain upon the receipts is not all . The agent is usually an alien , knowing little of the spirit of our institutions . To him undervaluation frauds and blanket invoices are terms without meaiiing . He can have but little reason to protect and promote Ainerican interests . Willful disobedience of the regulations has no terrors for him . It would be inaccurate to say that the office means nothing ; it may mean a great deal . Business and personal advantages may often be reaped by subservience to some powerful local magnate , whose interests are unalterably opposed to those of the remote foreign government which the agent represents . Indeed , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing business with the United States . The anomaly of such a position was forcibly summed up by the Hon. R. R. Hitt , in a recent debate upon the diplomatic and consular appropriation bill in the House of Representatives . Mr. Hitt 's long connection with the foreign service of this country entitles him to speak with authority . He said : " As a consular officer certifying invoices , he sees all the shipments and all the prices ; in fact , all the details of the business of other business men who are his rivals . He is an authorized official spy . More than this , as he certifies to his own invoices , it is hAs interest to put the valuations or prices of goods of his own firm at the lowest possible figure , in order to have to pay a low duty ; in other words , his interests are directly hostile to those of the Revenue Department of the United States . It is a bad , it is an unbusinesslike principle to place a servant in charge of business where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should have Americans to take charge of the business of their country. ** Hampered by such a system , it is small wonder that the conscientious con- // sul comes , after a time , to understand that it is bootless to try to check the operations of the thieves who flourish on both sides of the water , and who have reduced undervaluation to a science . Strict supervision , under such circumstances , becomes as ridiculous as a farce in a comic opera . It is never really difficult to find an agent who will gladly legalize an improper invoice for the sake of the fee , and say nothing . Offices of this character have no right to exist . Wherever the fees are large enough to make an agency self-sustaining , it should be detached from the principal office , and an intelligent , progressive American should be put in charge of it . In the great majority of cases , the revenue interests of the government would be better guarded and a more economical administration insured by uniting the subordinate with the principal office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be accomplished if the Department itself were to exercise a more direct control over the agent . Certainly , this would in great measure relieve these consular agencies of the stigma , now too often justly resting upon . them , of being mere sources of " revenue only . " But , unfortunately , the hope of improvement at this point is too remote to be seriouslyconsidered . The truth is , there is a practical obstacle which effectually blocks the way to all reform in this direction . That obstacle , already hinted at , is this : Each appointee is assigned to a post estimated to be worth so much a year , - say $1500 in salary and SiSOG from agencies . If the office be taken in liquidation of some " claim , " the discontinuance of the agencies would be regarded as a breach of contract . This circumstance alone must prevent the wholesale abolition of these agencies , so worse than useless to the government , but so profitable to the supervising consul . Equally prolific in abuses is the custom of nominating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed to be what is known as " merchant consuls . " These officers are put in charge of posts to which no salaries attach , and where the fees are next to nothing . The same objections apply to them , and with equal force , as to alien agents . They enjoy most of the prerogatives of a regular consul , and share few of his responsibilities . Their acts are entitled to full faith before our law . However honest their intentions , their allegiance to their native country and their sympathy for their own countrymen render their services of doubtful utility . There are over a score of officials of this stripe n6w in the service . Five are in Spain alone . No provision being made by law for the separate salary of a vice-consul , who acts principally in the absence of his chief , this post is generally filled by some local merchant , speaking English more or less indifferently , who is willing , for the added social or business prestige , to serve for a trifling consideration . As he is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in time to acquire a knowledge of the routine work , which easily makes him indispensable to the nominal head , who is pretty sure to find himself literally helpless amid the confusion of strange duties transacted in a stranger tongue . Nevertheless , this system , despite the drawbacks which will immediately suggest themselves , has worked surprisingly well . The history of very few offices , however , is entirely free from the malversation of an unfit vice-consul . Unfortunately , the opportunities of such an official for doing harm have not always been curtailed with the canceling of his commission . Thus , it was recently reserved for the principal officer at a metropohitaii centre to make the rather startling discovery that be was competing with a dismissed vice-consul , who had abstracted a seal from the office , and was doing a thriving notarial business on his own account at " cut " rates . Some years ago , it was officially // reported that a number of American vice-consulates , no allusion to which was made in the State Department register , had been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Herodotus , were discovered in Central Africa by Stanley . It was also alleged that a profitable traffic had been conducted in these offices , and that they had been sold for sums ranging from $1000 to $5000 . Any comprehensive system of reform must include some method which shall provide for the training of a number of American vice - consuls . A more careful apportionment of the clerical allowance , together with the additional amount which might be saved by a more economic expenditure of the contingent expense appropriation , would be quite sufficient to pay salaries to a number of capable young men who would be attracted to the service - even if the compensation were small - if there were any hope of retention and ultimate promotion . This suggestion has already been made , and is worthy of consideration . Such a plan , once adopted , would furnish the nucleus and means of gradually putting the service upon a stable basis . Frequent and angry outcries have been made against the consular rules , which are supposed to hamper trade . In an article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " oppressive and irrational . " However oppressive they may be to some people , they are not irrational , if the ad valorem system is to continue to be , as it has been , an important feature of our revenue legislation , and if the legalization of invoices is for the purpose of assisting customs officers . When traced to their source , most of these lamentations proceed from persons who are vitally and pecuniarily interested in promoting greater " freedom " of trade . There unquestionably exists case for complaint , but it comes from making a hard-and-fast set of rules fit , like a Procrustes bed , all classes of goods , whether ad valorem , specific , or free . There is , for example , no good reason why exportations coming plainly under the last two heads should be at : tended by the same requirements as those which ought properly and justly to accompany the legalization of ad valorem goods . To enforce strict compliance with the provision requiring goods to be invoiced before being shipped , as is the case with sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the free or specific duty list , and when the different lots that may go to make up one shipment are likely to come from widely diverging points , is at once absurd and farcical . rfo attempt to carry out the law in a case like this simply encourages successful subterfuge , which brings the whole law into contempt . If some latitude and discretion were allowed consular officers in these matters , it would be productive of less friction and more respect . Very different is it , on the other hand , with the average manufactured article . If the contention of some importers and their alien allies be conceded , it does away at one stroke with the great majority of inland consulates . To allow the exporter to consolidate in one invoice at Hamburg , we will say , goods made in Prague , BudaPesth , and Chemnitz would reduce the whole theory of consular inspection of goods to inanity . The consul at the seaport would , in practice , have no other resource than to accept unqualifiedly the statements made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goods through the New York custom house at the minimum duty . As well abolish the empty form of requiring invoices at once , and save the incident annoyance and expense . Nor does it seem as if the personal presentation of invoices by the shipper or his agent were an act calculated to imperil the comity of nations . It is no hardship to the exporter himself , because he has the alternative of appointing a responsible agent . If it is expedient to 1894. 247 ' // require an oath , it is certainly worth while to have it taken in the manner prescribed by universal law and custom . The mail or an irresponsible messenger would hardly do for this purpose . This is not affirming that there are not some grave defects in the present customs administrative act . Experience has shown , I think , that some of the requirements regarding the declarations accompanying consigned goods have proved vexatious and ineffective . Indeed , the whole consignment system is sadly in need of a legislative overhauling . The shipper , who is generally the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his declaration that he is willing to accept the prices which he gives in his invoice . If he is telling the truth , he ought to be glad to have a consul or an officer of the customs publish to everybody who handles such goods the place where they are to be had , and the price which is demanded . If he is telling a deliberate falsehood , he ought to be prevented from doing business on consignment , because his principal object is then to cheat our customs revenue . If the prices in coimsigned invoices are secret , how can any one prove that an American citizen is not willing and anxious to pay even higher ? As it is at present conducted , systematic consignment is systematic fraud on our revenue , and systematic injustice to all honest merchants importing into the United States . If the secrecy now surrounding invoices of this class were abolished , and consuls were authorized to disclose prices and samples to legitimate buyers , or collectors of customs were required to make public at stated periods these consignments , omitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system would die in three months . To revise the administrative act , nevertheless , along the line of least possible inconvenience to the exporter would be fatuous in the extreme . But no amount of captious criticism d the regulations , no matter how instruc tive , can do anything more than expose surface defects . The real trouble lies deeper , and the single word " spoils " lays it bare . It is this system , prolific of so much evil at home , which has also worked untold injury abroad . When this is remembered , all the contradictions , all the absurdities , all the vagaries , which have marked the history of the consular service become clear . That an inferior class of men should have been selected to represent us has followed as a necessary sequence . There have been , and are , many notable exceptions , and none more conspicuous than the lamented consul-general at Berlin , William Hayden Edwards ; but in the last analysis it must be conceded that , in its personnel , our service suffers by comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredit and impair it ; venality and its sinister accessories have done the rest . The new consul who inquired of the predecessor whom he was relieving " what in h-h an invoice was , anyhow , " showed at least one merit , - a commendable tendency to acquire useful definitions . Some officers have not always regarded their work or their instructions so seriously . Several years ago , a consular officer learned that invoices belonging to him were being legalized regularly at a neighboring consulate . He thereupon wrote a friendly official note to his colleague , calling attention to the irregularity . The reply came , expressing regret , but explaining that he ( the colleague ) had no means of knowing whether certain places were in his district or not . Somewhat puzzled , the consul , whose receipts hind suffered by this encroachment , suggested a reference to the large map of the district , which had been supplied a short time before by the Department for the express purpose of settling just such claims . It then came out that the colleague did have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the office wall upon his arrival . He later remembered that it // had struck him as being " pretty , " and he had consequently carefully shipped it home to a friend as a souvenir . Worst of all , these examples present no isolated cases . A catalogue of these edifying incidents might be compiled , and it may safely be set down that as long as the consular service is freely made a political Botany Bay , so long will it continue to be a storehouse of grotesque incidents . It is one of the few hopeful signs visible , in connection with the foreign service , that it has of late attracted the attention of solid and patriotic business men . The Boston Chamber of Comnierce has taken the matter up with much earnestness , and so have other commercial organizations . Agitation in this direction , if it is not arrested , can accomplish much , and , if systematic , may impel Congress to action . The National Board of Trade , at its recent meeting in Washington , adopted resolutions in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reform . All this is encouraging , and out of it may come something tangible . If the viceconsuls and more important agents could he placed within the classified list and fixity of tenure guaranteed by law , many of the sore spots now only too painfully apparent upon the body of our foreign service would be at once effectually healed . There are no practical obstacles in the path of this reform which a friendly Congress may not brush aside . *Then , however , we come to consider the case of the consuls themselves , we meet a serious difficulty , and one that is very generally lost sight of by many earnest and well-meaning friends of consular reform . The Constitution provides that the President " shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint , ambassadors , other public ministers , and consuls . " Here , then , the President is vested with a constitutional right which no congressional enactment can change . Reform at this point , if it comes at all , can come only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative must be taken by the Executive . It must be left to him to prescribe the conditions under which appointments shall take place ; and no matter how excellent those conditions , his successor could of course amend them , or abolish them altogether , if he saw fit . It may be safely asserted , nevertheless , that if regulations governing the appointment , promotion , and removal of officers in the consular service were once put in force , whether at the instance of the President himself or at the suggestion of the lawmaking branch , they would be permanently retained in some form . The tide of public sentiment would set too strongly to be resisted . The bill recently introduced by Senator Morgan obviates this constitutional difficulty by providing that the President himself shall be a member of the commission to be appointed to remodel the foreign service . This would give all the force of departmental regulations to the recommendations of such a commission . The bill itself ( which is not understood to emanate from the Senate ) contains many crudities , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , as it ought to do in some form , but the interest taken in the whole subject by no less a personage than the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs is an encouraging omen . Undoubtedly , the highest efficiency would be obtained by a competitive e*-amination , with reasonable safeguards which would allow the appointing power a proper latitude in the selection of candidates from the eligible list . This f ailing , t'he next best thing would be the substitution of a mere pass examination , and the assignment of a quota by States , in much the same manner as appointments at West Point and Annapolis now take place . In discussing this precise point at the recent meeting of the National Board of Trade in Washington , Mr. Theodore Roosevelt said : - // " I would divide the consuls , as far as may be , into grades , according to their salaries and the importance of the duties they have to perform . Then it should be provided that no men could be appointed to any higher grade save by promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion he must serve a minimum period of , say , a year in that grade . Then , before receiving his appointment , he should be required to undergo a rigid examination - non-competitive - at the State Department upon his knowledge of foreign languages , and to test his fitness not merely for the low post he is seeking , but his fitness to enter a service where he may by diligence and industry rise to the very highest positions . " The suggestion of a non-competitive examination has much to commend it . Tact , discretion , sound judgment , and good manners can not be scientifically measured by any scale of percentages , and some such system as this would obviate the objections which are sure to arise to a purely competitive examination . The examinations might be conducted under the direction of the Civil Service Commission , already established for that purpose , or take place under the supervision of a board selected by the State Department . It would perhaps be imprudent at first to put all consulates - especially those of the highest grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fully two thirds , at least , of the present offices might still be advantageously placed within the classified service , and many of the unimportant posts ought , logically , to be reduced to the rank of vice-consulates , a system which other countries have very generally followed . There is danger , though , that in striving to attain perfection in this matter the visionary may obscnre the practical . Reform rhetoric may impressively hurl anathemas at the head and front of the present offending system . It may burn endless incense at the shrine of an ideal service , and still the desired reform be several eons away . The history of most changes for the better has been marked by piecemeal concession wrested from stubborn resistance . If the way of the transgressor is hard , the path of his critic is even more thorny . It is vain to hope that any topsy-turvy scheme will commend itself to our doubting Solons . The time is not ripe . It is to be feared that there are still too many political mortgages to be honored by drafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most sadly needed , no matter what the system of appointment , and what ought , moreover , to be easier of realization than any other project , is some responsible system of supervision . It is a singular and astounding fact that so important a branch of the public service has been so long allowed to drift and shift for itself . The Treasury , the Interior , and the Post Office departments - which are by no means conspicuous for adhesion to civil service rules - all have their inspectors . No department with any regard for the public interest could dispense with them . This is undisputed . Take a conspicuous ease in point . The early history of our Indian agencies is filled with accounts of scandalous jobs and corruption of the most flagrant type ; and it was not until a system of inspection was adopted that these irregularities were arrested . If the teachings of experience have made mandatory this system of cheeks upon domestic officers , who are constantly exposed to the criticisms of a vigilant press , how much more necessary becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome restraint ! No plan which could be devised is more feasible or would result in more lasting good . A few inspectors , judiciously chosen , would not only much more than pay for themselves by checking reckless extravagance and waste , but they would vindicate the wisdom of their selection in a way not // to be measured by dollars and cents . Their existence would first of all insure the keeping of the consular records and accounts in an intelligent and orderly manner , which is now not always the case . Some of the gaps to be found in the archives of many offices can scarcely be accounted for on any theory of natural depravity . The knowledge that an inspector might drop in at any moment , without the ceremony of a formal notice , would put a stop to the almost incessant globe-trotting expeditions of many excellent gentlemen , who now go abroad for the purpose of educating their children , of studying art , of taking a vacation at the public expense , - in short , for every conceivable object save that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about returning grossly inaccurate quarterly statements of the time during which they were absent from their posts , while they are drawing their salaries with the usual punctuality and dispatch . The real work is of course done by some poorly paid clerk , to the great detriment of the interests of all concerned . But the inauguration of a system of inspection would do something more . It would elevate the morale of the service , and bring about a certain esprit de corps , as nothing else could . This could be accomplished , even with all the raw material with which inspectors would be condemned to work ( so long as the present method of appointment prevails ) ; for it is an interesting and instructive fact that there are at the present moment scarcely more than a dozen officers ( thirteen , to be exact ) - and they are usually filling unimportant posts - who have seen beyond a decade of service at the places where they are now stationed . If we include the exceeding few who have been transferred , it would be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served continuously for the period mentioned . And this in a service of over three hundred members . It is nothing that many able and conscientious officers , who have taken their families abroad at considerable expense , have been obliged to return after a brief term of service , and just as they were beginning to be of some use to those who sent them . The pathetic hardships of these removals are well known . They are of too common occurrence to excite much interest , whether the victim be at home or abroad . It is evident that what there is of sentiment in all these enstorus - which ought to be un-American , but , unfortunately for us , are everywhere recognized as being distinctively American - does not quicken the public conscience or arouse a righteous indignation . Something else is needed , and it will not be supplied until the American people can be persuaded to look into their accounts to see how needlessly they are being plundered . So long as human nature is as it is , so long will even importers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fatherland but the till , " with the aid of their alien allies , resort to every device to enter their goods at the lowest possible figure . These devices may not always be dishonest , but there is a pretty well grounded belief in time public mind that nudervaluations on no petty scale have taken place in the past . There is nothing to indicate a cessation of these practices in the near future . The aggregate amount lost to the government in this way is almost incalculable , but some idea of it may be gathered when it is remembered that an increase of only two and a half per cent in invoice valuations at the little industrial centre of Crefeld alone would result in an annual accession to the customs receipts of $150,000 . It is beyond any mere conjecture that an addition of at least five per cent could be brought about and maintained at many posts by competent and trained officers . On this basis , then , time conclusion is irresistible that the entire expense of a first-class foreign service could be more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year through incapacity and ignorance . In the interests of public economy , in the interests of American commerce , which has the right to be represented by intelligent men in foreign countries , and last of all in the interests of our own good name as a people , it is high time that we should dispense with an antiquated and a worn out system , and substitute something more in harmony with modern ideas . Foreigners of an observing and a critical turn of mind never fail to record something about that which Mr. Bryce calls the " patriotism and demonstrative national pride " of the American people . It is not a little strange that a nation of which this is so freely said has not long ago grown restive under abuses which have fastened themselves with " hooks of steel " upon its system of government . With our natural and well-defined hatred of an official caste and bureaucracy , it is perhaps not surprising that attempts have been made to defend the spoils system . But there is one branch of the public service where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible on any conceivable ground , and that is time consular service of the United States . Permanency and stability are the imperious needs of that service . Divorce appointments and removals from the present miserable exigencies of partisan politics , remove them from the " cockpit of faction , " and it can no longer be said in reproach of the American consul , as was once said of our average minister , that he " fleetli as a shadow , and hath no abiding place .
