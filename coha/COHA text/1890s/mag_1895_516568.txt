THE PARIS OF SOUTH AMERICA . BY RICHARD HARDING DAVIS . Q HOVED off by itself in a corner of KJ Central Park on the top of a wooded hill , where only the people who live in the high apartment-houses at Eighty-first Street can see it , is an equestrian statne . It is odd , bizarre , and inartistic , and suggests in size and pose that equestrian statue to General Jackson which mounts guard before the White House in Washington . It shows a chocolate-cream so-dier mastering with one hand a rearing rocking-horse , and with the other pointing his sword towards an imaginary enemy . Sometimes a " sparrow " policeman saunters up the hill and looks at the statue with unenlightened eyes , and sometimes a nurse-maid seeks its seclnded site , and sits ou the pedestal below it while the children of this free republic play unconcernedly in its shadow . On the base of this big statue is carved the name of Simon Bolivar , the Liberator of Venezuela . Down on the northeastern coast of South America , in Caracas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a pretty little plaza , called the Plaza Washington . It is not at all an important plaza ; it is not floored for hnndreds of yards with rare mosaics like the Plaza de Bolivar. nor lit by swinging electric lights , and the President 's band never plays there . But it has a fresh prettiness and restfulness all its own , and the narrow gravel paths are clean and trim , and the grass grows rich and high , and the branches of the trees touch and interlace and form a green roof over all , except in the very centre , where there stands open to the blue sky a statue of Washington , calm , dignified , beneficent , and paternal . It is Washington the statesman , not the soldier . The sun of the tropics beats down upon his shoulders ; the palms rustle and whisper pleasantly above his head . From the barred windows of the yellow and blue and pink houses that line the little plaza dark-eyed , dark-skinned women look out sleepily , but understandingly , at the grave face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his red blanket and Winchester carbine , comprehends when the gringos stop and // take off their hats and make a low bow to the father of their country in his pleasant place of exile . Other governments than those of the United States of America and the United States of Venezuela have put up statues to their great men in foreign capitals , but the careers of Washington and Bolivar bear so striking a resemblance , and the histories of the two countries of which they are the respective fathers are so much alike , that they might be written in parallel columns . And so it seems especially appropriate that these monuments to these patriots should stand in each of the two continents on either side of the dividing states of Central America . It will offend no true Venezuelan to ( lay if it be said of his country that the most interesting man in it is a dead one , for he will allow no one to go farther than himself in his admiration for Bolivar ; and he has done so much to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin and stamp of the country , by placing his statue at every corner , and by hanging his picture in every house , that he can not blame the visitor if his strongest impression of Venezuela is of the young man who began at thirty-three tolibcrate five republics , and who conquered a territory more than onethird as great as the whole of Europe . In 1811 Venezuela declared her independence of the mother-country of Spain , and her great men put this declaration in writing and signed it , and the room in which it was signed is still kept sacred , as is the room where our declaration was signed in Independence Hall . But the two men who were to make these declarations worth something more than the parchment upon which they were written were not among the signers . Their work was still to come , and it was much the same kind of work , and carried on in much the same spirit of indomitable energy under the most cruel difficulties , and with a few undrilled troops against an army of veterans . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where Washington suffered in the snows of Valley Forge , or pushed his way THE RAILROAD yr THE MOUNTAIN . // through the floating ice of the Delaware , young Bolivar marched under fierce tropical suns , and cut his path through jungle and swamp-lands , and over the almost impenetrable fastnesses of the Andes . Their difficulties were the same and their aim was the same , but the character of the two men was absolutely and entirely different , for Bolivar was reckless impatient of advice , and even foolhardy . What Washington was we know . The South American came of a distinguished Spanish family , and had been educated as a courtier and as a soldier in the mother-country , though his heart remained always with his own people , and he was among the first to take up arms to set them free . Unless you have seen the country through which he led his men , and have measured the mountains he climbed with his few followers , it is quite impossible to understand the immensity of the task he accomplished . Even today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven days , and yet Bolivar made the same distance and on foot , starting from the South Atlantic , and continuing on across the continent to the Pacific side , and then on down the coast into Peru , living on his way upon roots and berries , sleeping on the ground wrapped in a blanket , riding on muleback or climbing the steep trail on foot , a*Ad freeing on his way Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador , Bolivia , and finally Peru , the home of the Incas . The history of this campaign is one too glorious and rich in incident and color to be crowded into the pages of a magazine , and the character of its chief actor too varied . and his ris&amp; and fall too dramatic , to he dismissed , as it must be here , in a few paragraphs . But every American who loves a hero and who loves a lover , and Bolivar was very much of both , and perhaps too much of the latter , should read the life of this young man who freed a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were much his senior in years his lieutenants , and who , after risking his life upon many battle-fields and escaping several attempts at assassination , died at last deserted except by a few friends , and with a heart broken by the ingratitude of the people he had led out of captivity . It is difficult to find out , even in his own country , why the Venezuelans , after heaping Bohivar with honors and elevating him to the place of a god , should have turned against him , and driven him into exile at Santa Marta . Some will tell you that he tried to make himself dictator over the countries which he had freed ; others say that it was because he had refused to be a dictator that the popular feeling went against him , and that when the l ) eople in the madness of their new-found freedom cried . " Thou hast rid us of kings ; be thou PRE5IDENT CRE5PO OF VENEZUELA . // our King , " he showed them their folly , and sought his old home , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep him back once more and forever into the place of the popular hero of South Xmerica . It was sixteen years after his death that a hero - worshipping friend was brave enough to commission an artist to design a statue to his memory . On the neck of this statue the artist hung the representation of a miniature in the shape of a medallion . which had been given to Bolivar * by the family of Washington . On the reverse was a lock of Washington 's hair and the inscription , " This portrait of the founder of liberty in North America is presented by his adopted son to him who has acquired equal glory in South AimerSome one asked why the artist had stripped from the breast of Bolivar all of the other medals and stars that had been given him by different countries in the hour of his triumph , and the artist answered that he had done as his patron and the friend of Bolivar thought would best please his hero . And ever after that it was decreed that every bust or statue or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington hanging by a ribbon about his neck ; and so you will see in the National Portrait Gallery that while the coats of his lieutenants glitter with orders and crosses , Bolivar 's bears this medal only . It was his greatest pride , and he considered it his chief glory . And the manner of its bestowal was curiously appropriate . In 1824 General Lafayette returned to this country as the guest of the nation , and a banquet was given to him by Congress , at which the memory of Washington and the deeds of his French lieutenant were honored again and a am . It was while the enthusiasm and rejoicings of this celebration were at their height that Henry Clay rose in his place and asked the six hundred Americans before him to remember that while they were enjoying the benefits of free institu THE rREsIDENT 's BODY-GUARD OF CO*BOY5. // tions founded by the bravery and patriotism of their forefathers , their cousins and neighbors in the southern continent were struggling to obtain that same independence . " No nation , no generous Lafayette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; alone and without help they have sustained their glorious cause , trusting to its justice , and with the assistance only of their bravery , their deserts , and their Andesand one man , Simon Bolivar , the Washington of South America . " And you can imagine the six hundred Americans jumping to their feet and cheering the name of the young soldier , and the French marquis eagerly asking that lie might be the one to send him some token of their sympathy and admiration . Lafayette forwarded the portrait of Washington to Bolivar , who valued it so highly that the people who loved him valued the man he worshipped ; and to-day you will see in Caracas streets and squares and houses named after Washington , and portraits of Washington crossing the Delaware , and Washington on horseback , and Washington at Mount Vernon , hanging in almost every shop and cafd in the capital . And the next time you ride in Central Park you might turn your bicycle , or tell the man on the box to turn the horses , into that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd-looking statue stands , and see if you can not feel some sort of sympathy and pay some tribute to this young man who loved like a hero , and who fought like a hero , with the fierceness of the tropical sun above him , and whose inspiration was the calm grave parent of your own country . Bolivar 's country is the republic of South America that stands nearest to New York , and when people come to know more concerning it , I am sure they will take to visiting it and its.capital , the " Paris of South America " in the winter months , as they now go to southern Europe or to the Mediterranean . There are many reasons for their doing so . In the first place , it can be reached in less than six days , and it is the only part of South America to which one can go without first crossing the Isthmus of Panama and then taking a long trip down the western coast , or sailing for nearly a month along the eastern coast ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Valencia are typical of the best South American cities . When you have seen them you have an intelligent idea of what the others are like ; and when yoa read about revolutions in Rio Janeiro , or Valparaiso , or Buenos Ayres , you will have in your mind 's eye the background for all of these dramatic uprisings , and you will feel superior to other people who do not know that the republic of Venezuela is larger than France , Spain , and Portugal together , and that the inhabitants of this great territory are less in number than those of New York city . La Gunyra is the chief seaport of Venezuela . It lies at the edge of a chain of great mountains , where they come down to wet their feet in the ocean , and Caracas , the capital , is stowed away four thousand feet higher up behind these mountains , and could only be bombarded in time of war by shells that would rise like rockets and drop on the other side of the mountains , and so cover a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above La Guayra , on the hill , is a little fortress which was once the resi LEGISLATIVE BUILDING . cARACAs . // deuce of the Spanish Governor when Yenezuela was a colony of Spain . It is of interest now chiefly because Charles Kingsley describes it in IVestward Ho as the fortress in which the Rose of Devon was imprisoned . Past this fortress , and up over the mountains to the capital , are a mule trail and an ancient wagon road and a modern railway . It is a very remarkable railroad ; its tracks cling to the perpendicular surface of the mountain like the tiny tendrils of a vine on a stone wall , and the trains creep and crawl along the edge of its precipices , or twist themselves into the shape of a horseshoe magnet , so that the engineer on the locomotive can look directly across a bottomless chasni into the windows of the last car . The view from this train , while it pants and putfs on its way to the capital , is the most beautiful combination of sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are higher mountains and more beautiful , perhaps , but they run into a brown prairie or into a green plain ; and there are as beautiful views of the ocean , only you have to see them from the level of the ocean itself , or from a chalk cliff with the downs behind you and the white sand at your feet . But nowhere else in the world have I seen such magnificent and noble mountains running into so beautiful and green a plain , and beyond that the great blue stretches of the sea . When you look down from the car platform you see first , stretching three thousand feet below you , the great green ribs of the mountain and its valleys and waterways leading into a plain covered with thousands and thousands of royal palms , set so far apart that you can distingu ish every broad leaf and the full length of the white trunk . Among these are the redroofed and yellow villages , and beyond them again the white line of breakers disappearing and reappearing against the blue as though some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and then the great ocean weltering in the heat and stretching as far as the eye can see , and touching a sky so like it in color that the two are joined in a curtain of blue on which the ships seem to lie flat , like painted pictures on a wall . You pass through clouds on your way up that leave the trees and rocks along the track damp and shining as after a heavy dew , and at some places you can peer through them from the steps of the car down a straight fall of four thousand feet . When you have climbed to the top of the mountain you see below you on the other side the beautiful valley in which lies the city of Caracas , cut up evenly by well-kept streets , and diversified by the towers of churches and public buildings and open plazas , with the white houses and gardens of the coffee-planters lying beyond the city at the base of the mountains . Venezuela , after our experiences of Central America , was like a return to civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOLIvAR , CARACAS . // Texas . We found Caracas to be a Spanish-Arnerican city of the first class , with . a su , , gestion of the boulevards and Yen *zuela a country that possessed a history of her own , and an Academy of wise men and artists , and a Pantheon for her heroes . I suppose we should have known that th is was so before we visited Yen*zuela ; but as we did not , we felt as though we were discovering a new country for ourselves . It was interesting to find statues of men of whom none of s had ever heard , and who were distinguished for something else than military uccesses , men who had made discovtries in science and medicine , and who had written learned books ; to find the latest devices for comfort of a civilized community , and with them the records of a fierce stru* , gle for independence , a long period of disorganizati0* where the Church had the master-hand , and then a rapid advance in the habits and customs of enlightened nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing on one side a pride of country and an eagerness to emulate the customs of stable governmen*5 and on the other evdences of the southern hot-blooded temperament and dislike of restraint On the corner of the principal plaza stands the cathedral , with a tower . Ten soldiers took refuge in this tower four years ago , during the last revolution , and they made SO determined a fight from that point of vantage that in order to dislodge them it was found necessary to build a fire in the tower and smoke them out with the fumes of sulphur . These ten soldiers were the last to make a stand within the city , and when they fell , from the top of the tower , smothered to death , the revolution was at an end . This incident of warfare is of value when you contrast the thing done with its environment and know that next to the cathedral tower are confectionery shops such as you find on IRegent Street or upper Broadway , that electric lights surround the cathedral , and that tram-cars run past it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the roadway and over a better street than any to be found in New York city . Even without acquaintances among the people of the capital there are enough public show-places in Caracas to entertain a stranger for a fortnight . It is pleasure enough to walk the long narrow streets under brilliantly colored awnings , between high one and two story houses , painted in blues and pinks and greens , and with overhanging red - tiled roofs and projecting iron balconies and open iron-barred windows , through which you gain glimpses beyond of cool interiors and beautiful courts and gardens filled with odd-looking plants around a splashing fountain . The ladies of Caracas seem to spend much of their time sitting at these windows , and are always there in the late afternoons , when they dress themselves and arrange their hair for the evening , and put a little powder on their faces , and take their places in the cushioned window seats as though they were in their box at the opera . And though they are within a few inches of the passers-by on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are as oblivious of their presence as though they were invisible . In the streets are strings of mules carrying bags of coffee or buried beneath bales of fodder , and jostled by open fiacres , with magnificent coachmen on the box-seat in top - boots and gold trimmings to their hats and coats , and many soldiers , on foot and mounted , hurrying along at a quick step in companies , or strolling leisurely alone . They wear blue uniforms with scarlet trousers and facings , and the President 's body-guard are in white duck and high black boots , and are mounted on magnificent horses . There are three great buildings in Caracas - the Federal Palace , the Operahouse , and the Pantheon , which was formerly a church , and which has been changed into a receiving - vault and a memorial for the great men of the country , and where , after three journeys , the bones of Bolivar now rest . The most interesting of these is the Federal Palace . It is built around a great square filled with flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the handsomest building in Caracas , and within the building which forms its four sides are the chambers of the upper and lower VOL. xcIL. - No. 547. - il branches of the legislature , the offices of the different departments of state , and the reception hall of the President , in which is the National Portrait Gallery . The palace is light and unsubstantial looking , like a canvas palace in a theatre , and suggests the casino at a French watering place . It is painted in imitation of stone , and the statues are either of plaster of . Paris or of wood , painted white to represent marble . But the theati'ical effect is in keeping with the colored walls and open fronts of the other buildings of the city , and is not out of place in this city of such dramatic incidents . The portraits in the state-room of the palace immortalize the features of fiercelooking , dark - faced generals , with oldfashioned high standing collars of gold braid , and green uniforms . Strange and unfamiliar names are printed beneath these portraits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor which hangs from the ceiling , and which faces a list of the famous battles for independence . High on this roll of honor are the names " General O'Leary " and " Colonel Fergurson , " and among the portraits are the faces of two blue - eyed , red - haired young men , with fair skin and broad chests and shoulders , one wearing the close-clipped whiskers of the last of the Georges , and the other the long Dundreary whiskers of the Crimean wars . Whether the Irish general and the English colonel gave their swords for the sake of the cause of independence or fought for the love of fighting , I do not know , but they won the love of the Spanish Americans by the service they rendered , no matter what their motives may have been for serving . Many people tell you proudly that they are descended from " O'Leari , " and the names of the two foreigners are as conspicuous on pedestals and tablets of honor as their smiling blue eyes and red cheeks are conspicuous among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers in arms . At one end of the room is an immense painting of a battle , and the other is blocked by as large a picture showing Bohivar dictating to members of Congress , who have apparently ridden out into the field to me*t him , and who are holding an impromptu session beneath the palm leaves of an Indian hut . The dome of the chamber , which latter is two hundred feet in length , is covered with an in*mmense // panorama , excellently well done , showing the last of the battles of the Venezuelans against the Spaniards , in which the figures are life size and the action most spirited , and the effect of color distinctly decorative . These paintings in the National Gallery would lead you to suppose that there was nothing but battles in the history of Venezuela , and that her great men were all soldiers , but the talent of the artists who have painted these scenes and the actors in them corrects that idea . Among these artists are Arturo Michelena , who has exhibited at the World 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which institution he has received a prize , M. Tovar y Tovar , A. Herrea Toro , and Cristobal Rojas . It was that " illustrious American , Guzman Blanco , " one of the numerous Presidents of Venezuela , and probably the best known , who was responsible for most of the public buildings of the capital . These were originally either convents or monasteries , which he converted , after his war with the Church , into the Federal Palace , the Opera-house , and a university . Each of these structures covers so much valuable ground , and is situated so advantageously in the very heart of the city , that one gets a very good idea of how powerful the Church element must have been before Guzman overthrew it . He was a peculiar man , apparently , and possessed of much force and of a progressive spirit , combined with an overmastering vanity . The city was at its gayest under his regime , and lie encouraged as well the arts and sciences by creating various bodies of learned men , and furnished the nucleus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting concessions to foreign companies which were of quite too generous a nature to hold good , and which encumber and embarrass his successors greatly . But while he was President , and before lie went to live in luxurious exile on the Avenue Kl*ber , which seems to be the restingplace of all South American Presidents , he did much to make the country prosperous and its capital attractive , and , he was determined that the people should know that he was the individual who accomplished these things . With this object he had fifteen statues erected to himself in different parts of the city , and more tablets than one can count . Each statue bore an inscription telling that it was erected to that " Illustrious American , Guzman Blanco , " and every new bridge and road and public building bore a label to say that it was Guzman Blanco who was responsible for its existence . The idea of a man erecting statues to himself struck the South American mind as extremely humorous , and one night all the statues were sawed off at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen and only raw places in the walls to show where the memorial tablets hung . But you can not wipe out history by pulling down columns or effacing inscriptions , and Guzman Blanco undoubtedly did do much for his country , even though at the same time he was doing a great deal for Guzman Blanco . Guzman was followed in rapid succession by three or four other Presidents and Dictators , who filled their pockets with millions and then fled the country , only waiting until their money was safely out of it first . Then General Crespo , who had started his revolution with seven men , finally overthrew the government 's forces , and was elected President , and has remained in office ever since . To set forth with seven followers to make yourself President of a country as large as France , Portugal , and Spain together requires a great deal of confidence and courage . General Crespo is a fighter , and possesses both . It was either he or one of his generals - the story is told of both - who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off their shirts and grease their bodies and rush through the camp of the enemy in search of them . He told them to hold the left hand out as they ran , and whenever their fingers slipped on a greased body they were to pass it by , but when they touched a man wearing a shirt they were to cut him down with their machetes . In this fashion three hundred of his plainsmen routed two thousand of the regular troops , and captured all of their rifles and ammunition . The idea that when you want arms the enemy is the best person from whom to take them is excellent logic , and that charge of the half-naked men , armed only with their knives , through the sleeping camp is Homeric in its magnificence . Crespo is more at home when fighting in the field than in the council chamber of the Yellow House , which is the White House of the republic ; but that // may be because he prefers fighting to governing , and a man generally does best what he likes best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when he was on the march with his seven revolutionists , and goes to bed at eight in the evening , and is deep in public business by four the next morning , and many an unhappy minister has been called to an audience at sunrise . The President neither smokes nor drinks ; he is grave and dignified , with that dignity that enormous size gives , and his greatest pleasure is to take a holiday and visit his ranch , where he watches the round - up of his cattle and gallops over his thousands of acres . He is the idol of the cowboys , and has a body-guard composed of some of the men of this class . I suppose they are very much like our own cowboys , but the citizens of the capital look upon them as the Parisians regarded Napoleon 's Mainelukes , and tell you in perfect sincerity that when they charge at night their eyes flash lire in a truly terrifying manner . I saw the President but once , and then but for a few moments . He was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which every one was admitted with a freedom that betokened absolute democracy . When my turn came he talked awhile through Colonel Bird , our consul , but there was no chance for me to gain any idea of him except that he was very polite , as are all Venezuelans , and very large . They tell a story of him which illustrates his character . He was riding past the university when a group of students hooted and jeered at him , not because of his politics , but because of his origin . A policeman standing by , aroused to indignation by this insult to the President , fired his revolver into the crowd . Crespo at once ordered the man 's arrest for shooting at a citizen with no sufficient provocation , and rode on his way without even giving a glance at his tormentors . The incident seemed to show that he was too big a man to allow the law to be broken even in his own defense , or , at least , big enough not to mind the taunts of ill-bred children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Caracas , as are all boys in that country , where a child is listened to , if he be a male child , with as much grave politeness as though it were a veteran who was speaking . The effect is not good , and the boys , especially of the university , grow to believe that they are very important factors in the affairs of the state , when , as a matter of fact , they are only the cat 's - paws of clever politicians , who use them whenever they want a demonstration and do not wish to appear in it themselves . So these boys are sent forth shouting into the streets , and half the people cheer them on , and the children themselves think they are patriots or liberators , or something equally important . I obtained a rather low opinion of them because they stoned an unfortunate American photographer who was taking pictures in the quadrangles , and because I was so far interested in them as to make a friend of mine translate for me the sentences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vei-ses were of a political character , but so indecent that the interpreter was much enibarrassed ; the single sentences were attacks , anonymous , of course , on fellow students . As the students of the University of Venezuela step directly from college life into public life , their training is of some interest and importance . And I am sure that the Venezuelan fathers would do much better by their sons if they would cease to speak of the university in awe-stricken tones as the hotbed of liberty , " but would rather take away their sons ' revolvers and teach them football , and spank them soundly whenever they caught them soiling the walls of their alma mater with nasty verses . There are some beautiful drives around Caracas , out in the country among the coffee plantations , and one to a public garden that overlooks the city , upon which President Crespo has spent much thought and money . But the most beautiful feature of Caracas , and one that no person who has visited that place will ever forget , is the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are smooth and bare of trees and of a light green color , except in the waterways , where there are lines of darker green , and the clouds change their aspect continually , covering them with shadows or floating over them from valley to valley , and hovering above a high peak like the white smoke of a volcano . I do not know of a place that will so well repay a visit as Caracas , or a country that is so well worth exploring as Venezuela . To // a sportsman it is a paradise . You can shoot deer within six miles of the Operahouse , and in six hours beyond Macuto you can kill panther , and as many wild boars as you wish . No country in South America is richer in such natural products as cocoa , coffee , and sugar-cane . And in the interior there is a vast undiscovered and untouched territory waiting for the mining engineer , the professional hunter , and the breeder of cattle . The government of Venezuela at the time of our visit to Caracas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , and her own somewhat hasty action in sending three foreign ministers out of the country for daring to criticise her tardiness in paying foreign debts and her neglect in not holding to the terms of concessions . These difficulties , the latter of which were entirely of her own making , were interesting to us as Americans , because the talk on all sides showed that in the event of a serious trouble with any foreign power Venezuela looks confidently to the United States for aid . In expectation of receiving this aid she is liable to go much further than she would dare go if she did not think the United States was back of her . Her belief in the sympathy of our government is based on many friendly acts in the past : on the facts that General Miranda , the soldier who preceded Bolivar , and who was a friend of Hamilton , Fox , and Lafayette , first learned to hope for the independence of South America during the battle for independence in our own country ; that when the revolution began , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received her first war material ; that two years later , when the earthquake of 1812 destroyed twenty thousand people , the United States Congress sent many ship-loads of flour to the survivors of the disaster ; and that as late as 1888 our Congress again showed its good feeling by authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to return to Venezuela on a ship of war the body of General Paez , who died in exile in New York city , and by appointing a committee of Congressmen and Senators to represent the government at his public funeral . All of these expressions of good - will in the past count for something as signs that the United States may be relied upon in the future , but it is a question if she is willing to go as far as Ven ezuela expects her to go . Venezuela 's hope of aid , and her conviction , which is shared by all the Central American republics , that the United States is going to help her and them in the hour of need , is based upon what they believe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand it is a very different thing from the Monroe doctrine as they understand it ; and while their reading of it is not so important as long as we know what it means and look up to it and enforce it , there is danger nevertheless in their way of looking at it , for , according to their point of view , the Monroe doctrine is expected to cover a multitude of their sins . President Monroe said that we should " consider any attempt on the part of foreign powers to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety , and that we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing those governments that had declared their independence , or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any European power , in any other light than as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition to the United States . " He did not say that if a Central American republic banished a British consul , or if Venezuela told the foreign ministers to leave the country on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with force of arms . Admiral Meade 's squadron touched at La Guayra while we were at the capital . The squadron visited the port at that time in obedience to the schedule already laid out for it in Washington some months previous , just as a theatrical company plays a week 's stand at the time and at the place arranged for it in advance by its agent , but the Venezuelans did not consider this , and believed that the squadron had been sent there to intimidate the British and to frighten the French and German men - of - war which were then expected in port to convey their dismissed ministers back to their own countries . One of the most intelligent men that I met in Caracas , and one closely connected with the foreign office , told me he had been to La Guayra to see our squadron , and that the admiral had placed his ships of war in the harbor in such a position that at a word lie could blow the French and German boats out of the water . I suggested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign ministers than that of telling them to pack up and get out of the country in a week , and that I did not think the Monroe doctrine meant that South American republics could affront foreign nations with impunity . He answered me by saying that the United States had aided Mexico when Maximilian tried to found an empire in that country , and he could not see that the cases were not exactly similar . They will , however , probably understand better what the Monroe doctrine really is before they are through with their boundary dispute with Great Britain , and Great Britain will probably know more about it also , for it is possible that there never was a case when the United States needed to watch her English cousins more closely and to announce her Monroe doctrine more vigorously than in this international dispute over the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana . If England succeeds it means a loss to Venezuela of a territory as large as the State of New York , and of gold deposits which are believed to be the richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it means the entire control by the English of the mouth and four hundred miles of the Orinoco River . The question is one of historical records and maps , and nothing else . Great Britain fell heir to the rights formerly possessed by Holland . Venezuela obtained by conquest the lands formerly owned by Spain . The problem to be solved is to find what were the possessions of Holland and Spain , and so settle what is to-day the territory of England and Venezuela . Year after year O reat Britain has pushed her way westward , until she has advanced her claims over a territory of forty thousand square miles , and has included Barima Point at the entrance to the Orinoco . She has refused to recede or to arbitrate , and she should be made either to submit to the latter method of settling the dispute or be sent back to the Pomeroon River , where she was content to rest her claims in 1840 .
