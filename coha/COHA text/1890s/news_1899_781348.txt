txt The first anointing service ever witnessed here took place in the Christian Alliance Convention early this evening , and the large audience present drew as near the scene as they could get , as the service about which they had heard so much was entirely new to them . Dr. Simpson , in brief remarks , invited those who were to be anointed to come to the altar , where they were to kneel during the solemn ceremony . Fifteen men and women went forward , and among the number was a man described as Judge Rogers of New York City . He has been a regular attendant at the convention every day during the past week , and said that he had been converted years ago , but that he was going to join the rest of the company who were to receive the anointment . While the fifteen persons seeking the ceremony were kneeling with bowed heads at the altar , men and women who are workers with Dr. Simpson went within the altar railing to aid in the anointment . Dr. Simpson said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what it signified . " The anointing with oil , " said he , " is merely a symbol . You have not come titre , dear friends , as an experiment , but with faint in the Lord . Divine healing will cure consumption , heart disease , and other ailments  --  not by Christian Science , which we repudiate  --  not by faith nor by men  --  but it is a meeting of you and Christ , and He does for you what He promises to do . " After those desiring to be anointed had knelt , Dr. Simpson said he wished to ask them three questions . The first was : " Do you believe in the truth of the Lord 's healing as taught in these services ? " There was a hearty response , " I do . " Then Dr. Simpson said : " Are you yours-Al : right with God , so there is no obstacle between you and God that will prevent the working of His divine will ? ? ' " Yes . " was answered promptly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take Him ? Do you now believe that Ile will undertake your cause ? " " I do , " was the quick response from all who were kneeling . The anointing service consisted of placing a small quantity of olive uil upon the brow of each person , and two or three of the Alliance rniniE-ters and their co-workers stopped at each anointed person , pressed their hands upon his or her head , and prayed almost inaudibly . The service was a very impressive one . and not a sound was heard in the large tabernacle during the half hour occupied by the ceremony . Dr. Simpson told the audience that nothing of a mystifying nature about the anointing was intended , but it was only a simple service . as much so as baptism in one of the Christian churches . An hour 's meeting , consisting of testi-monials by  --  those who said they were heaven by prayer , preceded the anointing and many testified . Among these was Mrs. Van Vorst , widow of the late Judge Hooper C. Van Vorst of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjoining the Alliance grounds . She does not belong to the Alliance , but is a prominent member of the Nyack Episcopal Church . She was dressed in deep black , and as she stepped forward as the platform , every one leaned forward to catch what she might say . Mrs. Van Vorst said that she had not expected to attend this meeting when she left the city , but came by accident . She wanted to tell her ey.pericnce in divine healing . She said she was once so afflicted that an operation was deemed necessary . She had been placed in the room with the operating table , but before the doctor came she concluded to pray to God , and she did so and site was healed , she said , so that an operation was not necessary , and she got up and dressed herself and walked , Many others related similar experiences . The Rev. Dr. D. W. Delacheur , before the dig-it to healing meeting , made an address . in which he appealed for more money to be given for the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year for liquor : that there were 100 liquor shops in and near Manila . and yet the people would not give near that amount for missionary deleted 7 lines " But you can not cheat the Lord , " said the speaker . The convention will close to-morrow , when a great crowd is expected . The collection , which it is supposed will be large , will be taken at the 11 o'clock service In the morning . The proceeds will be for missionary work .
