txt It seems hardly necessary to say that nobody who does not enjoy the confidence of the Japanese Ministry can possibly know upon what terms Japan is willing to make peace . It is doubtful if the members of the Japanese Ministry have arrived at an agreement upon these terms which they are prepared to recommend to the Emperor , in whom the ultimate decision rests . There is no necessity for an agreement until a formal and direct application for peace is made by China . Certainly nobody outside the Japanese Cabinet can know what the terms are to be before they are made known to China . Until a conference is had all talk about the terms of peace is mere guesswork . Upon one point , however , it is clear that Japan will not need to insist . It was the avowed purpose of Bismarck , in the terms he exacted at the close of the Franco-Prussian war , to make France powerless to disturb the peace of Germany for twenty years thereafter . That terni is now overpassed , and though both rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept up armaments that have greatly burdened their people , the peace has not yet been broken . The war has shown Japan that it will not be necessary for her to take guarantees . upon this point . It will not be in the power of China to do Japan any harm until the Chinese Empire is reconstructed and modernized , and the end of that process is so far off that it does not concern any man now living to make provision in view of it . A nation which is so absolutely helpless for defensive purposes as China has been shown to be is not in the slightest danger of taking the offensive .
