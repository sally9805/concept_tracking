txt Miss Harriet Hosmer has been stirring up the artists of San Francisco by some remarks about local sculpture which she did make and others which were put in her mouth . In her valedictory on April 1 , she remarked : " Our ideas of art are apparently confined to portraiture  --  ideal art is vanished . Poetry in art , as poetry in practice , is little in accord with our too utilitarian age . " In Boston the same plaint is heard from Miss Anne Whitney , who resembles Miss Hosmer in being the product of our art colony in Rome , a champion of sentiment and romance in sculpture , a believer in the highest form of the classic in statuary . This view of art will always have defenders , although it is only the rare artist who can so treat the romantic and ideal as to save his work from dull commonplace or frank bad taste . Miss Hosmer is , however , quite right in saying that ideal sculpture hardly exists .. She is only within bounds in remarking : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for art by the erection of these bronze photographs is to banish art farther and farther from its legitimate realm , " supposing , of course , her allusion is to the ordinary run of our portrait statues , not to such works as the " Lincoln " and " Sherman " by St. Gaudens . The demand just now is ' almost exclusively for portraits , and our sculpture for public places is almost as completely mortuary sculpture as that for our cemeteries . We do not use sculpture readily in our houses and without , in our gardens and parks , along our bridges and boulevards . Yet sculpture is essentially a manly art , and we Americans like to fancy ourselves a manly nation . We do not encourage our sculptors properly and we lack examples of the finest works of the past . The former neglect may be gradually removed by the efforts of the National Sculpture Society ; the latter should be more or less overcome , in New-York at least , by the sculptural section of the Metropolitan Museum . For some years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although all its contents are not yet placed , there is much to_the at is worth examination already ? arranged . It is particularly rich in ideal , imaginative works . The Willard collection offers to students of sculpture a very wide range of fac similes taken from the greatest pieces of antiquity and the Middle Ages ; it deserves to be visited more by connoisseurs and studied more by sculptors than it is . When all the pieces are shown , it will be the fullest , finest gathering on this side of the Atlantic . By the time that happens , let us hope , the museum will have seen fit to print thorough and cheap handbooks for the guidance of visitors , so that they can follow the sculpture.of any age by names of workmen and by dates , and occasionally by " schools " of sculpture . Another thing greatly to be desired is the presence in the museum of good , large photographs of the sculptures and other objects , to be had at cost price . In ' this feature most European museums are defective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to take advantage of the cheapness of photographs . These aids to information and helps to - memory will do much for a spread of the taste for sculpture and hasten the day when it will be impossible for societies , clubs , Park Commissioners , and town officials to accept statuary that is really mean , meaningless , or grotesque .
