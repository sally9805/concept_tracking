txt There is evidently need of the diffusion of elementary knowledge among many depositors in savings banks . Many of these depositors are , of course , illiterate , and while they are among the last to be reached by a financial " scare , " it abides with them , when it has once been reached , with a corresponding tenacity . The conduct of better-educated men of business in times of panic is not always judicious or commendable . In fact , the philosopher might draw from the experience of Wall Street quite as striking illustrations of the sheeplike traits of humanity as he could draw from the runs of depositors on savings banks . A panic , by the force of the term , is a state in which large numbers of persons are bereft of the use of reason . The difference may be that the stock broker or the merchant , when he is not bereft of his reason , understands that to force his debtor to sell out on a low market is to incur the risk of losing his debt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ignorant is not aware at any time of this important fact . The little runs that have already concurred on some of the savings banks are not formidable or threatening . nor likely to become so . It is rather noteworthy that , such as they are , they have been produced by a measure of precaution which the savings banks have taken in the interest of the depositors . The course of the money market is known to the managers of the savings banks , but not to the depositors , and it was from considering the course of the money market that the managers were led to reflect how grievous would be the loss if they were compelled to realize upon their securities in such a market . Accordingly , some of them protected themselves and their depositors by availing themselves of the provision entitling them to require a long notice for the withdrawal of deposits . This notice , proper and necessary as it was , was probably the first notice that the depositors of the class who made the little runs had that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Miller 's Frenchman : " If you got my money , I do n't want him ; if you do n't got him , I must have him . " Against this temper of mind the power of requiring a notice for the withdrawal of deposits is an effective security , and , although the use of the power may itself precipitate the distrust of which it is intended to avert the consequences , it has in the present instance been prudently and properly used . It is noteworthy that the depositors mainly demanded paper currency instead of gold . It has commonly been the custom of people who were frightened about their deposits to insist upon gold , and , having got the gold , to secrete it in their private receptacles . That people who would not trust the savings banks should be willing to trust the national banks shows how complete is the confidence of the frightened depositors in the paper currency , and . how remote they are from the sphere in which discussions go on about the " basis of currency .
