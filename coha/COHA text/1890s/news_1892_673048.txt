txt Attention has already been caned by Tun TimEs to the methods of the Harrison Administration in inviting proposals for supplies for the Government . It has been asserted that the thousands of dollars spent each year by the different departments in advertising for proposals yields inadequate returns . Any one of a business turn who will take the trouble to investigate the subject will speedily discover that the so-called economy which is practiced in calling for supplies is of the blindest sort . THE TIMES has shown that in the invitations for bids , which are issued at short intervals by the various departments , full lists of the articles required are not given . Those responsible for the system say that brevity in this connection means the saving of much money . It is true that very often there are hundreds of articles included in the proposals , and It would be costly and inconvenient to enumerate them in the invitations . The classes , however , ( mind be mentioned . Instead , the merest reference is made to the kind of supplies required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are furnished upon application . Right here is where brevity operates to increase the cost of the supplies . The proposals for bids average about 200 words each . They are printed in newspapers designated by the Secretary of the Navy . Although Solna Democratic Journals get the benefit of these advertisements , most of them are bestowed upon papers favorable to the Administration . Not over twenty words of each advertisement are devoted to specifying the supplies wanted . The heading is almost invariably misleading . Here is a sample proposal issued by the Navy Department : AVAL SUPPLIES FOR THE NEW . 1 York Navy Yard. ? Ang . 29. ** proposals , indorsed " Proposals for Naval Supplies for the New-York Navy Yard , to be opened Sept. 20 , 1092 , " will be received at the Bureau of supplies and Accounts . Navy Department , Washington . D. C. , until 12 u-clock noon Sept. 20. 1892 , and publicly opened immediately thereafter , to furnish at the New-York Navy Yard a quantity of lumber , hardware , tools , paints , boiler tubes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass the usual naval inspection . Blank proposals will be furnished upon application to the Nary Pay Oilice , New . York , or to the bur . an . The attention of manufacturers and dealers is invited .

Bi/W1.1%.7 STEI.VAHT , Paymaster General , United States Navy . The blank proposal referred to gives a minute description of the articles desired . All bidders must consult it and conform to all the requirements in order to get standing before the department . ' 1 here is no fault to be found with this requirement . But how are the manufacturers and wholesalers in the thousand and one different lines to discover from the proposals just when they should apply for the schedule Take the above sample . for instance . Would a stationer , unused to the Government 's blind way s , be apt to conclude from it that this invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a hint of stationery required . " Naval supplies " are not supposed to mean blank books , inkstands , envelopes , pencils , or Yet the schedule furnished in connection with this proposal palled for all these articles . It called for muslin , too , and yarn , alcohol , hose , and candles . All these were represented in the advertisement by " &c."; The " joker " in all the Government proposals is found in this ? &c."; Aug. 31 , In an advertisement for " naval supplies ? for the navy yard , Portsmouth , N. H. , " belting. lumber , oars , and other articles were mentioned . The irrepressible ' ? &o."; was present as usual . Doubtless many an ironmaster scanning this invitation came to the conclusion that there was no reason why he should accept it . In this Particular case , however , the " &c."; meant " charcoal and bevel iron . " When the bids were opened . Sept. 20 , it was discovered that none had been submitted covering these grades of iron . Dealers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department wanted it . Apparently the regular bidders ? of whom something will be said hereafter  --  overlooked the schedule . There is no excuse for these , for they know the queer methods of the department . Now , there is not the slightest doubt that iron of the grades described in the unpublished schedule is required . Probably it is needed immediately . How will it be secured I The purchasing officer of the Portsmouth yard will be instructed to boy it in open market . In 1891 , according to the report of the Secretary of the Navy , the purchases in open market amounted to $1,552,157.26 . The same year over $235,000 was spent in open contracts . it is not to be presumed that all these open market purchases were due to " economical brevity " in advertising . But the charcoal and bevel iron incident shows teas this alleged economy is responsible for much of this expenditure . ? Official cheating of contractors " is a term one hears in connection with these numerous open market purchases . It is not surprising that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring , which fattens upon the present system . The records of the Navy and other departments show that contracts are always awarded to the lowest bidders . There seems to be no doubt that this is true . Yet a study of the lists of competitors shows that comparatively a few men secure the awards . Doe &; Co. may not get the contract to furnish copper , and still be the lowest bidder for steam pipes . Hoe &; Co. may fail to bid lowest for gasoline and yet succeed in capturing the turpentine contract . In the long run both manage to furnish immense quantities of goods to Uncle Sam , presumably at a good profit . To get on successfully with the Government in the matter of furnishing supplies , contractors must be " up with the trick , ' and it is apparent from the records that a few manage to occupy this highly-necessary vantage ground . Department officials deny , of course , that any favoritism is shown in connection with the contracts . At the ? Mee of the Paymaster General of the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shown to THE TIMEs 'S correspondent , and great stress was laid upon the alleged impossibility of making clearer announcements to contractors . At first it was denied that the system ever resulted in failure to receive bids for articles not even hinted at in the advertisements . When the charcoal iron matter was brought up and the otlioial detailed to investigate it reported that no bids had been offered , the excuse was advanced that this was the " first case " where the system had failed of perfect success . The Paymaster General asserted , with regard to the purchases in open market , that supplies were frequently needed which would not admit of the delay incident to advertising for and receiving proposals . Despite the excuses offered for the present avoidance system , it is plain that many bids are lost to the Government by reason of it , and that many dealers are debarred from competing for good contracts . If the Democratic House should investigate this subject , it would undoubtedly recommend that businesslike methods take the place of those now in vogue . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals would go far toward doing away with the present injustice .
