txt The Daily Chronicle , taking it for granted that there is some truth in the reports of a new European concert for coercion , devotes an editorial to urging England not to join . It says : " Our concern is to see that England is not once more dragged at the heels of despots and made to play the game of the latest of the rotten tyrannies that incumber the earth . We have good reason to state that there are strong friends of America in the present Government , and we hope Lord Salisbury is one of them ; but it is important that the feeling of the country should be adequately represented both in London and in Washington . " It was nut easy to coerce Greece ; but America stands in a different category . She is a very great power , intensely proud , and entirely self-contained . Her fate has been to undertake a task peculiarly arduous and thankless . Sne is not going to be bullied by the heroes of the Cretan blockade , and if the movement against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own interests , to clear the situation . " Our present purpose is to insist that our Government does best by using every means in its power to defeat any anti-American combination . If there be any doubt about the feelings of the great majority of the nation , we shall be happy to try the experiment of marching a hundred thousand Londoners through the metropolis with the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes in combination . It is the business of the mother country to stand by her children of the West as stiffly and strongly as one country can by another . " The Daily Chronicle also ridicules The Saturday Review , which asks , " Where are the American officers for an army to march through Cuba ? " It says it is not aware that the United States intends to do anything of that sort , but " if it does its trouble will be chiefly one of selection from a vast number of highly trained men from the West Point Academy . " The Times , which attaches no importance to the rumors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " England would assuredly be no party to such a demonstration , but it is even more absurd to suggest that because Englknd sympathizes with American indignation at Cuban horrors . the British Government ought to rush into armed alliance with the United States for a settlement of a question in which we have no immediate concern . " It is another instance of the the hair-brained foils ' which endeavored to involve us in a war on behalf of Greece . The Americans would rightly regard an offer of such assistance as an intrusion and an insult . But it is to be added that , though we can not condone the errors of Spain , we feel very keenly that she is paying a heavy penalty in the form most painful to a high-spirited nation ; and , for any reason short of such urgent considerations as are most unlikely to arise , we should be unwilling to go out of our way to throw our forces into the balance again an old ally . " The editorials generally dismiss the rumors as to the intervention of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong language . and other papers In milder terms censure making the Maine disaster a pretext for war . The Graphic says : " Such a war would be one of revenge . which would certainly find no sympathy in Europe . "
