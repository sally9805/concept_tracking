txt The Assembly Judiciary Committee has reported favorably the bill of Mr. HENRY CATtY SANGER " or the suppression of corrupt practices in elections . It is a very good measure so far as it goes . Its object is to turn the light of publicity on all expenditures for political purposes , and that is an excellent object . The weakness in the bill is in the means provided to secure its object ; these seem inadequate . The bill requires every " political committee in any campaign " to have a Treasurer , who shall keep a detailed account of all money received or promised and how it is paid out , promised , or otherwise disposed of . Every person not a member of such a committee who receives or disburses money exceeding $ : ; ( .1 is to be deemed a " committee " anti subject to the law . Any member of the committee who receives or disburses money must account for it in detail to the Treasurer , or tile a separate account . Provision is made for vouchers , Sic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public officers . If all this could bc. secured with entire certainty and regularity in every election , the law would go a good way toward putting a stop to the various and numerous forms of bribery now notoriously practiced in canvasses for election and also for nomination . The bill proposes to secure its object by making every violation of its provisions a misdemeanor . We do not believe that much can be done in this way . The deterrent force of such risk as may actually he incurred of prosecution and conviction by the ordinary agencies of the law will , we fear , be slight . There is not sufficient motive force in the average District Attorney 's office to set the machinery at work and to keep it at work until offenders are brought to trial , convicted , sentenced , and punished . It is probable that with real zeal and energy the task would not be an easy one , for the offenses are not readily proved by such evidence as the law requires . But what reason have we to think that real zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Atorneys are themselves indebted to the present system , more or less corrupt , for their places , and have usually reached them by a pretty long course of politics , in which they have felt themselves obliged habitually to do the very things that they will be called upon under the law to get punished . They have very little to fear from neglecting their duty . They have not much to hope for by performing it . They are not likely to bestir themselves very much in regard to it . Possibly , if the candidates for an office could be held to account , and violation of the law could be made a ground for depriving a successful candidate of his place and giving it to the one having the next smaller number of votes , a sufficient motive for the enforcement of the law could be provided . There are difficulties in the way of such a law , and it is not certain that it would not conflict with the Constitution of the State . But we are quite sure that unless some such motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in a few unusual cases , would remain a dead letter . To A great extent the suppression of corrupt practices in elections must be brought about by the action of public opinion , and as yet we do not see the proof that public opinion is definite enough and strong enough to do the work . A good deal can be done by taking the minor offices out of politics . The bribery by patronage and the promise of patronage is much worse than bribery by the use of money not drawn from the public treasury , and there is probably much more of it . The steady enforcement of the provisions of the new State Constitution in this direction will do a great deal to make our elections more pure . The worst form of bribery in our politics is not the direct form in connection with elections , but that which , directly and indirectly , is used to secure nominations , to run the party machine . Here , too , the bribe , though it is sometimes money , is not in the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise of patronage : This is so far true that if we could fairly and fully take the minor offices out of politics , and . make it impossible for successful candidates to " take care of " their
