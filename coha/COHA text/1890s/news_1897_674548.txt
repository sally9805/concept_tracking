txt The Senate caucus has decided not to put the sugar bounty into the Tariff bill . It is not easy to disentangle , the various motives that have led to this course , but probably the strongest is the fear that this indefinite appropriation , tacked to a tariff that will surely fail to give enough revenue , would be a load too heavy to be undertaken without promise of more immediate party profit . Moreover , there was the certainty that the bill would be considerably delayed by the opposition to this measure and by the debate which the opposition would compel . The political force of the bounty seekers is not as yet serious . It is not likely to be , as related to the whole country . It may be that they will get control of some doubtful States and so be able - to dictate terms . But the Republican managers will not cross that bridge until they come to it . Even when they are very near it , they will temporize . The plan of taking up Senator THunsToN 'S bounty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile the action of the caucus is good evidence of one thing that the Sugar Trust is not yet ready for a. bounty ' on beet sugar . If that bounty ever comes , it will be for the real benefit of the Sugar Trust . There is a certain number of good , easy souls  --  possibly Senator THURSTON is one of them  --  who really-think that the bounty will go to the growers of sugar beets , or to refineries under their control or run in their interest . But the Trust which has managed to get all there is of advantage out of tariff legislation on sugar will . not be found napping if this new source of wealth is opened up to it . Its managers will have no objection to any aid that the farmers may be willing to give in getting the chestnuts properly roasted or , in pulling them from the coals , but the eating - will be reserved exclusively for the palate and the stomach of the Trust .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
