txt may be divided into two groups : first , those which depict manners and customs and the life of men and beasts ; second , those in which men 's thoughts and creations *dready given to the world in another form , as in literature and tradition , are taken and used as subjects by the artist . The earliest illustrations are as old as writing , and are indeed symbolic writings recording the social , religious , and political life of the people . The Egyptian and Phomician figures carved on blocks of stone , the pictures on Greek vases , and the wall-paintings at Pompeii are illustrations . All these belong in the first group . What we mean when we speak of illustrations to - day are included in the second group , and , unlike the earlier works which exist only in a single example , the artists ' designs are multiplied a thousand - fold by the various processes of reproduction . Du Halde is authority for the statement that the Chinese printed pictures from plates or blocks as early as 1120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from blocks in 1285 , the Germans making prints of saints at the beginning of the fifteenth century , and Finiguerra using copper plates in Ylorence in 1461 . The painter Botticelli gave his attention to copper-plate engraving , and others followed his example . Since the days of Albert Dfirer and the Italian Renaissance , painters have been drawing for reproduction , until at the present time half of all those who use the brush have worked more or less in the field of illustration , as we use the term , and some have made in it reputations that outshine those gained in painting pictures . We have many worthy artists who do nothing but illustrations , and who rarely paint a picture or draw in color . In the liJuited States great progress has been made in the past twelve or fifteen years . Some of the best of our painters have devoted a large part of their time to illustration , and the work done by the " illustrators "  --  the artists who work almost exclusively in black and white for the magazines and illustrated journals-has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession of a host of men and women , the gagne-pain of a number of painters , who find in it a source of income that permits them to paint pictures according to their individual tastes , without regard to the question of popularity with the public ; and the serious occupation of others who find in some work of poetry or fiction subjects with which their temperament is in sympathy , and an opportunity to make drawings that are in no sense to be confounded with what is known as " hack work , " even when it is of such excellence that it seems unjust to apply to it a name that suggests in itself a lack of true artistic interest . By William A. Coffin . // ( From a drawing by Will H. Low , to illustrate Keats 's " Lamia . " By permission of the artist and the J. B. Lippincoth Co. ) // In considering the subject of illustration we must say a word at the outset about the dictum of certain critics , who maintain that illustration , as such , is unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea or a scene is portrayed in words , " they contend , " what reason is there for another man to attempt to do it over again in another form ? If in a poem , a play , or a story , a thing is well done , the illustration will be inferior , or in a few cases , perhaps , it will be better as a work of art than the text which furnished the subject . In the first case the designer 's work is superfluous , in the second the picture will live , and the original in its literary form will be forgotten , for the world will not want both . If this is not plain , reverse the proposition and fancy a man writing a poem about a picture . What can he tell that is not already told on the canvas , and how can he express in words what the artist has only been able to convey to the senses by means of form and color ? " This is a specious argument , but it is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of the current illustration is inferior , it serves a useful purpose in the propagation of a love of art among people who would not without it see any whatever worthy of the name . Woodcuts and photo-gravures from the designs of competent artists , in the illustrated papers and magazines , are far better food for the people in homes distant from the art-centres , than the cheap chroinos and cheaper steel engravings that used to be about all there was in such houses in the way of pictures of any description . The relative merit of the illustration and its subject in literature are not in question . In our own country , at least , it is indisputable that more has been done through the medium of illustrated literature to make the masses of the people realize that there is such a thing as art , and that it is worth caring about , than in any other way . As to the best work in the field of illustration , when the artist has found in literature something that appeals to him as a subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not forced to decide which is in our opinion the better , the author 's word picture or the artist 's interpretation of it . No better ex ample of this can be found than Mr. Abbey 's delightful drawings illustrating Herrick 's poems . We shall not forget the sweet lines of Herrick because we have seen the charming pictures the artist has made to go with them , and if we remember best the poems , we shall not for that reason be blind to the beauty of the drawings . We shall have two things that please us where we had but one before . Further than this , a very large part of the world 's art is illustration . Pictures depicting religions and historical subjects , even the frescoes of the Vatican , are in one sense illustrations . All the works of art in the great galleries , in which the subjects are drawn froffi mythology and legend , are illustrations in the same way . The only essential point of difference from what we call illustrations in our time , is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects that artists have treated , from the old masters down , have been drawn from literature in one form or another , and it is only in portraits , genre , and still life , and in our modern schools of landscape painting and  |p1cm  air treatment of figures , that the subjects have been found in nature . In the United States the most serious work in illustration has been done by men already well known as painters of the figure . The two volumes of Keats 's poems , " Lamia " and " Odes and Sonnets , " with drawings by Will H. Low ; Dante Gabriel Rossetti 's " The Blessed IDamozel , " illustrated by Kenyon Cox ; and " The Rub6iy*t of Omar Khayy*m , " with decorative designs by Elihu Vedder , have contributed as much as their work in painting to the reputations of the artists . Mr. Low had already done a considerable amount of magazine and book illustration when he began , in 1885 , the series of drawings for " Lamia , " and enjoyed among his fellow-artists a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibility . The illustration of " Lamia " was a project that he conceived himself and proposed to his publishers . The idea being well received by them and the commission given , he entered upon his work with enthusiasm , and for a year and more made it his chief , almost his sole , artistic occupation . The drawings , taken to ( From // a drawing by Will H. Low in Keats 's " Odes and Sonnets . " By permission of the artist and the J. B. Lippincott Co. ) // gether , form a harmonious series that , so far as illustrating the poem go , is very satisfactory . The choice of subjects for the illustrations has been made by the artist with excellent judgment , and in his treatment of them he gives evidence of a sympathetic appreciation of the poet 's thought . There are thirty-eight drawings in the book , including titles and head and tail pieces , and the design for the cover is a charming piece of decorative work . The drawings are of unequal merit , but most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the execution . It is only in a few cases that the reproach of conventionality of treatment may justly be made . Of some of the drawings inserted in the text , it may be said that from the shape of the designs one would expect them to be treated decoratively , and not in a purely pictorial manner . The picture for the line , " And shut the chamber up , close , hush 'd and still , " for example , is a narrow band across the page and it is not composed within its limits . The right way to use such spaces is shown in such designs as " I dreamt I saw thee , robed in purple flakes , " which , with its single figure of Hermes descending through the clouds , is complete in itself ; or in " What wreath for Lamia ? what for Lycius ? what for the sage , old Apollonius ? " where it is used as simple decoration without enclosing outlines . The best composition in Mr. Low 's " Lamia " is the picture " Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are admirable in line , and the group is exceedingly well arranged and good in movement . There is a drawing in the " Odes and Sonnets " that shows Mr. Low at his very best . It is the one that accompanies the " Ode to Psyche . " The nude figure of Psyche recumbent on the grass by the brook-side , is a marvel of delicacy and grace , beautiful in line and subtly modelled , and the figure of Cupid at her side is made subordinate , without losing importance in the group , with fine artistic feeling . The landscape setting is charmingly composed , the masses of light and dark skilfully distributed , and the ensemble is effective without being forced . The dedication to the " Odes and Sonnets " is the finest decorative page in the book , and one of the best things of its kind in modern art , sharing in this distinction with Mr. Cox 's dedication in " The Blessed Damozel . " Throughout the series of drawings in this book , Mr. Low shows that he has overcome certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier work , and there is a decided gain in decorative spirit . In soundness of execution and elegance of style , these drawings rank easily with the best modern work in the field of creative illustration . Mr. Low 's drawings for the two books were made in body-color and in monotint , of course , and are reproduced by a photographic process . Even in the very best of these processes something is lost in the reproduction , more in some drawings than in others , but always something . Taking the pictures , however , as they stand in the printed books , the artist 's chief characteristics are seen to be refinement and elegance of line in drawing the figure , a poetical feeling for landscape , and a genuine talent for composition . In his technical expression he is sometimes too mindful of detail , but he never sins in the other direction by carelessness and affectation of breadth . In such drawings as the Psyche , in the " Odes and Sonnets , " where his little faults do not exist and his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be an artist whose intention is serious and intelligent , and whose methods are direct and unaffected . Moreover , though one does not need to be a scholar to be a good painter , it is indispensable to be master of one 's subjects when one undertakes such a work as the illustration of the two books of Keats 's poems we have just been considering . A large part of it is purely creative , and it is gratifying to be able to say that , while we can praise Mr. Low 's work from the artistic standpoint , we are also able to commend his scholarship whenever it comes into question  --  and that is a matter of no small consequence where the illustration is of poems that allude to classical lore as much as do some of these beautiful lines of John Keats . " The Blessed Damozel , " by Dante Gabriel Rossetti , with drawings by Kenyon // ( From a drawing by Kenyon Cox to illustrate Rossetti 's " The Blessed Damozel . " By permissiOn of the artist and Messrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing by Kenyon Cox , to illustrate lEtossetti 's " The Blessed Damozel . " By permission of the artist and Messrs . Dodd , Mead &amp; Co. ) // Cox , appeared a year after the publication of Mr. Low 's series of drawings for " Lamia , " and though it is not our purpose to make comparisons between the two books-for comparisons in art do not prove very much-it is worth noting that Mr. Cox followed Mr. Low in taking advantage of the opportunities his subjects offered him to essay the serious treatment of the nude figure . Not very much had been accomplished in this direction in illustrative art , in the United States , up to that time , with the exception of a few of the designs in Mr. Vedcler 's " RubAiy6t of Omar Khayyam , " published in 1884 . The originals of Mr. Cox 's drawings were painted in oil in monotint , and the full page illustrations to the poem number thirteen . There are seven other drawings that may be classed as decorative , and twenty-four initial letters drawn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book Mr. Cox has attained to a very high level . Three of the drawings in particular are worthy of unqualified praise " Some of her new friends , " the beautiful group of three young women dancing on the sward ; " The stars sang in their spheres , " three nude female figures admirable in line and chaste in treatment ; and " With Love , ** in which the conception is bold and original and very ably carried out . The lastnamed drawing is well done , not only in the sense that it is good from the technical point of view , but also in the sense that such a conception as this new Eros , a pagan God of Love blessing a marriage in heaven , must needs carry in itself , in the way it is made to persuade us of the fitness of its presence , the justification on the part of the artist for its introduction . Considered as a picture without reference to the text , there would be no need of such justification ; but the drawing is an illustration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a question as this that the thought of the artist becomes of the utmost importance in dealing with it . In all of his pictures in this book , Mr. Cox has had to do with a niise-en-sc*nc that presented many difficulties in its representation . He has frankly made his heaven a place with tangible forms in architecture and landscape . He has discarded the old expedient of making clouds serve for all sorts of purposes , and gives us walls and casements , grass and trees , as we know them on earth . He has frequent occasion to introduce 1 ndscape , and he has adopted a sort of purist motive , suggestive of the early Renaissance , and which harmonizes admirably with his figures , which are not etherealized , but solid and living , depending on natural beauty for their charm , and never falling into quaintness or weirdness through fancied idealization . His use of landscape in these pictures is especially good in the drawing , " We two will lie i ' the shadow , " where the carefully drawn foliage of spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream winding through it , form a delightful setting for the group of two figures in the foreground . One of the finest of all the designs in the book is the dedication , with its two figures personifying the art of painting and the art of poetry . The figure of Poetry , in classic drapery , with uplifted head and a lyre in her hands , is possibly not unlike something we have seen before , but the nude figure of Painting , a fine , ample type of woman with a wealth of hair and something typical of the splendid art of the Venetians in her face , is a real creation . The subject of the title drawing is a half-length figure of an angel drawing a bow across the strings of a violin . It is pure in line and beautiful in type . The lettering in this design also deserves commendation , and it may be said in passing , that wherever Mr. Coy , in the decorative part of his work , has had occasion to use lettering , he has adopted the elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anything resembling the fantastic characters which too many of our designers seem to fancy in some way especially fitted to decorative inscriptions . The pen drawings for initial letters are by long odds the best things of the kind that have come from the hand of an American artist . There is not space to speak of them separately , but of them all it is but just to say that they show great originality of conception , a knowledge of the principles of design that very few artists possess , and a delicate though virile sense of beauty // ( From a drawing by Elilin Vedder , to illustrate the " Rub*iy*it of Omar Kheyy*tm . " By permission of the artist and Messrs . Houghton , Muffin &amp; Co. ) // in their execution . One which is intended to illustrate the lines : And the souls mounting up to God Went by her like thin flames , is quite as good in its way as anything in all modern art . Mr. Cox 's work in " The Blessed Damozel " shows him to be a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive , and founded on a thorough knowledge of construction . He has a rare talent for composition , and his work in this respect , while it does not violate sensible traditions and go to extremes in the search for novelty , is never such as to deserve the reproach of conventionality . In his treatment of the undraped figure , these drawings give proof of a right appreciation of the beauty of the nude , entirely free from the sort of vaporing refinement that the ignorant call " idealization , " and possessing true purity in vitality and naturalism . His taste is sometimes at fault from the point of view of the layman , who is not accustomed to think always of the subject as a motive primarily in the artist 's eyes to make a picture of , but to think of the subject as the whole of the picture and disregard th' technical achievement . These drawings , as well as many among the large number he has contributed to the monthly magazines and other publications , entitle him to rank among the very best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has , among other things , signed some pen drawings representing animal groups in sculpture by Baryc , that for cleverness of technique and truthful and characteristic rendering of the spirit of the originals , are surpassed by nothing that anybody has done . The illustration of the " Rub*iy*t of Omar Khayy*im " by Elihu Vedder , is conceived in quite a different way from that in which Mr. Low and Mr. Cox proceeded in the works we have just been considering . The essential point of difference is that the illustrations , with the exception of two- " The Throne of Saturn , " and " The Recording Angel " - are not separate pictures , but designs composed in connection with portions of the text , enclosed with an outline , the composition being ar ranged as a sort of decorative border . In almost all of the fifty-six illustrated pages in Mr. Vedder 's book the figure is introduced , and the drawings are in chalk , reproduced in black and white and gray , with excellent effect . The chief interest in Mr. Vedder 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is not , at least in these examples , of more than respectable quality , nor in the composition of pictures , nor iu any particular point of technical skill , but in the eminently decorative tendency of his illustrations . Even in " The Throne of Saturn , " which is a page apart from the text , the figure on the whirling globe with the encircling ring around it , is not the prime motive of the composition , but only a part of it , and the spirit of the drawing is derived from the fine arrangement of the great curving lines of the sphere and the ring . In " The Recording Angel " there is more interest in the mysterious face of the angel , perhaps , than in anything else , but it is not left to tell its own story . Hands reaching up from below to the desk before him , and a group of wings about his head and those of the two angels that appear on either side of him , are introduced in a decorative manner that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy finds enjoyment in twisting draperies , curling clouds of vapor , wreathes of vines , and curious forms of animal and vegetable matter with which he surrounds his figures . In one case it is a griffin-like monster with a woman 's head , " The Inevitable Fate , " lying upon a vast pile of skulls and bones ; again , it is a wine cup , " The Cup of Despair , " placed in the midst of a whirl of fuming vapor ; and again , the winged figure of a youth , " Love affrighted at the sight of Hell , " standing on a cloud , and a crowd of human shapes passing below him , with serpents twining about their necks . Sun , moon , and stars , men and angels , things earthly and things celestial , are brought together without coherence , apparently , but yet it is not a jumble . The artist uses whatever he finds that is weird , when weirdness is his subject , caring little for probability , and bent only on strange and quaint effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawing by Eiihu Vedder , to illustrate the " Rubsiiyftt of Omar Kh*yyf*m .

Through the cool cathedral aisles Went strains of holy music . All the throng Of those that knew him in his gentle life Knelt , lifting up their souls in prayer to God For his , gone to God 's presence. - Then the bells Clanging harmonious told the time was come To bear him to his everlasting rest . The red-coat beadles with their ringing staves Stalked solemn first ; then red-robed , chanting boys ; Then , grave and reverend , spectacled and laced , The bishop with his chapter ; following on , The faithful , holy clergy , robed in black , Save one with shaven crown and sandalled feet , Brown robe and ropen girdle , down-cast eye , And visage grim with fasting .

Glorious light Of summer noon-day streamed beneath the Christ Who sits enthroned above the headless saints Twice martyred in his service . So the dean Passed from the church he gave his life to ; turned In solemn pomp the corner of the porch ; And down the hill-side , where gray buttresses Half block the way , lacing the noon-tide sun With lines of stony shadow , passed from sights Leaving the world of men.
