txt THAT business depression exists and has existed since midsummer no one doubts . Much as we deplore this fact , the painful proof of it is manifest ; confident as we are that the worst is over and the country is now on the road to recovery , it is certainly true that a general depression , starting with stringency of money and a financial panic , has extended through all branches of business and has brought suffering and misery . It is equally true that this condition has not been limited to our country , but has been world-wide in extent , and is in part due to world-wide causes which it is quite beyond the power of legislation here , past or future , to control . The fact remains , however , that legislation can not escape its share of responsibility . Unwise laws can impair confidence , shake ci'edit and disturb industrial stability , until the people , under the stress of suffering , demand and get remedial legislation by repeal or otherwise . Political action in this country can and does to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection of business with politics is wise or proper , it is not my purpose now to discuss .

All rights reserved . // ially in late years , received prominent attention in political campaigns . Carefully , thoughtfully , the people have considered these matters in the firm belief that political action would affect their own material welfare . Since 1888 the political issues have been largely on these lines , and while other and sometimes local questions have also been considered , the attention of the country has been directed most to important matters of national and economic policy . It is not strange then that again this year the old questions should have arisen . While it is an " off year , " with only a few State elections , and those involving largely local issues , yet business depression and popular belief that its cause and remedy are to be found in legislation have brought both parties sharply to face the issue of responsibility for present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . The Democratic party is in power , but Republican laws and policy are still in force . There has not been time yet to change or repeal these with the exception of a single measure , and that one only by a special session of a Democratic Congress convened by a Democratic President . All other laws remain . The Republican policy upon tariff and finance , with this exception , is still the law of the land . Our revenue is still raised under Republican taxation , and our money spent under Republican appropriations . If mills are closed and men idle , it is well to remember that the McKinley Bill and high protection are still in full force ; if the cause of sound money is threatened , that the Sherman law has only just been repealed ; if there is an increasing deficit in the Treasury approaching fifty million dollars a year , that the Democratic party left in March , 1889 , a surplus of over one hundred millions , and that our income and expenses since have been determined by Republican laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power with no fair chance yet to make the people 's will and Democratic policy the law of the land . As measures are more important than men , so the acts and laws of a party have the larger share of responsibility for results dependent upon political control . A Democratic administration with Republican laws to enforce is not responsible for those laws , nor for their evil results , until at least it has had opportunity to change them . // No doubt a suffering people are apt to lay their ills to the party in power . It is easy to say to an idle workingman : " Your party has won a national victory , and now you are out of a job , " and to ask him to believe that the one fact has caused the other . However untrue this conclusion , it is hard to reach him , and to show him the real facts and the true causes of his idleness , especially in the haste and excitement of a short campaign . No doubt this Republican appeal to idle men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , were important factors in the recent elections , and the Democratic party had to suffer for causes it did not create and over which it had little control . Now that the election is over the people will more carefully and fairly consider the situation and measure party responsibility for it . Realizing its responsibility for present laws , the Republican party seeks to escape from it by claiming that not these laws but the fear of laws which are to be enacted has shaken confidence and brought adversity . This then is the issue-Is our admitted distress due to existing Republican legislation which the country has condemned and ordered to be repealed , or to impending Dernocratic legislation which is to carry out the people 's will ? Let us see what the situation is : We find the country suffering from a diminished revenue , increased expenditures , a reduced gold reserve and a flood of useless silver . The Republican party through its McKinley Bill declared its purpose to shut off imports and so reduce revenue . Then it set the precedent of a billiondollar Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Then for partisan purposes , and with the aid of Territories which it created States , protection and silver through the Republican party made their coalition for a double burden on the people and passed the Silver Bill against the unanimous protest of the Democratic party . Four years of reckless , extravagant legislation had to be paid for by impaired confidence , with the inevitable result of panic and distress . Although the evil of the Sherman Bill was continually becoming more clear and burdensome , its authors in their State and National conventions either openly indorsed it or uttered 110 word of protest against it , until at last a financial crisis , due principally to it , broke their silence and forced them to lend their aid in undoing their own mischief . Then they claimed that the bill was passed to prevent the free coinage of silver . But a the time of its passage the House had // already defeated free coinage , and it was known that the President would veto it . Their excuse means that over a Presidential veto a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have supported free coinage though a majority of the House had just voted the other way . The country does not credit this excuse . It believes that the Sherman Bill was passed less from a patriotic purpose to avert danger than from a political purpose to risk a danger in order to save the silver-mining States to the Republican party and to facilitate the passage of the McKinley Bill . So Republicans themselves have declared . Senator Teller , in the recent debate upon the repeal of the Sherman Bill , said : " I want to refer to the statement made by the Senator from Ohio ( Mr. Sherman ) that the Sherman law was passed to save the country from a free coinage act . The Senator from Ohio was the Chairman of the Conference Committee which framed that act ; and on the floor of the Senate , when he made the report , he stated in the most emphatic manner that the House of Representatives had determined in a very positive way that no free coinage bill could pass that body . Mr. President , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator , and trying to keep as closely within the rules of senatorial decency and courtesy as the circumstances will admit , that his present statement was an afterthought . The records will not support it . The matter was brought here in that shape for the reason that it was supposed it would quiet the agitation and would maintain intact in the Northwest the Republican column of States . We were told in plain , unmistakable language that this might be a sop to our people which would save us and save or*r political organization in that great section of the country and that we could get nothing better . I repeat , Mr. President , there was not a man in this body nor anywhere else , who gave attention to this subject , *ho did not know we had reached a point where it was absolutely impossible to pass a free coinage bill . " Another Republican , Senator Jones , of Nevada , is quoted in the Boston Daily Advertiser of September 6 , 1893 , as having said to his associates in the Conference Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I want to tell you , gentlemen , that the McKinley Bill will be over in the Senate in a very short time . If you reject our ultimatum on the silver proposition the silver men in the Senate will move the free coinage bill as an amendment to the McKinley Bill , and there are enough Democrats who will vote with us to carry it . Now after that amendment is adopted in the Senate , all the Democrats will vote against the McKinley Bill because it is aprotective measure , and the Eastern protectionists will vote against it because it contains free silver . The free silver Republicans in the Senate will be the only men who will vote for it ; and being protectionists they will be the only consistent men in the Senate , being for protection and for the // free coinage of silver . ' When I got through they were listening to me , and before the conference broke up the silver purchase law known as the Sherman Act was agreed to . If there are many more misrepresentations on the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1890 was agreed to and came about , I will take the floor and explain what occurred and how it came to be adopted . " And again , but a few days ago , in the closing debate on the repeal of the Sherman Bill , at least one other Republican Senator in effect repeated the charge and served notice that the coalition of silver and protection was ended because the Republican party had not kept faith with silver . It is true that neither party is united upon this question , but the difference between them is that at the critical moment the Republican party yields to financial heresy in its ranks and the Democratic party conquers it . This was strikingly shown by the Democratic administration from 1884 to 1888 . Its unflinching stand for sound money was met by the criticism and opposition of the Republican party , expressed in the Republican national convention of 1888 , later by Republican leaders , notably by Mr. McKinley , who said in his speech at Toledo , February , 1891 : " During all of his ( Cleveland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonoring one of our precious metals , one of our great produnts , discrediting silver and enhancing the price of gold . He endeavored even before his inauguration lo stop the coinage of silver dollars , and afterwards and to the end of his administration persistently used his power to that end . He was determined to contract the circulating medium and demonetize one of the coins of commerce , limit the volume of money among the people , make money scarce and therefore dear . He would have increased the value of money and diminished the value of everything else-money the master , everything else the servant . " This was followed by Republican acts in adulitting the silver Territories and in the passage of the Sherman Bill . Always the spirit of compromise was dominating that party and giving new life and vigor to its financial unsoundness . Contrast with this the action of the Democratic party not only from 1884 to 1888 , but later in meeting division within its ranks upon this question . With an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives in 189Z it fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believed by the country to be unsound and nnsafe . It faced the issue again in its national convention , and settled it not by compromise , but by argument and the triumphant assertion of a sound principle and policy ; and then , as its pledge for the future , it nominated as its candidate // TIlE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . the one man most conspicuous before the country for consistent , steadfast devotion to such policy . Again , within a few weeks , when a general demand arose for the repeal of so much of the Sherman Bill as business men believed had been the great cause of depression , and the Democratic party properly was called upon to face this responsibility , it found united action impossible and the only course open concession or a fight . It chose the latter , although the fatal spirit of compromise was in the air . Such compromise was suggested by Republican precedents , but Democratic precedents and pledges prevailed , and unconditional repeal , through a fight , obtained a great and deserved victory . Ex-Speaker Reed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President over his party . A Democratic President was indeed at the helm , but a Democratic crew was aboard the ship , and , while he " kept the rudder true , " together they sailed the ship out of financial shoals into safe waters . The President stood for right and led his party , instead of following the precedent set by his predecessor , who yielded to wrong because led by his party . Democratic State conventions have , almost without exception , declared this leadership to be the expression and enforcement of true Democratic principles . I believe that Republican action on the silver question , marked as it has been by bargains , concessions and compromises culminating in the Sherman Bill , has been the chief cause of business depression . That bill can not escape responsibility , as Republicans contend , on the ground that the panic did not come until three years after its passage . It took time for it to make its evil fully felt , and it will take time to recover from that evil now that the cause has ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing its mischievous work , heaping up silver , driving out gold and impairing the public confidence that our increasing currency could be kept at par with gold . During the *administration of President Harrison , from March , 1889 , to March , 1893 , the treasury gold , outside of the reserve of $100,000,000 , fell from $96,000,000 to $3,000,000 , while our paper currency , outside of the $346,000,000 of legal tenders , rose from $246,000,000 to $448,000,000 . The proportion of free gold to this currency fell from thirty-nine to less than one per cent . Time was constantly making matters worse . The crisis had got to come . The man // who fell from the third story window to the sidewalk declared that it was not the fall that hurt him , but bringing up so suddenly on the ground . Under the Sherman Bill the country had been steadily falling and was certain to bring up with a round turn at the end . The best proof that this was the cause of the business depression comes from business itself . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and the remedy . From boards of trade and business centres all over the country there came a unanimous demand . For what ? To let the tariff alone ? No , but to repeal the Sherman Bill . Impatient of delay , as if its very life depended upon this action , business watched the movement for repeal . Every step in that movement it felt and indicated as keenly as the barometer does a change of weather . It said emphatically through its representative boards that the one predominant cause of its trouble was the financial legislation of a Republican Congress and the one remedy was its repeal . As this remedy was delayed by weeks and months of discussion and obstruction , the business depression became more serious and so deep rooted that now the repeal itself can not produce an immediate cure . But the Republican party , anxious to escape its responsibility , insists that the crisis was due , not to its laws , but to impending Democratic laws ; that we have not been reaping the whirlwind Republicans have sown , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has thrust them from power and condemned their financial and tariff policy . Let us examine their claim . What is or was the impending Democratic legislation at the time of the crisis ? First , the repeal of the mischievous provisions of the Republican Sherman Bill . To that the Democratic party was pledged ; for that a Democratic President had called together a Democratic Congress in special session , which now has redeemed the pledge and met the responsibility that rested upon it . Undoubtedly this impending legislation was not feared as a cause of trouble , but hoped for as a necessary remedy . Next is the repeal of the McKinley Bill . It is true the Democratic party has , by the deliberate , repeated judgment of the people , been charged with this duty , which it means faithfully to meet , and so obey the people 's mandate to reduce the tariff . But we emphatically assert that the promise of such reduction has not caused present depression ; but on the contrary that the reduction , // when accomplished , will be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the Republicans tell the laborer out of work that a Democratic victory which condemned unjust taxation , and promised that the power of the people 's government would be used not for selfish interests but for the equal benefit of all ,  --  that this has brought him idleness and poverty . They neglect to tell him that he is still living under high protection and the McKinley Bill , or that after three years of trial it has failed to give him its promised benefits of work , high wages and prosperity . If called upon to meet this fact , they excuse the failure of that law by asserting in the words of Mr. Reed that " The McKinley Bill is in prison under sentence of death , " and they ask with him , " How can it help you or me ? " No doubt that is its condition . It was charged with the crime of robbery , tried before the people fairly and fully , with proof of the influences by which it was produced , its purposes and effect ,  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution . But this was last November . And even before that it had been tried and condemned . It is an old offender . It was first tried in 1890 , when the facts in the case were fresh in the public mind , and was then found guilty . True , a Republican Senate and President could for a while stay proceedings . A little time might be given it for repentance and to prepare for death . But it was in prison then and has been for three years with the condemnation of the country upon it and with the certainty that it must go . Timid manufactt'rers who really believed that their prosperity was dependent upon it ought to have been shortening sail since 1890 . Let us look a little into the past and see how far the promise or fear of tariff reduction has injured business or caused depression . There has scarcely been a year from the close of the war until 1888 when there has not been promised and impending tariff reduction . The war tariff itself was passed with the pledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue was over . Presidents Grant and Arthur and their Secretaries of the Treasury repeatedly recommended such reduction . Some measures in that direction , like the removal of the duty on hides in 1872 , were passed . Then the tariff commission of 1882 took up the subject , and after a thorough examination recommended a reduction of duties of from twenty to twenty-five per cent . ; and // later , in 1884 , the Republican party became very largely in favor of some reduction . Then followed the earnest recommendation of President Cleveland in 1887 , and the introduction of the Mills Bill . In all these years there were promise and hope of tariff reduction through both the Repnblican and Democratic parties , and though these efforts failed-some of them nnexpectedly-nowhere did the anticipation of tariff rednction canse panic or business distress . Then came the tariff reform victories of 1890 and 1892 , and not for many months after the last was there a panic or business depression . Not until our revenue fell off , and gold was exported , and the gold reserve impaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican legislation - not nntil then was confidence destroyed . After that business became stagnant and mills idle . That these were the true causes of the trouble Republicans and Protectionists have admitted . Ju a recent interview Mr. Thomas iDolan , the wellknown protectionist of Philadelphia and of its Manufacturers ' Club , said : " I believe that the depression is almost wholly due to the silver policy . If the alarm was due to the victory of the Democrats , why was it not manifested last November ? The people knew then as well as they know now that it was within the power of the new administration to repeal the tariff laws , yet no uneasiness was felt . In fact , in the woollen business everything went along swimmingly until the first of July . " The American Wool Reporter , a standard authority , corroborates this statement . It says " For those who believe the tariff has been and is the paramount factor in the present depression in the industrial and business world , it may be of interest to note that certain descriptions of wools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully one cent per pound higher in March than in January , and some wools two cents per pound higher . If the tariff was a factor it had not made itself manifest in prices during these months . As we have shown in previous issues , the goods market was in good shape , the manufacturers with large orders in hand right through the spring months . The depression is due to a lack of confidence in the stability of our currency . " And no less an authority than Senator Sherman , in the debate in the Senate on October 17 , 1893 , said : " If we would try it ( repeal of the Sherman act ) to-morrow , after all the long debate that has been had , and dispose of this question as we think best for the people of the United States , while you are assuming your responsibility , we would gladden the hearts of millions of laboring men // who are now being turned out of employment ; we would relieve the business cares of thousands of men whose whole fortunes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his product for free transportation to foreign countries now clogged for the want of money . In the present condition of affairs there is no money to buy cotton or corn and wheat for foreign consumption . Break down the harrier now maintained by the Senate of the United States , check this viper called obstruction to the will of the majority , give the Senate free power and play , and in ten days from this time the skies will brighten , business will resume its ordinary course , and the clouds that lower upon our house will be in the deep bosom of the ocean buried . " ' Let us go a step further and see what the Democratic tariff policy is , and whether it can be an injury or cause of alarm to onr industries . Its policy , as often stated , is a revenue tariff with reduction of duties to cheapen the necessaries of life , and give free raw materials to our industries . This it has declared in National and State platforms , formulated into bills and voted for in Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It means free wool , coal , iron ore and other raw materials , with fair and proper reduction on finished products . It is something in favor of such a policy that since 1890 it has , after thorough consideration , been twice indorsed by a large majority of our people ; that great manufacturing States like New York , New Jersey and Connecticut have constantly supported it , and even Massachusetts voted for it in 1890 ; that it has been the policy of our nation through most of its life ; that , after thorough trial of the low tariff of 1846 , manufacturing New England joined with the rest of the country in demanding the lower tariff of 1857 , and under these low tariffs many of our great manufacturing cities were founded , and their industries established and prospered . Can such a policy now , after a generation more of active industrial life , with our industries older , with our labor more efficient , with our progress in inventions and greater aptitude for manufacturing , can it , with its assured benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let us consider some pertinent facts upon this point gathered from the industries themselves , and , first , a bit of evidence from New England . In February , 1889 , its iron and steel industries prepared a statement and petition , setting forth their condition and asking Congress for free coal , iron ore and reduced duties on pig and scrap iron . That statement declared that the tendency of these duties had been " to wipe out the iron and steel indus // tries , large and small , of New England . " It gives the facts to support this claim . Again , it says " It is then clearly the duty on coal and crude iron that is strangling in New England one of the largest of all the wonderful industries of our modern days . " It adds : " There is no necessity for letting it die ; that it is only the existing duties on coal , ore and crude iron that are strangling it ; and that the abolition of those duties will not only keep it alive , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This statement and petition were signed by 598 iron and steel industries of New England , including almost without exception every one of importance , and by men of both political parties , including the then Republican Governor of Massachusetts . Certainly to that industry there is hope of new life and growth when a Democratic tariff bill takes the place of the McKinley law . Turn next to the woollen industry . The burden to-day of a duty upon wool is clearly shown by the fact that this industry asks and gets an additional duty on its finished products called compensatory , because given to offset this burden . The industry itself asked Congress in 1866 for free wool , and said that with it a duty of twenty-five per cent . on its finished products was sufficient , and recently over 700 woollen manufacturers and dealers , including some of the largest in the country , have again asked for this benefit . They have no fear that free wool , which in all other civilized countries has been a help to this industry , will here work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic party has twice formulated its policy into bills which gave free wool , still leaving a duty on its product larger than the labor cost of the product and much larger than the twenty-five per cent . asked by the woollen industry in 1866 . Turn next to the boot and shoe and leather industries . What better proof could be given of the benefit of the Democratic policy of free raw materials than the growth and prosperity of those industries after the duty on hides was removed in 1872 , and their unanimous protest against the proposition to reimpose that duty by the McKinley Bill ? With their principal raw material free , they export annually over thirteen million dollars worth of goods , competing in the markets of the world with the labor of the world . Mr.* McKinley said there was no reason for a duty on wool which did not equally apply to hides . He was right , but he did not put back the duty against this protest . The Democratic // party says that every reason which made hides free demands that wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief . The great advantage of free silk to the silk industry , of free rags to the paper industry , of free hides to the boot and shoe and leather iudustries , can and ought to be extended to other industries as a benefit not only to all the people as consumers , but to the industries themselves , giving them a larger market here and a better chance to send their products into foreign markets . This is the policy of the Democratic party as declared in its platforms , formulated in its measures and supported by its votes . It advocates a revenue tariff , remembering that revenue has been the basis of every tariff , even our war tariff , until 1888 , when another principle , controlling the Republican party , supplanted it and found expression in the McKinley Bill . It believes that a tariff , which gives free raw materials and cheaper necessaries of life and which is required to raise a revenue of nearly two hundred million dollars , is a conservative measure , and a benefit to industries as well as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has for its purpose and result taking from one to give to another , or burdening all to enrich the few . It opposes the principle of the McKinley Bill that taxation can be laid not for revenue , a public purpose , but solely for private interests , to kill competition , encourage trusts and cut off revenue . The country **30;392;TOOLONG in 1890 and 1892 that the Democratic policy was right in principle and would be beneficial in its results . It is hardly conceivable that its mature judgment , twice expressed , was wholly wrong . It certainly is no proof of this that a great business depression has come under another tariff policy , which by the same judgment the country condemned and ordered to be repealed.
