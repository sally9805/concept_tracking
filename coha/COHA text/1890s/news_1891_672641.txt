txt The Liberal press ridicule the reception of Canada 's Treaty Commissioners by hir . Blaine and intimate that they were snubbed . It is pointed out that the last election campaign was one long series of bitter and unworthy attacks upon the people and institutions of the United States by Canadian Tories ; that their flag was held up to contempt and their President and leading statesmen caricatured on bill boards ; and this it is hinted . is the reason Sir John Macdonald 's treaty Commissioners were given sunken unsatisfactory reception at Washington Monday . The result of their mission to the American capital is looked upon as a poor redemption of boas/u1 promise by Sir John Macdonald about reciprocity on the dissolution of Parliament . Those who were persuaded to vote to return his Government on the understanding that a reciprocity treaty would be sure , now begin to see they were hoodwinked and understand the Canadian Government is powerless to negotiate a treaty on its own account . The Liberals are by no means dissatisfied at the fruitlessness of the Commissioners ' trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial . reciprocity. and as their failure will tend to fresh complications at the opening of Parliament this month and possibly the defeat of the Government . the Liberal prospects seem , on the whole Just now , to'be remarkably- bright . The Globe says the national policy of Sir John Macdonald was introduced to force full reciprocity from the United States . For twelve years it has been thoroughly understood that upon no other basis could a treaty be negotiated , but in the face of all this the Canadian Commissioners were sent to Washington to ask for limited reciprocity with the language of denunciation still upon their lips . The result is a humiliating failure . The last hope of access to the markets of the United States through the Tory Government seems to have disappeared , and Canadians mast reap the consequences of the folly , virulence , and bungling of their rulers and of the recent indorsation of the Government which dares not move beyond the limits fixed by the restrictionists.                 @ @ @ @
