txt Mr. JOHN L. STEVENS , lately oar Minister to the Hawaiian Islands , has made au explanation to his fellow-citizens of Augusta , Me. , of his official conduct iu connection with the annexation movement . He furnishes the real explanation somewhat unconsciously by plainly showing that front first to last lie was an intense partisan of the annexation policy , and affords ground for believing the charge that he'worked zealously to promote the movement and to give it success . There is little doubt that his interest in the annexation of the islands was the animating cause of his official action throughout , and that was the chief support of those who set up the provisional Government . That Government , he says , is the best the country ever had , " administered by men of intelligence , education , and character , and as thoroughly American in sympathy and interest as we have at the head of any of our American States and Territories . " That Government and " those back of it " ask for annexation because they believe it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They regard Hawaii as " in reality an American colony , closely identified with American interests and governed . by American ideas . " This " rich prize , " he says , is " - freely offered us , " anti he does not , think our people and our statesmen will refuse to accept rt. , . Mr. . / . ' PVEN ? ' ? " American ideas , " of geYerninent are quite remarkable . Nobody denies that the provisional Government and " those back of it " constitute a small minority of the population of the islands , and that their policy is opposed by the large majority of the people , who , according to traditional American ideas . have a right to determine their own government . The minority may be American and may have large property and business interests , but it is not the American idea that the few with property and with control of business shall rule the majority , even though they think that it would , be best for them . A more un-American theory than that on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not matter what the native population constituting the vast majority and the original possessors of the country may desire ; their rights are not worth considering . The few with " American interests " and " American ideas " make their country " in reality an American colony , " and'are entitled to offer the " rich prize " to a foreign nation , which would be very foolish not to accept it . The doctrine strikes us as something monstrously out of harmony with genuine American ideas of government and of popular rights . Mr. STEVENO himself makes it clear that Hawaii could be governed by us only as a " colony . " He practically advocates an oligarchy , a Government by the few representing property and business interests , and in no other ' way could the country be governed under the authority of the United States . It could not be made an integral party of the Union with a popular local control . This presents the real question involved . Do we wish to seize a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and establish it as a colony to be ruled by the central authority at Washington through a small official class of Americans at Honolulu Y That is the practical question to be considered as the inevitable result of annexation .
