txt WITHIN the memory of most of us nearly every family boasted some member who was said to be a " born nurse , " who came to the fore in times of sickness , and whose labor of love was sometimes shared by a paid outsider , usually a motherly body supposed to have a great deal of experience . But that time is past , and now no one who can afford a trained nurse thinks of taking a patient through an illness without one , any more than a captain willingly takes his ship through a dangerous channel without a pilot . This means that a new trade or profession has been created for women , and it may be told once more that they owe it to one of the noblest women of her time . At the close of the Crimean War the passionate gratitude of the English people to Florence Nightingale found expression in a great public meeting , at which fifty thousand pounds was subscribed as a testimonial to her . She refused , however , to take it for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation which was quaintly termed " An Institution for the Training , Sustenance , and Protection of Nurses and Hospital Attendants , " in connection with St. Thomas 's Hospital , London ; // and thus the first English training school for nurses was started in June , 1860 . Accounts of this great reform , which spread in England from year to year , reached this country more or less vaguely , but were without result until , in 1872 , the men and women belonging to that branch of the State Charities Aid Association which visited the sick in Bellevue Hospital felt that they could not do any good or lasting work until the existing system , or want of system , should be entirely changed . The nurses were too few in number , nearly all illiterate , some immoral , and others intemperate , and had sought their places simply as a means of livelihood , and not because they had any aptitude for , or knowledge of , their profession . The members of the Bellevue Association therefore applied to the Commissioners of Charities and Correction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital , pledging themselves to pay the additional salaries and all other expenses of a better class of women and to put two more nurses in each ward . The consent of the Medical Board of the hospital , to whom the Commissioners referred this appeal , having finally been given to what many physicians considered a doubtful experiment , the Bellevue Training School for Nurses was started on May 1 , 1873 , with a superintendent and five nurses , having five wards under their care . In 1890 the school has 62 pupils and has graduated 345 , while as a direct outgrowth of that modest beginning there are three other great schools in New York alone . These are the New York City , which has 64 pupils and has graduted 263 ; the New York Hospital , with 48 pupils and 192 graduates ; and Mount Sinai , with 50 pupils and 111 graduates . There are also smaller schools in the city , but , great or small , Bellevue must always be honored as the pioneer . Her graduates are at the head of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have even gone so far afield as England , Italy , and China . The next school to be established was the New York City , which was started by the Commissioners of Charities and Correction in 1877 , and is entirely supported by the City . Until last year it was known as the Charity Hospital School , because it began there , but as it grew its work spread until the old name was misleading and had to be changed . It is now the largest and in some respects the most important of all the schools , as it nurses five different hospitals-Charity and Maternity on Blackwell 's Island , the Infants ' Hospital on Randall 's Island , Gouverneur at Gouverneur Slip , and Harlem ; at the foot of East 120th Street , the two last being accident or emergency hospitals , while at Charity the cases are largely chronic . Besides the pupils of the school , there are thirty-two permanent trained nurses at Charity and Randall 's Island , making nearly a hundred in all , for whom the superintendent is directly responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other schools in the city are supported from the funds of the hospitals which they nurse . I have said that nursing is a trade or profession , for it is really both-being a trade , in that it exacts manual skill and dexterity , and a profession because it requires mental ability , judgment , and progressive knowledge . The hospital is therefore at once a workshop and a college , with this essential difference , however , that its scholars exist because it has need of them , not they of it . So much talk has been made about nursing as a noble " vocation " that it is easy to lose sight of the fact that hospital training schools are run first of all because hospital patients must be taken care of . When Florence Nightingale led her little band of workers out of England it was not in order that women should have a new vocation , but because men were dying liI*e flies in the hospitals at Scutari , and the women who started the Bellevue School did so because they found the hospital could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the schools the nurses receive each $10 a month during the first year of their service , and $15 the second , and at the present time there is some discussion as to whether they should be paid at all , or should give their time in return for their professional training , as the house physicians do . This seems reasonable enough to // an outsider , but in the first place much of a nurse 's work is of a routine kind , repeated far oftener than is necessary for her education , and such as a doctor is rarely called upon to do , and in the second , the most desirable pupils are those who could be self-supporting outside the schools , and will not be a burden on their families while in them . In this country there is a large class of conscientious and industrious women whose education and early associations lead them to look for some higher and more thoughtful labor than household service or work in shops , who have received the good education of our common schools , and who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be trained to make the best possible nurses , and it is the unanimous opinion of the superintendents of the large schools that it would be false economy to seek to deprive such pupils of the small salary which now keeps them independent during two years of very hard work . We will suppose that a woman of this kind has decided to go into one of the large schools , and has applied to the superintendent for information . She receives in return a circular giving the rules , requirements , and course of study , and in due time finds herself with other candidates waiting for examination in the superintendent 's office . When her turn comes , and if her credentials are satisfactory , the superintendent usually talks to her a little while in order to find out what grade of nurse she is likely to make ; for candidates are admitted only on their own merits , and where there are more applicants than vacancies it is important to secure the best . A short examination in spelling , dictation , and simple arithmetic follows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed over if the candidate is evidently too nervous to do herself justice . Yarious experiments have been tried as to*Examining Boards , but the best result is always gained by choosing a good superintendent , and then leaving her free to select her own nurses , without fear or favor , from those who present themselves , as she must train , discipline , and live with them for two years , and has therefore every reason to take only those who are likely to do her credit . Apart from articles in professional journals , much that has been written about hospital life is apt to strike one familiar with it as somewhat vague and sentimental , and there may therefore be some interest in the following sketches , by pupils now in the New York City Training School . The first gives a general outline of the work . " We each begin our duty in the hospital as probationers on a month 's triaL That beginning is very new to most of us ; quite unlike anything in our previous lives . Before entering the school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar fitness for nursing , even if we did not consider ourselves born nurses . We may have made up our minds that we knew how to make a poultice , and to care for the sick by being kind to them and ventilating their rooms . We may possibly have read Miss Nightingale 's " Notes " and so are quite sure that we know something of nursing ; but that the hospital training will give us a sort of standing , and therefore it will be a desirable thing to have . As we proceed with our training we discover that we did not know how to make a poultice , nor how best to care for a sick person . Some of us , again , know nothing at all about nursing , but we are not required to know anything . A head nurse prefers to train the raw material , so to speak , in her own way . What is required is that the probationer be receptive , that she be intelligent and , above all , active ; and in case she has any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she is discriminating she will keep them to herself . We have no dreaming time ; there is no place for sentiment , and very little for sympathy in the ordinary sense of the word . Were we to sympathize with all the woes that we see we should be used up , we should die . A probationer enters the ward for the first time , and is introduced to her head nurse . She is then probably set to do some simple piece of work , such as arranging a closet or folding clothes and the like . On the next day she will have her regular duties to learn . As // the afternoon goes on she may find herself looking at the clock watching for 5.30 P.M. to come so that she may go off duty , and she has , probably , a bad headache . There is a hospital atmosphere , produced by the smell of drags and other unavoidable odors , perceptible to a fresh nose ; there are strange sights and sounds which , combined , give a sort of shock for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sleep that night , and by the end of the week she may find herself crying in bed , with pain in her feet and legs . These little ailments she keeps to herself . She is anxious to give satisfaction , and she has to do unquestioningly all that she is directed to do . A head nurse is nearly always considerate , if necessary helping her through with her work and encouraging her . Time goes on and the probationer becomes a junior , a senior , and finally a head nurse , and as we proceed with our training , each day , if we will , we can learn something ; we gain confidence in ourselves and others gain confidence in us . I suppose we are rather an ordinary class of young women . We never talk of ideals ; we may not even think of them ; perhaps we have not any . We are essentially matter of fact ; we have to deal with human beings and with facts . Our two years ' service to most of us is a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz. : the earning of money . Some one told us at our commencement that we had done well to have chosen a profession which would not go out of fashion and which could not be done by machinery . That is a good start anyway . I am speaking of us as a whole ; in the school we are told we cease to be individuals . That does not mean that we become automatic , for , I suppose there is no calling for women which needs more personality , more individuality . Whatever may have been the rush , monotony , or otherwise of our day ( and there are some days in which everything seems out of joint ) , when our time to be relieved comes , we go away from the hospital , and if we choose we need not give it another thought for the next twelve hours . Out of the hospital we have not a care , unless it is for ourselves ; we know how to appreciate our leisure ; we are cheerful and apparently happy , and sometimes frivolous ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all good nurses to be . Our training is divided into what we call " services . " We have so many months ' training in the different services . They are medical , surgical , maternity , gymucological , eye , skin and throat , and the care of infants . About six months of our time is spent on night duty , spread over the two years in periods of about six weeks ' duration . The large wards of Charity Hospital have each four nurses - two juniors , one senior , and a head nurse . In the emergency hospitals a nurse has usually the charge of a ward by herself , with a supervising nurse over all . There are also " special cases , " the patient having a room to himself , and a day and a night nurse appointed in charge . We each have our preferences and our dislikes , which are of no account as far as the distribution of the services is concerned ; it makes us something to talk of , but we are under discipline ; we go where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large ward of Charity Hospital . The probationer will have charge of one side of the ward , with the care of from ten to fifteen patients and all belonging to them . The head or senior nurse will go round with her and work in with her for the first time . She is shown how to make the beds , to change all soiled linen ; how to remove a very sick patient from one bed to another ; how to cover a patient and save her from fatigue while sitting up to have her bed made ; the best way for her to get in and out of bed ; to keep an eye on the beds that the patients are able to make themselves , and so on throughout the details of the morning 's work . The latter part of the day is taken up with waiting on the patients and keeping her side in order all the time . The probation month is especially a time of learning something new ; a good deal has to be got into that month ; afterward things come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she becomes a junior nurse and has the same kind of work for about three months . She then goes on night duty ; she is " on the landing " as we call it , that is , has charge of the two or // three of the wards opening on to that landing . The junior nurse is feeling somewhat independent and consequential by this time . She does not have to act by herself ; there is always an experienced nurse on the top floor to whom she can refer in case of emergency or otherwise . A nurse may never have been up all night in her life before , so the first night is rather exciting and anxious ; she is very wide awake until about two or three o'clock in the morning when the effort to keep awake is really painful . A night nurse does not sleep , that goes without saying , and should she doze when all is quiet she has always one ear open . Imagine a rather young nurse peering around the large ward with the aid of an antiquated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would throw all shadow and the least possible ray of light and anywhere but where it was wanted . Sometimes its miserable little light would go out and the wick have to be pricked up and relit , then it would spit and splutter as though it meant to burn well , but somehow it never would , and the gas burnt low on the landing . When I think of that lantern I can go all through my night duty over again . We have a helper to fetch and carry for us , and she can be very useful in many ways . She may be as " good as a nurse " or she may have a fancy for gossiping with her friends during the day and so prefer to sleep at night , and such a " lady " is rather a trial . The patients have a way of dying at night , in spite of the very best efforts of the nurse to keep them alive until morning . Some helpers " never could go anigh a dead body , " but they " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . " It requires considerable nerve on the part of the nurse to " lay out " a patient in the small hours of the morning ; when the wards are silent and gloomy there is something uncanny about it ; there is not much of the " beauty of death " in these cases , but we get used to it after a time . When we become more experienced we have our emergency hospital night duty . We occasionally speak of this in rather strong language ; we call it " that awful night duty , " " that dreadful night duty . " Here is where a nurse 's mettle comes in . She has long hours-fourteen , and besides the care of the patients she has the real " ward work " to get done before eight o'clock in the morning . The patients in this hospital are very sick ; there are no " chronics , " the nurse has critical cases to watch , and upon her devotion and judgment the life of the patient may depend . Here the doctors are hard worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is considerate , is very reluctant to call the doctor , and so often has an anxious time . Some of the cases that come in during the night are truly heart - rending . The burnt cases are the worst ; if they are not too badly hurt their sensibility is acute and they suffer dreadful agony . At about five o'clock the nurse begins to feel rather badly . She has to brace herself up and put on a big spurt to get through the morning 's work , and perhaps at eight o'clock she will go to bed without her breakfast . A senior nurse 's duties are somewhat different from those of the juniors . To begin with , she feels herself of some importance ; she has charge of linen closets ; she sees to the giving out of the food and gives out the medicines ; when the doctors make rounds , if there is time she accompanies the head nurse ; she makes herself acquainted with the state of the patients , and often has to be in charge of the ward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " giving out the medicines " might mean a spoonful of something in a little water . A medicine list is an appalling undertaking at first there may be thirty names on the list , some patients having as many as five or six different medicines ; in fact , it practically amounts to one-dose prescriptions . Different quantities are given-drops , drachms , ounces , and so on . With some practice and with someone to take the medicines around quickly a nurse can get through the list accurately in a remarkably short time , say fifteen to twenty minutes , but this is not often done ; we usually take our time . ( A nurse has learnt something of the properties and doses of the medicines in her class . ) When a nurse has charge of a ward , // or becomes a head nurse , any notions she may have had of her importance as a senior disappear . She feels herself responsible , and is responsible for the condition of the ward , the care of the patients , the instruction of the nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doctors rely upon her for the faithful carrying out of their orders , and altogether she needs a good deal of judgment and tact . After receiving the notes of the night nurse and seeing that all the work is going on well , the head nurse goes round , note-book in hand , and inquires into the state of each patient ; she questions them and listens to what they have to say ; she also makes her own observations . In this way the nurse becomes acquainted with her patients , while she reports everything of note to the doctors . There is an etiquette observed in the wards , but it is not very oppressive ; the nurses on duty are subordinate to the doctors for the time being , and everything goes on with order and decorum . This may sound stiff and formal , but it is not so ; it is only the fitness of things . We usually all work well together and there is seldom any friction . The patients in Charity Hospital are the very poor of the city ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they puzzle the doctors to make a diagnosis . Most of theii sickness , as we nurses know , has been brought on by over-work , poverty , drunkenness , laziness , and the like , but some are worthy and deserving persons . Often when a patient comes into the hospital she enters a moral atmosphere which is new to her . She is cleaned and made fairly comfortable ; she has to drop many of her old habits of speech , and be a decent member of the hospital for the time being . If she is not too degraded she can see what is expected of her at once . We seldom have any trouble with the patients and rarely hear an improper word . A nurse never need submit to insubordination ; on her complaint the patient is dismissed , but a very sick patient is seldom beyond endurance . They are often very witty , and if we are in the mood we can get lots of fun out of them . They are also very reli gious . They thank God for everything ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their death ; it never seems to occur to them that they might have a will of their own . In one way they have not much variety ; they usually object to soap and water . As a rule the nurses are as good to the patients as they can be . Many of them remain in the hospital for a long time , and a nurse has the opportunity of showing them small kindnesses , perhaps writing a letter or giving them a garment or a few cents to pay their car fare . In those tedious cases of phthisis where the treatment is only palliative a nurse can be much to the patient . The patients in the emergency hospitals are somewhat different ; they are mostly of the mechanic class , and usually quite sick . That means business and getting them well , and they pass on . They are not so poor ; they can even offer us money , either by way of bribe or reward . I heard of a nurse having the handsome sum of ten dollars offered to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear-rings , only the pa* tient changed his mind and would not undergo the operation . " The " helpers** spoken of in this sketch are women sentenced to the workhouse on Blackwell 's Island for terms varying from three days to six months , and for such offences as drunkenness , vagrancy , and fighting in the streets . From the workhouse they are sent to do the scrubbing , laundry work , etc. , in the institutions controlled by the Commissioners of Charities and Correction , who are obliged by law to use their labor . Most of them are the sodden , frowsy creatures who huddle into the prison van after the laconic " ten days ' of the police justice , but they are " all ages of bad eggs , " as one of them once said to me , and taken together they form a curious class . They are most punctilious in always speaking of each other as " ladies , and the much - abused word is somewhat amusing when applied to a stout virago with a variegated eye . Drunkenness , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is delicately alluded to as a " weakness " or a " failing , " and some of them seem rather // proud of the number of times they have been " sent up , " while others regard it as the inevitable . Once I had to pass a woman who was scrubbing in a doorway at Charity , and as she moved her pail I recognized her and said , " What , Mary , are you here again ? I thought you were n't coming back . " Her face fell as she answered , " Yis , m 'm , I thought so too , " and then she brightened up and said proudly , " But it was the iligantest wake you ever see. ** Some of them again are decent and quiet enough when not possessed by the devil of drink , and it often happens that one of this better class will stay on as a helper after her sentence has expired , perhaps feeling that she is protected from herself while the river is between her and her boon companions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has " gone over , " and if she comes back it is in the prison boat . Here follows the journal of an ordinary day at Charity Hospital , by one of the head-nurses : " Time : 7.30 A.M. Scene : Ward 3 , Medical . Beds all unmade , a few patients up-these have faces washed and hair combed - the majority in bed with this duty still to be performed for them . A part of the floor at the front of the ward has been scrubbed . Mary , one of my prison helpers , is washing dishes at the table , and Bridget , the other , is taking soiled clothes from a large can and sorting them for the wash . The atmosphere contains none too much oxygen ; this can be explained by saying that the night-nurse is finishing her work in one of the other wards , and the patients in her absence have taken the precaution to close all of the windows for fear of taking cold . After giving an order for the windows to be let down , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 AM . Ryan-Temperature , 1080 ; pulse , 120 ; respiration , 30 . Antifebrine , grains iii. , and other medicines given as ordered . Poultice applied last at 6 AM . Patient passed a very restless night . And so on , through the other cases in the ward . These notes are signed by the night nurse , who now comes in with the keys , looking pretty well fagged . " Good-morning ; I am sorry I have kept you waiting for the keys , but I have been so busy I could not get down sooner . Had a death in Ward 4 , as well as the one here , and a patient in Ward 6 suffering from delirium tremens , besides the ordinary work . " I now go over to where my assistants are putting on their caps and aprons and getting together the things necessary for work . Miss W. and Miss A. are here , but where is Miss H. ? Miss W. answers : " She was called up last night to go on the maternity service . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that another nurse could not be spared to-day . " Oh , dear , thirty-two patients in the ward , and five of them so helpless that they have to be fed and cared for like babies , two pneumonia cases , and the usual number of phthisical and rheumatic subjects . Well , well , grumbling wo n't do the work , so we 'll have to make the best of it . Each of my assistants , armed with a pile of clean sheets and pillow-cases , proceeds to the lower end of the ward and commences the task of getting beds made , while I go to write the list of clothes for the laundry . Bridget counts the clothes while I stand by and take down the number of each of the different articles . This done , they are tied in large bundles and sent to the wash-house . Now the medicines are to be given out . I measure and prepare them , while a convalescent patient carries them round to those in bed . My list is a long one , and it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles wiped off , and the medicine closet put in order . My next move is to take a list of medicines which need to be renewed , and leave it ready for the doctor 's signature . It is now twentyfive minutes past eight , and Miss A. and Miss W. are making as good progress as possible at their respective sides ; for it must be remembered that a nurse has often to stop what she is doing to attend to the wants of some particular patient , or to carry out an order if the time is due . // The " railroad beds " * are still unmade . Occasionally we have a convalescent patient who can do this part of the work very well . We had one in this ward last week , but alas , for the frailty of human nature , she showed a disposition to quarrel with the other patients on very small pretexts , so she was dismissed . With a rueful thought of what might have been , I go to work at the beds . A patient goes ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our might , and they are finished at ten minutes past nine . The side beds , too , are nearly finished . This part of the work necessarily takes much longer , as sick patients have to be placed in chairs and wrapped up in blankets , or , if they are too weak , lifted into other beds , so that their own can be made . My next work is to take morning temperatures ; when I have finished this I see a large tin can standing near my table . It contains crackers , butter , eggs , and sugar . These have to be put away in their proper place , and the quantity noted . Now , I must write my diet-sheet , and order the supplies necessary for to-morrow . It is twenty-five minutes past nine , the beds are all made , the stands in order , the floor swept , and the table scrubbed . The junior nurses are about through with washing faces and combing heads , and it is now high time that I should make a round of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patients ' condition to which the doctor 's attention should be called . While this has been going on the gruel and milk have been standing on the table , and the distribution of this falls to my share to-day also , as I have no senior nurse . Each bed-patient who cares for it is served with a portion on a tray ; afterward the walking patients seat themselves at the table and take theirs . Now the doctors come in to make their morning visit , the housedoctor is told of any special complaints ; he examines these patients , also any new ones who may not yet be under treatment , and leaves the new orders on my book . * A " railroad bed " is one that is unoccupled during the day , and therefore , as it were . " shunte an onl rolled out at night . They stand close together in the middle of the ward . While doing this work all morning , I have been trying to keep an eye on what my helpers are doing , and now take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ward , bath-room included . In the meantime the special diet has been divided among the patients needing it most . At eleven o'clock tonics are given out , afterward eggnogs and milk-punches are made and distributed . We now begin to breathe freely-the worst pressure is over if we get no new patients . Our hopes along that line are doomed to disappointment , for the helpers from the women 's bath-room now announce the arrival of two new patients , and Miss W. disappears to superintend their bathing . I am congratulating myself on not having a " stretcher case " at any rate , when two men come in with one . Miss A. quickly places screens round a bed , and a rubber sheet over the clean bedclothes . The woman is lifted on the bed , and her temperature , pulse , etc. , taken . Her own clothes are soon removed , and a warm sponge - bath given and hair combed . These operations have effected a wonderful change in her appearance , and she now looks a little more like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have belonged to one of the darker races of mankind . The doctor is notified that there are three new patients in the ward . It is twelve o'clock ; Miss A. and I go to dinner , and leave Miss W. to superintend the patients ' noonday meal , and give out medicines afterward . We return at one o'clock , and Miss W. goes , with the right to remain off duty till four o'clock . The ward is now to be swept again and put in order for the afternoon . This is hardly accomplished when two huge bundles of clothes are carried in , and in ten minutes time two more . These have to be sorted and counted . Before we proceed to the folding of them the afternoon milk and other extras are given out . That done and the table cleared , we fold the clothes as quickly as we can . In due time this is finished , Miss A. is making a poultice in the bath-room , and I am putting the clothes in the closet , when someone calls " Nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound comes from , and notice several patients pointing to a bed in the far corner of the ward . I hurry down and find the patient 's clothes saturated with blood  --  a hemorrhage from the lungs . Screens are immediately placed around the bed , cracked ice given , and the doctor summoned . He comes at once , the flow of blood seems to have ceased , medicine is ordered , and the doctor goes . The patient 's clothes are now changed very carefully , and she is made as comfortable as possible . The screens are just put away when another stretcher is brought in , and Miss W. , who has now returned , gives the usual treatment . It is time for the afternoon tonics , and eggnogs and punches are again distributed ; after this I take advantage of a few spare minutes to enter the names and addresses of patients in a book kept for the purpose . Discharged patients are also marked off . The patients have supper between halfpast four and five . At hall-past five Miss A. retires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being hers to rest . In the meantime the doctor has been in and left a few orders . The giving out of the evening medicines falls to me , while Miss W. attends to the patients ' needs in other ways . If I had a fourth nurse I might be relieved from duty ; but it can not be thought of now . This is the evening for carbolizing the side beds ; the helpers do this , while we follow and restore things to order . The rest of the time till hall-past seven is spent in making patients comfortable for the night , and writing down new orders and notes on the patients ' condition for the night nurse . We are quite willing to deliver her the keys when she comes in , and bid her good-night , while we go home tired enough to sleep soundly . " Charity Hospital , as I have said , has chiefly chronic cases . The work in the accident or emergency hospitals is somewhat different , as will be seen by the following notes : " Leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ride in boat and car , I reach Gouverneur Hospital . On my arrival I receive from the night nurse both a verbal and written account of all that has happened of importance during the night-arrival of new patients , serious symptoms which may have developed in certain cases , new orders which have been given by the doctor , or old ones which may have been countermanded , etc . Then begins the work of the day . The ward is thoroughly scrutinized , to discover little things which the helpers are apt to do slightingly , or not to do at all ; stands are dusted , clean covers and curtains put on , if necessary ; every patient and bed must undergo thorough inspection . Everything is done as quickly as possible , for the " visiting " may be looked for at any time after 9 A.1*r. , and it is the ambition of each nurse to have her ward spotlessly clean . I have six pneumonia cases , who are poulticed regularly every three hours ; they are also kept on milk diet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just finished putting on my last poultice when the " visiting " comes in , followed by the house surgeons , senior and junior . I accompany them to the different beds , ready to receive all orders , and impart any information which may be required of me . During the rounds of the physicians , an ambulance call is given ; in due time the man is carried in on a stretcher ; I rush to prepare a bed , which consists in turning down the covers , and protecting the whole with a rubber sheet ; with the assistance of one of the helpers the patient is placed in bed . It proves to be a poisoning case . As quick as possible I get ready pitchers of tepid water , a pail , and a stomach-pump . The doctor then begins his operations , and I stand near to assist him . If the patient is very weak , I administer stimulants hypodermically ; an emetic is given . Fortunately , the case has been attended to in time , and is soon out of all immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought in with hand and wrist literally pulverized ; the poor little fellow 's cries are heartrending ; an ana*sthetic is administered , I carefully sponge the blood away from the injured parts , get ready the different solutions , gauzes , // bandages , splints , etc. , and stand near to assist in any way that I can . ( I Look care of the little boy for six weeks after that , and he was sent home cured , having lost but two fingers . ) Standing by , awaiting his turn , is a stonecutter . He must have taken his thumb for a stone , for he has simply hammered it off . The compression of his lips and the pallor of his face give evidence of the pain he is suffering . A thin piece of skin on one side keeps the thumb from being entirely severed from the hand ; the doctor replaces it and sews it on , but eventually , to save the hand , it had to be amputated . Fortunately there are no more accident cases on hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other patients . I give out the three-hour medicines , renew my poultices , and take the temperature , pulse , and respiration of a patient who came in about an hour ago ; but , finding his temperature normal , I let him remain seated until the doctor comes in . After dinner I give out the noon medicines , examine the beds of the helpless patients , and find out from them if there is anything I can do to add to their comfort . After attending to their wants , and performing numberless duties which it would be impossible to relate , I finally feel satisfied that every patient has been made comfortable ; then I tear up bandages , which are given to the convalescent patients to roll ; prepare solutions and different kinds of gauzes to be used during operations ; in the meantime keeping a watchful eye on all around , so that no patient shall suffer from want of attention . About 4 P.M. I have to take the temperature , pulse , and respiration of each patient , which , in a ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . After the temperatures are taken , I see that each patient has his supper , then write an account of all the orders I have received , which are to be continued during the night , renew the poultices , give out the medicines , see that the ward is in perfect order , and am relieved at 6 P.M. by the night nurse . " The following is an account of the routine of a night at Gouverneur Hospital : " The night nurse of Gouverneur does not often arise with bright face and laughing eye , feeling as fresh and happy as a lark , at half-past four in the afternoon of a hot July day , but she scrambles out of bed and dons the " stripes " * as quickly as possible , that she may not be late for the dinner at five o'clock . At six we get to the wards to relieve the day nurses from duty , and are often greeted with , " Well , I think you will have rather a hard night . " As I look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sunstroke case , with a temperature of 1O5* , and the orders are to keep ice-bags on head and abdomen , give ice-baths , and take temperature every fifteen minutes until the temperature falls below 1O2* . The child in the corner has pneumonia and has on a jacket poultice of linseed-meal , which must be changed as often as it becomes cold , and the child watched very closely . The delirious patient in the other corner is to have an ice-cap on his head , which must be kept well filled with cracked ice . He has a fracture of the base of the skull , and he raves and shouts most of the night . We have two patients more than we have beds , consequently we must prepare four patients to be transferred to Bellevue , in order to have beds for the patients who will come in during the night . At nine o'clock the doctors make their rounds , and oftentimes there are dressings that the doctor has had no time to do during the day , and the nurse must always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ward . At eleven o'clock there is an ambulance call and a man is brought in with three stab wounds . He is covered with blood , hands , face , and clothing , has a long wound on the face , a deep one in the shoulder , and a small one in the abdomen . The wounds are sewed and dressings put on . These dressings are scarcely finished , when there comes another call , and the ambulance brings in this time a fine-looking young man with a deep wound in the forearm . From his nervous tremor and restlessness I conclude he has been drinking heavily , and * The uniform of the school is blue au4white striped seersucker . // this is confirmed when the house surgeon gives the order for a " half-ounce of the ID . T. mixture immediately . " His wound is dressed , and he is launched into bed and tied down . Presently he begins to see snakes and all sorts of creeping things upon his bed , and he wants to get up and eat the man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is put into handcuffs and taken to the " alcoholic cells " at Bellevue . Then things quiet down for perhaps an hour , which time must be devoted to the man with sunstroke and the child with pneumonia . These , however , have not been wholly neglected , for there was time to make a poultice for the child , and the helper has attended to the bathing of the man , whose temperature has fallen only one and one-half degree . Now it is time to begin the morning 's work of the wards , for they must be all in order for the day nurse when she comes on duty at eight o'clock . The temperature , pulse , and respiration of each patient in the wards must be taken and noted upon the chart , also any new treatment ordered during the night , and anything noteworthy in the condition of the patient . Each bed is to be made , bed-linen and patient 's clothing to be changed , if soiled , while the floors are swept and washed by the helpers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , as each becomes due . Then there is the patients ' breakfast to look after , and to see that all are served who may eat the food , and that those who are on special diet may get nothing but that allowed them , whatever it may be . " It would certainly seem that these women earn ten or even fifteen dollars a month besides their board and lodging . Here is an account of a serious operation , from a nurse 's point of view . prepared , being boiled and soaked and wrapped in antiseptic towels , or kept until needed in large glass jars . The nurse is further responsible for having everything in the room which the surgeon may possibly want , such as hot water , ice , hot-water bottles , stimulants , etc. , and must be prepared for every emergency which , during the operation , may possibly arise . The patient is prepared by the nurse , who gives a full bath , braids the hair , puts on clean and suitable clothing , and arranges her on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a single blanket if necessary . Another . nurse helps the doctor give the anesthetic , and in fact , there are usually three nurses at an operation of any importance , the head-nurse being in charge and the other two her aids . She herself keeps her best eye on the operator and stands in a certain place where she can readily hand him hot towels , sponges , bowls of solution , anything he may need . The second nurse watches the supply of hot towels , solutions , sponges , hot and cold water , etc. , while the third helps the junior doctor who is etherizing the patient , and fetches and carries , i.e. , empties out water and puts it outside the door , where some patient is stationed to carry it away and fill up empty pitchers . In running an operation a nurse always aims at having it go off without a hitch , and sometimes it does , sometimes not . Occasionally an operator is unreasonable and asks for the moon , and occasionally he makes a mistake and loses his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , being blamed if they have no boiling-hot beeftea or brandy when there is no means of heating it in the room , the operation having already lasted over an hour . A doctor , if he is a gentleman , usually thanks the nurse after a long operation , and then she feels like doing anything for him . " qwq going up and down the great river . But all the evenings are not given to amusements , except during July and August . The school is divided into junior , senior , and graduating classes , and each has a " quiz " or lesson once a week , and sometimes oftener , which is usually taught by the Assistant Superintendent . A skeleton , some large colored diagrams , and a manikin who is represented as if he were skinned , which gives him an unpleasant likeness to Marsyas or St. Bartholomew , and who takes to pieces in a startling manner , are much used at these lessons , while some of the physicians and surgeons of the visiting staff give lectures to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years ' course is over , a board of physicians hold the final examination which a nurse must pass before receiving her diploma . At private nursing a woman receives from $15 to $25 a week , which would pay her well if she were always busy ; but she is subject to be overworked for some months and idle for several more , and an excellent nurse said recently that she should be satisfied to be sure of making $600 a year . There are signs that the market is beginning to be overstocked . The four large schools which I have already spoken of have already 911 graduates , and every hospital of whatever size must now have its training - school , so that each year brings a new crop of certificated nurses , more or less trained , according to their capacity and opportunities . Some of the schools announce that they have many more applicants than they can take , from which outsiders have naturally been led to conclude that pu pils would be willing to come without pay , but the superintendents , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any such move would be fatal to a really high standard . This competition between the schools has not been without good results , . in that it has stimulated the different boards in charge of them to greater efforts in the direction of comfort in the Homes , and a distinct and attractive course of instruction ; and it is to be hoped that something may be done toward shortening the long hours of work in the wards . In regard to graduates , the time has come when the profession , if it is to be such , must be protected . This can best be done by the formation of a central committee or board , which shall recognize only graduates of standard schools , shall take the testimony of their superintendents as to the fitness and trustworthiness of such graduates , and after submitting them to an examination , shall give them a degree or diploma not obtainable in any other way . The law sets the standard for physicians by recognizing only the degrees of certain colleges , which might be dif*. ficult in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate and to protect the women who have earned the best right to live by their trade . It is not enough to let the stronger crowd out the weaker , as in the case of stenographers or telegraph operators , because doctors have learnt to expect intelligent help from a trained nurse , and if she fail them in a critical case , it may mean the difference between life and death.
