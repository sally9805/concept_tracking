txt The Progressive Progressive Civil Service Reform Association , which held a meeting at Cooper Union last night , is well known to consist , intellectually , of Mr. ABRAHAM GRUBER . The proceedings of the meeting , for all practical purposes , consisted of his speech . This is the effort for which it was given out some months ago that the orator was making strenuous and statistical preparation . We fail to find much evidence of his labors in the address itself . It is fairly readable , though not so readable as it would be if its author has not abandoned the congenial field of low comedy for the arduous steeps ' of statesmanship . And it is worth reading , because it is a kind of official manifesto of those who are trying to undo the work which has been doing in the local , State , and National spheres and to bring back the system under which the spoils of office were the nourishment of party organization . They are undoubtedly very much in earnest in this purpose , and the speech of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of means to ends . On the critical side Mr. GRUBER is by no means so strong as on the constructive . He does adduce instances in which the merit system , as it has been actually applied , does not seem to have worked well . There is one striking instance in which Mr. CONSTABLE , whose good faith is not disputed , attributed the fall of a building to the neglect of the Inspector , and the neglect of the Inspector to the fact that the examination he had passed did not properly test his qualities . Instances of the imperfect working of the civil service laws are valuable in stimulating improvement in administration . The production of them should be welcome and useful to those who are engaged in managing the machinery of examinations , as indicating the improvements that need to be made . But of course Mr. GRUBER . does not adduce them for the purpose of improving , but for the purpose of overthrowing , the system . What he cheerfully calls " progressive - civil service reform " is obviously and merely retrogressive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone age , sneers at " general intelligence " and " Chinese importations , " and he does not give them even a superficially fresh aspect . But he knows what he wants , and has a fairly clear notion , up to a certain point , how it is to be got . He desires a system which , as he expresses it , will " make men hustle " in political work if they desire offices and shall enable the appointing power to reward such hustling with offices . To this end he proposes that executive departments shall have their own civil service boards , that the entire eligible lists shall be open for selection to the appointing power , and that these eligible lists shall " Stand for at least two years . " Undoubtedly . if these things could be done , the connection between hustling and office holding would become as close as ever , the civil service would be degraded to the lowest level it has ever reached , and the laws which have been passed to secure it from that degradation would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to lose his clearness of vision . In the National Government the carrying out of his proposal would involve the repeal of existing laws , or the refusal of a Republican Congress to make appropriations asked for by a Republican Administration . In the State of New York the outlook is still more gloomy . For here what the blithesome GRUBER describes as " the views of an infinitesimal minority " are incorporated in the Constitution of the State . Suppose the Legislature were to enact his pleasteing scheme of a pass examination conducted by the appointing power . Does he or anybody imagine that any court Would accept such an enactment as a compliance with the Constitutional requirement that appointments and promotions in the civil service of the State , and of all the civil divisions thereof , shall be made according to merit and fitness , to be ascertained , so far as practicable , by examinations , which , so far as practicable , shall be competitive ? That is the file which GRUBER and all the other hustlers and spoilsmen are at liberty to gnaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make much impression .
