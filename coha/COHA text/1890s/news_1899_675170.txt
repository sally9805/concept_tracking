txt An interesting and apparently successful ' test was made at the Sandy Hook Proving Ground yesterday with the Gathoman safety fuse in a shell loaded with wet guncotton and fired from a gun by means of smokeless powder . The object of the test was to show that wet guncotton could be safely used in a shell fired by powder . The inventor contended that under his system a shell could be put into a gun which was overcharged so as to burst the gun without exploding the contents of the shell . An old Rodman smoothbore gun was used for the test . It was placed in a sand pit thirteen feet deep . Into it were first placed , 100 pounds of fine smokeless powder of the kind used in three-inch guns and of very speedy combustion . This was a tremendous overcharge , and designed to break the gun itself . Next the shell was put in . The shell was of phosphor-bronze , fitted with the Gathoman safety fuse , and containing eighty-two pounds of 30 per cent . wet guncotton . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five grains of fulminate of mercury . The fuse is designed to operate by the revolving motion given to a shell thrown from a rifled gun . After the gun was loaded the barrel was filled up ' to the muzzle with wet sand and sand was thrown in around it . Then a quantity of timber was placed over this and the hole was filled up with sand and sand was piled up in a mound , so as to give eighteen feet of sand over the gun . The Rodman used weighed 49,099 pounds , was 16 feet long , and its walls were 161/2 inches thick . Provision was made for exploding the charge by electricity from a distance of one mile and within view from a tower . The party retired to that distance , therefore , and the gun was fired . With the aid of glasses the effect of the discharge above the surface was observed . Sand and timbers were thrown up to a height of forty or fifty feet . The party then returned to the scene and foimd a hole'scooped out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun were found within a distance of thirty or forty feet . Some of them were pretty large . One piece was from near the muzzle , and on the smooth inner side there was a coating of phosphor bronze from the shell . Several pieces of wet guncotton were found , and also a broken pressure gauge . Beyond this the w nit of the explosion was hidden in the sand , and it is expected that it will take several days ' work excavating to discover the full effects . From what appeared it was decided that the guncotton had not been exploded . That handfuls of wet guncotton were found showed that the shell had been broken and +the contents released without combustion . That the fragment of the gun 's muzzle bore the coating of the phosphor-bronze showed that the shell had been driven forward to the muzzle , and that it had not , therefore , been exploded by concussion when the gun had been fired ; otherwise , it would have been shattered in the breach of the gun . Furthermore , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you 'd have been terrific . The noise would have been heard , the /role would have been larger , and the fragments found would have been smaller , while there would have been no wads of unburned guncotton found . The owners of the invention expect that the guncotton charge will be found mostly intact somewhere in the sand , whither it was driven with the greater part of the broken shell . If further investigation bears out the conclusions formed yesterday , the safety fuse , it was said , would accomplish very important results , as it will then be considered safe to throw the high explosive from powder guns .
