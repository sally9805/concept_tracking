txt ALTHOUGH democratic governments not only existed , but were copiously discussed by political philosophers , more than two thousand years ago , the world has as yet had very little experience of the rule of numbers as applied to large populations . Switzerland and Norway , no less than the republics of antiquity , of the middle ages , furnish data of comparatively little service to great nations like Germany and Italy , for democracy in small communities is evidently quite a different thing from what it is in large ones . France has been democratic only since 1871 , England only since the two great Franchise Extension and Redistribution Acts of 1884 and 1885 . Thus it is only in the United States that the problem of governing a great state by the vote of large masses of men has been worked out with any approach to completeness , and those who in the old world seek to forecast the course of their own popular governments must look for light beyond the Atlantic . This is especially the case as regards the organization of political parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , though Burke has some admirable reflections upon the uses and dangers of this kind of government . No one of the best-known European authorities on political science , such as Tocqueville in the last generation , or Bluntschli , Sch*rer , Bagehot and Laveleye in our own , has recognized the importance of the part which is played in large democracies by what may be called the mechanism of the parties . Party government is a species of war , conducted by ballots instead of bullets . The efficiency of the contending hosts de // pends hardly less on their discipline than on their numbers , because scattered voting is even worse than scattered firing . A small party which is cohesive and obeys its leaders will prevail in a campaign , if not in a battle , against a larger party which breaks into fractions . This has been forcibly brought home to people in England by the recent general election , in which the Tory party did not lose a single seat by internal divisions , while the two allied oppo3itions , British and Irish , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing off by rival candidacies of large groups of voters . Before proceeding to comply with the request made to me to furnish some account of party organizations of Great Britain as compared with those of the United States , it is well to account for the rudimentary character of the former . Some American readers may fancy that our British backwardness is due to a deficient interest in political strife . So far is this from being the case that there has never been a time when political interest was keener than from 1876 till now ; nor has any election since 1832 been fought with as much fierceness as that which is closing as I write ( July , 1892 ) . The causes why party organizations have been less developed in the United Kingdom may be best understood by noting what are the causes which have stimulated their creation and extension in the United States . I. In the United States the number of elections is very great , vastly exceeding that to be found in any European country . The system of urban and rural local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , requires the election of many representative bodies for areas of all sizes ; while the practice of choosing executive officers by popular vote instead of having them , as in Europe , nominated either by the central government or by the local representative council , still further increases the occasions on which the people are called upon to declare by ballot their preferences . The federal structure of the government adds another set of assemblies to those which European countries ( except federal Switzerland ) require , with another set of elections . Moreover , in America , representatives and officials are usually chosen for short periods , so that the occasions for choosing them occur very frequently . Hence the need for keeping a party together for fighting purposes is a need continuously felt , a need which not only obliges the organization to // be always " on a war footing , " but gives it that dexterity and exactness of drill which come from unintermitted practice . II . In the United States , while there are incessant elections for small areas , such as city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area is very large and the number of voters enormous-such as the elections of State officers and of congressmen . Nothing but an active and well-built organization can manipulate these huge masses , and turn them from a mob into an army . III . Over the greater part of the United States the lines of political party do not coincide with those of class distinction , or of any other kind of distinction , such as trade or religion . Party , therefore , can not avail itself of such other forms of social or economic organization as may exist , but must create fresh ones for its own purposes . Moreover a large proportion of the population is new to the country and its institutions , ignorant , migratory . It will vote wildly , or will not vote at all , unless it is seized , enlisted , drilled by the recruiting agents and inferior officers of the party machinery . Compare with these conditions those of Great Britain . In Great Britain elections are comparatively few . The only one which excites much political interest , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once in four years . Elections for city councils , county councils , and even school boards , are now beginning to be fought upon party lines , but the first was seldom a party affair till some twenty or thirty years ago , while school boards date only from 1870 , county councils from 1888 . Thus both the need for machinery to handle voters and the opportunities for working that machinery have been comparatively slender . When a parliamentary election came round , a system of committees sprang into being to meet the emergency ; but when the emergency had passed the committees were dissolved , and the organization practically went to pieces . It is not yet clear whether the interposition between parliamentary elections of the minor ones just referred to will do much to keep the party machinery in a state of constant readiness for work . In Great Britain the masses of voters to be manipulated have till recently been , on an average , small . Even now few parliamentary constituencies exceed twelve thousand voters , while many are below eight thousand , numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are not only far more settled in their dwelling-places than in America , but are grouped and organized by a variety of social , religious , and economic bonds which scarcely exist in the newer parts of the latter country . The influence of rank counts for something , that of wealth for a vast deal . Employers , if they have any tact , are often able to carry their workers with them , and may venture to appeal to , oi even put pressure on , the latter in a way which American opinion would not tolerate . So the clergy of not a few denominations interfere in politics . Those of the Established Churches of England and Scotland have been active of late years on the Tory side . English Nonconformist ministers occasionally appear on the platforms of the other party , while in Ireland the Episcopalian and Presbyterian ministers in Ulster seem at the recent election to have rivalled the Roman Catholic priests of the southern provinces in their political exertions . Thus voters can be moved in many other ways than by purely political machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the influences of land-owners and capitalits , or industrial magnates , or ecclesiastics , methods of swaying the constituencies often more effective than the regular party associations . Nor must it be forgotten that the issues upon which most of our British parliamentary contests have been fought , have been clearer and sharper issues than those raised between the two great American parties since 1868 , and have in many cases turned upon the extension of the political privileges of the masses . The people have been so excited by questions touching themselves directly , as to need the stimulus of party methods far less than has usually happened in the United States , at least since the election of 1868 . However , the most important difference between the two countries lies in this , that in Great Britain there are extremely few persons who have any direct personal interest , affecting their pocket or their status , involved in the victory or defeat of a party . Setting aside the holders of , and aspirants to , the thirty or forty places which change hands with the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite insignificant number of persons who hope for those few posts in the permanent civil service which remain within the free patronage of ministers , or who seek to become peers or baronets , there is nobody to whom it mnkes any pecuniary difference which party is in power . Hence , whoever // works for his party works disinterestedly , and can seldom afford to give more than a small part of his time to the work . We have in England no paid political workers , except the secretaries of the political associations , and they are paid just the same whether their party is in or out . How different things are in the United States , and what have been the results of the spoils system there , everybody knows . It can not be doubted that the completeness and effectiveness of the party machine there is largely due to the fact that it commands the service of so great a number of men who have a direct money interest in the success of their party . Americans who weigh the considerations , and perceive how different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be surprised to find the organization of parties in Great Britain far less perfect than in America . It is also worth remarking that although the main aim of every organization is to win elections , this aim is pursued in different ways in the United States and in Great Britain .. Jn the United States the efforts of those who work are concentrated on the selection of candidates and the getting hold of voters . In Great Britain , on the other hand , while the latter object is supremely important , the selection of candidates has not hitherto demanded great ex , ertions . Much attention has had to be given to the registration ; that is , to seeing that duly qualified voters of one*s own side are put upon the voting roll and non-qualified opponents are struck off . Probably we in Great Britain devote relatively more pains to political education , not only by distributing pamphlets and leaflets , but also by arranging meetings and lectures . In the United States the system is complete and symmetrical from top to bottom . The smallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its party meetings in which each party nominates its candidate , and has also a working committee for conducting the election . So in each voting area forming part of some larger area for which a representative or an executive officer is to be chosen , the party meeting ( primary ) sends its delegates to the Convention or meeting of persons representing the party in that larger area . This Convention nominates the party candidate and chooses the committee which is to work the election . For every electing area , except the smallest , there is a Convention , from that which nominates candidates for city office or county office up to the gigantic national conventions // which nominate the party candidates for the Presidency and VicePresidency of the United States . Everybody who sits in a Convention sits as a delegate , that is to say , he has been sent to sit there by the choice of other persons in a primary meeting or in a Convention of a lower degree . Thus the system is strictly representative . It is intended to enable the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cast , as well as the managers who are to run the election campaign . And in being representative it has two advantages . It enjoys an authority , that of the people themselves , which no self-constituted body could enjoy , and it enables the primary meeting which chooses the delegates to a Convention to instruct those delegates in favor of the person whom they are to endeavor to get selected as candidate , so as thereby to give effect to the wishes of the party as a whole . The British system , though far simpler and rougher , is harder to describe , because it varies from place to place , and is still in a fluid state . Till recently we had in Great Britain no regular local party organizations for selecting candidates or for fighting elections . Every thing was left either to the central office in London of each of the two great parties , or else to the candidates themselves . Sometimes the central office sent down a candidate , perhaps aiding him with money , to fight a borough . More frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading men , and , if he saw a fair chance of success , issued his address , hired a committee-room , got some people to act as his committee , but practically worked the election by his agent . If the constituency was a county , it was almost a matter of course that the candidate should own property in the county and reside part of the year there ; nor could any one have much chance of success unless he had been approved by the leadiug country gentlemen belonging to his own party . Some forty years ago things began to change in the boroughs , and the change has now extended even to the counties , having been greatly accelerated by the Redistribution Act of 1885 , which cut the counties up into manageable electoral divisions of ( approximately ) 8,000 to 15,000 voters each . In every borough there is now a Liberal and a Conservative ( or " Constitutional " ) Association , which is deemed to represent the party for all purposes with n the area of the constituency . To it belong the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though in practice this // is often undertaken by the agent of the sitting member on one side and of the prospective candidate on the other ; ( b ) of conducting the political education of the voters by holding meetings ; and ( c ) of selecting candidates . J do not include the work of fighting the elections , because , when the tug of war comes , the association , or rather its permanent executive committee , usually stands aside to make way for the candidate and his agent and the election committee specially formed for the occasion . As respects the selection of a parliamentary candidate , this is a matter which excites a good deal of interest when the field is vacant-i. e. , when the sitting member desires to retire , or when the candidate who fought for the defeated party at the last preceding election does not wish to try his luck again . It is unusual to reject the person actually in possession of the field from the last contest , partly because he is supposed to have an advantage in the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the place , partly because there is an unwillingness to do anything that savors of discourtesy to one who has established personal relations with the leading local men . Two instances occurred the other day which illustrate this attitude . In an important borough a sitting Tory member had displeased his party , not by his opinions , but ( it would seem ) by want of tact . In order to get rid of him the local association had to invite both the members ( it was one of our few remaining twomembered constituencies ) to retire . Both consented , whereupon the association promptly re-invited one of them whose popularity had never been questioned , leaving the other member out in the cold . In the other case a member who had sat for some fifteen years for a borough had irritated the more advanced section of his party by a backward and , as they thought , too cautious attitude . The party became split up over the question of retaining him at the general election . Few approved of his votes , but there was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the association stuck by him , though many of the rank and file fell away , and set up a Radical candidate against him . Both he and the Radical went to the poll , with the result that a Tory got in , though by a vote little more than half of that which was wasted upon the two contending Liberals . Such cases , which could scarcely occur in America , show how strong 18 the aver8ion to throw over a person who has once // obtained a hold ; and it may be said generally that the renomination of a sitting member is in nine cases out of ten a mere matter of form , and even more so among the Tories than among the Liberals . When , however , the field is clear , considerable pains are taken to get a suitable person . If there is a good local man-rich , popular , and a ready speaker-he will be preferred . If none such appears , or if he excites the jealousy of some section , then aspirants from without come down to reconnoitre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to the central office in London ( whereof more anon ) to learn there what available men the party managers have on their books . Probably two or three , possibly four or five , are invited to interview the committee or to address a meeting of the association . When the association has heard them , a vote is taken to decide who shall be adopted . So lately as fifteen years ago it was thought scarcely compatible with the dignity of a man aspiring to sit in Parliament to submit himself in this way to the judgment of the electors , instead of waiting till they had by a requisition invited him to do them the honor of representing them . But all that is changed now , and the dignity of a member of Parliament-or , at least , the old-fashioned conception of it-has vanished . The grounds on which a candidate is selected are much the same in Great Britain and in America . Local influence counts for a good deal , though probably less than two-thirds of the members of the present House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Character and talent are pretty fairly estimated ; wealth is an important factor in constituencies where subscriptions are expected or where a contest is costly . Seldom is a selection complained of as obtained by unfair means ; nor do I recollect any instance in which it was even alleged that an aspirant had used money to obtain a nomination . American readers will ask how the local party associations or their directing councils are constituted , and whether no difficulties are found in securing a fair election of delegates . British practice in these matters is so loose and unsettled that it is not easy to give a view which is at once precise and generally applicable . As a rule , however , anybody who likes can join a Conservative or Liberal Association , a small subscription being in theory expected , but in fact often dispensed with . No proof is required // that the person joining belongs to the party , beyond his own declaration . If he voted on the other side and professes to have now come ronnd , so much the better ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most regularly arranged , as in Birmingham and those constituencies which have followed the Birmingham pattern , the association is organized by wards , and in every ward a meeting is held annually of the members registered in that ward , at which delegates are chosen to the general council of the association . These meetings are usually thinly attended , and little or no controvery arises over the choice of delegates . Only in those rare cases in which there are two factions supporting the claims of two rival aspirants for the party nomination does each faction beat up its supporters and try to carry its own list of delegates . Even when this happens , one hears no suggestions of foul play . Such as it is , our local caucus machinery is free from any taint of corruption or trickery ; and the idea of having to pass statutes in order to secure the fair conduct of primaries and nominating conventions , as it has been found neces sary to do in several American States , would excite amazement in Great Britain , where all party meetings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too little importance to be worth capturing . Were security for their honest management needed , it would be found in the fact that the slightest suspicion either of bullying or of fraud would destroy the credit of the association and its nominee in the eyes of the party generally . As it is , the mass*of voters pay no great deference to the association . If a sitting member were to lose his renomination , owing to the intrigues of a rival who had won over the majority of the association 's council , he might , if popular with the party as a whole , defy the council and his rival , and he would probably get a larger number of votes at the election . But as such a split would probably involve the loss of the seat to the other party , things scarcely ever go so far . Pressure is put by the leading local men , or perhaps by the central office , upon the rivals , until some coml ) romise is arranged under which one or other aspirant retires from the field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thus constituted by a regular scheme of ward elections , but is chosen by a general meeting of the association . The strength and authority of a council , howsoever chosen , consist not in its repre // sentative character , but in the men that compose it , their zeal , their ability , their local influence , and , to some extent , their wealth also , especially in places where ( as in Lancashire ) it is the custom for the rich members of the party to subscribe towards the election expenses of a candidate . One may indeed say that all through our British system the material element prevails over the formal . It is not the rules , but the actual forces , that count . So long as a strong candidate is secured , on whom the party will unite , nobody cares much about the manner in which he has been selected . The complications that arise seldom spring from a disregard of forms , still less from tricks and devices , but from the difficulty of reconciliug the claims of various sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of opinion it is the personal jealousies of influential men that give trouble . Among the Liberals , boxvever , the working classes have sometimes been at variance with the wealthier sort , and found the latter reluctant to adopt workingmen as candidates , while occasionally the temperance men have refused to support any candidate who does not go the full length of their programme . Now , however , practically every Liberal candidate goes for restriction of the liquor traffic , and the claims of the workingmen to a substantial representation by members of their own class are generally conceded . The preceding observations refer to parliamentary candidates only . It is still harder to treat of the choice of candidates for town councils , county councils , and school boards , for our practice is still less settled . In some districts these elections have little to do with the party lines of demarcation . Candidates offer themselves for election on their personal merits and conduct , irrespective of party organizations . In other districts the organization helps the candidate , placing its rooms at his disposal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is a steadily increasing practice  --  the ward council of the party chooses the ward candidate for a town council , and if the county electoral division happens to have a party association or party council , that association or council will choose the candidate for county counsellor . In the case of towns , however , the association ( or its executive committee ) for the whole town will usually conduct the election , raising the funds and managing the canvass. // To complete the above account , it must be added that in the counties , aud especially in the agricultural county districts , as opposed to those in which there is a manufacturing or mining population , party organization is less complete than in the towns , and the influence of land owners and large employers of labor is proportionately greater . The rural districts are , in fact , much less democratized than the cities . So , too , party organizations are more perfect in England than in Scotland or Ireland . In Scotland the Liberal party has hitherto enjoyed a marked preponderance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the spirit of party , simply as party , has less power than in South Britain . It is a trifling , but significant , illustration of this difference that party colors , universal in England , are little used in Scotch elections . In Ireland , on the other hand , religion creates so strong a line of demarcation that it is hardly worth while to take trouble in building up secular party organizations . In five-sixths of the island the Home Rulers have so overwhelming a majority that they do not really require a system of local councils and committees . In the other sixth , where Roman Catholics and Protestants are pretty evenly balanced , party feeling has lately run so high , and the ministers of religion and the local leaders have been *o active , that such a system can be dispensed with . Nowhere in the United Kingdom has so large a proportion of the voters come to the polls as in these Ulster constituencies . As the account given above refers primarily to the Liberal party , it must be qualified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less frequently than among the Liberals purport to be created by the election of delegates , the so-called " Birmingham system " having been rarely adopted ; that in many county divisions no regular Conservative associations exist , and that everywhere , though more markedly in the counties than in the towns , the influence of local magnates , peers , landowners , wealthy brewers , or manufacturers is greater among the Tories than among the Liberals . This is partly because such magnates are mostly Tories , partly because the tone of the Tory party is still much less democratic . Yet the tendency is towards a popular and representative organization . Just as the Liberal party has begun to follow , though at a long distance , the American system of organization , so the Tories are followiug , with steps still slow , // yet daily quickening , the Liberal model . Wherever there is a substantial Tory party there now exists the germ of a Tory representative caucus . Rough and irregular it may be , for there is often a sort of ring of aristocratic proclivities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the ring goes through the form of obtaining the confirmation of some popular body professing to be representative of the rank and file ; and , as the influence of the latter increases , so does that of the former decrease . In cities and in thickly populated country districts the popular control is felt and the popular sentiment " placated " by the party leaders . And although the Tory party is still much more docile and more cohesive than its rival , its temper has so largely changed during the last twenty years , that in another twenty years more it may have become as democratic , both in its methods and in its programme , as the Radical party of to-day . Of the two smaller parties  --  the Irish Nationalists and the " Dissentient " or " Unionist " Liberals-it is hardly necessary to speak , for the phenomena they represent are quite exceptional , and may probably prove transitory . So far of the local party associations , councils , and committees . It remains to say a word upon those larger party organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing in Great Britain to correspond to a State Convention or to a State Executive or Campaign Committee , because we have no divisions larger than counties . Both Liberals and Tories have , however , their central offices in London , and each has a sort of confederation of the local party associations , called respectively the " National Liberal Federation " and the " National Union of Conservative Associations . " These two bodies have each of them an annual conference , held in some large town , and consisting of delegates sent up by the various local associations . They are the nearest parallel we have to the National Conventions of the United States , but are far less important , because they select no candidate , and , indeed , do no business beyond making speeches and passing resolutions embodying the platform of the party . Such resolutions derive their importance , moreover , not from being passed at these meetings , but from their acceptance by the responsible chiefs of the party : and the value of a conference lies chiefly in the enthusiasm which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it fuynishes to the parliamentary // leaders of making the acquaintance of locally influential and zealous members of the party . The central offices of the parties are charged with a general oversight of party interests , and especially with four duties , the compilation and diffusion of party literature , the raising of funds for party purposes and allotment of them to constituencies where they are needed , the sending down parliamentary orators to public meetings , and the provision of candidates to constituencies which can not find candidates for themselves . In the case of the Liberal Central Office , which is worked along with the permanent secretariate of the National Liberal Federation , this function of suggesting candidates is sparingly and cautiously exercised , with a careful regard to local susceptibilities . Where the party in a constituency has got a good local man , it is left to itself . It is only when it asks to have candidates suggested for its consideration , or when some local dissension arises which needs to be removed in the interests of party harmony , that it ventures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral authority , which it retains by showing tact and impartiality . A strange idea has got abroad , and been propagated by some who might know better , that these offices , and especially the secretariate of the National Liberal Federation , are the seats of a secret and despotic power , which holds all the local associations in thralldom , nominates its own candidates over the whole country , frames the programme of the party , and compels every candidate to swallow it ; and , to use a colloquial expression , " bosses " the party at large . No conception could be more absolutely wide of the truth . Neither candidates nor local associations are in any way dependent on or subservient to this so-called " Liberal Caucus . " The candidate has to reckon with his party in the constituency , and with them only ; the local party is master of its own organization , and that organization need have nothing to do with the central office unless it pleases . What really binds the party together is their attachment to the leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indefinable thing we call party spirit . The same remark holds generally true of the Tories also , save that the Tory party is far more influenced by its peers and other magnates . Its structure is more oligarchic , and it is , therefore , a more compact and well-drilled fighting force , in proportion to its numbers . // Both our great British parties profess to be dissatisfied with their organizations ; both exhort their followers to stricter discipline , as well as to more active cooperation in local political work . So far as party associations and clubs tend to stimulate a knowledge of politics and honest thinking about them , they do good ; and it is also a gain that when an election arrives the greatest possible number of voters should be brought to the polls . Nor does there seem to be danger that Great Britain will see , as the United States has seen , selfish rings in cities gaining the control of the party machinery and working it to their own sinister purposes , because we have a permanent civil service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is personal pecuniary interest , rather than political passion , that makes the party machine so dangerous in free governments . Nevertheless it may be doubted whether British politics will gain by that more elaborate and effective organization of party forces which has been in progress among us and seems destined to grow still further in strength . Party is , after all , only a means to an end , and must not be suffered to become an end in itself ; while the attempt to drill a party too rigidly has sometimes the effect of driving independent men out of political work altogether . There is , moreover , a sense in which it may truly be said that the more of party organization the less of the free play of public opinion . It is desirable that there should be in the conntry a large proportion of persons who , while watching politics intelligently and alive to the duty of voting at every election , are not so blindly attached either to their chiefs , or to their party traditions and prejudices , as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merits , throwing their weight on this side or on that according to the character of the leaders as well as to the nature of the issues involved . Nothing else keeps the parties in order . It is no small gain to the government of a great state that the judgment pronounced by the nation at . a general election should be a broad and decisive judgment , expressed in a strong majority for one or other policy and party . And this result is more apt to be secured when there remains a large number of those who , looking to principles and performance , refuse to be dominated by mere party machinery.
