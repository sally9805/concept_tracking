txt The hottest June 2 in the annals of the Weather Bureau was yesterday . Those who went out in the forenoon found the day such a sweltering one that most of them returned to their homes as soon as they could . By 3 o'clock , miles upon miles of up-tOwn streets were so deserted that stray policemen standing motionless in the shade seemed to be their only living occupants . A very large proportion of the inhabitants of the city must have remained indoors during the day . The following are the cases of heat prostration reported , . CASLEB. , MORRIS , eighty years old , 1,164 Broadway ; taken to New-York Hospital from residence suffering from prostration . FLOOD , THOMAS . greengrocer , 101 Greenwich Street ; prostrated and fell unconscious on the sidewalk ; taken to Hudson Street Hospital . BUCHMAN , NATHAN , of 174 Rivington Street ; prostrated at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street and Third Avenue ; taken to One Hundred and Twenty-sixth Street Police Station . where he recovered sufficiently to make his way . home . WALSH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostrated at Pier 24 East River ; taken to Bellevue . The westerly breeze which continued to Mow theouffhout the day at an average speed of twelve miles an hour had no perceptible effect in cooling the atmosphere . At 3 o'clock in the morning the temperature was 70 ? , and at 6 o'clock it fell to 76 ? , the lowest point touched by it during the day . Then the thermometer began to rise steadily , getting up to 0 ' at 9 o'clock , and 89 ? at 2 o'clock . At 4 o'clock it reached 94 ? , its maximum , and from that point fell very gradually to 84 ? , where it stood at 8 o'clock in the evening . The humidity varied between 54 per cent . and 61 per cent , during the day , the proportion of moisture inerpa ging with the risa in temperature , so that the inhabitants of the city were most uncomfortable in the afternoon . Though it was band day in Central Park . the number of persons attracted there was smaller than it ever has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats around the bandstand were moderately crowued , but the rest of the Park was comparatively deserted . Where the streams of carriages usually roll without ceasing , on the east and west drives of the Park , there was not a vehicle in sight for fully five minutes at a time . Even then , the monotony was relieved only by a Park bus , bent on keeping its schedule time . The paralyzing effect of the heat was perhaps best seen on the Boulevard , which has become the Sunday resort for thousands of bicycle riders Yesterday afternoon there was often not a single bicycle in sight . It is estimated that 30,000 persons visited the Menagerie in Central Park Decoration Day . Yesterday the whole number of visitors was set down by the Director at less than 4,000 . The trains on the elevated railway lines carried much fewer than their usual number of Sunday passengers , and some of the men who sought this mode of conveyance felt so hot that they took their coats off and placed them on the adjoining seats . Every one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women alike made abundant use of the Sunday newspapers which they carried , with the intention of cooling themselves by vigorous fanning exercise . Children between the ages of seven and fourteen appeared least affected by yesterday 's oppressive heat . Those of them who went to Central Park seemed bright and active compared with their more mature companions . Women and children were evidently clad in their lightest garments , and presented all the varieties of thin cottons and thin silks in their costumes . The crowds which surrounded every drinking fountain and the ice water carts in Central Park were eloquent tributes to the thirst-producing qualities of the day . Boys and girls , women and men , left their manners at home , as they pushed each other right and left in their efforts to secure the next cupful of water . Down in the Menagerie most of the animals seemed anything but satisfied with the four days of unceasing hot weather . The big lion lay crouched but awake , panting weariedly and looking cross , sulky , and unutterably bored . The hyenas rolled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain attempts to find cooler places in their cages . Even the camels , accustomed as their species is to the sand and heat of the desert , lay down yesterday on the shady side of their fences , and kept yawning away as if they had hopes in this manner of finding a cooler breath of air . The alligators and hippopotami were the Only creatures visible to which the day did not seem a burden . The alligators , which love to lie a-basking in the sun , with an amount of thought not usually placed to their credit , halted their bodies to their hearts ' content while they allowed the heat to run out of them by keeping their tails dipped in the water . The hippopotami  --  monsieur , madame , and baby  --  stood in the sun until they felt hot enough , then formed a solemn procession of three , always in the order named , into their tank until they felt cool , and repeated the process every half hour or so . The Gila monster , which is kept in the Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten a hard-boiled egg Saturday . The Director said he had received a letter from William O'Neil of the Standard Telephone Company , saying that hard-boiled eggs would kill the monster , though raw eggs would be excellent reeding for him . Mr. O'Neil said he had spent some time in Arizona , and had caught and killed many Gila monsters in his time . He had known of three men who had been bitten by them , of whom two died in an hour 's time , and the third had never fully recovered . Two persons suffering from sunstroke , who were brought Into St. Vincent 's Hospital Friday , have recovered , through the energetic method of treatment adopted by Dr , Murray . The first case was that of John Gerrity of 44 Clarkson Street . When brought to the hospital , he had a temperature of 110 ? , with a weak and fluctuating pulse . Dr. Murray , in addition to ice pack , bled his patient , and in three-quarters of an hour had the man 's temperature down to normal , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 107.6 ? to normal the temperature of Alexander Wunder , who works in a west-side foundry , and who was brought into the hospital shortly after Gerrity . Both patients have now quite recovered .
