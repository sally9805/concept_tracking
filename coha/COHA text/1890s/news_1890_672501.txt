txt The Pittsburg Times will publish to-morrow a dispatch from ex-Senator Lewis J. Emery , Jr. , in which he confirms the publication of the names of the gentlemen hitherto known as X , Y , and Z. The dispatch reads : " Replying to your inquiry , will say that when the testimony was furnished me directly connecting Mr. Delamater with the use of money for the suppression of the memorial and of bribery , soon afterward those giving me the information requested that their names be kept from the public until such time as prosecution was begun , when they were willing to come into court and swear to the evidence which has been given to the public , showing the direct use of money by Mr. Delamater . " Conforming to their wishes , I withheld the names of those giving the information , using instead the letters X and Y. the person represented by Z never having had personal or written communication with me on the matter . Now , in view of the fact that the press of the country has in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a duty of the first importance to the public and myself to frankly say that the names made public are those of the persons represented in my speech by the letters X , Y , and Z. I have kept faithfully their desire , an I protected by so doing my honor as a gentleman , and now can see that further attempt at concealment would only be construed and distorted into an evasion of one of the main points of my arraignment . " The names as published are : Ex-State Senator Homer J. Homes , represented by X ; ex-Repreaentative L. E. Reach , represented by V , and Robert Odell , now a newspaper reporter in Milwaukee , Wis. , represented by Z.
