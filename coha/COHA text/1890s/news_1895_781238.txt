txt The fastest single hour 's run was made on July 29 , when , from 4 to 5 P. M .. the ship ran 22.3 knots . But as the ship was speeding to the westward , the hour was consequently longer than the ordinary one , and the distance logged in that time is not a true gauge of what the ship was actually doing . The trip was devoid.of exciting incidents , and save the blowing out of a boiler tube and an unimportant accident to a drain pipe , the run , was free from mishap . The accident to the tube disabled Boiler Ft for twenty-two hours . The tube blew out at 12:10 A. M. July 27 . It was necessary to draw fires under the boiler , and it was not until the forenoon of the following day that it was connected and giving steam . A giant iceberg was sighted on the evening of July 30 . It was just dusk when the great white mass loomed up almost in the path of the cruiser .

She was delayed a few moments at Quarantine , and then went to an anchorage off Forty-eighth Street , North River . Her officers say that they saw the Augusta Victoria but once , and that was on Friday . The Hamburg vessel was then heading in for Cowes . Mr. E. L. Boas , that vessel 's agent , adds this to the history of the case : " As comparisons have been made between the trips of the United States cruiser Columbia and our steamer , Augusta Victoria , we beg to call attention to the fact that the Augusta Victoria did not sail direct from Southampton to New-York , but touched at Cherbourg , leaving the latter port July 26 at 7:10 P. M. The distance from Cherbourg to New-York is about the same as from Southampton to New-York , and , as the Augusta Victoria reached Sandy Hook today at 10:42 A. M. , her actual time of passage was 6 days 20 hours and 20 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia 's arrival was received as a surprise , as very few of the officers expected that she would be sighted before today . Acting Rear Admiral Bunce , in an interview , said : " The Columbia certainly did very well indeed , and very much better than was expected after the reports we have had from Capt . Sumner of the condition of his engineering department . If she makes this rate under a natural draught , which , 1 believe , Is what she did , or , at any rate , was ordered to do , there is no doubt but that she can do it under a forced draught twenty-four hours earlier . I am very much pleased and delighted with her . " Commander Sicard , the commandant of the yard , was not familiar with the speed records of merchant ships , and did not care to express an opinion as to the Columbia 's relative merit .

Moses ; Gunner  --  T. M. Johnson ; Carpenter  --  M. A. Mahoney . WASHINGTON , Aug. 2 . ? Acting Secretary McAdoo sent the following telegram this afternoon to Capt . Sumner of the cruiser Columbia : " The department extends to you , the officers , and men of the Columbia its congratulations and thanks upon the result of the run from the Needles to the Sandy Hook Lightship , thus making an unexampled record for a new ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy Department over the Columbia 's creditable performance , some naval officers have been unable to restrain criticism of Capt . Sumner , on the ground that he did not follow his instructions . These included a direction to run the Columbia under forced draught for the last twenty-four hours of his voyage , and his telegram to Acting Secretary McAdoo shows that he made the entire run under nat  --  ral draught . Had Capt . Sumner used fm , : ed draught , there is no doubt that he would have lowered the Columbia 's record at least two hours , but it is not likely that he failed to carry out his directions in this respect without a good and sufficient reason . Capt . Sumner will doubtless explain in his official report of the trip . There is no concealing the fact that the Columbia 's success is displeasing to a number of officers who are opposed to her type of naval vesel , and some of these , in order to provide balm for the failure of their predict'ons that the trip would show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to endeavor to excite prejudice against Capt .

The time consumed by the Columbia in her passage is given in a dispatch to Acting Secretary McAdoo from Commodore Sicard , commandant of the Brooklyn Navy Yard , as fellows : " Columbia six days twenty-three hours , and forty-nine minutes from Needles to ' Sandy Hook Lightship . " Speaking of the performance of the cruiser , Acting Secretary McAdoo said : " The department is , of course , very highly gratified , not only at the performance , but over the decision to make the test , as there were many misgivings whether the ship would be able to do herself justice as against the fast mail steamers , which are especially designed , equipped , and manned for making fast time over this particular ocean route . The department knew that the Columbia was a very fast snip , and that in a race for life she would fear no rival , but it is exceedingly gratifying at this long-run performance and showing as to her coal endurance .
