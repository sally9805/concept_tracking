txt The examination of the Sandy Hook pneumatic gun carriage the other day by a board of navy officers will doubtless determine whether the disappearing gun is suited for naval purposes . The vessel specially proposed for utilizing it is one designed by Mr. NEcoli , chief constructor for the Camars , which , while of only 1,550 tons ' displacement , would yet carry a belt of armor and the remarkable battery of four eight-inch guns . She would have 325 tons less displacement than eight of thelittle single-turret monitors and 560 tons less than the other five . The Nantucket , for example , one of the smaller vessels , has a length of 200 feet , a beam of 46 , and a mean draught of 111j , whereas the proposed craft has a length of 180 feet , a beam of 42 , and a draught of 11 . But while the single-turret monitors have only five inches of laminated iron armor on the sides , the new craft would have five inches of nickel steel . As to the vast gain in battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with only two feet freeboard , but substituting for the turret two gun pits beneath the deck . The big rifles would be above deck only when raised for firing , while protecting steel covers , rising and falling with them , would fit the apertures in the steel deck . Such a craft would certainly be a hard target to hit , and could go almost anywhere in harbor waters with its light draught . It would be a sort of floating battery , solely for port defense ; and if successful on so small a scale the plan could be applied to larger vessels with much thicker armor . The pith of the proposal is the substitution of disappearing carriages for the turret in the coast-defense monitor .
