txt Senator Burrows of Michigan was at the War Department to-day . The Senator said that he had no means of judging what would be the prevailing sentiment of the Senate as to the treaty of peace , as he had had no conversation with any of his colleagues on the ject recently . " As for myself , " he remarked , " I do n't care to go very deeply into a discussion of the subject at this time , but in general terms , I take this view of it : " We must have absolute possession of Puerto Rico and Spain must relinquish completely her sovereignty over Cuba . We should retain permanently the Island of Puerto Rico . Toward Cuba we will act in good faith and with perfect justice , giving to the people of the island a free and independent government as soon as it can be established . We must see to it that a good and stable government is established , and , of course , the future will depend upon the ability of the people of Cuba to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance and every opportunity to maintain themselves as a free and independent people . " As to the Philippines , I do not believe that we want the entire group of islands , with its several millions of semi-barbarous people . In my opinion , we should retain one entire island  --  the ? best in the whole group for our purposes  --  absolutely as our own , for a naval station and commercial base . Our ownership of the entire island should be complete , with no vestige of Spanish influence anywhere upon it . This would give us all we want for the development and protection of our commerce . The rest of the group of islands might go back to Spain or the people might be left to work out their own destiny . " The question of just how far this Government should exert itself in the matter of securing good government for the islands which we do not retain is a matter of detail for the future . The only thing that I care to say on that point is that I do n't think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islands after having taken possession of the one we want . "
