OHIO is a State of individualisms . The principle emerges in its settlement , and moves as a constant element in its history of one hundred years . Previous to the Revolutionary war no less than four distinct claims , having at least some evidence of validity , were made to that territory a part of which is now called Ohio . New York , by a grant of 1664 , claimed a part . Massachusetts also put forth claims , which were in conflict with the claim already mentioned . Virginia , by right of conquest and by act of her Legislature , annexed the territory as a county . It is also to be said that the Indians claimed the entire territory of the Northwest as their own . In addition to all these specific demands , France and England , at different times and with different degrees of force , proclaimed their ownership and exei-cised their control . This diversity of claims to original proprietorship is still further accentuated by the variety of the early settlements . In the score of years that divide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Union no less than six bodies of people established themselves in the territory . Men of Virginia , of Massachusetts , of Connecticut , of Pennsylvania , of New Jersey , and of France hither came , and here made homes . It is significant that few of these six colonies came from the States which had laid a claim to the territory in the early period . The Virginia company largely consisted of sol diers , who found in the land granted to them compensation for their services in the war . The Massachusetts men , led by Rufus Putnam , made , in 1788 , a settlement on the Ohio , at the place now known as Marietta  --  a name which these chivalric Americans composed by uniting the first syllable and the last of the name of Marie Antoinette . The Connecticut men , of the same type as the Massachusetts , settled in the noithern part of the State , on the lake , in a section which was long known as New Connecticut , and which has taken its place in history as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who entered the middle belt . The New Jersey colony , inspired to emigration by the representations of a fellowcitizen touching the fertility of the soil and other conditions of an easy existence , came into the south . The Frenchmen , some five hundred souls , left France near the breaking out of the Revolution , moved by the persuasions of Joel Barlow to inhabit a land which was to them described as " the garden of the universe , the centre of wealth , a place destined to be the heart of a great empire . " With the men of Massachusetts , and in a secondary degree with those of Connecticut , as well as with those of the Virginia colony , the motive of securing compensation for service rendered in the war had value . The Federal government owned land ; it lacked money . It had at the close of the Revolution paid off its soldiers in certifi BY PRESIDENT CHARLES F. THwING , WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY . // cates , which soon came to be greatly depreciated , a dollar having the value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to accept its own notes in payment for land . With the Pennsylvania and the New Jersey colonists and with the Frenchmen commercial motives of a more ordinary type prevailed . Few of the reasons which brought the Pilgrims from Leyden to Plymouth moved the Connecticut or other emigrants . The same motives urged people to come to Ohio a hundred years ago that were at that time moving people to go from Cape Cod to the District of Maine  --  a better living . There were few or none of those motives which Bradford , in his history , says moved the Pilgrims : the Pilgrims came to save their mother-tongue for their children , to worship God in freedom , and to establish a free commonwealth . But people came to Ohio not so much to lead a better life as to get a better living . Yet , outside of motives , there was much in common between these two emigrating bodies . The people who emigrated to Ohio came , most of them , poor in purse , like the Pilgrims ; only a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puritans who came to Massachusetts Bay . They were the first of the great emigrations into the Northwest Territory . They had , moreover , the same experiences of want and plenty , of hope abounding and of hope disappointed , which the Pilgrims had , and which , indeed , is the usual lot of pioneers . They were , both of these sets of people , first farmers , and afterwards manufacturers . Some of them breathed the same ethical and Christian atmosphere and possessed the same educational purposes which the Puritans had . They were , like the Pilgrims , of the great body of the common people . Like both Pilgrims and Puritans , they gave the names of the towns of the old home , like Keene and New Lyme , to their new dwelling-places . They were orderly men . They believed in the constituted order of human society . They were neither cranks nor bigots . They had no unreasoning enthusiasms . They came to make homes , not to establish tradingposts . The movement of five hundred Frenchmen in 1790 from their native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greater daring and of stronger emotional enthusiasm than the emigration from any New England State . It was a unique undertaking . The American spirit had touched France . French soldiers who served in the Revolution had , returning home , aroused the enthusiasm of their fellow-countrymen with pictures of the free life of the new land . It was a time of excitement in Paris and France . A sense of great events that had come or that were to come was moving among the people . " Nothing was talked of in every social circle , " says Volney , with of course some degree of exaggeration , " but the paradise that was opened for Frenchmen in the western wilderness , the free and happy life to be led on the blissful banks of the Scioto . " And they came , saw , suffered . It was about the time that Barlow was persuading the Frenchmen to come to America that Jefferson wrote from Paris to Monroe urging him to come to Paris , for " it will make you adore your own country , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , people , and manners . " Jefferson also prophesied that though many Europeans might come to America , " no man now living will ever see an instance of an American removing to settle in Europe and continuing there . " It is not unreasonable to infer that Jefferson , holding such sentiments , may have directly promoted the emigration of the Frenchmen . He returned to the United States a few months before the French colony reached the banks of the Ohio-la belle riviire . The men of Paris , on reaching the banks of the Ohio , however , did not find that the representations of Barlow and Playfair were quite true . Rice , cotton , and indigo were not products of the Ohio Valley . Frost was not unknown , and the river did freeze . Among those who came were carvers , gilders , coach and peruke makers , accustomed to the conditions of life in the gayest metropolis . They did not find the work of felling trees and of grubbing up the soil fitted to their strength or to their tastes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them remained , but the larger part of them scattered among the older States . And yet for all of them there must have been a certain sense of satisfaction filling their disappointed hearts . Some of them were Royalists . If they had remained in their own country , they might have suffered something more severe than fear of starvation and cold weather . // It was the same kind of satisfaction which the Pilgrims of Plymouth must have felt when tidings came to them in their free life of Laud and Strafford . The presence of this body of Frenchmen is still evidenced in Ohio by the names of Gallipolis and of Belpre . Weishmen are now far more numerous in Gallipolis than Frenchmen . * In general it is to be said that the earlier settlers of Ohio possessed the best blood of the parts from which they came . In their vocations they represented all the works and workers which go to make up a well-ordered and civilized society . In learning they were more of the type of the Pilgrims who came to Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is probable that in the Bay Colony in the first twenty years after its settlement were to be found as many college men as could be found in any population of a similar size anywhere , but among the Pilgrims of Plymouth Was not a single man who had taken a collegiate degree . Elder Brewster had received a part of his training at the university , but had failed to finish the course . Bat the men who came to Ohio were , like both Puritans and Pilgrims , possessed of high * The following incident may be worth preserving among the annals of the little French settlement : " Louis Philippe went down the Ohio in 1798 and stopped at Gallipolis . Years afterwards , when he occupied the throne of Fiance , a distinguished citizen of Ohio was presented at his court by the American minister . The King received Ii imvery graciously , and learning that he resided in southern Ohio , led the conversation to Gallipolis and the French settlers , and asked him if he knew a.French baker there named . The gentleman replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his surprise at finding him among his Majesty 's acquaintances . The King then spoke of his visit to Gallipolis , and said he had improved the opportunity of his stop there to have a supply of bread made for his voyage . While the bread was baking , word came that the ice was coming down the river , and that it would be necessary for his boat to start at once in order to keep ahead of it . What was to be done ? It was impossible to delay his departure , and it seemed equally hnpossible to go without the bread . In this dilemma the baker offered to go along with him , with his ovens , down the river far enough to finish the baking of the bread . He was accordingly hurried on board the boat , ovens and all , and they started ahead of the ice . When the bread was done , the baker with his ovens was put on shore , and returned to Gallipolis. " - Ohio : 1788 . Translated from the French by John Henry James . Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French from the English for the use of Barlow . This incident is taken from the notes of the Introduction . ideals of education , and were moved in sympathy with the best learning of the time . In point of social respectability they were families out of the stock which had peopled the Bay Colony and the colonies of Hartford and of New Haven . They represented officers of the Revolutionary war-men who had been accustomed to command , who were without wealth , and also free from extreme poverty . After the disintegrations and attritions of a hundred years , the conditions and the influences which many of these bodies brought are still quite intact and distinct . It is not difficult to trace through the northern part of the State the southern line of the Western Reserve purchase . The Western Reserve people are inclined to pride themselves upon the fact that evidences of thrift , economy , and energy are to be observed in their villages , churches , school - houses , and homes not found in certain parts of the territory south . A friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and across the State , tells me that a dull observer can trace with ease the southern line of the Western Reserve territory . In this territory he is in New England ; out of this territory he is out of New England . Marietta , too , and its neighborhood are still distinct and integral . The other original colonists have scattered more or less in various parts of the State - a leaven which has helped to leaven the whole lump . The noble character of the settlers gave promise of a noble character in those who might follow them . Like attracts like . The presence of the best people constrained others also of the best people , who were following the star of empire , to take up their abode with the original inhabitants . At the close of the first decade of the century not far from a quarter of a million of people , and at the close of the second decade somewhat over half a million people , had become citizens of Ohio . A few centres of large influence had been established . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tIme first capital of the State ) . Thl'oughout the State also , in small towns as well as in the larger , were people of genuine culture . Though their homes might be quite unlike Blennerhasset 's villa , yet in village and even in the lone settler 's cabin were found men and women who had " light " and whose lives were " swcetness . " I often // talk with the sons and daughters of the founders of the Western Reserve , and I constantly hear stories of the books that were read , which , though few in number , were rich in power . The memories of the noble and beautiful lives which were lived are yet green and fragrant . To Ohio also came not a few of the best people of the older States as visitors . Lafayette visited Ohio in 1825 ; and his secretary , Levasseur , says that Lafayette was simply astonished at this new creation of a commonwealth . The attentions shown him gave him delight . Ohio to him seemed " the eighth wonder of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several parts , yet at the present time Ohio is less dependent upon other commonwealths for her people than any other of the north central States . Only thirteen per cent . of the native American population were born outside of her borders . The States which have contributed the more largely to the 441,000 Americans who have moved on to and are now living on her soil are-Pennsylvania , with 121,000 ; New York , with 57,000 ; Virginia , with 41,000 ; Kentucky , with 38,000 ; and Indiana , with 35,000 . The Connecticut and Massachusetts immigration continues ; for 9000 persons born in Massachusetts and 6000 born in Connecticut are among her present citizens . But above most States her American citizens are her own production . The progress of a people in a new country is well measured by the simple element of roads and of other means of communication and transportation . In the beginning there is no road . The beginning of civilization and the beginning of a road are contemporaneous . Turkey has no roads ; England has turnpikes . The explorer makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line . A bridlepath is subsequently cut , along which the lone traveller , the circuit-rider , the solitary postman , stubs his way on horseback . The next step is the felling of trees , the laying of the fallen trees into corduroy roads in case the way is over a bog , or removing and burning these trees and the pulling out of stumps . Thus a way is made for " teams . " Presently the road is improved . Population increases . The demands of life become more niimerous and more urgent . The road becomes a turnpike ; over it the coach , bearing the goods and folks of and for the new State , goes twice or thrice a week . Presently the railroad surveyor emerges as silently as the sun rises and within a few months after his appearance rails themselves are laid . Such is the history of Ohio . Governor St. Clair in 1795 wrote , " There is not a road in the country . " In as many years after the beginning of the century as there elapsed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century roads had their beginning . They were few , and the few were bad . But among the earliest internal improvements made by the United States was a road called the Mail Route from Wheeling to the West . This road , built by Ebenezer Zane , of Wheeling , was known as " Zane 's Trace . " It was first a bridlepath cut through the woods . In a few years corduroy bridges were built over bogs and marshes . The road-wagon , with its four and six horses , presently supplanted the pack-horse . Along this road for forty years went the mails between Washington and Kentucky . In 1832 the first railroad was built . But Ohio above most Western States was favored with means of communication other than of the land . On its southern and eastern boundary it had a great river ; on its northern , a great lake . Long before the roads became moderately passable , on both river and lake was passing the commerce of vigorous and everincreasing peoples . In October , 1811 , the steamboat Orleans departed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those living on the banks between which it passed . Some supposed that a comet had fallen and come into the river . Some supposed that it was an English boat , for the war with England was already in the air . She did not reach her destination until more than two months after her departui-e , and it was not till the next year and the year following that two other steamers from Pittsburg followed her down the Ohio . But no one of these boats ever came up the river against its current . It was not till 1815 that a steamer which in December , 1814 , had taken a cargo of ordnance stores from Pittsburg to General Jackson in fourteen days , succeeded in stemming the tide , although she was twenty-five days in making the distance from New Orleans to Louisville . But in this time , although steamers were not proving inefficient , sail-boats were doing // a great business . It is said that iXiarietta alone sent to the sea before the war of 1812 no less than twenty - five sailing craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six schooners . In this time , too , the flat-boat played a most important part . Every spring , at full water , flour , bacon , pork and other products of the country were taken to New Orleans and to the markets that lay this side of the Southern metropolis , and the boats returned with cargoes in which were many tropical and foreign goods . As the southern part of the State was the earlier settled , so also the commerce of the river preceded the commerce of the lake . At the time when the Ohio River was the scene of an active business , Lake Erie had but a few little schooners . Lake Erie sprang into prominence not through its commerce , but through Commodore Perry 's victory of 1813 . But it was not alone the river and the lake to which the people looked for easy communication . The Ohio Canal , in association with the Erie Canal , played a most important part in the development of the State . This canal stretched from the river to the lake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begun in 1826 , was , with the great canal , completed in 1833 . In 1842. when the entire canal system was finished , there were found to be 796 miles of navigable water opened for commerce . The entire cost was between fourteen and fifteen millions of dollars . The effect of these improvements it is now hard to overestimate . The canals opened the markets of the world to the farmer of central Ohio . Wheat doubled in value ; land greatly appreciated ; the population rapidly grew ; capital flowed into the State ; villages became towns ; towns became cities . Ohio began to take its large place among the great commonwealths . In 1800 Ohio had 45,000 people , and ranked eighteenth among the States in point of population . In the next tea years its rate of increase was greater than that obtaining in any other State , being 408 per cent. , and in 1810 it had 230,000 inhabitants , and came to be the thirteenth most populous commonwealth . In 1820 it sprung to the fifth place , having 581 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in 1840 to the third place ; and the third place it continued to hold till 1890 , when it fell back to the fourth , Illi nois having come to have 150,000 more people than her own 3,672,316 . In Ohio , as in most of the Western States , agrieulture was the first employment of the early settlers . The immigrant found the State well wooded , and he , unlike the colonists in such States as Wisconsin and Minnesota , cut down the walnut and the pine not to make lumber , but to get a patch for planting corn and potatoes and wheat . It is probable that the present value of the timber destroyed by the settlers in Ohio would be more than the present value of the cultivated land on which that timber stood . But necessary as the soil was to the settler , he did not know that beneath the sod lay a treasure far more valuable than the soil itself . The coal - mine and the oil - well have proved to be in *ot a few counties of far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has thus become , through the same condition which makes England a great manufacturing nation , a great manufacturing commonwealth . These manufactures are largely of iron and of allied products . The conditions of the problem are very simple . Iron ore is taken from the mines of Michigan and Minnesota . Soft coal is necessary to its manufacture . Manufactured iron is needed in every part of the country . Iron ore is not adequately produced in Ohio ; soft coal is not adequately found in Michiigan or Minnesota- " useless each without the other . " The definite part of the problem is , where can iron ore and soft coal best meet ? From what point can the results of the meeting of iron ore and soft coal be best transported to those points where they are needed ? It is now known and confessed that the spot where iron ore and soft coal can best meet , and the spot whence can best be shipped the products of their union , is to be found on the shore of Lake Erie between Toledo and Buffalo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iron products . Since 1872 Ohio has been the second State in the making of iron and steel . Pennsylvania was then and is still ahead of her neighbor . The Lake Superior mines produce more than one-half of the iron ore of the United States , and these mines are very largely owned in Ohio , and mostly in Cleveland . The total value of the products of iron and steel in this country in 1890 was $478,687,519 , and about oneseventh of this value is to be credited to // Ohio . In the making and distribution of iron , the ship plays a part second only to the furnace . The chief city of the State on its northern boundary has become one of the great ship-building points of the world . If the construction of war-ships be omitted , it has become the second greatest ship-building port in the world , being excelled alone by the Clyde . When warships are included , Cleveland is obliged to fall behind Philadelphia . The total foreign and coastwise commerce of New York is , of a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 10,000,000 net tons . Thus the State , which was primarily agricultural , has become , though still remaining agricultural , a State of iron and steel makers , of mineowners , and of ship-builders . The development of Qhio , like the development of Plymouth Colony and of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , has been a development led by great men . The names of the leaders of the two colonies that went to make up Massachusetts are the names of great men . Take away the Wintlirops , the Matliers , the Adamses the Bradfords , the Brewsters , the Everetts , and Massachusetts history would be a thing quite different from what it is . A great people creates and demands great leaders . Great leaders create and demand a great people . But the demand of a great people for great leaders is the more imperative . In Ohio great men have led . Its earlier history is woven with the names of Putnam , Manasseb Cutler , and Moses Cleveland , the founder of the great and beautiful city bearing his name ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads the names of Ewing , Corwin , Giddings , Stanton , Chase , Wade , Waite , Hayes , and Garfield . It is significant that the great men of Ohio have usually been men engaged in political life . There are of course certain exceptions , to which I shall allude , but on the whole the great men have been statesmen and generals . There are a few lawyers , Ohio born and bred , who can be seen from beyond the boundaries of the State , so tall are they . One of them is Chief-Justice Waite , respected in Ohio before his great elevation , as he was respected beyond Ohio after it . His associate , too , Stanley Matthews , is regarded in Ohio as not unworthy of his high office . Allen G. Thurman , also , was for almost half a century one of the great lawyers of the State , a man , too , whose political service was greatly enriched by his legal knowledge and training . In northern Ohio was one lawyer who has received large recognition aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ranney , of whom Rhodes , in his history , says : " He was a profound jurist .... As a member of the Ohio Constitutional Convention he had a great share in making the organic law ; as judge of the Ohio Supreme Court , he interpreted it in a series of decisions which for sound doctrine , and clearness of thought and expression , are probably not surpassed in the court records of any State . " - ( History of the United States , vol. ii. , pp. 380-81 . ) The annals of Ohio in medicine are quite vacant of the greatest names . The two names that occur first of the great religious leaders of the State were not of Ohio origin , and the work of one only was done in large degree in Ohio . Lyman Beecher came to Cincinnati , and helped to mould that part of the State to a liberal orthodoxy and to civic freedom . Finney came to the northern part of the State , to Oberlin , a radical , a man of strong brain , of unique personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of piety . The great editors in Ohio have been few , but one does not forget that Whitelaw Reid was here born and educated . The great educators have been few also , but certain names at once occur to one . The greatest by far of these is Horace Mann . Short and sad was his Ohio life . He dug his grave in Antioch College . Of him Theodore Parker said , writing to him in 1854 : " I am glad that you are there ,  --  sad enough for my own sake ; sympathizing , too , for the heartache which I know often comes over the homesick man . But I think of the generations which will rise up and call you blessed . I think New England had no seed in her granary which the West needed so much as yourself . Now God has sown you in Ohio , I look for great harvests which mankind shall one day reap th erefroin. * ( Life of Horace Mann , pp. 458-9 . ) But , alas ! it must be said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mann 's death , too , Antioch College had come almost to its grave . Horace Mann 's life is a power in American life because of his work in the common schools of Massachusetts , not // because of his work in a college of Ohio . Following Mann was another great educator , Thomas Hill , who went from Antioch to Harvard , but greater as an educator , scholar , thinker , than as an administrator . Probably the next greatest name in Ohio 's educational history is that of Fairchild of Oberlin , who has occupied almost every position in that college , and taught almost all branches , from mathematics to dogmatic theology , and who has brought to every task a clear mind , a sympathetic heart , and a calm judgment . When one thinks of the great authors one finds that they are men and women whose association with Ohio has been brief . Of all these the most famous probably is William D. Howells . But does not all the world know that Howells left Ohio almost as soon as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , and worked many years , but when he wished to begin in earnest the writing of his volumes he went to Cambridge . Here also that noble man and charming , John Hay , has a home , but Washington is his more permanent dwelling-place . Constance Fen imore Woolson spent her girlhood in Cleveland , and her relations with that city were always intimate , but her residence in late years was abroad , and abroad she died . The Cary sisters began their popular and inspiring writings near Cincinnati , but they drifted soon , like many others , to the metropolis . No one forgets that Artemus Ward had a service on the Cleveland Plaindealer in the troublous times before 1860 , but it was brief . His Cleveland life is still preserved in his name , which is given to a club of journalists . No journalist has been more prominent in Ohio than Murat Halstead , and though his residence is now outside the State , his name and work are here honored . Albert Shaw and Edith Thomas were born in Ohio  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Paddy 's Run ( a name which the postoffice authorities tried to change , but failed ) , where also was born Murat Halstead ; the other , at Chatham , and was educated in a high-school and normal institute at Geneva . It must be confessed that the great men of Ohio , arid the men who have helped to make Ohio great in itself and great in reputation , have been men engaged in civil and political life . In his Twenty Years in Congress , Mr. Blame , writing of the time of the beginning of the war , says : " The Ohio delegation was especially strong . John A. Bingham , the oldest in service on the Republican side , was an effective debater , well informed , ready , and versatile . A man of high principle , of strong faith , of zeal , enthusiasm , and eloquence , he could always command the attention of the House . His colleague , Samuel Shellabarger , was distinguished for the logical and analytical character of his mind . Without the gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Shellabarger conquered by the intrinsic strength of his argument , which generally amounted to demonstration . His mind possessed many of the qualities which distinguished Mr. Lincoln . In fairness , lucidness , fulness of statement , the two had a striking resemblance . Valentine B. Horton was a valuable member on all questions of finance and business ; and on the issues touching slavery James M. Ashley followed the radical example of Mr. Giddings . Among the Democrats , George H. Pendleton , Clement L. Vallandigham , and Samuel S. Cox were especially conspicuous . Mr. Pendleton was regarded as the leader of the Democratic side of the House by a large section of his party , and his assignment to the Committee of Ways and Means by the Speaker was intended as a recognition of that fact . Mr. Cox gave much attention to foreign affairs , to which his mind had been drawn by a brief but fruitful participation in the diplomatic service of the country . Mr. Yallan digham possessed ability , and a certain form of dogged courage , combined with a love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions and the advocacy of unpopular measures . No other State was in the aggregate so ably represented as Ohio " ( p. 328 ) . But it must be said that probably the Ohio delegation was never again so strong as it was at this time . The names of Ewing , Corwin , and Giddings are now becoming rather a memory ; but the stories of Corwin are still told by men who heard him tell them , and they still arouse many a laugh . TIme name of Wade , too , is not familiar to the younger generation , and , like the names of so many of his companions who were leaders in the times between 1856 and // qwq have been greater than either . He holds a position in American as well as Ohio history absolutely unique . He was one of the men who had a part in shapin* the movements which resulted in the war ; he was one of the three or four great men whose conduct was most influential in carrying on the war ; and thirdly , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the settlement of the constitutional principles involved in the war . As an orator and candidate for office , as Secretary of the Treasury , and as Chief Justice , he took a mighty threefold share in the great issues . The names of Garfield and of Hayes are dear to every heart . The public career and the ending of the life of VOL. xcIu. - No. 554-33 retirement from the great office , the first citizen , and he bore himself in ways worthy of the first citizen . He said to me at different times : " I wish to do useful things which no one else will do . I am president of the Prisoners ' Aid Society , a worthy work , I think . Who cares for the poor prisoner ? Possibly I can help him a bit . " " My chief work , " he said at another time , " is to advertise good things ; my one wish is to be useful . " Ohio as the mother of great men becomes possibly more conspicuous in war than in peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the field between 1861 and 1865 , whose birthplace was in Ohio or whose early train5HIPPING IN THE OLD RIvER-BED , CLEVELAND . // ing was there received , are pre-eminent . Among them were such commanders as McDowell , McPherson , Buell , Cox , Rosecrans , and also Sheridan , Sherman , and Grant . McClellan went to the war from Ohio , and was first appointed to the command of Ohio troops . It is only not to be forgotten that Hayes and Garfield won the title of " General " long before that of President . But these names are to me hardly so significant as the fact that oneeighth of all the Federal army of the great war came from Ohio . The similarity between Ohio and Maine in having its great men political leaders is striking . The delegation of Maine in Congress , like the delegation of Ohio , has always been one of pre-eminent ability . George Evans and William Pitt Fessenden , Lot M. **ori*ill , Hannibal Harnlii* , and James G. Blame-not to mention men who are now in Congress-illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Washington . An Ohio Governor was the rival of the great Maine man as a candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency in 1876 , and four years later a like condition prevailed . The Ohio men won both in the conventions and at the polls . But the contrast between the vocations and avocations of the great men of Ohio and the great men of Massachusetts is most striking . One who visited Boston twenty or forty years ago wanted to see literary men-Longfellow , Whittier , Emerson , Lowell , and Holmes . Sumner did not attract the public notice that Longfellow called out , nor Wilson that of Whittier , nor Winthrop that of Holmes . There are two exceptions . One , Daniel Webster . No man probably ever filled the public eye in any State as did Webster in Massachusetts . I have heard Colonel Higginson say that when Webster walked down State Street , State Street seemed to stop its business , look out of the windows of counting - rooms , cease its walk and turn round in order to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bated breath , " There goes Webster ! " The other exception is Wendell Phillips , great orator , who thought he was a statesman , but who helped to make the events which called into service the greatest of statesmen . The origin of the remark , made half in jest , half in earnest , as to the ubiquity and power of the Ohio man , lies largely in his ubiquity and power as a statesman . The causes that have contributed to this civic greatness are of course general and particular . One cause to which I allude is the ubiquity of the Ohio college . Ohio is a State of colleges . And yet it must be acknowledged that many of the great political leaders were not college men . Giddings was not . Wade was not . Chase was a graduate of Dartmouth . Ewing was a graduate of Ohio University , at Athens , and received the first degree of A.B . ever given in Ohio . Hayes was a graduate of Kenyon . Gai ' - field was educated in part at Hiram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the rank and file of these men who have made Ohio history have been college-trained . The typical Ohio college of forty years ago was a very sorry institution , except in the nobility of its purposes and in the character of two or three men who sat in its professors ' chairs . There were of course exceptions . The old Western Reserve College , at Hudson , was an exception , in which such teachers as Laurens P. Hickok , afterwards President of Union , Professor Loomis , of mathematical fame , Barrows , the great Hebrew scholar , President Bartlett , Clement Long , Henry N. Day , Professor Charles A. Young , and the elder Seymour were gathered . But any college , poor in money and resources , if it be true and honest , may do a great work for the student if lie be honest and not too poor . And these Ohio boys went to college , and in the college they were trained to think . From the college they went to the lawyer 's desk and the bar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , and to places in the national Congress . The principle of individuality which is manifest in the beginnings of Ohio receives illustration in its collegiate system . The first college founded in Ohio was not only the first college founded in the whole Northwest Territory , but also it was the first college founded in the United States having an endowment in land given by the national government . It bore the ambitious name of the American Western University , and the act establishing it passed the Territorial Legislature in January , 1802 . The college preceded the State . In the century that has since elapsed more colleges have been founded in Ohio than in any other State . // Although the present number of colleges may be somewhat less than is found in Illinois , yet the number is sufficiently great to illustrate the principle of individuality . Instead of having one urnversity , as has been the method in most States of the West , Ohio has continued to have three . The oldest is still at Athens , where it was fourldQd ; a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically known as the Ohio State University , which has just celebrated its twen ty-flfth anniversary , is at the capital of the State . Throughout this period , too , in all parts of the State colleges have sprung up . They have usually had their origin in religious or sectarian motives . Ikenyon , the college of the Episcopalians , laid its corner-stone in June , 1827 . Western Reserve was founded in 1826 by Congregationalists and Presbyterians , among whom the influence of Yale was ure-eminent . Oberlin followed in 1833 as a part of an evangelistic movement . Marietta JUDGE RUFUS P. RANNEY. // qwq policy of decentralization , a policy which is opposed to the policy that has prevailed in New England , for Ohio has twice as many colleges as all the New England States , and as many as New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania combined . As one reads the history of the higher education in the State he is impressed with the method of experiment which has prevailed . It has been the State of educational reforms and of educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest Territory , she has been the century . The educators are sympathetic with the centralizing tendency of modern education . When this State was without roads , or had only poor ones , it was fitting to have many colleges . For the local influence of any college *s great . Many boys and girls went to colleges scattered throughout the State who would not have gone to a university situated in one part of the State . It is significant that more than half the students of a national university like Harvard come from the State in which it is located . But when A cHARAcTERIsTIc OHIO HOMESTEAD . // THE CAPITOL AT COLUMBUS . qwq necticut , it was natural , therefore , that boys going away to college from northern Ohio should go to the colle , . , e of old Connecticut . But this condition has now passed away . The l ) ublic-school system of Ohio is better for a public- school system than the college system is for a college system . The system is good ; the teachers as a body are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although in no State are they as well trained as they ought to be . The school-houses are excellentfar better than one finds in Maine or in the country districts of the other New England States . I have sometimes thought that the farther west one goes , the better one finds the school-houses in comparison with the churches . And the farther east one goes , the better he finds the churches in comparison with the school-houses . To foster education has been the policy of the West . The large proportion of the public domain that has been set apart in the Northwest for the purposes of higher education has resulted , and will result , in giving a magnificent system of education without large drau*hts upon the purses of the people . In all these manifestations of its life Ohio is essentially a State of individualisms . The communistic system or method has not prevailed . Political parties have been more split than in most States . The large number of colleges represent , as I have said , the individualistic principle . Normal schools have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The efficiency with which the Underground Railroad was run in Ohio illustrates the individualistic quite as much as the co-operative system and method . The laws in respect to corporations , and commercial enterprises have been far more severe than New York laws of the same kind . Individual legal rights have been respected . The greatest corporation of modern times was organized in Cleveland , but it was found wise to transfer its headquarters to the city of New York . A Republican Legislature has been known to choose a Democrat as United States Senator . The Ohio man is an individual . The individualisms of the State also receive illustration in its ecclesiastical history . I do not know how many of the different denominations are represente ( in Ohio , but I am sure that most of them are , and I am also sure that most of their churches are vigorous . Although the northern part of the State was peopled by those who were originally Congregation . alists , and who , coming to Ohio , became Presbyterian s  --  and it is always to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and of living greatly differs in different parts of the State . The standard of living in the country is somewhat better , I think , than can be found among the farmers of Vermont and Maine . Ohio farmers have more money and provide a better table . The life in the two great cities of Cleveland and Cincinnati is somewhat similar to the life in Boston and New York , though the similarity of life in Cleveland and Boston is greater than that which obtains between Cincinnati and New York . People in Cleveland spend money more freely than people in Boston , because they get it from a larger rate of interest and more profitable commercial ventures . The tax laws of the State , however , have driven a good many rich men to New York . The departure of millionaires from their native State and town in order to avoid swearing to the amount of their property is evidence of the uprightness of their consciences , butit does tend to make Ohio poor . I have suggested that the Ohio man is ubiquitous . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have had some relation to Ohio . If Ohio shares with Massachusetts and Connecticut the privilege of being the mother of great men , it may be also said that with Illinois she shares the honor of being the mother of great States . A million of her children now have their homes in States west of her own boundaries . To her next-door neighbor Indiana she has contributed 164,000 people ; and to her second-door neighbor Illinois , 126,000 - a number greater than has been contributed by any other State . To Iowa she has given 102 ,  - -  000 ; to Kansas , 116,000 : to Michigan , 80 ,  - -  000 ; to Missouri , 70,000 ; to Nebraska , 59,000 ; to California , 28,000 ; to Colorado , 21,000 ; to Oregon and Washington , 24 ,  - -  000 ; and to Texas . 10,000 . Few of her people have turned against the movement of the star of empire , and fewer still have entered the South , though Kentucky has 31,000 of native Ohioans ; West Virginia , 31,000 also ; Pennsylvania , 34,000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3000 ; and the New England States so small numbers that the Census Reports fail to specify tlem . Thus in her emigrations in the last decades of her century , as well as in hei* imniigrations during the first decades , Ohio is still a State of individuahisms.
