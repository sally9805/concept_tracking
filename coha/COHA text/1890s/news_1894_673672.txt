txt Bigotry and Snow-Nothingisin have been introduced into the campaign by the Republicans . and from now until November these un-American agencies Win be invoked to secure votes for Republican candidates . This will be a matter of surprise to many who have listened to the assurances of the Republican leaders that the ideas advanced by the American Protective Association would not be adopted by the party in the present contest Evidence secured in the last two days by the correspondent of The New-York Times shows that the country is being flooded with A. P. A. literature , and that the Republican Congressional Committee , despite its protestations to the contrary , is behind the movement The attempt to veil this performance in secrecy attests to the unwelingness of the Republican leaders to let the country know to what disreputable means of influencing voters they have resorted . Denial after denial has been made by men connected with the Republican Congressional Committee that the teachings of the A. P. A. were being dissemmR+ed with the aid of Republican money , or that any reliance would be placed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the principles of this pernicious organization . The falsity of these assertions Is shown clearly by the actions of the committee in the last two days . A vast quantity of A P. A literature Is now stored in a house in this city , and the committee is making requisitions upon it to meet the demands of partisans who regard such literature as necessary and justifiable in the procuring of votes . It will be remembered that on June 7 last S Linton , a Representative from Michigan , delivered a speech in the House en which the Catholic Church was assailed upon the ground that it had for years been engaged in pushing Catholic schools upon the Government and securing large appropriations for their support . Mr. Linton made a characteristic A. P. A. speech . The subject under discussion by the House was the bill making appropriations for current and contingent expenses of the Indian Department . Mr. Linton , while disclaiming any intention of attacking any religious denomination as such , produced a number of tables designed to show that the Catholic Church had received in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of its Indian schools , while Protestant denominations had been restricted to a comparatively small amount in the aggregate . Here is a sample paragraph from Mr. Linton 's speech , which throws a good deal of light on the present attempt of the Republicans to inflame the minds of voters against Catholics : Will- you not take warning from the past by heeding the protests of great religious denominatinos ; by heeding the resolutions passed by many civic organizations ; by heeding the demands of almost the entire population of our country , declaring that this nefarious system of paying millions of the people 's money to priestly agents of sectarian institutions must immediately cease ? So long as you continue this sYsteka ; - soAcug will the religious agitation now- sweeeeng- the country continueThat , the Republicans intend to take up the A. P. A. cry in this campaign was more than hinted at in the paragraph contained in the Republican Congressional campaign book , embodying a few lines of Mr. Linton 's speech . This paragraph did not occupy a prominent place , and doubtless many readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been followed by the publication in pamphlet form of Mr. Linton 's speech , and also the proceedings of the Senate on the day the Indian Appropriation bill was considered , when Mr. Quay Introduced a memorial from citizens of Pennsylvania remonstrating against the appropriation of money by the Government for denominational schools for Indian pupils . This pamphlet is embellished by " display " type , and on the last page , in capital letters , is printed an extract from the remarks of Mr. Gallinger , whose sympathies with the A. P. A. are well known , as follows : Now , this is a very serious matter . It concerns the rights of the American people so far as the appropriation of their money is concerned . I do not believe the Congress of the United States can long stand upon the ground that it occupies to-day . There is already a gathering storm in this country against this matter of appropriating money for sectarian purposes . That storm may break before a great while upon the Congress and the people of the United States . The- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in. the campaign was given a short time ago , when there was placed to the credit of Linton , in the House and Senate folding rooms , 2,319,500 copies of the Linton speech , with the addenda just referred to . Of this vast quantity , Senator Gailinger ordered 1,000,000 copies , Senator Platt of Connecticut 500,000 , Senator Patton of Michigan 500,000 , - Mr. Linton 200,000 , and Senator 179,500 . All the pamphlets were to be delivered at the office of a firm of local printers . Over 2,000 , - 000 of the pamphlets were printed in New York , the remainder being produced here . The greatest secrecy has been observed in preparing this matter for distribution , the officials at the Republican headquarters apparently having nothing to do with the work . it would seem that the manipulators of the scheme to flood the country with this literature without casting suspicion upon the Republican committee be-who - live at 204 Arthur Place . on the front , and the house is unfurnished . the pamphlets at 208 Arthur Place , Northcame mr ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg hi staentaedif. yo er s8t eyrnd at yesterday , . and s ifory , an order was issued to deliver 2,000,000 of west Number 208 Arthur Place is a small house in a. small street near the Republican It was evidently selected because 4f its a. man named Nassau , one of two brothers comparative isolation .

In view of what has happened to-day , it seems strange that the Republican committee should be at such pains to shirk the responsibility for circulating these documents . The officials at the headquarters have not shown the circumspection which one would think would go hand in hand with this deliberate attempt to deceive . - Yesterday a gentleman , with full knowledge Of the facts , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linton pamphlet . e have none of those pamphlets now , " said Capt . , the Assistant Secretary , of whom the request was made , " but if you will call to-morrow or leave your address I Will see that you get one .

The value of this statement will be appreciated by all who know what it costs to hire clerks and send out documents by the million . This afternoon the gentleman called again at the headquarters and reminded Capt . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Captain . " here is one , " and he handed the visitor a copy of the desired document . It was not inclosed in an envelope , and there was no sign of Mr. Linton 's frank upon it . Further evidence connecting the committee with the circulation of this literature was supplied this morning , when another man went to the house in Arthur Place , and applied for copies of the Linton speech . " Did Capt . send you ? " the attendant demanded . The gentleman replied in the negative , and when asked if it was necessary to have an order from the Captain , Mr. Nassau replied in the affirmative , but added that , if he only wanted a few copies , there would not be any difficulty . Then he dived into the cellar , and returned with ten copies of the Linton pamphlet , ready for mailing . When the visitor turned to go , he was informed that if he wanted any more he would be obliged to secure an order from either the Assistant Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Republican ex-member of Congress from Kentucky , who is now a Baptist preacher on Capitol Hill . Mr. Smith Is a member of the A. P. A. , and from all that can be learned , has been intrusted by the Republican committee with the task of disposing of the bulk of the documents . Late this afternoon the correspondent of The New-York Times went to the house on Arthur Place , and was admitted by a man who said his name was Nassau . " I would like a copy of the A. P. A. document , " he said . " You mean the Linton speech , I suppose , " said Mr. Nassau . The correspondent replied in the affirmative , and the custodian of the documents started for the cellar . " I can spare but a few just now , " he said , " because the orders are coming in so thick . " When he had handed one of the documents to the correspondent , he was asked what plan would have to be followed by one who desired a large quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring an order from Capt . or H. Clay Smith , " was the prompt reply . Mr. Nassau , who was perfectly willing to talk , told the correspondent that 15,000 of the documents were sent out to-day , and that the demand for them was constantly growing . Ten thousand copies were to be sent to New-York , he said , and orders had been received for 3,000 to go to Chicago . Many had already been sent to Michigan , and more were to follow . Nassau was careful to say that all this work was being done under orders from Mr. Linton , and that so far as he knew , Mr. Linton was footing the bills . Those who are opposed to the pernicious teachings of the A. P. A. will hardly require stronger evidence than that here furnished , that the Republican leaders are doing their utmost to flood the country with matter designed to inflame voters against the Catholics .
