txt If , from conviction , political expediency , or any other cause , Gov . Flower had seen fit to veto the bill increasing the salaries of the police force of this city , one can readily imagine the denunciation he would have bestowed upon the Legislature for its violation of the " principle of home rule . " Whenever he has used that as an excuse for vetoing bills that he did not like , he has been particularly emphatic in condemning the practice of forcing expenditures upon local communities without the consent of their authorities , and he has shown a peculiar regard for the desire of those authorities and for the attitude of the representatives of the communities concerned . This bill was an exceptionally flagrant case of the violation of the principle of " home rule . " It was not introduced by any representative of New-York City , but by a Republican Senator from the interior of the State whose reputation as a politician is not very savory . It was not supported by the Senators or Assemblymen from the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor excuses his approval of the bill on three grounds . In the first place , he does not think that the policemen of New-York are paid enough , but , on the principle of home rule , what business is that of his or . of the Legislature 's ? It is not true that rents have advanced and the cost of living increased since 1886 , or that the expense imposed upon policemen by the regulations of department reduce their income by $200 to $300 a year , or that they are paid " less proportionally " than those of other cities , but , if it were true , , that is a matter for the local authorities to consider . If power had been given to them to increase salaries , nobody would have complained , but what right had the Legislature and the Governor to decide that matter , if " home rule " is to be regarded ? This excuse is not good . In the second place , the Governor was anxious about the morals of the police . He said they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would remove them from that temptation by adding $200 a year to their pay . But what chance is there that a ma.4 ) . who is not honest on $1,200 a year will become so on $1,400 ? We do not think the change will make the least difference with the honesty or the " temptation " of policemen . They . have also been accused of paying money to get their places on the force , and the officers of the department who get the highest salaries are charged with making the most " private gain " out of their " office . " The Governor has shown no disposition to promote or sustain inquiry into the truth of charges of this kind , to which he seems after all to attach some importance . But the flimsiest of the excuses urged by the Governor is that the salaries of the police were already fixed by the Consolidated act , and could only be changed by its amendment . " Unfortunately for the cause of home rule , " he said , " which Wisely demands that local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the salaries can not be either increased or reduced except by an amendment of this mandatory act . " But in amending it , what was to prevent a modification of its mandatory character by giving to the local authorities the power to increase or reduce salaries instead of fixing them again at an arbitrary figure ? A consistent advocate of home rule would have insisted upon that method and consented to nothing else . The ' fact is , the Governor yielded to the power which lobbied the bill through the Legislature and threatened to work politically against all who opposed it , thereby furnishing the best of reasons for its disapproval .
