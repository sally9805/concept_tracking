BY JULIAN RALPH . POPULATION and wealth are classified by the same standards . In both eases a million is the utmost figure that is popularly comprehended . A million of citizens or of dollars suggests the ripening of success in both fields . It is true that London has five millions of citizens and the Astors have thirty times as many dollars , but London is simply one of the world 's capitals and the Astors are but millionaires in the general thought and speech . In America we are growing familiar with big figures , and now it seems logically likely that another town will soon increase our acquaintance with them . It startled the English-speaking world to learn that Chicago had reached the million mark , but to-day we foresee that in a few years-perhaps the next census will record it -- St . Louis is to share the honor with her . No other Western city has such a start in the race . It is true , if the signs are to be trusted , that the Twin Cities-Minneapolis and St. Paul - may then have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the commercial rival of all three of her great Northern neighbors , and is drawing trade which they were seeking , while the Twins are separate cities . The only millionaire towns , so to speak , will be Chicago and St. Louis . St. Louis is already the fifth in size among the cities of the land , and would be fourth if Brooklyn were rated what she is in fact - a bedchamber of New York . But it is the new growth of St. Louis , her re-start in life , that is most significant and interesting ; it began so recently and is gathering momentum so fast . And we shall see that never was city 's growth more firmly rooted or genuine . What is accomplished there is performed without trumpeting or bluster , by natural causes , and with the advantages of conservatism and great wealth . More remarkable yet , and still more admirable , the new growth of the city is superimposed upon an old foundation . It is an age , as this world goes , since this proud city could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the near future will be a fine , dignified , solid city , with a firmly established and polished society , cultivated tastes , and the mounVOL . LXXXV. - No. 510-90 ments , ornaments , and atmosphere of an old capital . I have had occasion once or twice in the course of these articles upon the development of our West to speak of what may be called the " booming organizations " which father the commercial interests of the more ambitious cities , and in some instances of the newer States . These should have had more prominence , and should have been mentioned more frequently . Though they have nothing to do with the governments of the cities , they are , like the governments , the instruments of the united will of the people , working for the general good , and when they and the governments conflict , the will of " the boomers " often rises supreme above the local laws . For instance , it was announced in one city that the excise laws would be ignored , in order that the place might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the city 's guests . There are good reasons for such supremacy of these powerful and active unions . Their leading spirits are always the most energetic and enterprising men in the cities , and their interest in their schemes for the general advantage is more enthusiastic than that which is felt in the government . The phrase " booming organizations " is applied to these institutions for the benefit of Eastern and transatlantic readers . It is not altogether satisfactory to the persons to whom it is applied , because in parts of the West booming is a word that has come to be coupled with unwarranted and disastrous inflation , as when a new town is made the field of adventure for town-site and corner-lot gamblers . I use the phrase as we do who have succeeded in getting General Horace Porter to " boom " the completion of the Grant monument in Riverside Park . To " boom , " then , is to put a plan generally and favorably before the people , to put a scheme in motion with *clat , to vaunt the merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with and for the interests and merits of the Western cities by these organizations , which are there variously known as Boards of Trade , Chambers of Commerce , and Commer // cial Clubs . They are in essence what our Chambers of Commerce in Eastern seaports are , but in some cities they work apart from the Chambers of Commerce and on separate lines , while in others they do some of the same work , and a great deal else that is very different . They are in some cities what an engine is to a machine-shop or a locomotive is to a railway train . Whoever visits a city that is well equipped in this respect feels the pulsations and is conscious of the power and influence of its Board of Trade , as we note the presence of the dynamo in a boat that is lighted by electricity . These unions consider the needs of their cities , and set to work to supply them . They raise the money for a fine hotel , if one is lacking ; and in at least one city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hotel after it is built , even going to the extreme of giving a grand annual banquet there , and paying a purely fancy price per plate to the lessee of the house in order that he may get a sort of pourboire out of it . They raise the means to build street railroads ; they organize companies for the erection and maintenance of a first-class theatre in such a city , for the holding of an annual fair or carnival parade , for the construction of a great hall , to which they afterward invite conventions . These ventures are not all expected to be profitable by any means , particularly in the smaller cities ; but they are " attractions , " they swell the local pride , they promote that civicism which is such a truly marvellous factor in the even more marvelIons progress of our Western cities . But these local unions go farther . They obtain the passage of laws exempting certain manufactures from license fees and taxes on the buildings in which they are carried on , and then they induce manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonuses in the form of exemption from taxes , in the form of a gift of land , or even of a gift of a building designed and constructed as the recipients desire to have it . To give one illustration out of ten thousand , the little town of Rapid City , South Dakota , gave a noble store-house of brick and stone to a wholesale grocery firm for coming there to do business . To give another view of the subject , the editor of an influential newspaper in one of the ambitious smaller cities of the West resigned his membership in the local Board of Trade because he said it contained so many wealthy men , and they so frequently subscribed large sums of money for public improvements , that he was uncomfortable at the meetings , and preferred to do his share of the work out side " until he had made his pile " and could " chip in with the rest . " These commercial circles send committees to Congress , to the heads of great societies , to the capitalists of the East and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits , for especial ends . They cause the building of railroads and railroad spurs ; they print books , pamphlets , and " folders , " to scatter praise of their cities wherever English is read . They stop at nothing which will tend toward the advancement of their local interests . They are unions of business men landowners , and capitalists ; but , as in all things , one man is the dominant spirit and the most fertile in expedients . This is usually the secretary , who is a salaried officer . Men with an especial genius for the work drift into such positions , and when they prove especially and signally capable officials , such as those are who are in St. Paul , Spokane , and St. Louis , other cities try to secure them . St. Louis has one of the most progressive and influential bodies in the West in its Merchants ' Exchange . It is by no means a mere exchange . It does very much of the work toward the public and general good of which I have spoken ; indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the immense territory drained by the Mississippi , find in it the ablest and most active champion of their needs . It is to the central West and the Southwest what our Chamber of Commerce is to New York and the commercial interests of the Atlantic coast . But with the sudden assumption of a new youthfulness in old St. Louis there has sprung up an auxiliary , or , at all events , another organization for the exploitation and advancement of local interests . It is called " the Autumnal Festivities Association , " and is one of the most remarkable of the mediums through which Western enterprise works . The story of its inception and organization , with the incidents I gathered concerning the firelike rush of the movement among all classes of St. Louis citi // zens , presents a peculiarly clear reflection of the character of the new life that how dominates that city , as well as of the forcefulness and ambition of the Western people generally . When St. Louis failed to secure the World 's Fair , instead of sinking back discouraged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be that its merits were not as widely or as clearly understood as was necessary . Therefore , in the spring of 1891 , a meeting was called at the Exposition Building to discuss the advisability of forming an organization which , for three years at least , should devote itself to celebrating the achievements and adding to the attractions of the city . From the stage the crude plan of the campaign was announced , and suggestions from the audience were asked for . As my informants put it , " the first suggestion ' was a subscription of $10,000 from a dry - goods firm ; the second was a similar gift from a rich tobacconist . Then came two subscriptions of $7500 each , and others of amounts between $5000 and $1000 . Mr. John S. Moffitt , a leading merchant , as chairman of the Finance Committee , promised to undertake the raising of one million dollars within three years , and received promises of sums amounting to $100,000 on that first evening . The sense of the meeting was that this large amount should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and caring for them after they came . A sum of money was set aside as a bonus for any persons who should build a one million dollar fire-proof hotel in the city on a site to be approved by the executive committee . It was resolved to appropriate as much as would be needed to illuminate the city with between 20,000 and 100,000 gas and electric lights on especial evenings during each year 's autumnal festivities , and committees were appointed to look after illuminations , transportation , and whatever . It was also arranged that one-third of the full amount raised should be expended under the supervision of a branch of the organization to be called the Bureau of Information , and to be headed by Mr. Goodman King as chairman . Mr. James Cox , who had been the managing editor of one of the daily newspapers , became the secretary of this bureau . It has offices in St. Louis , and it arranged to open oth ers in London and other cities in pursuit of a systematic effort to advertise the commercial , social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the raising of the prescribed amount of money , the association fell to work at once , and the illuminations and festivities of the autumn of 1891 attracted hundreds of thousands of persons to the city , and were characterized as the finest displays of their kind that had up to that time been made in the country . In the mean time the finance committee began its task of raising a million of dollars . It adopted a shrewdly devised plan . Every trade was appealed to with a request that a committee be appointed and a canvass be made within its own field . Within a week 200 such sub-committees were at work . Each vied with the other in an effort to secure the largest sum , and subscriptions , in sums that ranged between three dollars and $5000 , poured in . Those who did not subscribe promised to do so at a later time . In answer to about 4000 applications by these committees , it is said that there were only five refusals to join the popular movement . It had not occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , to ask the police for any subscriptions , the feeling being that the money was to be expended for purposes that would greatly increase their work ; but , after waiting for months to be asked to join the movement , the police force applied for a thousand subscription cards , appointed their own collectors , and sent the money to the association headquarters in silver dollars carried in sacks . The citizens who were not directly appealed to  --  the lawyers and doctors and all the rest - sent in their checks , and five months after the organization was effected the finance committee reported the receipt of two - thirds of the total amount that was to have been raised in three years , or $600,000 . It is not to be supposed , at this writing , that there will be a failure to raise the remaining $400,000 within the period in which it will be needed . It will be seen that this association was formed after the city failed to secure the World 's Fair , and that its term of duration covers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not antagonistic to the fair , however , // but is simply due to the determination of St. Louis not to be lost sight of , and not to hide its light under a bushel , while the country is filled with visitors to Chicago . It may cause a smile to read that Chairman King and Secretary Cox report , in a circular now before me , what work the Bureau of Information has done " to correct any false impressions which have been created by the too great modesty of St. Louisans in the past . " But they are right , for , as compared with its rivals , St. Louis possessed that defect , and the frank admission of such a hated fault shows how far removed and reformed from retarding bashfulness that city has since become . The bureau reports that it is causing the publication of half-page advertisements of St. Louis , precisely as if it were a business or a patent-medicine , in sixty-two papers , circulating more than a million copies ; that it has obtained reading notices in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manufacturing and commercial metropolis and as a carnival city " are sent out every day ; that arrangements are making for a weekly mail letter to 500 Southern and Western journals ; and that once or twice a week news items are sent to the principal dailies of the whole country . It was found that St. Louis was not fairly treated in the weekly trade reports published generally throughout the country , and this source of complaint has been removed . Invading the camp of the arch-enemy - Chicago - the bureau has caused a handsome " guide to Chicago " to add to its title the words " and St. Louis , the carnival city of America . " It is also getting up a rich and notable book , to be called St. Louis through a Camera , for circulation among all English-speaking peoples . The local service for the press telegraphic agencies has been greatly improved , " and the efforts of the bureau to increase the number and extent of the notices of St. Louis in the daily papers throughout the United States have continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis being ignored or referred to in a very casual manner it is now recognized as fully as any other large city in America . " I have described the operations of this association and its most active bureau at some length because they exhibit the farthest extreme yet reached in the development of the most extraordinary phase of Western enterprise . There we see a city managed by its people as a wideawake modern merchant looks after his business . It is advertised and " written up " and pushed upon the attention of the world , with all its good features clearly and proudly set forth . There is boasting in the process , but it is always based upon actual merit , for St. Louis is an old and proud city ; and there is no begging at all . The methods are distinctly legitimate , and the work accomplished is hard work , paid for by hard cash . It is considered a shrewd investment of energy and capital , and not a speculation . If we in the Eastern cities , who are said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a remarkable example of enterprise , we can not help admiring the concord and the hearty local pride from which it springs . St. Louis is the one large Western city in which a man from our Eastern cities would feel at once at home . It seems to require no more explanation than Boston would to a New-Yorker , or Baltimore to a Bostonian . It speaks for itself in a familiar language of street scenes , architecture , and the faces and manners of the people . In saying this I make no comparison that is unfavorable to the other Western cities , for it is not unfriendly to say that their most striking characteristic is their newness , or that this is lacking in St. Louis . And yet to-day St. Louis is new-born , and her appearance of age and of similarity to the Eastern cities belies her . She is not in the least what she looks . Ten or a dozen years ago there began the operation of influences which were to rejuvenate her , to fill her old veins with new blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise . Six or seven years ago these began to bear fruit , and the new metropolitan spirit commenced to throb in the veins of the old city . The change is not like the awakening of Rip Van Winkle , for the city never slept ; it is rather a repetition of the case of that boy god of mythology whose slender form grew sturdy when his brother was born . It was the new life around the old that spurred it to sudden growth . There is much striving and straining to fix upon a reason for the growth of St. Louis , and in my conversations with a great number of citizens of all sorts be-. tween the City Hall and the Merchants ' // Exchange , I heard it ascribed to the cheapness of coal , iron , and wood ; to river improvement , reconstructed streets , m anufactures , and even to politics . All these are parts of the reason , the whole of which carries us back to the late war . In the war-time the streets of St. Louis were green with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war and until ten years ago , the tide of immigration was composed of the hardy races of northern Europe , who were seeking their own old climate in the New World . Chicago was the great gainer among the cities . That tide from northern Europe not only built up Chicago , but it poured into the now well-settled region around it , where are found such cities as St. Paul , Minneapolis , Duluth , Milwaukee , Omaha , and a hundred considerable places of lesser size . It was a consequence of climatic and , to a less extent , of political and social conditions , and it caused St. Louis to stand still . But for the past ten years the tide of immigration has been running into the Southwest , into Missouri , and the country south and southwest of it . St. Louis is commonly spoken of as the capital of the Mississippi Valley , but her field is larger . It is true that there is no other large city between her and New Orleans - a distance of 800 miles - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 283 miles ; or to Chicago , 280 miles ; or for a long way east or southwest . Her tributary territory is every State and city south of her ; east of her , to the distance of 150 miles ; north , for a distance of 250 miles ; and in the west and southwest as far as the Rocky Mountains . Between 1880 and 1890 the State of Missouri gained more than half a million of inhabitants ; Arkansas gained 326,000 ; Colorado , 300,000 ; Kansas , 430,000 ; Kentucky , 200,000 ; Nebraska , 600,000 ; Texas , 640,000 ; Utah , 64,000 ; New Mexico , Arizona , and Oklahoma , 114,000 . Here , then , was a gain of 3,174,000 in popula tion in St. Louis 's tributary country , and this has not only been greatly added to - in the last two and a half years , but it leaves out of account the growth in pop ulation of the States of Illinois , Iowa , Indiana , Mississippi , and Louisiana . St. Louis had 350,518 souls in 1880 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in habitants . Her most envious critics grant that she has 470,000 souls . In 1891 permits were granted for 4435 new buildings , to cost $13,259,370 , only eleven hundred thousand dollars of the sum being for wooden houses . The city now has 347k miles of paved streets , and they are no longer the streets of crumbling limestone , which once almost rendered the place an abomination . They now are as fine thoroughfares as any city possesses , 272 miles being of macadam , 41 of granite blocks , and the rest being mainly of wooden blocks , asphaltum , and other modern materials . A system of boulevards , of great extent and beauty , is planned and begun . New waterworks are being constructed beyond the present ones at a cost of four millions of dollars , but with the result that a daily supply of one hundred millions of gallons will be insured . The principal districts of the city are now electrically lighted . A new million dollar hotel is promised . The old city , with its stereotyped forms of dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes , which search the world for types , are dominating the new growth . The new residence quarters , where the city is reaching far from the river in the vicinage of the great parks , are very pretty and open , and are embellished with a great number of splendid mansions . In the heart of the city are many high modern office buildings . They are not towering steeples , as in Chicago , nor are they massed together . They are scattered over the unusually extended business district , and in their company is an uncommon number of very large and substantial warehouses , which would scarcely attract the eye of a New-Yorker , because they form one of the striking resemblances St. Louis , both new and old , bears to the metropolis . The most conspicuous of the office buildings are distinguished for their massive walls and general strength . Beside some of the Chicago and Minneapolis buildings of the same sort they appear dark and crowded , and are rather more like our own office piles , where room is very highpriced . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enterprising towns , having fly - away elevators , laundry offices , drug shops , type-writers ' headquarters , barber shops , gentlemen 's furnishing shops , bootblacks ' stands , and so on . But in praising the new orders of architecture in St. Louis I do not mean to condemn all of the old . The public and // semi - public edifices of its former eras should be , in my opinion , the pride of her people . That cultivated taste which led to the revival of the pure and the classic in architecture , especially in the capitals of the Southern States , found full expression in St. Louis , and it commands praise from whoever sees such examples of it as the Court-house , the old Cathedral , and several other notable buildings . What was ugly in old St. Louis was that cutand-dried uniformity in storehouses and dwellings which once made New York tiresome and Philadelphia hideous . But to return to the size and growth of the city . It reaches along the river-front 19 miles . It extends six and sixty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres , or 61.37 square miles . This immense territory is well served by a great and thoroughly modern system of surface street railways , having more than 214 miles of tracks , and run almost entirely by electric and cable power . Some of the newer cars in use on the electric roads are as large again as our New York street cars , and almost half as large as steam railway coaches . Their rapid movements , their flashing head-lights at night , and the cling-clang of the cracked - sounding gongs in the streets seem to epitomize the rush and force of Western development . There is an element of sorcery in both of themin modern progress and in the electric cars . Was it not Dr. Holmes who likened those cars to witches flying along with their broomsticks sweeping the air ? If Chicago was not the first , it was at least a very early railway centre in the West , and her citizens are right in ascribing to that fact much of her prosperity . To-day St. Louis has become remarkable as a centring-place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokes of steel that reach out in a circle , which , unlike that of most other towns of prominence , is nowhere broken by lake , sea , or mountain chain . Nine very important railroads and a dozen lesser ones meet there . The mileage of the roads thus centring at the city is 25,678 , or nearly 11,000 more than in 1880 , while the mileage of roads that are tributary to the city has grown from 35,000 to more than 57,000 . These railways span the continent from New York to San Francisco . They reach from New Orleans to Chicago , and from the Northwestern States to Florida . Through Pullman cars are now run from St. Louis to San Francisco , to the city of Mexico , and to St. Augustine and Tampa in the season . New lines that have the city as their objective point are projected , old lines that have not gone there are preparing to build connecting branches , and several of the largest systems that reach there are just now greatly increasing their terminal facilities in the city with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge across the river is yet a novelty , but it is to be followed at once by a union depot , which is promised to be the most commodious passenger station in the world . lit will embrace all the latest and most admirable concomitants of a first-class station . It will be substantial and costly , and will follow an architectural design which will render it a public ornament . But St. Louis is something besides the focal point of 57,000 miles of railways . She is the chief port in 18,000 miles of inland waterways . She is superior to the nickname she often gets as the mere " capital of the Mississippi Valley , " but her leading men have never been blind to the value of that mightiest of American waterways as a medium for the transportation of non - perishable and coarse freights , and as a guarantor of moderate freight rates . The Merchants ' Exchange of St. Louis has for twenty years been pressing the government to expend upon the improvement of this highway such sums as will render it navigable at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of the river , but it will require a large expenditure and long-continued work to ensure a fair depth all along the channel at low water . What is wanted is a ten-foot channel . Now it drops to five feet and a half , and even less where there are obstructions in the form of shoals and bars . It is argued that the improvement asked for would so reduce the cost of freighting on the river as to bring to the residents of the valleys of the river and its tributaries a gain that would be greater than the cost of the work . In the language of a resolution offered in Congress by Mr. Cruise , of Kansas , " it would reclaim an area of lands equal to some of the great States , and so improve the property of the people and increase their trade relations with other sections of the United // States , and improve the condition of our foreign trade , as to benefit every interest - and every part of the whole country . " This year the Exchange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , sent a memoria to Congress which they called " a plea in favor of isolating the Mississippi River , and making it the subject of an annual appropriation of $8 , 000,000 until it shall be permanently improved for safe and useful navigation . " They said that the removal of a snag or a rock anywhere between Cairo and New Orleans extends relief to Pittsburg , Little Rock , Nashville , and Kansas City . This is because the stream runs past and through ten States , and ( with its tributaries ) waters and drains , wholly or in part , more than one-half the States and Territories of the Union . After proving that 28,000,000 persons inhabit the region directly interested in the improvement of the river , the memorialists proceed to show that the railroads in 1890 carried freight at .941 cents per ton per mile , and that this amounted to $11 29 for 1200 miles , the distance between Boston or New Orleans and St. Louis , whereas the river rate for that distance was $2 20 a ton . They show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheat by rail from Chicago to New York in 1868 , the rate had decreased in 1891 to .941 of a cent . This saving to the people was not brought about solely by competition among the railroads ; the competition of the water lines with the railroads also influenced the reduction . Upon the basis of an estimate that fifty millions of dollars must be spent upon the river , they offer other reasons for believing that the money will be well spent . They assert that before the jetties deepened the mouth of the river , only half a million bushels of wheat were annually exported to Europe from New Orleans . Now eighteen millions of bushels are shipped thus , and the amount is increasing . Had that wheat not gone by that route at the rate of 14-b cents a bushel from St. Louis to Liverpool , it must have been sent by rail to New York at 21* - cents a bushel - a difference of seven cents a bushel in favor of the river route , or a saving of $1,260,000 on the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the amount of freight carried on the river and its trib utaries in 1889 was 31,000,000 tons . It is impossible to here follow the arguments and pleas that are embodied in the memorial , but it is well to know that they are not the outcome of the interests and ambition of St. Louis alone , but of the entire region which makes use of the now erratic , destructive , and uncertain river . What St. Louis asks is what New Orleans wants , and this is what Memphis , Yicksburg , Cairo , and the masses of the people in several large and populous States believe should be granted for their relief and gain . The bill that was prepared in this interest provides that the river , from the Falls of St. Anthony to the jetties , be permanently improved under the direction of the Secretary of War and the chief engineers of the army ; that $8,000,000 be appropriated for said improvement , and that a similar sum be annually expended under the direction of the Secretary of War until the river is permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has had so much to do with the development of the new St. Louis as a manufacturing centre , comes from Illinois , the bulk of it being obtained within from ten to twenty miles of the city . St. Louis is itself built over a coal bed , and the fuel was once mined in Forest Park , though not profitably . The Illinois soft coal is found to be the most economical for making steam . It is sold in the city for from $1 15 to $1 50 a ton . The Merchants ' Exchange has it hauled to its furnaces in wagons for $1 56 a ton , but Mr. Morgan , the secretary-  --  to whom I am greatly indebted for many facts respecting the commerce of the city-says that those manufacturers who buy the same coal by the car-load get it cheaper . All southern Illinois , across the Mississippi , is covered with coal . Fifty or sixty miles farther south in that State a higher grade of bituminous coal is found , and marketed in St. Louis for household use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it costs between 25 and 30 per cent . more . The Exposition and Music Hall Bullding was the subject of what was perhaps the first great expression of the renewed youth of the city . It is a monument to the St. Louis of to-day . It is said to be the largest structure used for " exposition " purposes in this country since the Centennial World 's Fair at Philadelphia . // It is 506 feet long , 332 feet wide , and encloses 280,000 feet of space . The history of its construction is one of those stories of popular co-operation and swift execution of which St. Louis seems likely to offer the world a volume . A fund of three-quarters of a million was raised by popular subscription six or seven years ago , and the building was finished within twelve months of the birth of the project . It is built of brick , stone , and terra-cotta , has a main hall so large that a national political convention took up only one nave in it , contains the largest music hall in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smaller entertainment hall to accommodate 1500 persons . The famous pageants and illuminations which mark the carnival in that city are coincident with the opening of the exhibitions . Six of these fairs have been held in this building , each continuing forty days , and showing the manufactured products of the whole country , but principally of the Mississippi Valley . The merchants and manufacturers of St.Louis naturally make a very important con tribution to the display . I say " naturally , " because this busy capital of the centre of the country and of its main internal water system has an imposing position as one of the greatest workshops and trading-points of the nation . In the making of boots and shoes no Western city outstrips St. Louis , and her jobbing trade in these lines is enormous , and rapidly increasing . Boston , the shoe-distributing centre of the country , sent 310,500 cases of goods to St. Louis in 1891 , as against 288,000 to Chicago and 284,000 to New York . The gain in the manufactured product of St. Louis was 17 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than 40 per cent . The Shoe and Leather Gazette of that city makes the confident prediction that , " at this rate of progress , in five years St. Louis will lead the world in the number of shoes manufactured and in the aggregate distribution of the same. ** She has an enormous flour-milling interest , having sold in 1891 no less than 4,932,465 barrels of flour . Her 14 mills in the city have a capacity of 11,850 barrels a day , and her 16 mills close around the city , and run by St. Louis men and capital , grind 9850 barrels a day . The city turned out 1,748,190 barrels and the suburbs 1 , 542,416 barrels in 1891 . In the neckand-neck race in flour-milling between St. Louis and Milwaukee , St. Louis has recently suffered through the loss of a large mill by fire . The figures for the two cities are , St. Louis , 1,748,190 barrels ; Milwaukee , 1,827,284 barrels . It is seen that our reciprocal treaties with the Central and South American countries and the islands off Qur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , as well as in many other commodities . While I was in St. Louis , in the early spring of 1892 , a large shipment of flour had been made to Cuba , where the duty on that staple had been reduced from nearly five dollars to one dollar a barrel . The city exported 344,506 barrels to Europe , and sold more than two millions of barrels to supply the Southern States . Cotton is received in St. Louis from Missouri , Oklahoma , Kansas , Arkansas , Texas , and Indian Territory . It seeks that way to the East , and as much passes on as is stopped in St. Louis . It is used to a slight extent in manufactures there . A wooden-ware company in the city sells fully one-half of all that ware that is marketed in the country , and manufactures , or controls the manufacture , in many places . The largest hardware company in the country which does not make , but carries on a jobbing trade in those goods is a St. Louis institution . The saddlery and harness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a trade of six millions ; the new and growing trade in the manufacture of electrical supplies reached a value of five millions last year ; four millions in wagons and carriages was an item of the city 's manufactures ; the making of lumber , boxes , sashes , doors , and blinds amounted to five millions ; of paints , to three millions , and of printing , publishing , and the periodical press , to eight and a quarter millions . The businesses of the manufacture of iron and iron supplies , brass goods , and drugs and chemicals are all very large . Within ten years the furniture-making industry has doubled , and there are now 57 furniture factories , employing 4000 men , and making $5 , 500,000 worth of goods . St. Louis is said to be the only city that increased its operations in this respect in 1891 . The territory of distribution was largely extended , and now includes Mexico and the Central American States . The fact that the city is a // great hard-wood lumber market , coupled with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is another line in which St. Louis , among the larger cattle depots , made a unique progress . She handled more than three-quarters of a million of cattle , nearly half a million of sheep , 1,380,000 hogs , and 55,975 horses and mules . The only falling off was in the horse and mule trade , and that was due to the supremacy of electric and cable power over horse - power on street railroads . St. Louis is still the great mule market of the country . The city caters to human weakness by an enormous output of beer and tobacco . Of each of these luxuries she makes fourteen millions of dollars ' worth annually . Here is the largest lager-beer brewery in the country , if not in the world , and the city is third in the list of brewing towns . The business excited the interest of English capital , and a syndicate bought up a great number of the breweries , but the two largest remain the property of the original companies . Twenty millions of dollars are invested in this trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into Canada and Mexico , and even into Australia and Europe . St. Louis is our biggest market for manufactured tobacco . Thus the principal depots of the trade compare with one another : Pounds . Total sales of chewing and smoking tobacco in the United States 243,505,848 St. Lonis 52,214,862 Fifth New Jersey District 22,000,000 cincinnati 21,000,000 Petersbnrg , virginia 18,000,000 Of plug tobacco , 44,503,098 pounds were taxed as the city 's product in 1891 ; of smoking tobacco , about 5,682,000 pounds ; and of fine-cut chewing tobacco , 314,702 pounds . The cigars made there numbered fifty-three and a quarter millions . St. Louis has twenty-three national and State banks and four trust companies with a joint banking capital of $29,661,075 . The city is one of the two second-class national banking depositories , New York being the other , and Washington ( the United States Treasury ) being the one of 2 the first-class . In the monetary strain of 1891 , St. Louis developed a reserved financial strength which enabled its banks not only to supply the bare needs , but to very substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified city , with every sign of wealth in its commervon . Lxxxv. - No. 510-91 cial and residence districts , and with a shopping district whose windows form a perpetual world 's fair . The knowledge of the value of tasteful and attractive shop-window displays always accompanies push and prosperity in a city , and in this respect none in America excels this one . Yet it offers a chance to compare modern customs in this respect with the shabby inert ways of the traders of the past . To see the contrast it is only necessary to leave the centre of Broadway and walk to where that street passes the French Market . Here is the cramped , careless untidiness of half a century ago ; but the place has a distinct interest for a New-Yorker , because it is his Eighth Ward transplanted . The same low brick houses , the same dormer - windows , the same cheap signs , and the stalls and stands and tiny shops that are found near Spring Street market are all repeated . But it is easy to change one 's point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the most open , clean , and clear of settlements . This can be accomplished by going out to Grand Avenue and beyond , and riding through the dwelling districts . There one sees broad tree-lined streets , costly houses , and many beautiful semiprivate , courtlike streets that are the seats of pretty homes . In this neighborhood are the parks which are the crown and glory of the city . Some , like Forest Park , boast nature 's beauties merely tidied and treasured up ; but others show the blending of human taste with natural greenery and blossom adorned by statuary and fountains . But St. Louis is rich otherwise in those possessions which have elsewhere been described-her fine theatres , her clubs and churches , her great fire-proof hotel , her schools , and her old and cultivated society . The levee along the river-side is worth a visit . It is diametrically different in itself and its atmosphere from the city that lies back of it , and that seems so familiar to a New - Yorker . It is a wide and imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not Western ; it is Southern . Hides , wool , cotton , and tobacco are heaped about on the wharfboats , which seem to cling to the levee with gangways that are like the antennae of an insect . There is a line of huge oldtime river packets , looking as open and frail as bird-cages , but with towering black funnels from which jet smoke curls // lazily up . Beyond is the turgid , hurrying river . The street along the top of the levee is a single line of warehouses and shops . The latter recall those of our own water-side in New York . In place of our bronzed and bearded salt-water men , here are shiftless white laborers and negro roustabouts . But the same petty traders are among them , keeping drinking - places and stands for the sale of brass watches and rings , dirks , brass knuckles , pistols , cartridges . Cheap gin , cheaper clothing , and still cheaper jewelry are the prime articles all along the thoroughfare , precisely as in New York or Liverpool or Havre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mississippi , as is the case in New Orleans , and the cities between there and St. Louis . It is mud-colored , and seems thick and soupy , whether it is or no . I was assured that it was second in high sanitary qualities to the Nile water , which is still muddier . It used to be said that the sum of the collective ambition of St. Louis was represented by a pretty woman with jewels in her ears and mounted on a thoroughbred horse . Women , horses , and diamonds , in other words , were the things dearest to its heart in the by-gone days . I do not know whether this taste has changed with the inrush of new inhabitants . They certainly have the fine horses in plenty , and St. Louis is likely long to maintain her fame as a seat of womanly beauty . Having observed several very large and splendid jeweller 's shops that are a notable feature of the showy business streets , I went into one of the finest and inquired of the manager whether the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behold his answer : " There is no one of moderate means in St. Louis who does not own and wear diamonds , " said lie ; " however , they are not worn as large as formerly . Two and a half carats is the size of the largest stones now worn by men or women . The ladies who possess ear-rings still wear them , but few are now bought . There is no nonsensical law , such as obtains in London and Paris , making it bad form to wear diamonds in the daytime . Those who have them wear them when they please . " The Chief of Police , Mr. Lawrence Harrigan , assured me that there is no fixed gaming-place in St. Louis-not one regu lar " game , ** even of poker . The l ) eople did not want it , and the police did not want it , so it was stopped , lie said . The men play at their homes , in clubs , and in the hotels , but I saw no sign of any indulgence in cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , next to New Orleans , in the country . I do not mean to say that the city is a moral one , for its people are distinctly human , and the imperfections of their lives are apparent and , in some respects , lively . The theatres are open seven nights in the week , and , while Friday is the play - going night for the fashionables , Sunday is the night for the people . They have an American Sunday in St. Louis . It is the same as what we in the East call a European Sunday . But it becomes apparent to whoever travels far in the United States that the only Sunday which deserves a distinct title is that of England , New England , and the Atlantic coast . The Sunday of Chicago , San Francisco , Cincinnati , New Orleans , St. Louis , and most of the larger cities of the major part of our . land is European , if you please ; but it is also American . In St. Louis the theatres , groggeries , dives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refreslunent places of every kind are all kept wide open . The street cars carry on their heaviest trade , and the streets are crowded then as on no other day of the week . On the other days the city keeps up , in great part , the measure of its old river-side hospitality , a survival of the merry era of the steamboats . The numerous night resorts  --  the variety and music halls , the dance - houses and the beer - gardens , blaze out with a prominence nothing gets by day . To conclude , in the language of the editor of one of the several thoroughly equipped newspapers of the city : " St. Louis prefers to do business according to safe and creditable doctrines , and to wiii success by honestly deserving it . ilciexperience has vindicated her policy . She has never taken a step backward . She does her business with her own money . She has multiplied her mercantile and manufacturing establishments , her blocks of niagnificent buildings , and her facilities of trade in every direction out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she will be in the future  --  the country 's best example of a truly thrifty city .
