txt Many people high in official position have been much surprised at the recent revelations concerning the part which 8 . B. Elkins has taken in the fur-seal scheme which Mr. Blaine tried to carry through secretly and then publicly attempted to place the shame of it on John Bull . Mr. Elkins was brought into this job in the following manner and for the following reasons : When the new contract was awarded last year , the North American Commercial Company of San Francisco , consisted of only five incorporators  --  Isaac Siebas , D. 0 . Mills , Lloyd Ferris , Albert Miller , and one other citizen of San Francisco . Elkins , at . the time of the renewal of the lease , was interested in another company which was chartered in West Virginia , and called ' itself the " Atlantic and Pacific Company . " He was bidding then in good faith for himself and associates , and the day the bids were opened he was in attendance at the Treasury Department , " and then went immediately over to Blaine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract . " Mills got the contract . He thought that there were millions of seals and plenty of Influence behind him . He did not - want any more associates  --  he intended to float a joint-stock company if the venture was not very profitable , and to hold it with his five associates if it was . But when the result of last Summer 's work came down and Prof. Elliott , the best authority on seals , declared that these fur-seal rookeries were in danger of commercial ruin unless sealing by the lessees was at once checked , as well as sealing in the ocean , then Mr. Mills became anxious . Something had got to he done . He was above any such business as lobbying at Washington . He could not think of such a thing . Who could he get ? Now Elkins loomed up , bland , oily , and effusive . He was the man , of course . Why not ? He was Windom 's business associate , was Blaine 's business associate , was Russell Harrison 's master , and had repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal work connected with the many railroad and mining jobs which have made Elkins so notorious all over the West . Mills took Elkins right on . He was the ready , all-round hustler , and his pull was " immense . " Elkins thought very little of such a contingency as the pablie asking any questions about this matter . He was used to political rough-and-tumbling , and sailed in to persuade Blaine and Foster that the proper thing to do was to take care of Mills , Elk-Ins and company , said let the British get all the blame of the shameful act he was to accomplish . Blaine , not seeing far ahead enough this time , attempted to meet the wishes of Partner Elkins , and in so doing he was uncovered at the last moment , when he was chuckling over the fact that the season would soon open , with his friends in full swing on the seal islands , literally ruining them while the British Minister slept and trusted for an " early settlement " There is a good deal of dynamite left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them left .
