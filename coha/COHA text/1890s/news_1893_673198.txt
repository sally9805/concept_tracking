txt The announcement that the city authorities were opposed to the bill providing for a moderate but reasonable extension of the range of investment for the deposits of savings banks in this State was probably somewhat puzzling to many people . What have the city authorities to do with the management of savings banks ? Why should they concern themselves with the fate of this bill , unless indeed it was such as to threaten the safety of deposits and thereby that of the important financial institutions in which the mass of people were most deeply concerned ? The fact that the very able and conservative officers and managers of the institutions in question were urging the legislation that would enlarge the scope of investment was sufficient assurance that it was not only safe but in the interest of the depositors in the savings banks . It seems that the motive of the " city authorities , " who are apt to be taken as synonymous with the political power that rules the city , was to be found in quite a different direction . It is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings banks under their present close restriction as a means of coercing them into taking municipal bonds at a low rate of interest and sustaining the credit of the City Government . The savings banks of this city are said to hold now 70 per cent . of all the municipal bonds issued in this State , and they do not deem it wise to increase the proportion . They did not take so many of the 3 per cent . bonds of this city offered in January as was desired , because they found other means of investing their funds at equal or better advantage . They wish to have such facility and discretion in making investments as not to be compelled to take the bonds of New York cities and towns without regard to the volume of issue or the rate of interest in order to keep their surplus funds from lying idle . In this they are perfectly right , and there is no propriety in an interference with legislation by the city authorities as a means of forcing the savings banks to accept municipal bonds against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the methods of maintaining the credit of this city . If it can not hold its own in a perfectly free and untrammeled market in competition with cities outside of the State . like Boston , Philadelphia , Chicago , and Cincinnati , we had better have some means of knowing it , and there could be no better test than allowing our savings banks to invest in the securities of those cities . In short , in prescribing limits by legislation for the investment of savings ba.nkdeposits , the one consideration should be safety . If that is made certain , the wider the limits the better . The bonds of the seven cities designated in the Bloodgood bill are no safer than those of the nine cities which the savings bank officers propose to add or those of the fifteen or twenty more that would be included by the provisions of the Mullin bilL The interference of city authorities or city politicians , not in behalf of savings banks or their depositors , but in behalf of a scheme to bolster up the city 's credit , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
