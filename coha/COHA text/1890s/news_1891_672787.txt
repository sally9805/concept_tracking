txt Although Chief Inspector Byrnes has but part of the facts relating to a blackmailing scheme which he has frustrated by arresting the schemer , William H. Walsh , or H. K. Williams , a clerk with James H. Taylor &; Co. , ooffee merchants , 91 Wall Street . he was able last night to tell a remarkably interesting story of the prisoner 's dastardly rascality and to establish that the records of the Detective Bureau do not show that he has ever had an equal in coldblooded , designing villainy . The fellow 's Intended victim was Henry W. Box , a Buffalo lawyer . who is not only well known and esteemed in his profession , but regarded as one of the elite of his city . Mr. Box is the head of the firm of Box , Norton &; Bushnell , whose offices are at 311 Main Street , Buffalo , where Justice Charles Daniels of the Supreme Court has an office . His home is at the Niagara , and several years ago he adopted as his daughter an estimable young girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fifteen years bookkeeper in a crockery house in Buffalo . Mr. Box did not know him , but it appears that Walsh interested himself in his family affairs , and believed that he bad discovered a disgraceful and humiliating Bearet on which he would trade . Walsh four years ago left Buffalo and was , by inclination rather than through necessity , drawn into the " bucket shop " business down town . but he had abandoned it for his present occupation nearly nine months when he opened his campaign on Mr. Box by writing the following letter dated New-York , Aug. 18 , 1891 : " An impecunious friend of mine in Buffalo sends Me the foundation of what would be interestin reading if woven together , as some of those scandalloving sensational papers can do , with a request that I try to cull it . It reflects on your adopted daughter and designs to undeceive her as to her being the orphan or otherwise related to any but very common parents , and he assures me that there is no question as to the truth of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . nor do I think I shat ! , although an otter or half or what I conk ' sell It for would be acceptable . I can assure you that it the amount is forwarded I could put a quietus on the whole thing . What do you think of it i " Mr. Byrnes says that the letter was signed " Williams . " He does not give the address to which an answer was to be sent . and can not at present give Mr. Box 's reply , which went by return of post , but he furnishes " Williams 's " further correspondence . Aug. 21 " Williams " wrote : " Yours received , but although the language is a little severe . terms are satisfactory . Remit me by drat mail a five-hundred dollar bill registered to same address , and 1 Shalt get out of the - UMW States before Saturday , and send you a letter that will enable you to positively prevent any more robbery , as you call it . 1 consider It only a loan . " Five days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Yoti did not think it worth while to even answer my last letter . All right ; I will first write your daughter , and then let your enemy take his course . " This letter bringing no answer , " Williams " wrote again Aug. 29 , saying : " Not hearing from you I presume you think more of your hard-earned dollars than you do of your daughter 's happiness . We are frightfully hard up . and a Lew thousands would do us more good than it would hurt you . If I do not hear from you within this week through a personal In the New-York will write Miss pane ; also your wife . Your daughter was at a boarding school here , but I have not yet learned whether she is still there , but will dud out . " Oct. 14 , " Williams " wrote : " You are playing with me . I guess . All right , I 'll show you I am not fooling . While , of course , I would rather have money , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but I at least can have my revenge and on Monday next I shall begin to circulate such information among the Burial ? 400 as will be only anin , ying to you and yours . It will be very humiliating to you . If my figures are too high , with a view to a speedy financial setdornent you put a price on it yourself say e1,000 ? and advise me by personal If you have n't done so . 1 In return I will send an account which will enable you positively to prevent a recurrence or this matter forever . Further eorresponde nee is unnecessary . I want to encrthe whole matter this week . " This letter was received after Mr. Box had taken advice from friends and officials , and had asked Justice Daniels as an old friend to aid him by plaoing the case in the hands of the New York pollee , and Justice Daniels was assured by Mr. Box that he would pursue the blackmailer relentlessly . On the 16th lust Justice Daniels called on Inspector Byrnes and the blackmailing letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discussed and agreed upon . Detective Sergeants Prink and Titus were assigned to the case , and they first got Mr. Box to send a registered letter for " Williams " to the general Post Office here . " Williams " did not call for it , but he wrote the following to Mr. Box , dated Oct 21 : " Call od your dogs of war . There is something wrong . You are trying to play me false . Ail right ; I 'll make it uncomfortable for you . I may not attain my desire , but you assuredly can not escape me . I told you there was note soul beanie myself knew anything about the matter . I will not make ar . rangements whereby anything may happen MC , and what you wish to avoid will certainly come out . I thought your last letter was suspicious  --  the feigned changing of your mind and recalling your first letter on the pretence of not being sure or my getting It . " I have nothing to lose , and am. fairly indifferent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall lose it ? that is , your peace of mind . You have plenty of time to put a personal in Saturday 's ? assuring me that your letter was not a decoy and that your emissaries are not trying to shadow Inc . Any attempt to trace me through this address will recoil on yourself . I wash my hands of this financial business atter this week , and after that , sweet revenge . " A little later came a note from H. K. Williams asking the Postmaster to forward his mall to G. W. Smyth , 67 New Street . This is Percival &; Stetson 's " bucket shop , " and Smyth Is their clerk . Of course the letter carrier who took " Williams 's " mail there was shadowed by the detectives . Smyth , when he saw the registered letter , declined to receive it , and it went back to the General Post Office . " Williams " kept quiet until yesterday , when an envelope direoted to Smyth was received at the General Post Office with a note from " asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope and forwarded . Tale led the detectives again to Smyth , who received the envelope and thrust It into his pocket . He was kept under surveillance until he went into the street , when he was put under arrest . At Police Headquarters he appeared to be frank in his statement that " Williams " was William H. Walsh of West Twenty-first Street . He knew aim first , he said , in 1888 , when he was clerk in J. C. Allen 's " bucket shop " in New Street . They worked together until last year , when Walsh went to Taylor Ss Co. ' s . Recently Walsh sent for him , he said , and told him that be was trying to borrow money and that he had a friend named Williams in Buffalo who had letters in the New-Pork Post Ottioe and wanted him to get them for him . Smyth did not satin faotorily ( ; explain why he consented to be a oat 's paw and get several letters for Williams and give them to Walsh , in view of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that when tho envelope came yesterday be started to go to Wall street to deliver it to Walsh . Smyth bad in his possession a letter from Walsh , dated " Jersey City , Oct. 26 , " which said that he expected a registered letter from a Mr. Box of Buffalo , and that as he , Walsh , was going out of town for a few days Smyth would do him a favor by getting it . Smyth was able and appeared willing to identify the letters received by Mr. Box as written by Walsh . Smyth was detained and detectives found Walsh at Taylor &; Co. ' s , Fritik told Walsh that he Was under arrest and could come quietly or make a fuss as he might ohooee , but Waleh said : " Do n't say anything , I 'll get my coat and go quietly . " and he kept his word . On the way to Police Headquarters Walsh asked why he was arrested and when told " for blackmailing " Mr. Box , he bad no more to say . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tee letters . Smyth was produced , and then he admitted everything except the writing of the letters , which , he said , he received for " a third party . " Mr. Byrnes decided to hold both Smyth and Walsh , and notified Mr. Box of the arrests , andreceived word that he would be in New-York today .
