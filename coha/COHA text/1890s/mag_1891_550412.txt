I. John P. Long . THINK the New England of forty or fifty years ago has been subjected , in the social and general features of its country town life , to a radical change , and will nevef* in those respects , return to its former sort . For two hundred years , till 1840 or 1850 , its towns remained practically unchanged in the character , habits , living , and occupations of their inhabitants ; or , perhaps I should say , moved in a current of slow development along the same lines . Since that time there has been a rapid and fundamental shaking up and dispersion of elements . The overwhelming inrush of foreign immigration ; the injection of foreigners distributed along every line of railroad embankment and around every mill wheel , being at first engaged in the construction of the means of material enterprise , but next multiplying in numbers and flowering out in thrifty , permanent citizenship ; especially also the railroad system itself which has fairly sucked the native New England population into the maelstrom of city life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there offered for the swift acquirement of wealth , - all these and other causes have wrought the revolution . The old family trees have been remorselessly stripped and shattered . The winter school , that used to have in the farming country dist#icts fifty or sixty scholars , " great big " boys on the back seats , " fellers " and girls chewing gum , sliding down hill , going to spelling school , yet turning out ultimately as the very bone and sinew of a vigorous New England life , have now wilted to a meagre and straggling attendance of small urchins . The soldiers of the Revolutionary War , and the men of their time , ( and they were the best blood of Pilgrim and Puritan descent ) that went a century ago to the farms of Maine , and the hill towns of what was then remote in Massachusetts , and made a spirited yeomanry with their well-filled churches , their saw-mills and stores , their turnpikes and stage-coaches , their trainings an*l musters , their justice courts and vigorous townmeetings , their great fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pretentions and distinctions in social life ,  - -  have now to a great extent , outside of the central villages , a diminishing number of representatives left , except when some millionnaire jauntily comes back , after a half-century 's absence , for a few summer weeks , and starts a fancy stock-farm for tosses a public library to the old Common where he used to play ball , or drive home his father 's cows . Many an outlying rural mansion , almost aristocratic in its day with its white paint and green blinds , with hollyhocks in the yard , and mahogany and dainty china in the interior , is now in a dilapidated old age , crushed under a mortgage , or bought for a song by some wanderer from foreign shores . But this is not finality ; it is simply transition . It has been the result , not of the depressidn , but of the prosperity of our country for the last thirty years - a prosperity which has given such activity to its centres of population that the mobile elements of American enterprise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , to the cities from the towns , to the valleys from the hills , to the prairies from the rocks , and to the mill wheels from the sheep pasture . A reaction is sure to come . It will come from the steady increase of general wealth , which , as a matter of taste , of change , of novelty , as well as investment , will flow back again . It will come more and more speedily as now the public lands , the domain of which until recently seemed inexhaustible , are more and more occupied ; and as the pioneer , finding no longer the boundless room of the West , turns his face to the sunrise and finds that New England // has still , in her soil , resources of product and maintenance , and that , in fact , during all this transition time , there have been those who remained on the paternal acres and have made them pleasant and profitable . Indeed in the tuwns about the birthplace of any of us , there are here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , has already begun to come , more than some are aware , in the fact that our citizens of foreign birth are seeking and have sought the New England farms , and are there going through the experiences which made our own ancestors self-supporting farmers ; to wit , living prudently , saving their money , making no show of dress or equipage or lavish living , and raising large families of boys and girls , and keeping them at work indoors and out of doors , at home . There is no fear for the future of New England rural life . It will be a different life from that of a generation or two ago . It will be , not a unique , but a conglomerate population . It will not be of one faith , but of many faiths . It xviii not be a Puritan New England , but will be the New England of the twentieth century , with a seaboard rich in foreign commerce , - with great cities ,  --  with factories and all sorts of skilled industries dotting its inland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere from hamlet to centre , - and with its fields and farms cultured and productive , furnishing the living and profit of the farmer who depends on the soil , or representing the wealth and leisure of those who retire or turn to country life and expend upon it the surplus of their profits gained in commerce or manufacture . II . George B. Loring . IN considering the future of the New England country , we naturally review the past , and are guided by the facts which are already recorded in history . It is but a century since the population of Massachusetts was not more than three hundred thousand . Boston had only thirteen thousand souls . The entries of foreign and coasting vessels into that port were about three hundred annually , and the clearances were about four hundred . The valuation of all the property of Massachusetts , including the Province of Maine , was about ten millions only . The travel on the great line to New York was more than accommodated by two stage coaches and twelve horses . The strangers who visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No bridges spanned the Charles or the Mystic . In Essex County , one of the oldest and most populous sections of the colony , there were only three post-offices , and the appointment of these postmasters was all the patronage of that kind which the illustrious chief magistrate or his postmaster-general possessed . A weekly mail was a luxury ; a weekly newspaper was all that the most inquisitive or ambitious could obtain for the gratification of their curiosity or the ventilation of their views . The school-system of Massachusetts , even , the most cultivated of all the New England States , was most primitive . Here and there an academy , simply organized , conducted by a strict disciplinarian whose scholarship was undoubted , constituted all the means by which young men were prepared for college . No school of theology or law , and but one of medicine existed . Children were educated in district schools called " outskirts " and sometimes " squadron " institutions . The senior class in Harvard college counted only twenty-seven students , and Harvard was the only college in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man just entering on the profession wrote to a friend : " The profession by which I am to get my bread , nay , the very coat in which I can at present exercise it , is denied . " The clergy were the social autocrats , and ruled their parishes with a rod of iron , while with supreme authority and assurance they pointed the way to heaven . The farmers , who constituted the bulk of the population , living in exceedingly simple dwellings , xvearing largely homespun , led isolated lives , and were dis // tinguished for sturdiness of purpose , rather than for any grace of mind or body . Farming was a rude , while a successful occupation . The plough , the flail , and the sickle were clumsy and would now be considered useless . The territory of New England was occupied by farms large and small , in which all grace and beauty were ignored before the universal demand for profit and a good living . A refined and beautiful country residence was hardly known . The residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rarely , even in midsummer , journeyed either to the mountains or the sea , and never enjoyed the luxury of a summer home . Of the habitations of these people the author of the " Memoirs of an American Lady , " says : " The house I had so much delight in recollecting had no pretension to grandeur and very little to elegance . . . Through the middle of the house was a very wide passage with opposite front and back doors , which in summer admitted a stream of air peculiarly grateful to the languid senses . Valuable furniture was the favorite luxury of these people . " The same author assures us that the lives of her cultivated friends " besides being passed in unruffled peace and prosperity afford few of those vicissitudes which astonish and arouse . " And of the great mass of mankind who lived outside of the small towns and cities , we are told that they had " plenty of the necessaries of life , but no luxuries . Their wives and daughters milked the cows and wrought *t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porticos , and a fine stream beside the dxvelling and some Indian wigwams near them . They were wood-surrounded and seemed absolutely to live in the bosom of nature , screened from all the artificial ills of life ; and those spots , cleared of incumbrances , yet still in native luxuriance , had a wild originality about them not easily described . " Wilson , the ornithologist , a Pennsylvania Scotchman , a confirmed grumbler , but a shrewd judge , and the most thorough of American travellers , said , as late as i8o8 : " My journey through almost the whole of New England has rather lowered the Yankees in my esteem . Except a few neat academies , I found their schoolhouses equally deserted and ruinous with ours ; fields covered with stones ; stone fences ; scrubby oaks and pines ; wretched orchards ; scarcely one grain field in twenty miles ; the taverns along the road dirty and filled with loungers brawling about lawsuits and politics ; the people snappish , and extortionous , lazy , and two hundred years behind the Pennsylvanians in agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and was convinced that the tastes of the people were simple enough to be " satisfied with college commencements and sleigh rides as an amusement . " Their landscape was not adorned with flower gardens and lawns , but they took care to plant near their dwellings the American elm , which to-day towers above the farmhouse which it has watched so many years ; and which stands even , now , the monument to the social and domestic virtues , and the integrity and courage and honesty of the generations who have gathered beneath its shade . They rejoiced in the " wild originality " about them . A century has rolled round since the state of things which I have described existed . Had , the American of that early day predicted the facts of this he would have been counted a visionary and a dreamer . Leaving the thirteen thousand people of his admirable and beloved Boston , with its crooked streets and cowpastures , he could now wander through the twenty large cities of Massachusetts , and return to his home , thronged with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some adventure of mind and body and estate . He could reach the Pacific Coast in less time than he formerly occupied in passing from Boston to Philadelphia . The arts , the sciences , the industries of modern life , would astonish the venerable inhabitant of our old New England . His discourse of last evening would be read in every city in this Union in the morning papers , if he had recited any fact of universal interest or general sensation . His rustic home would be adorned with reproductions of the " Angelus " or Rosa Bonheur 's horses . The refinements of philosophy would have cleared away the theological perplexities of his ancestors . A long procession of two hundred and twelve seniors would pour through the gates of Harvard , and a // college known as Yale , new to his vision , would count a score more as her new recruits in the army of scholars . The " outskirt " and the " squadron " would have disappeared , and the stately high school would fill their places , and struggle to eclipse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moderate methods of this man 's mind , the intellectual activity of the present would be bewildering and confusing . The audacity of investigation has taken the place of accepted dogma , and in mind and morals the community has assumed new duties and new obligations . The soil of the New England states is occupied by an agricultural industry very different from that which existed a century ago . When this territory fed and clothed almost the entire population , there was a uniformity of occupation which prevailed in all sections . A farm in Berkshire county was similar to a farm in Essex ; and the characteristics of the people were the same in both counties . But sixty years ago that great manufacturing industry sprang up which has changed the whole aspect of the states and the condition of society . Over a large portion of New England have sprung up centres of a most active and industrious character , established by able and energetic men , and conducted by the best and most comprehensive capacity . In these towns and cities we find the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , managing the schools , and controlling the order and well-being of society . We find also an ample market for all that the farmers can produce on adjoining lands ; and the cultivation of New England soil has left the remote regions and has clustered around these more favored and encouraging spots . Not only in the management of farms , but in the general character of the people has the influence of these populous centres become strongly felt . XVe hear much of the distinguished sons of our ancient and perhaps now declining towns . We are told how these towns furnished the leaders of society and the state . General Ward , a rival of Washington as commander-in-chief of the revolutionary forces , lived on his farm in Shrewsbury . Samuel Osgood , colonel in the army , friend of Washington , first Postmaster-General of the United States was the son of a farmer in the town of North Andover . From the Connecticut Valley came the river-gods to control the policy of the commonwealth . From a farm in New Hampshire Daniel Webster came forth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About this time Benjamin Count Rumford shot like a meteor from the woods of Woburn , " exclaimed the fervid and excellent Quincy , in his famous Centennial oration at Harvard College . The farms were prolific in strong and controlling men . And so they are in our day . A chronicler of Berkshire County has recently given a long list of remarkable men of our time who passed their boyhood and hardened their . muscles in the toil of farms now deserted , - the Fields of Stockbridge , Governor Morgan of the little town of Washington , and a long line of merchants and authors and editors whose opinions the community has accepted and followed , and whose wealth has added to the industrial revenue of our country . An eloquent writer in the Greei*feld Gazelle " deploring the fact that the rural pop*ilation " of New England , of Franklin County , of Colerain in particular , have seen their best days , says " Where are the once prosperous families that occupied the Eddy , the Smith , the Purington , and Wilson farms above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thrift on Catamount Hill , with their dairies and stock , and their ninety scholars ? * * Where is that long line of noble farmers that were so industrious and l ) rosperous , extending from North River over Christian Hill to the Green Mountains , and thcse cattle drovers and merchants that did more business than all the stores in a half-dozen Western towns to-day ? " It seems to me the answer to this is easy . This thrifty and energetic rural population , which once occupied these farms in Colerain and the adjoining towns , obedient to the laws of business , has transferred its energy to more favorable locations . Not far from Colerain are private fortunes , each one of which could have purchased that town in the days of its greatest ancient prosperity . The wealth of Greenfield and North Adams and Pittsfield and // Chicopee and Holyoke and Springfield , wealth created by those very men who were born on the deserted hillsides , is the pride and blessing of that section of the Commonwealth . The old drovers are gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in driving* the herds from Vermont , they could not feed a tithe of the population of the towns I have enumerated , who are nearer to-day to the great pastures of Arizona than their fathers were to the grazing lands of New England . Let the New Englander rejoice , therefore , that the great supplies of the West are brought to his very doors . Let him remember that the " half-dozen Western towns " referred to are not counted in the list of controlling forces on this continent , nor are they the points toward which the sons of Colerain have turned their footsteps ; but the great cities of the West , rivalling the other cities of the East , call constantly for the forces which are still found in our little towns . The city of Chicago points with pride to one successful merchant , born in the section of Massachusetts we are contemplating , whose sagacity and foresight and courage have made him the controlling force of his business companions . It is unfortunate that the little mountain towns of New England could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they may rejoice in the fact that they have been the nurseries of such a noble race . Does any one suppose that the crop of talent and capacity grown on a populous area of New England is smaller than it was when that area was divided into little scattered farms and occupied by a hard-worked isolated people ? The founders of one of our manufacturing cities - what have they to say with regard to the tireless ability exhibited in their foundation ? And what have those to say , also , who have developed and enlarged these active communities , from the simplicity of a town to the magnificence of a city ? Compare the intellectual activity of the present in ventors and learned men of Worcester with the strong men of that time when its citizens were engaged in tilling the soil ; and they may turn back with pride to the era of the Lincolns and Wards of an earlier day , but not with fear . Every busy and growing city in the Commonwealth can boastof similar capacity , every town can point with satisfaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle to attempt to enumerate a class from which have sprung the bold builders of our railroads , our senators , our vicepresidents , our presidents , our learned men , our philanthropists , our heroes , as great in our day as when the founding of our republic was the object of great popular effort . And when the great enterprises of our cities are examined , it will be found that they have been laid and brought to perfection by the sons of our rural population , who have established the great centres of trade , have constructed our imposing buildings , have adorned and beautified the charming homes which are gathered in these busy and prosperous centres of population . The men who have concentrated . the great industries of Connecticut and Rhode Island , are they not to be considered in comparison with that generation who nursed those commonwealths in the laps of their infancy ? And when we turn to Maine and New Hampshire and Vermont , they have not only preserved their own reputation , but they have furnished leaders whose services are counted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of our government , and have cherished and adorned it in our day . But the progressive spirit may be found not only in those who leave , but in those who remain upon the farms , and occupy the " country of New England . " I am warned , I know , that the rural population is decreasing , and that the families of the farmers are diminishing . But I am somewhat familiar with the farming towns of Massachusetts , and with the collections of persons who appear at our agricultural fairs ; and I can only say that I see no falling off either in numbers or the activity of those who own the land . It does not appear that any large number of farms has passed into the hands of foreigners , although I am aware that abandoned farms have been taken up and profitably managed by aliens who have set a good example to those who were born on the soil . The fairs , however , are managed , the committees are filled by , and // the officers of the societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest exhibitors . The professors in our agricultural colleges , the Secretary and Board of Agriculture are almost universally Americans . I do not state this invidiously , but merely to show that Americans are not deserting the land , and that they alone control the agriculture of New England , and are entitled to the credit of whatever improvements are made in this industry . We all know how primitive and simple were the crops in the antemanufacturing days of our country ; but to-day the skill of the farmer is exhausted in the cultivation of all special crops which the market demands , and which have taken the place of more general crops which once occupied all the farmer 's attention . Statistics on this point are interesting and convincing , and show how the opportunity of the landowner has increased as the population of the country has increased , and his industries have multiplied . In the state of Massachusetts , whose returns are most available , I find that the cultivated acres have increased from 881,402 in 1865 , to 939,260 in 1885 . I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 3,988 acres , valued at $1,024,236 in 1875 , to 8,851 acres valued at $3,088,826 in 1885 . The value of the products of the farm has increased from $37,073,034 in 1875 to 47,756,033 in 1885 . It is important to know of what this increase consists . In 1885 , the crop of strawberries amounted to 3,930,730 quarts , valued at $408,898 ; the crop of tomatoes amounted to 322,056 bushels , valued at $164,307 the cabbage crop amounted to 11,499,817 heads , valued at $55o,5 18 ; the amount of milk produced was 72,528,628 gallons , valued at $10,312,762 . There are many other crops of equal value , and they all indicate the readiness of the New England farmer to accept the situation , and to improve his business by occupying lands better adapted to it . And this is all there is in the abandonment of farms in New England . When the New England farmers gather around a manufacturing centre , they not only find an opportunity for a more elaborate and profitable cultivation of crops of a special nature adapted to the neighboring market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages which are found in thickly settled communities . All household comforts are within their reach . The lyceum and the lecture-room are at their very door . Institutions of learning invite the farmers ' children to that cultivation which makes them valuable teachers , or prepares them , in all the preliminary branches of training , for higher education and services in the professions , or in all those callings which are demanded by the construction of railroads and by the great architectural enterprises of the day . The farmer and his family move in a sphere which is beyond the reach of those who occupy the remote regions and are cut off from all the influences which society can bestow . But not to the cultivation of those faculties adapted to the severe work of life is this condensed society fitted , but to the development of those refined tastes which add so much to the joy of life and lead to the adornment and beautifying of the home . I have described what I consider the progressive nature of New England society , practically and *sthetically , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century has brought us . That this progress will continue there can be no doubt . New England can not pause now . Her vast accumulations of wealth and industrial enterprises will continue to increase in the years to come as they have in the years that are gone . Her genius for the most delicate manufactures will find a market lying all around her and increasing as time goes on . Her seacoast offers all the pleasure and refinement which a rich and cultivated people demand . Nowhere , from Eastport to the capes of Florida , can be found a more attractive range of coast or a more invigorating climate than exists along the shores of Maine and Massachusetts , Rhode Island and Connecticut . The attractions to the lovers of natural scenery which may be found in the " deserted farms , " and along the hills and valleys of New England , are everywhere recognized . And while those who seek for recreation are already thronging the hills and mountains , the lakes and the coasts of New England for health and rec // reation and repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide circle of land lying about them . I can recall an ancient town , one of the oldest in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , whose simple respectability was most attractive , in the former days . In that town there were good farms and good farmers . The selection of a neighboring water-power for the erection of great mills and the founding of a great city has already had its beautifying effect upon this outlying place . The charming hills are crowned with the costly homes of prosperous manufacturers . The old lanes bounded once by wild hedgerows of untrimmed bushes , have been converted into wide avenues running through well-cultivated fields whose limits are defined by well built walls . Handsome church architecture now stands not far from the old meeting house , and the modern schoolhouse has taken the place of the modest little building in which our ancestors were taught . The respectability of the old town remains , and all the memories which cluster around a spot famous for influence , and integrity , and cultivation , and patriotism . And added to that respectability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all the marks which prosperous industry will always create ; and the growing city is the centre of a refining influence as manifest as " the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land . " I can not doubt that these busy centres will increase and will exert their influence on the surrounding country . There is a section of the French Republic lying between Paris and Bordeaux , marked by continuous cultivation , gardens and vineyards , thriving towns , great regal estates , all radiant with historic interest , where man has toiled for centuries , and which indicates what time may do for New England . New England may be , will be , the home of the manufacturer , the gardener , the pleasure seeker , and a cultivated society . To the people of New England her traditions will always remain ; the influence of their ancestors will always be felt ; the effect of modern enterprise will not be lost ; and in her mills , and schools , and estates . and exact agriculture , and cultivated communities , and charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England Country . " In . Rev. Samuel W. Dike . " Mv invitation to contribute to this " symposium " is due , I suppose , to my various papers upon " The Religious Problem of the Country Town , " in the Andover Review , in 1884 and onward , and since that time in several other periodicals . I venture here soi*ie suggestions only , such as are prompted by more recent utterances of others and further reflection upon the subject . ( i . ) More real study is needed . We have a great many views taken of the country town and its problems . But this is not enough ; for these may be so partial as to be misleading , though quite correct as far as they go . To give an illustration : Two leading daily newspapers have contained a good many articles , both editorial and contributed , on the subject , that have not been very convincing to the student . Many of the facts set forth must be accepted as they are given ; but it is not easy always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lack of an impartial observer trained to scientific methods of study is felt . We soon become aware of some partisan end in view on one or both sides . The reader is soon made to feel that the tariff or some othet pet subject affects the judgment and even method of the writer ; that real facts are made to tell a defective story . True study will help us out of this difficulty . ( 2 . ) Broader work will give us larger results in study . We can not , for example , take the facts one chances to find in the carriage ride of a vacation , or at a single summer resort , or in a tier of towns one happens to know , for a just exhibition of the problem , until we have put them into their true position in a whole . Simple as this principle seems to be , its application // is not always made in practice . President Eliot even seems to me open to criticism at this point in his admirable study of a town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class far smaller than the reader of his instructive paper in the Cen/ury of August last is left to think . The two facts , that the population of the town increased according to his estimate , forty per cent in a decade , and the valuation doubled , take it out of the largest class of the country towns of New England , or of the country as a whole , and put it into a much smaller one . His town does stand for a class , but not for the larger class of country towns where population and wealth are stationary or declining , or at best very slowly increasing . A study is needed that will proceed on the careful classification of country towns by growth in population and wealth or the contrary , and a measurement of the volume in each class in these and other respects . ( i . ) The still wider , almost world-wide considerations should be brought to bear to enable us to interpret the facts and perceive the future . Isolation of position , singularity of conditions , count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of relative advantage , and for more in some respects of disadvantage . Communities , like men , can not any longer live wholly unto themselves , and so defy the outside world . Sheer force and industry without high skill go for less , relatively , in helping overcome levelling forces than they once did . Intelligence , thrift , are a common necessity . New England , the rural parts of the country everywhere , must move with the tide . Yet , much may be done against the current by the power of a high personality . The workings of both these elements must be considered . ( 4 . ) The industrial conditions are a powerful factor . Scarcely any other is more so . Property has been the tremendous developing and differentiating instrument of all modern society . Undoubtedly it is yet far from being brought into its true place in service of and in true subordination to the interests of personality . It is clear enough to many that in this respect the socialist demand has considerable substantial foundation . But on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the material world and of the production and distribution of wealth . Some of us who many years ago protested against the old Political Economy , with its " cash nexux " and subjection of Humanity to the bondage of selfishness , are now compelled to complain that the social reformers in economics are too much " in the air . " They seem to us to forget that all our spiritualized life is still , as it were , incarnated in a material world , an earthly society , and therefore to be developed under principles and laws that belong to both , in wise union . Study , intense , prolonged , and broad , will be extremely useful to show how deeply and inclusively industrial conditions enter into our present and future . Indeed , it is more truly sociological than otherwise . ( 5 . ) The problem is eminently sociological . I do not mean by this that its material lies in the field of sociology . This is clearly enough seen by most . The trouble is that many do not also see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociological quality of the material to something much more important , and that is to the bringing to bear upon it of the methods and principles of that science . That only is scientific treatment which attempts to do this . The facts of the country social life must be carefully collected , classified and weighed and tested qualitatively . The same ought to be done for its forces and institutions , and then the whole should be brought to the interpretation of the science that explains the structure and operations of this social order according as analysis , synthesis , comparison and historic explanation enable us to do this work . We all recall the criticism of Agassiz , when listening to a panegyric on the remarkable delineation of a famous geologist , to the effect that the accurate descrzjg5-lion in this work was not comparison , meaning that it is the latter that transforms the best accounts of nature into science . Comparative study is the new Archimedean lever of the present generation of social students . Comparison must go below facts to their underlying prin // ciples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the mere facts , to let alone their truths , and this only can lead us to successful classification . Mr. John Fisk 's little book , American Political Ideas , is for this reason worth volumes of old-fashioned American history . Freeman , Maine , Toynbee and Thorold Rogers applied to Weeden , and the growing material of our statisticians . and the special work of Johns Hopkins and other students , are samples of the kind of equipment needed . Sociological knowledge and methods are still too inchoate to be of the best service or easily available to more than a few . But enough exists to be highly useful and to make it clear that future work must be more and more in that direction . ( 6 . ) Some special lines of work and directions which our thought may well take , are briefly mentioned in conclusion . More and better statistical work is one of them . For we are by no means in possession of all the facts accurately described and arranged . A few years ago the general convention of congregational churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great expenditure of his time and generous use of his money , heartily entered into a measure I proposed in this direction , and did an original work of this kind of the greatest value . A religious and to some extent incidentally a social census of forty-four towns in Vermont was taken and published , with maps , diagrams , etc . Studies of the effects of numbers , wealth , and distance , and their distribution , were made . Something like this work has been repeated in other places ; but there is need of its systematic and persistent prosecution upon still broader plans , and over far wider fields . A state like Massachusetts , for instance , ought to have the enterprise to push such a work . The leading religious denominations alone , or possibly the State independently or in co-operation with them might carry the admirable work of its state census into the religious field , including perhaps investigation of social organizations like clubs and fraternities of various kinds . A comprehensive survey of these that would bring all into the range and shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , results , compared with their working force , the population , wealth of communities , etc. , would be of immensely greater value than the present material which the denominational statistics separately give . Not so much would have to be added to the present outlay for statistical purposes to insure these larger results , while any additional cost would be more than met by the saving in expenditure and more intelligent directions given to work that would inevitably follow . Indiana reports , or did report a few years ago , her churches as items in her official statistics . It would seem that the economic and other public concern in such facts give ample justification for this kind of civil statistics . A second line of inquiry is that of a scientific examination of our religious organizations and methods . I say scientific , for we have plenty of conventional studies of this sort . Take organization : A church is a social organization ; so is Christianity in any of its social forms . It , therefore , is capable of sociological study . Its own structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or with its parts . The influence of theory and tradition in shaping and fixing organizations , and the consequent advantages and disadvantages need to be carefully studied . I am persuaded that a scientific method of study applied to our . organizations for work would make clearer than even the results of practical experience have done , the great defects in ways of work . It is evident that the present forms used in carrying on religious work are wasteful of men and money . Practical men of experience see this ; but they are not prepared as they ought to be to solve the problems of readjustment ; for they lack scientific training in the great sociological field in which their practical work lies . As the school of mines and of scientific electricity lie back of and give intelligence and direction to practice , so it must sooner or later be the case in religious and other qwq into close agreement , to the benefit of each . At present the country pastor , so far as sociological principles and methods go , is left to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . It seems to me more than possible that the tendency to turn attention more to the home as a factor in rural work of undeveloped possibilities , as shown in the growing up of the Home Department of the Sunday school , may be followed by a greater use of educated women in the social improvement of country towns . In its way I think the Toynbee Hall idea for such young women has needs and possibilities in the country towns quite as great as in the cities . Help to a better understanding between people in and out of a village , and of parental duties , social opportunities , sanitary and hygienic conditions , to reading , to household economics , and other things , is needed in the country as well as in the city . A real community of life mingled with the best development of individual opportunities and domestic possibilities , is yet far from getting intelligent treatment by the leaders of rural life . Why may not the highly educated women of the day be drawn to these needy fields as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or not the education of the clergy and other teachers who are to work in the country , may be improved . Inability to think independently and yet soundly seems to me one of the most serious disqualifications of too large a part of the country clergy , though these are by no means so far behind their brethren of the larger villages and other parishes as one might think . The educated minister ought to be broader , quicker , surer in his efforts at re-adaptation than the business man . He should be more responsive to life and less hampered by mere tradition , yet he is often the reverse . Notwithstanding all the very great changes in collegiate and theological training , too few men have been trained into real freedom and self-mastery in their intellectual processes . Like a poor mechanic , they do not know how to find material to work it to the best advantage , and put things together in the best way . In other words , they are not educated at the very point to which true education aims . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it can be bought at two dear a price . Fertility in invention , the power to bring facts into their natural order and give them scientific explanation and practical value , are the qualities of mind which the pastor nee&amp;on the sociological side . And I can not help thinking that the public school teacher would be far more useful if more work should be done in teaching children , and even others , to observe and understand the material and social world about them . The former is often done . But social customs are not only as interesting and historical as plants and fossils ; they are far more important to the student now , ahd in his later life . Thus the education of the home and one s vocation are an intensely real part of life everywhere . Especially in the country should this fact be perceived and taken into the avowed work of educatiom We need to help people to make the most of home education . The power to think well about common things , one 's own work , the daily events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give a man . Many country people have this in a high degree . But a conscious possession of the processes and an insight into the methods of their work would add to their power and increase their pleasure in work . In short , educators may well give more attention in country towns to training young and old how to think well on common , everyday things and act according to the conclusions of a sound method of thought . TV . Rev. Geo ; ge A.Jackson . WILL the country towns of New England again become productive ? it is often asked . Productive of what ? Large crops , to compete with the deep-soiled West ? No . Of New England 's old-time and most precious crop-men ? Yes . This is the devout wish of every true // New Englander ; it is my own profound conviction . But the securing of such a priceless crop is to cost thought and effort . The earlier growth of sturdy New Englanders was like that of our virgin forests , which no man planted or pruned . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodlands as we need , attention must be given to the art of forestry . So if we would re-people our deserted hills with a vigorous stock , attention must be given to the man-growing art . We can not expect that the undirected forces of nature , any sociological law of demand and supply , will accomplish this . Men with wisdom and forethought must plan and work for the desired end . To know what direction this effort should take , we must recognize the causes which have operated and may still operate to deplete our country towns . I would suggest four which have been among the most , if not the most important . ( i . ) First , there was the rise of our manufacturing interests . It is now sixty years since the water wheel began to compete seriously with the plough . As is wellknown , the first operatives in our cotton and woollen mills were the sons and daughters of farmers , to whom the ready money and the opportunity to see something more of the world , afforded by the mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who had until then tilled our farms , and raised our distinctive New England crop , is shown by the character of the earlier work-people of the city of Lowell . The world had never seen before , and it has never seen since , a publication like The Lowell Offering . Nor had any other country seen such " factory girls " as Lucy Larcom and her compeers , who contributed to that sheet . And these Lowell operatives were representative of thousands who came down from the hills , to spin and weave in the mills that multiplied beside every stream in Massachusetts . If these others published no journals , they yet thought and wrote , as did those beside the Merrimac . Thi3 is testified by the hundreds of private albums , not photographic , but literary , which they handed down to their descendants . In how many families now filling the professions , or carrying on the great industrial and financial enterprise of the nation , are such albums cherished , as souvenirs of those transition days when the families came from the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not born to do what machines , or what men and women of less intelligence might do . When , therefore , the Irish famine and th' political disturbances in Europe sent swarms of laborers to our shores , the old stock left spindle and loom , not for the old farm , but for the minor workshops which demanded skill , and for stores and counting-rooms , and editor 's chairs , and schoolrooms , and hospitals , and courtrooms , and pulpits . Thus , while drawing upon our rural population for a quarter of a century , the factories for the last twenty-five years have ceased to attract our native people . Anxious as they may be to escape the tedium of farm life , few young men or women are to-day ready to exchange it for places in the great factories crowded by foreigners . And since the skill-requiring manufactories are measurably full , or even over-croxvded , we may say that this first depleting cause has spent its force . W* need not trouble ourselves about it . ( 2 . ) Another great draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands of the West . Horace Greeley 's " Go West , young man " has been heeded . When , instead of dodging between the rocks to hoe his father 's corn , a young man could go out and pre-empt a farm of his own which would yield half as much corn as his whole native township , it was a very loud call to go . And they went , not to western farms alone , but to western towns and cities and mines . They became to the great Northwest , leaders in thought , and enterprise ; they founded new New Englands , which in turn have founded others beyond . But this drain too , is ceasing . Fine farms of any value are now few and remote . For what it would cost to go to them with a family and put up the most modest of New England improvements , a man may buy here a farm all improved , where taxes are low , and schools and churches are , as compared with western distances , at his very door . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the open land that kept the Western labor market uncongested . Now that they are so nearly gone , the cities and towns are ceasing to call loudly for men - save to buy town lots - and in centres like Chicago there are more idle young men calling for work than in Boston . During the next decade , if present prices continue , I venture to affirm that the Westerners seeking farms in New England will outnumber the New England farmers going XVest . So we need not be concerned about this cause of depletion . Another , something like it , the cheap lands of the South , may , for a time draw off enough people to keep the prices of our farm lands from appreciating ; but in the nature of things that competition will soon cease . The day is at hand when the great mass of people born in New England will die in New England . ( 3 . ) A third cause for the abandonment of the farms , growing out of the first , has been a new sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Time was when this was not felt by them any more than by the old lady whom a Boston gentleman met in the back woods of Maine . " Where do you live ? " she asked . In Boston . " " Sakes alive ! how can you stand it to live so far away ? " But that time was before the sons and daughters who had gone to the new towns began to send back word of their stirring life ; before the distant whistle echoed among the hills , and the weekly paper brought more of the enterprise and advancement of the great world . With this new knowledge , the life which had once been accepted as a matter of course , began to seem cramped . The more ambitious boys , the brighter girls , wanted to see the world , and be a part of it . So the towns gathered other willing recruits . But the very causes which thus operated to produce a feeling of seclusion , as they became intensified , allayed that feeling . As railroads penetrated almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolis , as books and newspapers multiplied , and it became possible for the once remote farmers to hear daily of all that the world was doing and thinking , - he no longer had reason to feel secluded . In all southern New England there are now few regions where an enterprising man need feel himself out of touch with the throbbing life of the world . Concerning this third cause , therefore , we need give ourselves no serious uneasiness . ( *i* There remains , however , a fourth factor of our problem , which is a serious one , and which all who would rehabilitate New England country life should unite to correct . This is the feeling on the part of country people that their social status is inherently inferior to that of townspeople . " Pooh ! ' ' says your practical man ; " bread and butter determine those things , - not sentiment . " " No , sir , " I reply , " not with New Englanders . Sentiment , not royal taxes , led to Lexington and Bunker Hill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the feeling that they are thereby rising in the social scale , leads thousands of young men and women into our towns , who ought , for their own interests and for New England 's interests , to remain in the country . City pastors often meet these persons and see their mistake , but can hardly order them back to the farm . The greater part of them , however , do not even attract a passing sympathy . They simply plunge in , and are socially lost , among the busy , self-absorbing multitudes which throng our larger towns . Many a young man to-day , who at home , on the farm and in the country village , would be a leader ,  --  his family we 11-to-do , himself intelligent and popular , but without a trade - goes to the city expecting to better himseW but really only to swell the rank and file of those who are crowding one another for a scanty livelihood . When he marries and settles down , he will be found in a noisy street , next door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where his children , in spite of him , must grow up amid most undesirable associations . This instead of his owning the old farm , bringing up his children amid happy surroundings , and being perhaps a selectman of the town or a deacon of the church , and withal a person of n* little consideration . // Space permitting , actual instances could be cited of young married people who have felt that , whatever they did , they must get into town , because there they could " be something . " Inmost cases , it would be to tell of the privations they have had to undergo , as compared with their friends who have clung to the soil , in respect of their houses , their daily comforts , their associates , and the health and happiness both of themselves and of their children . Nor is this false notion confined to young persons . I recall an elderly farmer , one of the most dignified and generally sensible men I ever knew , living on a grand old homestead with its broad acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were thereby stepping upward instead of downward . If now New England country life is to recuperate , this * hurtful illusion must cease . Any intelligent and industrious man can get a living upon our farms , either as owner or tenant or laborer , and unless he is a skilled workman he can get a better living there than elsewhere . And any family which is unable to make itself respected and honored in the country may be certain of social insignificance in a large town . How shall these facts be impressed upon country people so as to check their unwise abandonment of the farms ? By the organized effort , I reply . of intelligent town people , who are interested in country life . The uumber of town and city people in New England who have homes in the country is large . Many of them have farms , and the weeks which they can pass upon them they deem the best part of the year , bringing them nearest to the normal , unartificial life of man . Now let such people come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its rightful place in men s minds . Let them plan to use their tongues and pens in showing that the place for those who can choose their own homes - eight months out of twelve at least - is in the country , upon their own lands , which they are to hand down to their children 's children ; that town life , for a majority of townspeople , is a privation as compared with country life , and is only to be accepted by them as a present necessity . But that will not be enough . The mission of such an association would be found , not alone in talking up country life , but in lifting it up . There are , at present , privations even in New England country life , which are not to be disguised , but rather to be remedied . There are schools enough , perhaps churches enough , if rightly used and supplemented ; but there is yet much to be done towards awakening a new intellectual life , and a broader , better social life among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but two suggestions : let every one who has a country hoiue , if he can not found a public library for the town , do what he can towards inducing the people to establish one ; then let him see that the country church which he attends in the summer , instead of going on in its sleepy old way , wakes up to serve seven days in the week in promoting a wholesome , social , and intellectual as well as spiritual life in the vicinage . Thus our country life may be redeemed , not only in name but in nature , and we may see a healthful outflow from the cities to the soil .
