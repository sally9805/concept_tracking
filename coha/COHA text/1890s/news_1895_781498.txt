txt From The Lancaster ( Penn . ) Examiner . The triennial report of the Pennsylvania Commissioners of Fisheries shows that during the last three y.ears 282,878,771 fish were placed in the streams of this State , which number included 45,517,000 shad distributed by the United States Commission . The distribution of brook trout was 8,59 ' ' 2 , - 040 ; other trout and salmon , 3,430,400 ; whitefish , 59,800,000 ; pike perch , 161,450,000 ; lake herring , 4,040,000 , and miscellaneous fish , 49,331 . As compared with the three previous years , the increase was 130,700,071 . The Commissioners point to their report as showing that their work is not for the benefit of the angler alone , but mainly to increase the food supply in the waters of the State , They say : " How well this work has been done is evidenced by the annual shad catch of the Delaware and the whitefish and pike perch in Lake Erie . The shad catch of the former river , though varying as the production of fish will vary through causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value that of any of our Atlantic rivers . " The statistics of the United States Fish Commissioner for 1592 make the value of shad caught in New-Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Delaware *752,676 , of which it can safely be said that $650,004 ) represents the value of those taken in the Delaware Bay and River . " The aggregate catch of North Carolina and Virginia , with their wide area of magnificent bays and sounds , the Potomac , James , Cape Fear , and Roanoke Rivers , comes next , with a valuation for 1892 of $510,000 , thus showing in the greater value of the Delaware product the advantage of artificial stocking and the benefit of restrictive laws that prevent the destruction of the young fish in the upper river by illegal devices . The successful result of restocking is not always immediate , nor in the case of ondromous fish are the annual returns always progressive . " Atmospheric and physicial conditions affect the yearly run of fish . A late , cold Spring , with abundance of melting snow water from the mountain streams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in the warmer tide water reaches , where by far the larger number is taken , It is only by comparison with other coast rivers in any year that the superiority of the Delaware as a. shad-producing river is clearly demonstrated . It is to be hoped that any legislation tending to close the Delaware , and consequently involving the destruction of the valuable shad fisheries of the river and bay , will be jealously opposed and defeated by the friends of fisheries in New-Jersey , New-York , Pennsylvania , and Delaware . " The obstruction of the Susquehanna by dams and the destruction of the young shad in fish baskets , in its course through Maryland , and frequently in Pennsylvania , have practically ruined thc , once valuable fisheries of that river . Until these fish weirs are entirely abolished and the darns removed , or the river above them is made accessible to shad by fishways , the Susquehanna will never reach its former high standard .
