It was 7 o'clook this evening when the steamer arrived . All thepassengers wore on dock , waving hats and handkerohiefsand cheering . Anchor was dropped , and the passengers were removed to shore by a tender . All showed signs of the anxiety which they had suffered ; some of the elderly steerage passengers were hardly able to walk . Several women fell on their knees and cried the moment they were landed . The voyage of the Noordland was tempestuous , almost from the hour of leaving Sandy Book . The winds blew almost a hurricane , and the ship had much difficulty In making headway through the waves . Some of the passengers were so apprehensive of danger that they Gould not be induced to retire at night and sat about the saloon . The waves covered the lower rigging with ice , and the deck Itself was like a skating pond . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers remained under cover throughout nearly all the voyage . The Noordland labored along successfully until Thursday evening . St was a bitter cold night , and the passengers were congratulating themselves on gradually nearing the end of their stormy voyage . The steamer was in latitude 18 ? 52 ' west and longitude 50 ? 15 ' when , at 9:20 in the evening , a tremendous crash was heard and the vessel quivered from end to end . The passengers who were sitting Up Were tossed about like ninepins , several of them being thrown to the floor . Three terrific blows resounded , one after the other , as if the vessel was being struck by a gigantio hummer , Which indeed was the fact . The fright of some of the people was pitiful to behold . They rushed hither and thither , delaying the officers in their efforts to get at the cause and extent of the disaster . Capt . Nickels know well enough what the sound meant , and with a reassuring word to the passengers he hastened to investigate personally . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that proved to be the danger seemed about to crush the ship at every concussion . Water rushed into the tube , menacing the stokohold and the engine rooms , and panicstricken passengers thought for a while that the vessel was about to sink . Several minutes elapsed before word was given for the engines to stop . The Noordland lay helpless , tossed by the gale , and as the water rushed in there seemed innninett danger of sinking . The pumps wore started and the water prevented from gaining on the vessel . The excited passengers . finding that they were not in instant peril of being swallowed up by the waves , regained courage , and Patiently waited for a steamer to tow them into port . At the time of the accident the Noordland was 400 miles west of Queenstown . She was sighted by the steamship Ohio , which left Philadelphia on the same clay that the Noordland lett New-York , and needed assistance was at once extended . The voyage to Queenstown in tow was attended by much difficulty , and the continuous stormy Weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , Noordland arrived without further accident . An examination showed that the fracture of the shaft was six feet Inside the stern . Fred Kotz , a first-cabin passenger , now at a Queenstown hotel , told his experience to-night : The first two days out of New-York were fairish. although part of the time a heavy sea Was running . Tile weather then grow rapidly worse . On the night of the accident we were making about twelve knots an hour . The ship was rolling heavily , and most of the cabin passengers wore below , sick . Five or six of us were in the smoking room , talking about how we should pass Christmas in Antwerp , when there was a terrific crash , and we were thrown from the seats into a heap on the floor . The vibration of the ship almost shook us from our feet as we started for the door . It seemed as if a gigantic hummer was pounding the ship 's bottom . When we got outside we saw the Captain coming from the engine room . The passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . We surrounded the Captain , and he told us that the main shaft was broken , but Were was no immediate reason for alarm . The other officers who were not busy below walked about among the passengers incessantly and tried to encourage all to believe that there was no danger . In a few minutes we learned that the engineers , at great risk to their lives , had found that the two stay plates and the plummet . blocks had smashed the gland of the engine . The bulkhead , however , had been kept tight . The vessel pitched and rolled terribly , so that we saw we could not trust to the boats in case the worst came . " We were Just becoming calmer when we saw the orew rushing through the steerage , carrying bedding , mats , and carpets , to be stuffed into the tunnel box . We all knew then that water was coming in . Nobody slept that night . The ' women sat orying in the cabins and the men crowded the smoking room to play cards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thu vessel rolled terribly , and with every swell came a tremendous thump as if a piece of the shaft was loose and smashing things in the hold . The sails had been spread , but they did not steady the ship noticeably . We knew we were far from the track of transatlantic steamships , and most of us on that night would not have guessed that our chances of life were more than two in five . The crew worked heroically at the pumps for twenty-four hours after the accident , and at the same time the engineers were busy at the shaft , fixing plugs and trying to prevent further influx of water . Eventually word was sent oat that the flow of waterbed been checked . We had plenty of food and water .. and , therefore . with fairly favorable weather , would have been able to hold our own for some time . As the sea was still too rough , however , for any lifeboat , we were a gloomy lot . Friday was uneventful . The tables were laid as usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday morning the lookout yelled Light ahead I ' Everybody turned out and listened eagerly for the next word . She 's a steamer was the next call . We all shook hands and cheered , and many rau about shouting for Joy . We all remained on deck the rest of the night , watching the Ohio 's lights . At daylight she stood by and passed a hawser . At that time , as I learned subsequently , our aftorpeak was full of water . and despite their expressions of confidence the officers of the ship were Intensely anxious . The Ohio began towing ns very slowly . The strain caused by the heavy seas was too great . however ; and after five minutes the hawser broke . Before another hawser could be passed nine hours elapsed . The Second hawser broke . as did also the third . On Sunday morning other hawsers were fixed , and as the weather had improved meantime , they held until we reached harbor . We proceeded about seven knots an hour . At Daunt 's Rook the hawsers were shortened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the steerage passengers who went ashore were taken back later , and will live aboard the Noordland until final orders are received from London as regards their transport to Antwerp . Probably the Noordland will be repaired temporarily hero . and then will proceed to Antwerp , where she will be completely overhauled .
