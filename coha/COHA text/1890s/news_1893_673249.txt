txt The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church has got itself and the Church into a predicament which probably few of the members had foreseen , and still fewer had considered a way out of . That body has overruled a decision of the New-York Presbytery , which was to the effect that a Presbyterian minister might hold and set forth the views which Dr. BraGus had announced without by these facts ceasing to have a right to retain his place in the Presbyterian ministry . Out of 499 votes in the General Assembly but 116 voted to sustain the decision of the New-York Presbytery . The General Assembly has thus " vindicated " its own orthodoxy by something more than a three-fourths vote . This is all very fine , and should be very impressive . It is less impressive than , perhaps , it ought to be , through the fact that the famous question once put by TWEED arises here with great force : " What are you going to do about it . " The committee to be appointed to decide this question will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself had , when it voted not to sustain the decision of the Presbytery of New-York . That decision was , in effect , that , while the views announced by Dr. BRIGGS were not necessarily those of the Presbytery , yet the Presbytery was of the opinion that Dr. BRIGGS might lawfully hold them . The General Assembly has decided otherwise , and . now the question is , What shall be done to Dr. BRIGGS ! As it has been decided about the Geary law , which provides for the deportation of unregistered Chinamen , that its provisions for deportation are void in the absence of an appropriation for carrying them out , it might be said about Dr. BRIGGS that , though his views have been discountenanced and . condemned by the highest authority in his Church , yet there is no way of punishing him for them , unless some may be devised . The General Assembly is undisputedly competent to provide such a way , but will . it do it it That is a question which , as we have said before , concerns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is that the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church is about the only body of educated . men in this country , or in this time , in which it would be possible to obtain a condemnation of the opinions which Dr. BRIGos holds in common with all educated men , although doubtless he has been led to them by researches much more extensive than educated men in general have had occasion tO undertake . But it is these conclusions which have for many years made it increasingly difficult for the Presbyterian Church to obtain a supply of educated men for its ministry . When it is known that these conclusions Ate matters not merely for condemnation , but for punishment by the Presbyterian Church , this difficulty will evidently be increased ; since the power of discipline of the General Assembly extends only to its own ministers , and . not to those outside of its ministry or its communion , and who are under no constraint to enter its ministry . If the spirit of the General Assembly is enforced , then the Presbyterian ministry may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIGGS , " first pure and then peaceable , " but it will be exceedingly small .
