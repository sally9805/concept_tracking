txt There appears no reason to doubt that the leader in the London Post yesterday reflects the views of Lord SALISBURY 'S Ministry and of the Tory Party in general ; and that is doubtless why it has attracted so much attention and given rise to so mach excitement in London . The excitement , assuming the article to be an authentic reflection of the purposes of the party , is very easy to be understood . It looks like a defiance of the deliberately expressed will of the people , and this is at least as grave an offense in England as it would be in this country . In fact , the popular will in this country has been not ' exactly defied , but evaded in a manner that would have wrought the political ruin of any statesman concerned in it if the attempt had been made in England . The supremacy and omnipotence of the House of Commons form the most important provisions of the " British Constitution , " and an effort to defeat the majority of the House of Commons is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed in our day . It is thus no wonder that London is excited by the " semi-official " declaration of the Morning Post , but the excitement will very probably subside when the facts of the case are considered . It is not disputed that Mr. GLADSTONE has a majority of some forty members of the next House , including the Irish members . On the other hand , Great Britain alone returns a majority of about the same size in favor of Lord SALISBURY as against Mr. GLADSTONE . Now , the Irish members are members , it may be said , for Irish purposes only . They are Liberals and . Gladstonians only because the Liberal Party at the instigation and under the influence of Mr. GLADSTONE has declared in favor of home Yule , without thus far specifying what it means by home rule . At any rate , these Irish members consider British politics only from an exclusively Irish point of view , and do not pretend to consider thorn from any other . Apart from the Irish question , Trojan and Tyrian , Liberal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite correct from the Irish point of view , but it is quite anomalous from the British point of view . It really puts British legislation at the mercy of a group of men who take no interest in it and do not profess any , but who happen by their number and the peculiarity of the political situation to hold the balance of power in a country of which they do not wish to be citizens and in the affairs of which they do not profess to take any sympathetic part . Their votes will doubtless be cast with Mr. GLADSTONE upon a motion of want of confidence in the Tory Administration . Doubtless , they will be cast with Mr. GLADSTONE for any measure which , by enlarging or readjusting the suffrage , promises to give him a larger majority after a dissolution than he now possesses . But upon this question their votes will avowedly be determined by the needs and interests of Ireland , and not of England and Scotland . That is to say , the course of British legislation will be determined by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of the measures they will - vote to promote , or about the bearing of the measures upon the welfare of the people immediately concorned . This is a very grave consideration . It is not at all to be wondered at that Britons , even if they happen to be in favor of home rule , should object to having British politics determined by the votes of men who care nothing about them , but whose VOWS are essential to the victory of one of the British parties over the other , which other has a clear majority of the British members . Neither is it to be expected that a British Ministry should . be at all eager or even willing to give up office at the dictate of a majority so composed . The Conservative orators and writers may be trusted to make the most of their case , and it is a strong one . If , they may say , it is an injustice that Ireland should be governed according to English ideas , and without reference to Irish ideas , then it is at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish ideas without reference to the English ideas that are shown to prevail by the result of the elections in British constituencies . Yet that is clearly the situation . Mr. GLADSTONE has no chance of carrying any British measures - without the Irish vote . This position of affairs does not furnish an argument against home rule . On the contrary , it seems to us to furnish a strong argument in its favor . If the representatives of Ireland were managing Irish affairs at home , they would not be troubling British politics at Westminster . They might , in that case , be interested . in " Imperial " politics , but they would no more interfere with purely English and Scotch questions than they would acquiesce in the interference of Englishmen and Scotehmen in purely Irish questions . This seems to indicate that the demand of a local legislature for Ireland involves the demand for a local legislature for England , one for Scotland , and one for Wales ; that is to say , for the establishment of a Federal system something like our own , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Imperial questions . However that may be , the Conservatives are acting within their rights in resolving to carry on the Government until it appears both that they can not carry it on and that the Liberals can .
