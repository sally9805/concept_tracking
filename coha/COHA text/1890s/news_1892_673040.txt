txt The cardinal idea of the reform of the tariff as involved in the various measures brought forward or passed by the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives ever since the Morrison Tariff bill has been the gradual reduction and ultimate repeal of the duties on the materials of manufacture . This is very clearly in the interest of the manufacturers themselves , and equally so of the workmen employed by them , since it reduces the cost of one of the two essential elements of production , extends at once production and consumption , while lessening the price to the consumer , and increases the demand for labor . There is no system that could be proposed that would be so distinctly and . immediately advantageous to each of the classes interested without in the remotest degree injuring any of the others . The manufacturer turns out his goods at less cost , commands a wider market , and has greater profits . The workman gets a larger and better market for his labor , which the employer can afford to pay for at better rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which to the workman is equivalent to still another increase of wages . And all this is ' accomplished , not by putting unjust discriminations on trade in favor of some and . against others , but by the simple release of all from arbitrary restrictions . If this is not essentially an American policy then the Declaration of Independence , with its announcement of " inalienable rights , " is not American . It is the abuse of the power of the National Legislature , in burdening the many for the few , that is as un-American as the British shipping laws which brought about the revolution of the colonies . From time to time a new illustration of the absurdity as well as the wrong of the modern tariff system comes'up . The latest is stated by Mr. CHARLES J. HARRAH Of the Midvale Steel Works . It is very practical . Mr. HARRAH had an order for 400 locomotive tires of steel for a Chilean road . " This order , " he says , in the course of an interview published in THE TIMES yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to secure it I had to take it almost at cost . I only took it from a spirit of patriotism and to prevent the Englishmen from getting it . There is no money in it , but if the 75 per cent . tariff was taken off of ore and the $6.80 off of pig , we would make money at the prices at which we took the order . " But who , then , is really benefited. , At the present stage of development no one . Mr. HARRAH says : ? ? Now let us take another view of the matter . No one except the-Treasury derives any benefit from the duty on ore . The Western and Pittsburg steel mills use the Minnesota and Michigan ores . The freight by water from Duluth to Cleveland and by rail from Cleveland to PHISburg is so heavy as to prevent Eastern steel rail mills from using native ores . In consequence of this both the Bethlehem Works and the Pennsylvania Steel Company have to import their ores from Cuba , where they own large ore beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freights from Cuba to Baltimore or Philadelphia handicaps them in their competition with the Western mills . Under the existing cireumstances the Eastern rail mills can not sell their product In Western markets , nor can the Pittsburg people or the Steel Company of Illinois sell theirs to Eastern railroads . " When asked wile , would . be benefited . by the removal of the duty on ore , Mr. HA.RRAH replied : " The makers of pig iron in the South , principally in Alabama , because by the introduction of foreign ores into the mixture of native ore from which they make their iron they could produce a grade of pig sufficiently good for Bessemer furnaces , and possibly even good enough for open-hearth furnaces . As it is , the iron that is made in the South to-day is so poor that it can not be used in Pittsburg , although a great many attempts have been made in that direction by almost every maker of steel . " Beyond these facts immediately connected with his own business , here is Mr. HARRAH 'S forecast of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ns Pennsylvanians will certainly be detrimental to Southern interests , and . no legislation of that kind will ever be accepted by the West unless it increases the prioe of pork or enables the farmer to get more for his bag of flour . Eventually we will all awaken , and , instead of building up a barrier around us that compels us to feed on one another like a lot of cannibals , we will pull down the barrier , meet the Englishman wherever he shows his face , and beat him out of the field  --  and we can do it every time , " This is the true American spirit , and its absolute triumph in American politics is only a question of time . We confess that we are very weary of the pusillanimous talk of Americans needing protection . Twice in the history of the commerce of the world this country has carried its products fairly into all the markets where they met English competition . When we hear from little men like Mr. HArtuismsr that if we give our workmen and our manufacturers a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we think of the Yankee 's reply to the Englishman 's threat , at the opening of the civil war , that if the Americans were not careful of British dignity England would send over an army and fleet and thrash us into good behavior . " What , " said the Yankee , " ag'in I "
