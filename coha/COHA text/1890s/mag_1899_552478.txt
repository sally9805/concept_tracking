**27;276;TOOLONG , as for a man , when it finds itself in a complex situation , with endless discussions of this and that raging in its ears , to determine rightly what is the important thing . This nation is today in such a situation . The last year has been one of the most congested years in our history . We have been compelled , month after month , to deal with combinations of circumstances such as we never dreamed of before . Dramatic and pregnant events have transpired so rapidly that it has been hard for our mental operations to keep up with them . Imperialism , expansion , militarism , colonialism , new spheres of influence and of trade , political competence , the rights and relations of races and a dozen other momentous subjects have been clamoring every day for discussion and practical settlement by this great democratic lyceum ; and it is not strange that good people have been confused . We are of those who believe that this nation is essentially a nation of good people . Like every other nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sinners are in high places , where they can blow loud blasts and pull strong ropes and often exercise the determining influence ; but nothing shall shake us from the conviction that the great majority of men in this republic desire to know the truth and to do the right thing , and that if they do not do the right thing it is because they do not know the truth or see clearly what is the most important question . * * * The important question at the present time is not the question of expansion . We certainly do not need to expand . Any man who told us a year ago that we needed more territory would have been laughed at . The ( lesire for more territory for the mere sake of more territory , on the part of the United States , is like the hunger of the farmer for more land when he is not able to cultivate properly what he already has . No man of common sense can believe that a hundred million dollars put into the Philippines would yield half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we do not ourselves believe that they would yield the Boston or New York capitalists the returns of the same millions put into Maine , New Hampshire or Vermont . The possible profits which may accrue to a few syndicates from operations in the Philippines can not in a century equal the expense which must be borne , not by the syndicates , but by the whole people , to maintain there an adequate military establishment to support those operations and keep the natives in subjection . No fallacy is more fallacious nor more pestilent than the fallacy that in order to trade with a people you have got to govern themthe fallacy that trade follows the flag . Trade has nothing to do with the flag . If we owned the whole of South America , we should not begin to have the trade with her which we have with Europe . If there were no wall of tariff , New England and New York would trade with Canada as freely as with Pennsylvania . If trade with China and the Philippines is what we want , all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what their people need . If this be done at lower prices than what England , France and Germany do it for , then we shall get the trade ; and the fewer battleships we 636 // show , the more we shall be liked , the more we shall be trusted , and the better we shall get on . But when this is said , we repeat *That we have said before in these pages and said very often elsewhere , that we have no dread of any expansion of the republic for which there is any natural or sufficient reason . The proper limits of expansion for any nation , as we said a year a go , are hard to define ; the sagacious practical statesmanship of each time has got to determine them for that time as best it can . Each push of our own  --  to the Mississippi , the Rocky Mountains , the Paci6c , Alaska-has been through controversy . Geographically there is no reason why we should taboo islands-why we should take in Alaska and refuse to take in Cuba and Hawaii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Great empires commonly die of indigestion , " Napoleon said , and said truly ; and Gladstone has warned England of the indigestion which has already attacked her and is weakening her to-day . But great and small are relative terms . The French philosophers of the last century believed that republics must always be small , that large republics never could be strong and stable , because public spirit and opinion could not make themselves felt freshly and unitedly over great areas ; but this was because they could not foresee those means of communication and relation which have made our United States smaller for political purposes than the thirteen states along the Atlantic coast which elected George Washington president . North America will be smaller for such purposes a generation hence than the United States today ; and we are of those who believe that this republic will in due time be co-extensive with North America With the victory of Wolfe at Quebec , says Green , the English historian with true discernment , began the history of the United States ; and Quebec will by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding there its natural place . Until it does find its place there happily and naturally , of its own free will , we do not want it there at all . Until then-for we have no fears , either , of adjacent islands , archipelagoes of them , on the basis of a " square deal " - we do not want San Salvador , where Spain first stepped ashore , nor Cuba nor Porto Rico , where her flag last flew . " Expansion " for expansion s sake , the thirst for conquest by a nation suddenly made drunk and heady by startling and sensational military successes , national highway robbery , are things for every sober man to set the seal of his damnation on , as the temptations to public sin and the sure ways to national disaster and doom . * * It is not a question of " world power " and world influence , with which we have to do . If it were that , as some very noisy people seem suddenly to have discovered of late , then it would be important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend in the least upon the number of square miles in the national domain . If it is a question of intellectual or spiritual influence , Palestine and Greece were small tracts compared with Tartary and Turkey . If it is a question of commercial power , which is what the Philistines are really thinking about nowadays when they talk of world power , then Venice was just a city ; Holland which succeeded her in commercial supremacy was at the height of her power almost the smallest country in Europe ; and Britannia , who now rules the wave , is smaller than Oregon . The student who does not know will be surprised to learn how little of her commerce , even with her colonies , depends upon any political dominance or connection . How much greater would her commerce with ourselves be to-morrow if we put a prayer for the Queen into our prayer-books in the place of the prayer for the President ? If , as Gladstone predicted , we supplant her // some day as the world 's chief carrier , we shall not do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial possessions or because of sovereignty over any new possessions , but simply because of superior enterprise and efficiency . It is only because of superior efficiency that we can acquire valid primacy anywhere in the world 's markets or become commercially a world power . It is ridiculous to say that we are not that to-day ; and it is reckless to throw away or to trifle with that peculiar advantage which most helps us to become so in ever higher and higher degree . Does America forget the eloquence with which John Bright used to point out to her this great advantage , an advantage which , while particularly her own , also , unlike most particular advantages , pushed on the general progress and welfare of the world ? America , not burdened by taxes for the support of great armies and navies , was free to devote all her resources and energies to the development of her industries . This gave her an incalculable advantage over the burdened countries of Europe , an advanfage which every one of them was feeling keenly . Let her maintain this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be forced to disarmament for sheer economy and self-protection . Did not the recent word of Prince Radziwill , a word so nervously explained away , mean the same thin ? It can not be that America will recklessly abandon a position in which she can steadily command the world to peace and efficient industrial organization , and consent to meet old tyrannies on their own terms and in their service . She has been a pre*minentlv oTeat commercial and industrial power during the last generation , putting the strain upon competing nations at the very point where strain is to b* desired , precisely because of that wise and virtuous policy which shallow and ambitious adventurers are to-day urging her to abandon . We believe that there is wit enough in our great democracy to see that the course of wickedness is here in the short run the course of weakness , as in the long run it is always . To-day one of the greatest of commercial powers , her commerce hindered and confined only by her own foolish and barbarous tariff laws , she exercises also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large not second to that of any other nation . Who shall say how much of the growth of democracy and liberal institutions in Europe during the century has been provoked and fostered by her example and by the words flying across the sea from the millions of struggling men who , coming thence , have here found liberty and opportunity ? Sacred , thrice sacred , the responsibility to keep the great republic , whatever she does or leaves undone , true to this leavening and inspiring task , true to her own genius , the honest incarnation , the honest representative and instrument , of the liberty which enlightens the world and whose light the dark world still so sadly needs . America not a world power ? Who knows the educational and religious history of the Pacific Ocean , of India and China and the isles of the sea , and says it ? What part of the miraculous renaissance of Japan in the lifetime of this generation has been due to American influence ? Would the world 's old fashion-our new fashion-bombardment , slaughter , subjugationhave effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political advice and the political training which we gave ? Is this record of Japan a condemnation of the old method of America as a world power , and an appeal for gunboats as the better tools of civilization ? Has Robert College on the Bosphorus been so great a failure that in our new thirst for world power we must reverse the influences which it represents ? One in high place has said , and truly said , that the leaders who have given law and liberty in so high measure to Bulgaria // in these days are men who learned what law and liberty are at Robert College . Can as high services be chronicled of all the fleets of all the " powers " which in the same decades have darkened the Bosphorus ? " I remember , " wrote an American scholar who travelled in the East just after the Armenian atrocities , " how in Constantinople the English companions of our voyage almost winced when they came to realize what a shining record America , by her schools , churches and colleges , had made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over against the measureless shame and cruel , diabolic selliseness of the European powers , who have been plunging from one depth of infamy down into those lowest deeps where now all the devils hiss and riot and applaud . " This American scholar is John Henry Barrows ; and the book from which the word is taken is " The Christian Conquest of Asia . " The last chapter of that book , " Success of Asiatic Missions ; America 's Responsibility to the Orient , " is a noteworthy picture of American educational and religious work in the East t6-day , and a sharp answer to the man who thinks that America has no power or influence in the world at large . In everything which constitutes true and uplifting influence , it shows that there is no other power equal to hers ; and it shows-this is the chief thing-that that influence is great precisely because it has been exercised by the methods of freedom instead of the methods of force ; because the American missionary and schoolmaster have not heretofore gone out with bayonets and bullets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they have believed not in the Mohammedan method of carrying gospel , but in the Christian method ; because they have not been suspected by those to whom they have gone of ulterior motives and of being the mere Sancho Panzas of political and commercial adventurers . The American missionary has often been a man with a narrow theology and with a poor appreciation of the religious history and thought of those to whom he went-although this not half so often as his disparagers like to believe ; but he has been a man of great devotion and unselfishness ; and in the whole story of modern missions-a story not second in glory or in romance to the story of the Crusadeshis part has been the most glorious and most important . The man who talks about " world power " should ask himself whether this kind of power is less great , less noble and less real or abiding than that represented by Clive and Warren Hastings , that dreamed of to-day by Joseph Chamberlain , Cecil Rhodes , Whitelaw Reid and Charles Denby , and which numbers among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the slaughter of the Filipinos . " I have come back from a voyage around the world , " wrote Dr. Barrows , " with a new feeling of the moral glory which belongs to our beloved land . I met numerous evidences that American missionaries have an especial advantage over their brethren from other nations ; " and his story makes it plain that that advantage was the absence of ulterior political motives and the absence of the sword . " After all , " he says , " there is a selfish look about much of England 's predominance in the Orient and in the southern waters . England 's dealings with subject populations , like our dealings with the Indians , have sometimes shocked the moral sense of mankind . . . . Her domineering ways , her fierce jingoism , have kept from her the completer confidence which a better England would surely have gained . " Two years ago America was not represented in the Orient by the sword , but only by her better self . The American merchant was there , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American trade everywhere spreading . " Bnt it is more inspiring , " Dr. Barrows wrote . " to feel the presence of American teachers and // missionaries , bent on relieving the human mind from error and on laying the foundations of an ethical civilization . Other lands , " he said , " are represented by the sword . In India , Great Britain stands for military power and commercial gain , as well as for justice , education , progress and civiliza*Vion . Germany is stretching out her strong military hand for the subjugation of the Pacific Seas . France has planted herself on the island of Madagascar and on the fertile lands of Tonquin . The American voyager in the East does not see the American flag in the harbors of the Orient as often as he might wish ; but I have found the American name bel.oved and trusted where other names failed to awaken any happy and affectionate feeling . " In the two years which have passed , things have indeed changed . We , toe , like the other lands , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , too , have come to stand there , like Great Britain , for " military power and commercial gain " ; we , too , like Germany , are " stretching out our strong military hand for the subjugation of the Pacific Seas " ; our name , too , then " beloved and trusted , " has ceased to " awaken happy and affectionate feelings . " Do we stand higher on account of this , or do we stand lower ? Are we a greater or a less " world power " ? Is our prospect brighter or darker for spreading among people less fortunate than ourselves the truths and sentiments which make for freedom , for fraternity , and for the real progress of the world ? After all , was the old Christian way of e*xpansion through honest trade and gospel and schoolmaster less fruitful and promising than the new Mohammedan way of slaughter , subjugation and the sword ? * * It is not , we say , the question of expansion ; it is not the question of world power ; neither is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how great and how unique were America* s missionary oppoi*tunity and her achievement ; and we have seen that this was precisely because her missionaries were siispected of no ulterior political motives and bore no sword but the sword of the spirit . This indeed has been hitherto her proudest boast . That the Christian way is better than the Mohammedan way has been the veriest commonplace of the missionary convention . It fortifies the soul to know that in the missionary circle itself it is still the boast and commonplace . Ministers in pulpits like men in pews have been swept off of their feet by the new craze for conquest which has swept over the nation ; and there have been those who have even defended imperialism on " missionary principles " and applauded the booming cannon as the fitting announcement of the Prince of Peace " Give them bullets first , " said a famous clergyman in Boston the other day , speaking of our conquest of the Philippines , " and Christ afterwards ! "  --  and in words less brutal and offensive , but to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are all stay -- at-home clergymen . In the circle of the devoted workers themselves , the same high word spoken when America was not " represented by the sword " in the Orient is spoken today . The greatest of American missionary organizations , that by far most representative of New England , is the American Board of Commissioners for Foreigfi Missions . Its two forei*rn secretaries are Rev. Judson Smith and Rev. James L. Barton . Replyincr publicly to an assertion that the men interested in foreign missions sympathize with the new Americ*r *mnerialism , Dr. Barton recently wrote : " I know the oninion of a large number of the missionaries of our hoard and of others , and I do not know one who is in favor of an imperialistic policy . I have never heard this policy advocated by the officers of our hoard or of any other . On // the other hand , I have constantly heard the officers and missionaries of the Amen .. an Board express regret that the policy of imperialism was likely to prevail . We believe that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it would be impossible to separate in the minds of the people missionary enterprise from government interference . A few mornings ago we sat with Dr. Judson Smith in his high room , close to the sky , above the old Granary burial ground , and talked on this great question . We wish that every citizen of America who indeed loves his country and would be true to her , could see the flash of his clear eye and hear the noble irony with which he speaks of this new doctrine of subjugation instead of invitation as the means of spreading Christianity and American civilization , the democracy of Washington and Lincoln . We wish that every one could hear his burning words , based upon recent travels and a lifetime of devoted study , upon the character and possibilities of China-that China in whose seizure and partition the President 's Philippine commissioner has just been suggesting that America should take a hand , failing in the alternative holding of the Philippines . No man coming down from that watch-tower could come with any feeling longer that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any people is the question of missionary opportunity . * * It is not a question of the competence of this republic to do any work which it ought to do . If there is any language more offensive to the honest American democrat than the language even of the imperialist , it is the language of the American pessimist and unbeliever who answers that the proposed policy would be well enough for some other nation , because others have the capacity , the training and machinery and political purity , but that we have not the capac ity and would simply open new floodgates of corruption . First cast the beam out of your own eye , they say to each proposition that America should go beyond herself ; and they revel in no rhetoric so much as that in which they iterate the census of the beams in our eyes . They talk of Indians and negroes , of lynchings and lawlessness and Standard Oil , of Quay in the Senate and Croker in New York . The Indian record is , God knows , red enough ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown a greater sum-total of savagery than our whole " century of dishonor . " The negro record is , God knows , black enough ; but the American people have done more for the negro every year since his emancipation than the English people in any corresponding year for the forty times as many poor of India . If there is lawlessness in America , America proposes to end it ; if there is mammonism , she proposes to trample it under foot ; and she proposes to put both Quay and Croker behind prison bars . And primarily she believes that no law of parsimony rules her soul . If some great duty calls her , she will not decline it because she sees that she has done but poorly this other lesser duty or that larger one ; she will turn to it as the strong man answers the call to heroism , not thinking of his failures and his falls , of which in every heart there is so long a list , or if thinking of them then knowing well that every new response to duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any a greater and more conscious shame . If America has authentic call to new and distant responsibilities , then America will learn , as England has learned , to keep the spoilsman in his place , and she will show that she has not one General Wood or Colonel Waring , but a hundred . America refuses to believe that a republic has not wisdom or cipacitv. such as kings and kaisers have , for dealing with peoples lower than its own and for lending them the honest // hand that shall help them up and on . That were a fatal impeachment of democracy-from which , could it be sustained , democracy could not recover . 4 hat were to gainsay the first principles of education and of neighborhood , to make the half-wise man a better teacher of the ignorant than the wise man . If the republic can not stoop without danger to its back , if we alone can not take risks for civilization , then are we of all men most miserable . If our guiding , helping and protecting hand is needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us freely give it ; and let us know that it means danger to our democracy only when it means danger to theirs . The instant that it does mean that , the instant that it ceases to be the fraternal hand and begins to be the grasping hand , that instant the gods detect it and trip us ; that instant some voice is heard in the very midst of our own body politic speaking with new boldness the accent of oppression here , sounding the fatal warning that a democracy can not serve two masters . When a democracy finds that for this task or that it has no natural or proper tools , it may not be always true , but it is almost always true , that it is not a task proper for a democracy nor proper for any men who love liberty and are really concern&amp;d with the welfare and progress of their fellow men . Our present question , we repeat , is not a question of our capacity ; it is a question of our duty , of what we ought to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of world power , of missionary opportunity , nor of political capacity ; not these , but simply this ,  --  whether America is to turn from a work like that of the Christian conquest of Asia to a work like the British conquest of India ; whether military power and commercial gain are to become the dominant marks and motives of our democracy ; whether we are to stretch out a military hand for the subjugation of the Pacific seas ; whether miiitarism and mammonism are to be allowed to grow up and determine the policies of this republic and finally choke its life , as they have choked the lives of so many republics in the past , or whether they are themselves to be checked and choked  --  and that now . It is , in a word , the simple question , whether the people of the United States love liberty , love it for themselves and love it for others ; whether the republic really stands for the advancement of liberty in the world or stands for the advancement of its own power and gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new nation , conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men - not simply all Americans-a-are created equal , are God 's children and to be treated everywhere and always as God 's children . Now we are engaged in testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so dedicated , can endure in the high service of that truth , or whether our great pioneering work for freedom is to take the second place and the new standard raised a hundred years ago to duck itself before those hoary old standards of military power and commercial gain at whose fatal reappearance the hearts of hopeful men have again and again grown sick and nations called by God to leadership and high emprise again and again and again decayed and died . We are doing no new thing , men plead . England again and again has done it , and England was never so strong as to-day . Yes , again and again England has done it , and England is yet strong ; but Rome did it oftener than England , and Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Roman Empire are not catalogued in this year 's Gotha almanac . Two years ago every American said Amen as Gladstone showed how all this was England 's weakness , not her strength . // Commerce is the great civilizer , the great sapper and miner for progress , the great stimulator and minister of men . " Theworid was made for honest trade , " sings Emerson ; and the heart of every strong man in Emerson 's America swells and exults to see the busy railroads multiply upon the land and the ships upon the sea . Free trade with all the world is the desire of civilization in all lands . But commerce has its place , and its place is second , and not first ; it is the servant , not the king , of worthy nations and of worthy men . When it becomes king , then the man and the nation cease to be worthy and to be the salt and the light of the world . And where they went on trade intent , They did what freemen can ; Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man . This is the picture of the merchants whom New England loves to praise . When the merchant is only the merchant , when he does what freemen may not do , when he makes his trade subversive of freedom itself , then his trade becomes a curse and not a blessing . " For what avail the plough or sail Or land or life , if freedom fail ? " The baleful definition and the threat of the present crisis is the word , Commerce is king . The interests of freedom are subordinated to the interests of trade . Decadent and amemic men talk of our seizure and subjugation of the Philippines for philanthropic and missionary purposes ; but Mr. Frye and Mr. Reid and Mr. Davis talk of indemnity and China trade . The President 's Philippine commissioner , Mr. Denby , believes in holding the Philippines only because he " can not conceive of any alternative to our doing so except the seizure of territory in China . " He scouts the pious sentimentalists . If the conquest of the Philippines will not help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow , and let their people , if they please , cut each other 's throats . " There is nothing in the present situation more melancholy than the easy acceptance of Mr. Denby as the nipresentative of the national policy in the Philippines , and the general indifference to the ideals and ambitions which through him dominate our operations there . For Mr. Denby , our former minister to China , a zealous student of Oriental trade and politics , is the real head and hand of the President 's commission , the only man of political , diplomatic or commercial experience , the man of purpose and of power , the man who will settle the commission 's policy and was chosen for that purpose . Were the people of the republic alive as they ought to be to their vital interests and their honor , they would learn by heart the words which commended this man to the government as the fittest instrument for its work in the Philippines . In truth , how many remember well those words , uttered only seven , months ago ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great people . We have a great commerce to take care of . We have to compete with . the commercial nations of the world in far-distant markets . Commerce , not politics , is king . The manufacturer and the merchant dictate to diplomacy and control elections . The art of arts is the extension of commercial relations-in plain language , the selling of native pr6ducts and manufactured goods . I learned what I know of diplomacy in a severe school . I found among my colleagues not the least hesitation in proposing to their respective governments to do anything which was supposed to be conducive to their interests . There can be no other rule for the government of all persons who are charged with the conduct of affairs than the promotion of the welfare of their respective countries . .

If it will not , set them free to-morrow , and let their people , if they please , cut each other 's throats , or play what pranks they please . To this complexion we must come at last , that , unless it is beneficial for us to hold these islands , we should turn them loose . " Crasser , more grasping and more brutal still were the words of the President 's commissioner in the interviews published in the San Francisco newspapers on the eve of his sailing ; and the newspapers of latest date bring the advices of the Denby interest in the great American syndicate which is already laying out railroads in China-that China whose conquest and partition , as we have remarked , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

All that is vital in this unhappy people , all that commands the future , all that we should name were the case not our own , is animate with the passion for liberty and independence . The question is not of them ; the question is of us . The question is , how has it become possible that the spectacle of such a passion and such a struggle should fail to stir any American heart ? How is it possible that this democracy , a century after Washington , should prostitute itself to the mouldy and poisonous doctrine that " sovereignty - sovereignty over unconsulted , unconsenting and protesting millions of men-is something to be bought and sold ?

Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves , and under a just God can not long retain it . " No word was ever truer , nor more immediately true . No democracy can play the emperor and remain democracy ; the mere temptation to it is evidence of taint . The moment that it exercises an outside oppression , that moment oppression asserts prerogatives within .

This republic is full to-day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is in error , even in sin , but who believe it must still be kept on its course , because the course has been decreed . It is the ultimate political scepticism ; but it speaks in the home and on the street , with the preacher 's tongue and the editor 's pen . It speaks from the chair where George VVilliam Curtis used to sit . We have made a great mistake ,  - -  thus it is written ,  --  we are wronging the people of the Philippines , we are false to ourselves , we have turned our backs upon American principles ; but we must stand by the administration in fighting it through . " The country is at war . When that is said , " - this is the monstrous conclusion ,  --  " the duty of every citizen is at once evident . He must support the government , whether he differed from it or not as to the propriety of the conduct which brought on the war . It is immoral to do otherwise . " There are men in this country who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that , going there by accident or sudden military need , we found an unforeseen opportunity to destroy Spanish rule , and it was a good thing to do it ; that the Aguinaldo government is not competent to govern well , and so it is a good thing to destroy that and subject the people to ourselves , not simply in the interests of our industry and trade , but in the interests of general peace and progress . The leaps in the logic of this position , the astigmatism of its look at facts , its sense of what is great and what is small , of what progress is , and of what right and wrong are , are to us appalling ; but we can respect the position ; we do at least respect a hundred noble men who hold it . They seem to us faithful blind men . But the position of this " journal of civilization , " the position of the multiplying thousands of men , in the republic for whom this journal speaks with a boldness and brutality only one degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithless men who see . It is faithlessness to civilization , faithlessness to humanity , faithlessness to our democracy itself ,  - -  to that higher law through love of which and fear of which and obedience to which alone can this democracy or any state continue to stand at all . It is a state of mind , says Ruskin , greatly to be dreaded , not to know the devil when you see him . More dreadful is the state of the mind whose " immorality " is obedience to the higher law . Immoral to turn back from recognized error and undo confessed wrong - immoral to do right ! It is expedient , it is hard necessity , it is sometimes solemn duty , when in some dreadful strait the very life of the state is at stake , for the citizen to be silent when he would else protest , because diversion to a little wrong might weaken a great right . But such occasions are rare indeed in history ; it is impious even to remember them in the vicious escapades of nations revelling in insolent power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly ! Say it to Chatham and to Burke , to the great company of the English immortals who rejoiced in London at the news from Bunker Hill and Saratoga ! Say it to Victor Hugo when to " support the government " meant to support Napoleon the Little in subjugating Mexico ! Say it to Charles Sumner when the government meant the Quays and Platts and Hannas of James K. Polk ! Support the government ! We , the people , are the government . " The People is the sovereign of this country , " how often we need to remember that great word of Edward Everett Hale 's ; - " the People is sovereign here , the People is the fountain of honor here ; the President is the ser // vant of the People . " This is not a government by presidents ; it is a government by the people , a government by public opinion ; and to the making of that government wise and righteous it is the duty of every citizen to contribute . Men say with a self-suppression which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government " has " facts " which they have not and therefore must not be meddled with . The President has no knowledge of important facts which every citizen may not have . As the chief servant of the people , he has no right to important knowledge which he does not share with them ; and in the present crisis he has frankly told us that he has not any . In the great town meeting of democracy the responsibility comes home to every man alike , to the selectman and the other ; and no man can atone for what he confesses to be sin and shame by any maudlin talk about " supporting the government . " Consistency is truly the hobgoblin of little minds ; and its sway is stronger over nations than over individual men . It is a fearful proverb , that corporations have no souls , though every member of the corporation be a deacon . Men are morewilling to dowrong , and less willing to repent , in their corporate capacity than by themselves . Men have tolearfi thatthe ethics of the citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethics of the gentleman-to confess mistake or wrong , and to undo it , the moment that he finds it out . Gladstone knows but one law for Hawarden and for Downing Street . Noblesse oblige-that is the doctrine and the test alike of the gentlemanly nation and the gentlemanly man ; and the " white man 's burden , " if his whiteness is whiteness of soul and not simply of skin , is to be quicker to undo a wrong to an inferior than to an equal . * * 4 ' History is kind to us in making this year , so big with fate to the country , the centennial of the death of the father of the country . We stand at the point just a century after Washington . Let us not keep the feast in desecration of his memory ; let us keep it by the manly ceasing from wrongdoing and the humble , proud return to his approving smile ; let us keep it by listening with new anxiety and reverence to his word . Could the voice of Washington reach us to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any selfish , smug parochialism , but with the accent of the citizen of the world . No man in his great day saw so far west as he ; to-day his vision would sweep round the globe . He was the great expander of the republic ; he would be the great expander of the republic 's true influence among men . He would tell the republic that it was no longer boy , but man , and that it must now quit itself like a man . He would remind us that while he was yet with us he foresaw the time " when , our institutions being firmly consolidated and working with complete success , we might safely and perhaps beneficially take part in the consultations held by foreign states for the advantage of the nations ; " and he would tell us that a hundred " entanglements " are expedient and imperative for us to-day which were not to be considered a century ago . But he would tell us also that there are truths which do not change with the centuries and with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more trifle with impunity than the new manchild . " There exists in the economy and course of nature , " he would say , " an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness , between duty and advantage , between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity . The propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right , which Heaven itself has ordained . " // pitable land from which the Pilgrims sailed , to lay the corner stone of this nation , the representatives of all civilized nations are gathered about the sacredest round-table of history , called by a higher and a holier call than any which ever came to Galahad or Arthur . It is the year which strikes the first stroke of the hour of Universal Peace , the year for which prophets have yearned and of which poets have sung , when the nations of the world first echo the strain of the Christmas angels of God . Is democracy to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which even sickened despotism seeks to cast away ? Is this Great Republic , whereto waiting , praying EurQpe has looked for leadership , to choose this year to turn her face from the future back toward the blood-rusted past and make it the Year One of her era of armies and navies , conquest and subjugation , partitions of Poland and opium wars ? Tragical was the irony by which the hour of the Peace Congress found her hands alone bloodstained , and which made the song of her poet an " Ichabod . " The faces of Whittier and Whitman and Lowell and Emerson are turned to the wall to-day , to remind us solemnly how " false is the war no poet sings " and that no line of theirs can be made to keep step with the situation . But to-morrow-who dare doubt it-her step shall be set once again to song ; to-morrow-who dare doubt it  --  the nightmare shall end and she will come to herself . Things present and things past shall not persuade us that the heart of the people is not sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and temptation of the hour , disciplined by the hour 's heart-searchings to better fitness for the imperial task to which God has called her in the family of nations . Imperial shall she rise ? Yes , imperial ; but an " imperial Salem , crowned with light . " She shall go out into all the world , with new dreams , larger ambitions and bolder venture , conquering and to conquer . But she shall not go with lust or greed or cruelty or oppression in her heart . She shall go the herald still of liberty , proclaiming liberty to all the earth . She shall found an empire that shall be a universal commonwealth , an empire based not upon the fears , but upon the aspirations and the hopes of men .
