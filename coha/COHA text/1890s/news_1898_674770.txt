txt As soon as it was known this morning that the Spanish Ministry had given passports to Gen. Woodford , both the army and navy of the United States were ordered to begin the actual operations of war . In the War Department the skeleton of the proclamation of the President , calling for 100,000 volunteers , was drawn up , and orders were sent to the troops to hurry to the rendezvous on the coast and be ready for an immediate advance on Cub &; In the Navy Department orders were sent promptly to the three fleets . The fleet under Capt . Sampson was ordered to prepare to sail for Havana without delay , and it is believed that it will set out tomorrow ; Commodore Schley was ordered to get in readiness for moving out of Hampton Roads to-morrow morning , and the Asiatic squadron , at Hongkong , was ordered to move at once on the Philippines . Thus the United States prepares to deliver a fourfold blow at the power of Spain . If the sole object of the war  --  the wresting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effected by a single attack upon the Spaniards in that island , the operations of the fleets and land forces would be confined to Cuba , but it is thought that as long as the Spanish fleets can roam the seas with power to destroy our commerce and threaten our coasts , drawing support from their numerous naval bases in the Atlantic and Pacific , Spain will never surrender ' Cuba . Swift Blow at Spain 's Navy . The army and fleets will therefore seek to deliver a crushing blow as soon as possible , even if it has to be delivered in the Philippines , in Puerto Rico , in the Canary or the Cape Verde Islands , or off the coast of Spain . The United States can not , in the opinion of military and naval experts , rest upon an almost bloodless victory in Cuba . Not only must Cuba be freed , but the war must be terminated by a decisive victory and by the submission of Spain . The State Department , soon after the orders to the fleets were sent this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once blockade Havana , and as the department advised the civilized world yesterday that it would recognize the rule of the Paris Congress that , to be binding , a blockade must be effective , it is announced that the fleet will make an effective blockade of that city fOrthwitn . For some ua s it must be a peaceful blo , cede , unless Blanco wishes to try the marksmanship of his gunners . If , as has been repeatedly said , he will at once open fire on the American ships , ample opportunity will be given to him to handle his guns . Will Not Attempt Close righting . The fleet . will not , however , attempt close fighting in Havana Harbor until the arrival of the land forces in front of the city . This will not be pc Bible for at least a week or ten days . In the meanwhile the fleet will lie in front of Havana , probably without firing a gun , and prevent the Spaniards from getting any supplies from the outside . There is very strong opposition to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it that it will be carrying out the very policy against which the United States so strongly remonstrated . It . will add greatly to the misery of the reconeentrados , as they will not have any opportunity to obtain food , their supply even from the charitable people of this country being cut off , and as the Spaniards will themselves be immediately pressed for supplies , they will see to it that no food goes to the starving wretches in the lines of concentration . The plan may prove very efficacious as a means of driving out the Spaniards , by forcing them to surrender at discretion , but it will , it is believed , work untold misery upon the people of Cuba who have been driven like sheep into the Spanish lines . ' ore Aggressive Policy Urged . Military men are urging a more aggressive policy . They want to make a dash at Havana and end the sufferings of the reconcentrados as quickly as possible and restore order and law and the usual course of life on the entire island , instead of instituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same opinion , and would be glad to see a speedy concerted movement of both land and naval forces on Havana Unfortunately this can not be done at the present time . There is no army ready to strike such a decisive blow . It must be slowly formed by drawing regiments from widely scattered parts , and concentrating them on our coast . Days must elapse before this little army can be formed ; days more must pass before it can be landed in Cuba and advance on Havana . Even after it is formed and effects a landing in Cuba , it will be too small , it is feared , to accomplish much . It must wait for the slow process of organizing a volunteer army from the several States . drawing an equal proportion from each , a process that will demand weeks at the least . A long blockade , therefore , seems inevitable , as the first aot in the drama of war . Movements of Spanish Fleet . A report of a sudden movement of the Spanish fleet from the Cape Verde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not moved , has again confused the plans of the Navy Department . It is supposed , however , if the report is true , that this fleet has sailed for Spain , and not for our coast . It would hardly risk an engagement with both of our fleets or with Capt . Sampson 's squadron . Commodore Schley 's squadron is thought to he just about a match for it . since it has been joined by the first-class battleship Pelayo . Possibly the Spaniard is a little stronger ; but that would largely depend upon the place e here battle is given . lf the two fleets were to meet on the high seas naval men think that the American fleet would prove very much the better . but if the battle were fought in a harbor , where the Spaniards could use their torepdo boats to advantage , Commodore Schley would , they s ty , have more than he could handle . It now seems probable that the Flying Squadron will be held in these waters to see where the Spanish fleet is bound for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havana and the clearance of Cuban water of Spanish sail . If the Spaniards go back to Spain , as appears most probable , in view of their previous movements , the Flying Squadron will proceed to the Canaries . It will also carry out this programme if the fleet puts back into Porto Grande or into Las Palmas , It has also been suggested that the Flying Squadron he strengthened and then dispatched in search of the Spanish fleet . The objection to this is that in the meanwhile the Spaniards will be coming directly to our coasts , and that we should be ready to meet them when they get here . Our Asiatics Squadron . The Asiatic Squadron , it was said to-day , has been ordered to attack the Spanish ships in the Philippines at once . That squadron consists of the Baltimore , Petrel , Olympia , McCulloch , and Raleigh , together with two supply ships . This force is quite sufficient for the work of ? sweeping the Spanish flag from the Philippines It is supposed that the fleet will reach the islands early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
