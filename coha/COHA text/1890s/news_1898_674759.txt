txt Mr. Quesada , the diplomatic representative of the Cuban insurgents in this city , was seen this afternoon by a reporter with regard to the constantly reiterated rep3rt from Madrid that the Queen Regent might issue an armistice proclamation . " It is useless for us , " said Mr. Quesada , " to reiterate again for the thousandth time that we will not accept an armistice and give up the advantages we naturally possess in the rainy season . We understand perfectly that Spain seeks only delay . We will have nothing but independence . As a matter of fact , an armistice is a suspension of hostilities to be arranged by the opposing Generals . Gen. Blanco and Gen. Gomez would have to agree so an armistice . Does any one think Gen. Gomez would agree to suspend hostilities just as we are about to win the great boon for which our people have fought and struggled so long ? Besides , who is CO take the proposition for an armistice to Gen. Gomez ? The Constitution of the Cuban Republic and the civil law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , to entertain or receive any offer from the Spanish lines unless it has for its basis the absolute independence of Cuba . Who is to carry the offer ? The fate of Ruiz is a warning of the fate which would await such an envoy . " Mr. Quesada has a letter from Gen. Gomez , under date of March 9 , which shows how hopeful he is of success and how even then he spoke of the utter futility of attempting negotiations with Spain . A portion of the letter is as follows : " This province , ( Santa Clara , ) as well as Santiago de Cuba and Puerto Principe , is curs . The enemy has departed , ceasing mil:tary operations and abandoning the garrison and forts which constituted its base of operations Days , weeks , and months pass without a column of troops appearing within our radius of action , which is of many leagues . In the condition in which we are , it is my opinion that what we need to end the war quickly is cannon and a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and steel from the towns . Notwithstanding the opinion of the optimists , I adhere to the idea that we will never make Spain come to terms but in that manner , and that it is a loss of time and very da ? gsrous to enter into any negotiations . We must fight them vigorously and unceasingly , in order to force what we will have , and we will surely obtain it in time . " The opinion was vouchsafed by an attach ? of the Spanish Consulate General yesterday that President will not send in his message to-morrow . The reason for this opinion he would notaffiscuss . It may have been the same as led Secretary Suarez to answer a query as to whether Spain would declare an armistice within a day or two by declaring : " Yes , we have not received word yet , but we expect it . There will be no war . We do not want war . " Advices were received last Monday , when news came of the autonomist appeal to the insurgents for an armistice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armistice without regard to the Cubans , and the fact was printed in this paper on Tuesday last . The idea prevailed among Cubans yester , day that it was the purpose of Spain to declare an armistice and secure a postponement of the sending in to Congress of the President 's message . If the message is sent it is asserted it will mean immediate intervention . If not it will mean that during the armistice the United States will continue its relief work among the reconcentrados , and in the meantime the powers , to avert war , will prevail upon Spain to withdraw from  - -  - e island and permit the United States to supervise the inauguration of an independent government . The declaration of an armistice by Spain , the Cubans say , will itself be a virtual recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban in , surgents , and can not fail to have its effects upon the attitude of the United States toward the provisional Republican Government of Cuba . Excepting the United States at once reef ognizes the Cuban Republican Government of Cuba or guarantees an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of an armistice and continue their fight for freedom . Inasmuch as the present Government is provisional , and it is the purpose immediately upon the establishment of peace to organize a permanent Government by the adoption of a new Constitution in which the whole people shall have a voice , it is believed that the United Sts will have no difficulty in coming to a satisfactory arrangement with the Cubans . " Independence and a republican government is what we have fought for , " said a Cuban , " and while we will consent to no cessation of hostilities based on any promises from Spain , there will be no objection to dealings with the United States , so long as the guarantees our independence . " Regarding the Red Cross the Cubans said that the insurgent army would not only recognize it but welcome it among them . Barring a policy of forcible intervention , it was believed at the Junta that relief supplies will continue to be sent to Cuba in merchant vessels , but there was reason to believe that these vessels will be convoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion yesterday that all differences would be patched up . His company , the Compania TrasatiantIca Espanola , has issued no orders yet to discontinue the New York service . The Mexico sails to-day for Havana .
