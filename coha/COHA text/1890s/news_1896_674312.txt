txt The biggest fire that Brooklyn has had since the destruction of the last Brooklyn Tabernacle and the Regent Hotel , May 12 , 1894 , occurred last evening , in South Brooklyn , when a large five-story factory , extending from Seventh to Eighth Street ' : between Second and Third Avenues , was totally destroyed . One fireman was killed and three others were severely burned . The factory consisted of a brick building , which was 100 feet square , a foundry adjoining , and a wooden one-story extension used for boiler and engine rooms . The factory was erected in 1892 by Oscar E. A. Weissner , who ' occupied the first and second floors , for making enameled bedsteads . The third floor was occupied by J. Kryn Wanthers Brothers ' lapidary establishment ; the fourth floor was occupied by the Etta Knitting Mills , of which Levy &; Gentz are the proprietors . The fifth floor was unoccupied . All the operatives had gone home , and the building was supposed to be deserted , when , shortly before 7 o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In another moment the entire floor was ablaze . An alarm was sent in , but as soon as the firemen saw the fire they realized that they had no easy task before them , and they sent in two more alarms . bringing to the scene all the engines in South Brooklyn and many from the western district . The flames ran from floor to floor rapidly . The interior of the building was constructed of spruce beams and heavy flooring of the same wood . Half an hour after the first flame was seen the entire structure was a red-hot mass . The roof caved in , and as it descended it carried with it the beams and planks of the floors below , which fell with a crash and sent a great flame skyward , accompanied with a brilliant shower of sparks . The sky was crimson with the reflection , and it was seen for miles , attracting big crowds from all parts of the city . The front wall of the factory next began to break and fall , scattering the crowds they were allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly the other walls tottered and fell inward like a pack of cards , sending up another torch of flame . ' By this time the two-story foundry at the side of the factory and the boiler room , in the rear , were on fire , and the firemen were doing their best to save them . Foreman Charles Biggsby of Engine Company No. 39 decided to run a line of hose into the second floor of the foundry . With him were Firemen Alfred Bauman , John Quigley , and William Barry of the same company . They carried the hose into the building , and , were fighting the flames in front of them , when they were suddenly struck by a back draught . All were knocked to the floor . Bauman was the most badly injured and was unable to move , and Quigley was severely scorched . Barry was overcome by the smoke , and Fireman Biggsby was stunned , but with the exception of Bauman all were able to escape by leaping from a window . Assistant Foreman James Ryan of Truck Company No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by flame , rushed in to carry him out . but could not get near enough to him on account of the heat . He caught Bauman by the foot , but Bauman 's shoe came off in his hands . Ryan ran back and shouted for assistance , and Firemen Ferguson and Blair of Truck 5 ran to his aid . By this time Bauman was burned to death . It was terribly hot in the building , but the other firemen played a line of hose on the three men while they went into the place and drew his body out . Every stitch of clothing was burned from Bauman 's body , and his face was unrecognizable . " Quigly and Barry were sent to the Seney Hospital , but foreman Biggsby was able to resume his duties . ? The fire burned steadily until past midnight , when the charred boiler house and a portion of the brick building were all that was left of the factory . Mr. Weissnet was in this city when he received news of the fire , and he hurried over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said his losses would amount to $200,000 . The loss of the Etta Knitting Mills , he said , would be about $15,000 , and the lapidary establishment about $10,000 . The stock of diamonds carried by this concern was locked in safes , and it would probably be little damaged , it was thought . It was reported that Watchmen Boehn and James Jansen were missing . Alfred Bauman was the first fireman apnointed by Fire Commissioner , now Mayor Wurster , in January , 1894 . He stood at the head of the eligible list and was indorsed ? by Edward M. Shepard . He was transferred to Engine Company 39 eight months ago . He was about Menty-six years old and single . Axel Jacobson , thirty years old , of 137 Butler Street , while looking at the fire from an adjoining roof , lost his balance and fell to the sidewalk , a distance of sixty feet . He broke both of his legs . He was removed to the Long Island Hospital .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
