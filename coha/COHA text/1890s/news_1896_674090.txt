txt The cold weather made a new record In this city yesterday . Never since the establishment of the Weather Bureau had the thermometer marked so low a temperature as was reached at S o'clock yesterday morning , when the mercury dropped to 6.4 ' below zero , nearly half a degree below the lowest figure that had been recorded here since the establishment of the ' Weather Bu reau in 1869 . This was the turning point , and it begat to moderate gradually , but quite perceptibly , after that , as the sun came out , so that by noon it was 2 ? above zero , and by 3 o'clock in the afternoon the mercury had mounted to 8 ? above . At midnight last night it stood at 2 ? above . The records of the Weather Bureau in this city show that on Jan. 10 , 1875 , and Dec. 31. 1880 , the thermometer recorded 6 ? below zero , and on the 6th of last January it was 3 ? below , and this mark was also reached on Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded on Feb. 24 , 1873 . The sudden advent of the icy weather was phenomenal , and makes this cold spell one of the most remarkable on record . At S o'clock Sunday morning the thermometer marked 300 above zero . Snow was then falling , and was melting as rapidly as it fell . The thermometer , at S o'clock yesterday morning , indicated a fall of 36 ? in twenty-four hours . The mercury registered 52 ? above at 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon , and this shows a fall of 58* during the thirty-nine hours ending at 7 o'clock yesterday morning . The Weather Bureau Sunday night gave the temperature at midnight as almost at zero . It was found yesterday morning that one of the instruments was out of order , so the record had to be corrected , making it stand 6 ' above zero at midnight . Forecaster Dunn said yesterday : " We knew we were going to have a fall , but we did not know it would prove such a long one . We received orders on Saturday night from Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out notices to that effect . The wave is from the far Northwest . The high pressure Saturday night was central up near Winnipeg ; on Sunday night it was over the great lakes , and it seems to be about here now . But the mercury has fallen at points a little north of us and more inland . " In all the twenty-five years in which there has been a Weather Bureau , it has never been as low as 6.4 ? below here before . It may have been colder some time earlier in the century , but not very often . " This is the cold wave that we were looking for on Saturday from the Lake regions . It is central now in Canada , just north of the eastern part of the great lakes . " The crest of the cold wave is now upon us . Though it will still be cold to-morrow , it will be warmer than to-day . The wave can last but a clay or two . The weather is generally fair , except for a few snow flurries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m sight for us . " During the morning there was a stiff northwest breeze blowing across the city at the rate of seventeen miles an hour , but it subsided in the afternoon , and although the cold was very keenly felt , it did not cause much suffering because the air was clear and pure , and the sun shone brightly during the afternoon . It was an invigorating and exhilerating atmosphere . Ice began to form on the ponds in Central Park on Sunday night , and preparations are being made at Central Park and Van Cortlandt Lake for skating . The present cold snap has frozen the water to the thickness of several inches . A test was made by the Police yesterday afternoon , as soon as the rubbish that had accumulated on the water had been cleared off , but the ice was not found to be thick enough for skating . Capt . Collins said yesterday that he thought there would be the best skating of the year if the temperature kept in its present state until this morning . An unusual and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was noticed by those crossing the ferries early yesterday morning . It was particularly noticed by those coming to the city from Staten Island and South Brooklyn . The water was so much warmer than the air and there was so little wind that steam rose from the surface of the water to a height of from eight to twelve feet . The hulls of passing vessels were hidden from view , and nothing but their upper works and lofty spars could be seen . When the sun came out the mist was dispelled . The body of Alfred Hockenjos , twenty-one years old , who had been employed as a porter in Bloomingdale Brothers ' store , was found early yesterday morning in the areaway of his home , 171 ) East Ninety-sixth Street , and it is believed that his death was due to exposure to the extreme cold while he was in an unconscious condition . He had been out to a party Sunday night , and reached home some time after midnight . His father , who is the janitor of the house , was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he %Vent to bed . The bell of the janitor 's apartments is out of order , and Hockenjos believes his son , coming home after all the family had gone to bed , failed to arouse any one , and he then attempted to climb over the railing about the areaway , intending to reach the basement door , but stumbled and fell into the area . The injuries which he received in the fall were not apparently sufficient to cause death .
