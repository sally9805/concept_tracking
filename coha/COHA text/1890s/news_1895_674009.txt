txt The politicians have repeatedly attempted to fool the farmer by ? telling him that he was in danger of being ruined by a reduction or the removal of duties on certain farm products which are exported from this country in large quantities . We have read elaborate arguments , for example , designed to con-. vince the farmer that he was seriously injured when an ad valorem duty of 20 per cent . was substituted for the duty of 25 cents a bushel on apples and for the duty of 2 cents a pound on apples that have been dried or evaporated . These followers of assume , of course , that the average farmer has no knowledge of the official reports concerning our large exports of this kind of fruit . This year a great quantity of apples has been shipped abroad . Up to a recent date the number of barrels ' exported during the season of 1894-5 had been 1,443,592 . The demand in Europe is still strong , and prices there are firm . These figures are those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period which does no coincide with the Government 's fiscal year . Turning to the Government 's reports , we find the exports for the fiscal year ending on June 30 last stated as follows : For the fiscal year 1894 the quantity was much smaller , but in the fiscal year 1893 the exports were large , amounting in value to $1,580,052 . The crop in the United States this year is estimated to have been 66,000,000 barrels , and a considerable part of it has been lost because it was not profitable to pick and barrel the fruit  --  not because the farmer was driven out of the market by " a flood of cheap foreign apples . " The " flood " moves from our shores , not toward them . Both the apples of this country and those of Canada go to England and other countries on the other side of the Atlantic , and the people there pay a good price for them . Our apples are sold abroad in open competition with the " pauper " apples of other lands , and sold profitably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a tariff duty on foreign apples to protect him here at home against imported apples , and that he is injured by a reduction of the old duty ! But there are farmers who can be misled by such talk , and can thereby be bound to the support of a policy designed to increase the cost of the things which they must buy .
