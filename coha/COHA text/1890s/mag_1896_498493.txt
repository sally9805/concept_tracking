PREPARATIONS FOR A GENERAL ADVANCE . HE night of May 3 will always be * memorable in the recollection of - those who assembled in the little - front room of the house occupied as headquarters at Culpeper . The eight senior members of the staff seated themselves that evening about their chief to receiVe their final instructions , and participated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was to egin the next morning with all its hopes , its uncertainties , and its horrDrs . Sherman had been instructed to strike Joseph E. Johnston 's army in northwest Georgia , and make his way to Atlanta . Banks was to advance up the Red River and capture Shreveport . Sigel was ordered to make an expedition down the valley of Virginia , and endeavor to destroy a portion of the East Tennessee , Virginia , and Georgia Railroad . His movement was expected to keep Lee from withdrawing troops from the valley , and reinforcing his principal army , known as the Army of Northern Virginia . Butler was directed to move up the James River , and endeavor to secure Petersburg and the railways leading into it , and , if opportunity offered , to seize Richmond itself . Burnside , with the Ninth Corps , which had been moved from Annapolis into Virginia , was to support the Army of the Potomac . The subse ( luent movements of all the forces operating in Virginia were to depend largely upon the result of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Northern Virginia . General Grant felt , as he afterward expressed it in his official report , that our arVOL LIII. - 28. mies had acted heretofore too independently of one another- * without concert , like a balky team , no two eVer pulling together . ) ) To obviate this , he had made up his mind to launch all his armies against the Confederacy at the same time , to give the enemy no rest , and to allow him no opportunity to reinforce any of his armies by troops which were not themselves confronted by Union forces . GRANT 'S REASONS FOR MOVING BY THE LEFT FLANK . THE general sat for some time preparing a few final instructions in writing . After he . had finished he turned his back to the table , crossed one leg over the other , lighted a fresh cigar , and began to talk of the momentous movement which in a few hours was to begin . He said : *J weighed very carefully the advantages and disadvantages of moving against Lee 's left and moving against his right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would best prevent Lee from moving north to make raids , but it would deprive our army of the advantages of easy communication with a water base of supplies , and compel us to carry such a large amount of ammunition and ra4Aons in wagontrains , and detach so many troops as train guards , that I found it presented too many serious difficulties ; and when I considered especially the sufferings of the wounded in being transported long distances overland , instead of being carried by short routes to water , where they could be comfortably moved by boats , I had no longer any hesitation in deciding to cross the Rapidan below the position occupied by Lee 's army , and 217 // move by our left . This plan will also enable us to co√∂perate better with Butler 's forces , and not become separated too far from them . I shall not give my attention so much to Richmond as to Lee 's army , and I want all commanders to feel that hostile armies , and not cities , are to be their objective points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army was to be the objective point of the Army of the Potomac , and it was to move against Richmond only in case Lee went there . To use Grant 's own language to Meade , ( ( Wherever Lee goes , there you will go also . ) ) He of course thought it likely that Lee would fall back upon Richmond in case of defeat , and place himself behind its fortifications ; for he had said to Meade , in his instructions to him , " Should a siege of Richmond become necessary , ammunition and equipments can be got from the arsenals at Washington and Fort Monroe ) ) ; and during the discussion that evenin g he rose from his seat , stepped up to a map hanging upon the wall , and with a sweep of his forefinger indicated a line around Richmond and Petersburg ; and remarked : ( ( When my troops are there , Richmond is mine . Lee must retreat or surrender. * HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS STAFF . HE then communicated verbal instructions to his staff , which gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , and showed the value he placed upon celerity and the overcoming of delays in communicating orders . He said to us : " I want you to discuss with me freely from time to time the details of the orders given for the conduct of a battle , and learn my views as fully as possible as to what course should be pursued in all the contingencies which may arise . I expect to send you to the critical points of the lines to keep me promptly advised of what is taking place , and in cases of great emergency , when new dispositions have to be made on the instant , or it becomes suddenly necessary to reinforce one command by sending to its aid troops from another , and there is not time to communicate with headquarters , I want you to explain my views to commanders , and urge immediate action , looking to cooperation , without waiting for specific orders from me . ) ) He said he would locate his headquarters near those of Meade , and communicate his instructions through that officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indejiendent of the Army of the Potomac ; but that emergencies might arise in which he himself would have to give immediate direction to troops when actually engaged in battle . He never made known his plans far in advance to any one . It was his invariable custom to keep his contemplated movements locked up in his own mind to avoid all possibility of their being mentioned . What impressed every one most was the self-reliance displayed in perfecting his plans , and his absolute faith in their success . His calm confidence communicated itself to all who listened to him , and inspired them with a feeling akin to that of their chief . The discussion did not end till long past midnight . As usual on the eve of a battle , before the general retired he wrote a letter to Mrs. Grant . I did not know the nature of the contents of the letters to his wife until after the war , when Mrs. Grant , in speaking of them , said that they always contained words of cheer and comfort , expressed an abiding faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad thought which always oppressed him when he realized that many human lives would have to be sacrificed , and great sufferings would have to be endured by the wounded . The general 's letters to his wife were very frequent during a campaign , and no pressure of official duties was ever permitted to interrupt this correspondence . GRANT 'S NUMERICAL STRENGTH OFFSET BY LEE 'S STRATEGICAL ADVANTAGE . THE Rapidan separated the two hostile forces in northern Virginia . Lee 's headquarters were at Orange Court-House , a distance of seventeen miles from Culpeper . The Army of the Potomac consisted of the Second Corps , commanded by Hancock ; the Fifth , commanded by Warren ; the Sixth , commanded by Sedgwick ; and the cavalry corps under Sheridan . Besides these , there was Burnside 's separate command , consisting of the Ninth Army Corps . These troops numbered in all about 116,000 present for duty , equipped . The Army of Northern Virginia consisted of three infantry corps , commanded respectively by Longstreet , Ewell , and A. P. Hill , and a cavalry corps commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been accurately ascertained , but from the best data available it has been estimated at between 75,000 and 80,000 present for duty , equipped . Those familiar with military operations , and unprejudiced in their judgment , will concede that , notwithstanding Lee 's inferiority in numbers , the advantages were , neverthe // less , in his favor in the approaching campaign . Having interior lines , he was able to move by shorter marches , and to act constantly on the defensive at a period of the war when troops had learned to intrench themselves with marvelous rapidity , and force the invading army continually to assault fortified positions . The task to be performed by the Union forces was that of conducting a moving siege . The field of operations , with its numerous rivers and creeks difficult of approach , its lack of practicable roads , its dense forests , its impassable swamps , and its trying summer climate , debilitating to Northern troops , seemed specially designed by nature for purposes of defense . Lee and his officers were familiar with every foot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . His army was in a friendly country , from which provisions could be drawn from all directions , and few troops had to be detached to guard lines of supply . The Union army , on the contrary , was unfamiliar with the country , was without accurate maps , could seldom secure trustworthy guides , and had to detach large bodies of troops from the main command to guard its long lines of communication , protect its supply-trains , and conduct the wounded to points of safety . The Southern Confederacy was virtually a military despotism , with a soldier at the head of its government , and officers were appointed in the army entirely with reference to their military qualifications . Since Lee had taken command he had not losta single battle fought in the State of Virginia , and the prestige of success had an effect upon his troops the importance of which can not easily be overestimated . His men were made to feel that they were fighting for their homes and firesides ; the pulpit , the press , and the women were making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; disasters were concealed , temporary advantages were magnified into triumphant victories , and crushing defeats were hailed as blessings in disguise . In the North there was a divided press , with much carping criticism on the part of journals opposed to the war , which was fitted to discourage the troops and destroy their confidence in their leaders . There were hosts of Southern sympathizers , constituting a foe in the rear , whose threats and overt acts often necessitated the withdrawal of troops from tue front to hold them in check . In all the circumstances no just military critic will claim that the advantage was on the side of the Union army merely because it was numerically larger . CROSSING THE RAPIDAN . THE campaign in Virginia was to begin by throwing the Army of the Potomac with all celerity to the south side of the Rapidan , below Lee 's position . The infantry moved a little after twelve o'clock in the morning of May 4 . The cavalry dashed forward in advance under cover of the night , drove in the enemy 's pickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six miles below , and before six o'clock in the morning had laid two pontoon bridges at each place , and passed to the south side of the river . Warren 's corps crossed at Germanna Ford , followed by Sedgwick 's , while Hancock 's corps made the passage at Ely 's Ford . At 8 A. M. the general-in-chief , with his staff , started from headquarters , and set out for Germanna Ford , following Warren 's troops . He was mounted upon his bay horse ( ( Cincinnati , ) ) equipped with a saddle of the Grimsley pattern , which was somewhat the worse for wear , as the general had used it in all his campaigns from Donelson to the present time . Rawlins was on his left , and rode a ( ( clay-bank ) ) horse he had brought from the West named " General Blair , ) ) in honor of Frank P. Blair , who commanded a corps in the Army of the Tennessee . General Grant was dressed in a uniform coat andwaistcoat , the coat being unbuttoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wore a pair of plain topboots , reaching to his knees , and was equipped with a regulation sword , spurs , and sash . On his head was a slouch hat of black felt with a plain gold cord around it . His orderly carried strapped behind his saddle the general 's overcoat , which was that of a private soldier of cavalry . A sun as bright as the ( ( sun of Austerlitz* shone down upon the scene . Its light brought out in vivid colors the beauties of the landscape which lay before ns , and its rays were reflected with dazzling brilliancy from the brass field-pieces and the white covers of the wagons as they rolled lazily along in the distance . The crisp , bracing air seemed to impart to all a sense of exhilaration . As far as the eye could reach the troops were wending their way to the front . Their warbanners , bullet-riddled and battle-stained , floated proudly in the morning breeze . The roads resounded to the measured tread of the advancing columns , and the deep forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , elastic step and easy , swinging gait of the men , the cheerylook upon their faces , and the lusty shouts with which theygreeted their new commander as he passed , gave proof of // the temper of their metal , and the superb spirit which animated their hearts . If the general 's nature had been as emotional as that of Napoleon , he might have been moved to utter the words of the French emperor as his troops filed past him in moving to the field of Waterloo : *Magnificent , magnificent ! * But as General Grant was neither demonstrative nor communicative , he gave no expression whatever to his feelings . With the party on the way to the front rode a citizen whose identity and purposes soon became an object of anxious inquiry among the troops . His plain black , funereallooking citizen 's clothes presented a sight not often witnessed on a general 's staff , and attracted no little attention on the part of the soldiers , who began to make audible side remarks , evincing a searching curiosity to know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether it was a parson who had joined headquarters so as to be on hand to read the funeral service over the Southern Confederacy when the boys succeeded in getting it into the " last ditch . ) ) The person was *vIr . B. B. Washburne , member of Congress from General Grant 's district , who had arrived at headquarters a few days before , and had expressed a desire to accompany the army upon the opening campaign , to which the general had readily assented . A short time before noon the general-inchief crossed one of the pontoon bridges at Germanna Ford to the south side of the Rapidan , rode to the top of the bluff overlooking the river , and there dismounted , and established temporary headquarters at an old farm-house with Dutch gables and porch in front . It was rather dilapidated in appearance , and looked as if it had been deserted for some time . The only furniture it contained was a table and two chairs . Meade 's headquarters were located close by . General Grant sat down on the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent for some time , quietly watching Sedgwick 's men passing over the bridge . After a while he said : " Well , the movement so far has been as satisfactory as could be desired . We have succeeded in seizing the fords and crossing the river without loss or delay . Lee must by this time knowuponwhat roads we are advancing , but he may not yet realize the full extent of the movement . We shall probably soon get some indications as to what he intends to do . ) ) A representative of a newspaper , with whom the general was acquainted , now stepped up to him and said , " General Grant , about how long will it take you to get to Richmond ? ) ) The general replied at once : " I will agree to be there in about four days-that is , if General Lee becomes a party to the agreement ; but if he objects , the trip will undoubtedly be prolonged. * The correspondent looked as if he did not see just how he could base anydefinite predictions upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field map at the time , and , at the general 's request , handed it to him . He examined it attentively for a few minutes , and then returned it without making any remarks . The main roads were pretty well represented on our maps . The Germanna road runs a little east of south ; five miles from the Rapidan it is crossed by a road running east and west , called the Orange turnpike ; a mile beyond it intersects the Brock road , which runs north and south ; and a mile farther on the Brock road is crossed by the Orange plank-road running east and west . There were also some narrow cross-roads cut through the woods in various places . About one o'clock word came from Meade that our signal officers had succeeded in deciphering a message sent to General Ewell , which read as follows : " We are moving . Had I not better move D. and D. toward New Verdierville ? ( Signed ) R.* The general manifested considerable satisfaction at receiving this news , and remarked : " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee is drawing out from his position , and is pushing across to meet us . ) ) He now called for writing material , and placing a book upon his knee , laid the paper upon it , and wrote a despatch to Burnside at Rappahannock Station , saying : " Make forced marches until you reach this place . Start your troops now in the rear the moment they can be got off , and require them to make a night march . ) ) THE HEADQUARTERS MESS . A COLD lunch was then eaten off a pine table in the dining-room of the deserted house . Later in the afternoon our tents arrived , and were pitched near the house , and a little before dark the " mess ) ) sat down to dinner . The table had been laid under the fly of a large tent of the pattern known as the ( ( hospital tent . ) ) Perhaps no headquarters of a general in supreme command of great armies ever presented so democratic an appearance . All the officers of the staff dined at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation was as familiar as that which occurs in the household of any private family . Noth // ing could have been more informal or unconventional than the manner in which the mess was conducted . The staff-officers came to the table and left it at such times as their duties permitted , sometimes lingering over a meal to indulge in conversation , at other times remaining to take only a few mouthfuls in all haste before starting out upon the lines . The chief ate less and talked less than any other member of the staff , and partook only of the plainest food . ON THE EVE OF BATTLE . A cA*IP-FIRE of dry fence-rails had been built in front of the general 's tent , not because the evening was particularly cold , but for the reason that the fire lighted up the scene and made the camp look more cheerful . General Meade came over to headquarters after dinner , and took a seat upon a folding campchair by our fire , and he and General Grant entered into a most interesting discussion of the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered Meade a cigar . The wind was blowing , and he had some difficulty in lighting it , when General Grant offered him his flint and steel , which overcame the difficulty . The general always carried in the field a small silver tinder-box , in which there was a flint and steel with which to strike a spark and a coil of fuse , which was easily ignited by the spark , and not affected by the wind . The French would call it a briquet . While the two generals were talking , and a number of staff-officers sitting by listening , telegrams were received from Washington saying that Sherman had advanced in Georgia , Butler had ascended the James River , and Sigel 's forces were moving down the valley of Virginia . These advances were in obedience to General Grant 's previous orders . He said : " I do n't expect much from Sigel 's movement ; it is made principally for the purpose of preventing the enemy in his front from withdrawing troops to reinforce Lee 's army . To use an expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , when I was speaking of this general policy , ( If Sigel ca n't skin himself , he can hold a leg while somebody else skins . It is very gratifying to know that Hancock and Warren have made a march to-day of over twenty miles , with scarcely any stragglers from their commands . ) ) Telegrams were now sent to Washington announcing the entire success of the crossing of the Rapidan , and saying that it would be demonstrated before long whether the enemy intended to give battle on that side of Richmond . Meade soon after retired to his headquarters , and a little while before midnight General Grant entered his tent and turned in for the night . Its only furniture consisted of a portable cot made of a coarse canvas stretcher over a light wooden frame , a tin wash-basin which stood on an iron tripod , two folding camp-chairs , and a plain pine table . The general 's baggage was limited to one small camp trunk , which contained his underclothing , toilet artides , a suit of clothes , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GENERAL LONGSTREET , then commanding a corps in Lee 's army , told me , several years after the war , that the evening on which news was received that Grant intended to give personal direction to the army which was to operate against Lee , he had a conversation on the subject at Lee 's headquarters . An officer present talked very confidently of being able to whip with all ease the western general who was to confront them , at which Longstreet said : ( ( Do you know Grant ? ) ) ( ( No , ) ) the officer replied . ( ( Well , I do , ) ) continued Longstreet . " I was in the corps of cadets with him at West Point for three years , I was present at his wedding , I served in the same army with him in Mexico , I have observed his methods of warfare in the West , and Ibelievelknowhim through and through ; and I tell you that we can not afford to underrate him and the army he now commands . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to stay there ; for that man will fight us every day and every hour till the end of this war . In order to whip him we must outmaneuver him , and husband our strength as best w&amp; can . ) ) AN EARLY BREAKFAST AT HEADQUARTERS . AFTER the officers at headquarters had obtamed what sleep they could get , they arose about daylight , feeling that in all probability they would witness before night either a fight or a foot-race  --  a fight if the armies encountered each other , a foot-rice to secure good positions if the armies remained apart . General Meade had started south at dawn , moving along the Germanna road . General Grant intended to remain in his present camp till Burnside arrived , in order to give him some directions in person regarding his movements . The general sat down to the breakfast-table after nearly all the staffofficers had finished their morning meal . While he was slowly sipping his coffee , a // young newspaper reporter , whose appetite , the Germanna road , came to the crossing of combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here General Meade gained a substantial victory over his modesty , was seen standing near the roadside . He came slipped up to the table , took*a seat at the forward on foot to give General Grant the farther end , and remarked , " Well , I would n't latest information . The general now dismind taking a cup of something warm myself , mounted , and the two officers began to disif there s no objection . ) ) Thereupon seizing cuss the situation . a coffee-pot , he poured out a full ration of qwq the situation , he followed his habitual custom in warfare , and , instead of waiting to be attacked , took the initiative and pushed out against the enemy . Warren had been directed to move out in force on the Orange turnpike , Getty 's division of Sedgwick 's corps was put into position on Warren 's left , and as soon as it was found that the enemy was advancing on the Orange plank-road , orders were sent to Hancock to hurry up his troops , and take up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were progressing , General Grant lighted a cigar , sat down on the stump of a tree , took out his penknife , and began to whittle a stick . He kept on his brown thread gloves , and did not remove them once during the entire day . Everything was comparatively quiet until the hour of noon , when the stillness was suddenly broken by the sharp rattle of musketry and the roar of artillery . These sounds were the quick messengers which told that Warren had met the enemy and begun the conflict . He encountered Ewell 's corps , and drove it nearly a mile , but was soon compelled to fall back and restore the connection which had been lost between his divisions . Warren then had a conference with General Grant , who proposed that they should ride out to the front . He called for his horse , which had remained saddled , and directed me and another of the aides to accompany him . As General Warren was more familiar with the ground , he rode ahead . He was mounted on a fine-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow sash of a general officer . He was one of the few officers who wore their sashes in a campaign , or paid much attention to their dress . The party moved to the front along a narrow country road bordered by a heavy undergrowth of timber and bristling thickets . The infantry were struggling with difficulty through the dense woods , the wounded were lying along the roadside , firing still continued in front , and dense clouds of smoke hung above the tops of the trees . It was the opening scene of the horrors of the Wilderness . GRANT HEARS OF THE DEATH OF AN OLD COMRADE . AFTER having learned from personal inspection the exact character of the locality in which the battle was to be fought , General Grant returned to headquarters , in order to be able to communicate more promptly with the different commands . News had been received that Hill 's corps of Lee 's army was moving up rapidly on the Orange plank-road . Grant was now becoming impatient to take the initiative against the enemy , and staffofficers were sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was soon seen that the infantry would have to fight it out without much aid from the artillery , as it Was impossible to move many batteries to the front , owing to the difficult nature of the ground . Hancock , with great energy , had thrown forward two of his divisions to support Getty , who had already attacked Hill . I was sent to communicate with Hancock during this part of the engagement . The fighting had become exceedingly severe on that part of the field . General Alexander Hays , one of the most gallant officers in the service , commanding one of Hancock 's brigades , finding that his line had broken , rushed forward to encourage his troops , and was instantly killed . Getty and Carroll were severely wounded , but both refused to leave the field , and continued to command their troops throughout the fight . After remaining for some time with Hancock 's men , I returned to headquarters to report the situation to the general-in-chief , and carried to him the sad intelligence of Hays 's death . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon learning the intelligence I brought , he was visibly affected . He was seated upon the ground with his back against a tree , still whittling pine sticks . He sat for a time without uttering a word , and then , speaking in a low voice , and pausing between the sentences , said : ( ( Hays and I were cadets together for three years . We served for a time in the same regiment in the Mexican war . He was a noble man and a gallant officer . I am not surprised that he met his death at the head of his troops ; it was just like him . He was a man who would never follow , but would always lead in battle . ) ) A CONFERENCE BETWEEN GRANT AND MEADE . WADSWORTH 'S division of Warren 's corps was sent to support Hancock ; but it encountered great difficulty in working its way through the woods , and darkness set in before it could get within striking distance of the enemy . Sedgwick had some fighting on the right of Warren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About eight o'clock in the evening the firing died away , and the troops in the immediate presence of the enemy lay on their arms to await the events of the morning . Sheridan had left a force in the rear suffi // cient to protect the trains , and had formed the rest of his command so as to confront the enemy 's cavalry , which had been moved around by the right of the enemy 's line . He had some severe fighting on our extreme left . When we sat down at the mess-table at headquarters that evening , the events of the day were fully discussed , and each staff-officer related to the general in detail the scenes which had occurred upon the particular portion of the front which he had visited . Soon after we had risen from the table and left the mess-tent , Meade walked over from his headquarters , and he and the general-in-chief seated themselves by the camp-fire , and talked over the events of the day and the plans for the morrow . Mr. Washburne and our staff-officers made part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to relieving the wounded , and the medical officers and the commanders of troops were urged to make every possible effort to find the sufferers and convey them to the rear . Even in daylight it would have been a difficult undertaking to penetrate the thickets and carry the wounded to a place of safety , but at night it was almost impossible , for every time a lantern was shown , or a noise made , it was certain to attract the fire of the enemy . However , those who had been slightly wounded made their own way to the field-hospitals , and by dint of extraordinary exertions , great numbers of the seriously injured were brought to positions where they could be cared for . During the conversation General Grant remarked : ( ( As Burnside 's corps , on our side , and Longstreet 's , on the other side , have not been engaged , and the troops of both armies have been occupied principally in struggling through thickets and fighting for position , to-day 's work has not been much of a test of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engagement ; for it is evident that Lee attempted by a bold movement to strike this army in flank before it could be put into line of battle and be prepared to fight to advantage ; but in this he has failed . ) ) The plan agreed upon that night for the coming struggle was as follows : Hancock and Wadsworth were to make an attack on Hill at 4:30 A. M. , so as to strike him if possible before Longstreet could arrive to reinforce him . Burnside , who would arrive early in the morning with three divisions , was to send one division ( Stevenson 's ) to Hancock , and to put the other two divisions between Wadsworth and Warren 's other divisions , and attack Hill in flank , or at least obliquely , while Warren and Sedgwick were to att*ick along their fronts , inflict all the damage they could , and keep the troops opposed to them from reinforcing Hill and Longstreet . Burnside 's fourth division was to guard the wagon-trains . This division was composed of colored troops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through whom all orders were issued to the Army of the Potomac , was of the opinion that the troops could not be got into position for the attack as early as half-past four o'clock , and recommended six ; but General Grant objected , as he was apprehensive that this might give the enemy an opportunity to take the initiative . However , he agreed to postpone the time till five o'clock , and the final orders were given for that hour . Meade now arose , said good night , and walked over to his headquarters . Before eleven o'clock the general-in-chief remarked to the staff : ( ( We shall have a busy day to-morrow , and I think we had better get all the sleep we can tonight . I am a confirmed believer in the restorative qualities of sleep , and always like to get at least seven hours of it , though I have often been compelled to put up with much less . ) ) ( ( It is said , * remarked Washburne , ( ( that Napoleon often indulged in only four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mental faculties . ) ) ( ( Well , I , for one , never believed those stories , ) ) the general replied . " If the truth were known , I have no doubt it would be found that he made up for his short sleep at night by taking naps during the day . ) ) The chief then retired to his tent , and his example was followed by all the officers who could be spared from duty . The marked stillness which now reigned in camp formed a striking contrast to the shock and din of battle which had just ceased , and which was so soon to be renewed . GRANT 'S PREPARATION FOR THE SECOND DAY IN THE WILDERNESS . AT four o'clock the next morning , 1'Jay 6 , we were awakened in our camp by the sound of Burnside 's men moving along the Germanna road . They had been marching since 1 A. M. , hurrying on to reach the left of Warren . The members of the headquarters mess soon after assembled to partake of a hasty breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so exhausting a day as that which was to follow . He took a cucumber , sliced it , poured some vinegar over it , and partook of nothing else except a cup of strong coffee . The first thing he did after // rising from the table was to call for a fresh supply of cigars . His colored servant " Bill brought him two dozen . After lighting one of them , he filled his pockets with the rest . He then went over to the knoll , and began to walk back and forth slowly upon the cleared portion of the ridge . While listening for Hancock 's attack on the left , we heard the sound of heavy firing on the right , and found that the enemy had attacked Sedgwick and Warren . Warren afterward had one brigade pretty roughly handled , and driven back some distance ; but no ground was permanently lost or gained by either side on that part of the line . Promptly at five o'clock the roar of battle was heard in Hancock 's front , and before seven he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confusion more than a mile . The general now instructed i*e to ride out to Hancock 's front , inform him of the progress of Burnside 's movement , explain the assistance that officer was expected to render , and tell him more fully the object of sending to his aid Stevenson 's division of Burnside 's corps . HANCOCK FLUSHED WITH VICTORY . I MET Hancock on the Orange plank-road , not far from its junction with the Brock road , actively engaged in directing his troops , and restoring the confusion in their alinement caused by the desperate fighting and the difficult character of the ground . All thought of the battle which raged about us was to me for a moment lost in a contemplation of the dramatic scene presented in the person of the knightly corps commander . He had just driven the enemy a mile and a half . His face was flushed with the excitement of victory , his eyes were lighted by the fire of battle , his flaxen hair was thrust back from his temples , his right arm was extended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave his orders , and his commanding form towered still higher as he rose in his stirrups to peer through the openings in the woods . He was considered the handsomest general officer in the army , and at this moment he looked like a spirited portrait from the hands of a master artist , with the deep brown of the dense forest forming a fitting background . It was itself enough to inspire the troops he led to deeds of unmatched heroism . He had been well dubbed " Hancock the Superb . ) ) This expression dated back to the field of Williamsburg . At the close of that battle , General McClellan sent a telegram to his wife in New York announcing his victory , and as she and Hancock were old VOL LIII. - 29. friends , he added the words , " Hancock was superb. * The newspapers got hold of the despatch , and the designation was heralded in prominent head-lines throughout the entire press . The description was so appropriate that the designation clung to him through life . Along the line of Hancock 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded strewed the roads ; prisoners had been captured , and battle-flags had been taken : but Hancock was now compelled to halt and restore the contact between his commands . Before nine o'clock , however , he was pushing out again on the Orange plankroad , and another fierce fight soon began . Sheridan had become engaged in a spirited contest with Stuart 's cavalry on the left at Todd 's tavern , in which our troops were completely victorious . The sound of this conflict was mistaken for a time for an attack by Longstreet from that direction , and made Hancock anxious to strengthen his exposed left flank . His embarrassments were increased by one of those singular accidents which , though trivial in themselves , often turn the tide of battle . A body of infantry was reported to be advancing up the Brock road , and moving upon Hancock 's left and rear . A brigade which could ill be spared was at once thrown out in that direction to resist the threatened attack . Itsoon appeared that the body of infantry consisted of about seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their commands . The incident , however , had caused the loss of valuable time . These occurrences prevented Hancock from further taking the offensive . After waiting for some time , and hearing nothing of Burnside 's contemplated assault , I told Hancock I would ride over to Burnside , explain to him fully the situation on the left , and urge upon him the importance of making all possible haste . Upon reaching his position , I found that he was meeting with many difficulties in moving his men into position , and was making very little progress . I explained the absolute necessity of going to the relief of Hancock , and Colonel Comstock and I labored vigorously 4o help to find some means of getting the troops through the woods . Seeing the difficulties in the way , I returned to General Grant to let him know the true situation , and that an early attack from that quarter could not be depended upon . GRANT AT A CRITICAL MOMENT . WARREN 'S troops were driven back on a portion of his line in front of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear , the enemy 's shells were beginning to fall on the knoll where General Grant was seated on the stump of a tree , and it looked for a while as if the tide of battle would sweep over that point of the field . He rose slowly to his feet , and stood for a time watching the scene , and mingling the smoke of his cigar with the smoke of battle , without making any comments . His horse was in charge of an orderly just behind the hill , but he evidently had no thought of mounting . An officer ventured to remark to him , " General , would n't it be prudent to move headquarters to the other side of the Germanna road till the result of the present attack is known ? * The general replied very quietly , between the puffs of his cigar , " It strikes me it would be better to order up some artillery and defend the present location . ) ) Thereupon a battery was brought up , and every preparation made for defense . The enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this instance , as in many others , the general was true to the motto of his Scottish ancestors of the Grant clan : ( ( Stand fast , Craig Ellachie. * About eleven o'clock the battle raged again with renewed fury on Hancock 's front . He had been attacked in front and on the flank by a sudden advance of the enemy , who , concealed by the dense wood , had approached near at several points before opening fire . situation . This caused some confusion among Hancock 's troops , who had become in great measure exhausted by their fighting since five o'clock in the morning , and they were now compelled to fall back to their breastworks along the Brock road . The enemy pressed on to within a few hundred yards of the intrenchments , but did not venture to assault . In this attack Longstreet was badly wounded , and the Confederate general Jenkins was killed , both having been accidentally shot by their own men . We suffered a severe loss in the death of the gallant General Wadsworth . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his right in person , as we learned afterward , and ordered that any further assault should be postponed till a later hour . Colonel Leasure 's brigade of Burnside 's corps now executed a movement of striking brilliancy . It had been sent to Hancock , and posted on the left of his line , and was ordered by him to sweep along his front from left to right . Leasure moved out promptly , facing to the right , with his right flank about a hundred yards from our line of breastworks , and dashed along the entire front with such boldness and audacity that the portions of the enemy he encountered fell back without attempting to make any serious resistance . General Grant was becoming more anxious still about Burnside 's attack , and I soon after galloped over to the latterwith instructions to move on without a moment 's delay , and connect with Hancock 's right at all hazards . I found his troops endeavoring to obey orders as best they could , but , in struggling through underbrush and swamps , all efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I met him this time , was dismounted and seated by the roadside . A champagne basket filled with lunch had been brought up , and at his invitation I joined him and some of his staff in sampling the attractive contents of the hamper . In doing so we acted upon the recognized principle of experienced campaigners , who always eat a meal wherever they can get it , not knowing where the next one is to come from . It was called ( ( eating for the future . ) ) A little after noon Burnside 's advance became engaged for about a quarter of an hour , but did not accomplish any important result . I worked my way out on foot to his extreme front line at this time , to obtain a more accurate knowledge of the difficulties which impeded the advance of his troops , and then returned again to headquarters to report the THE CRISIS OF THE WILDERNESS . ABOUT half the army was now under Hancock 's command , and it was probable that he would need still more reinforcements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our right , which had been weakened . At 10:30 A. M. Sedgwick and Warren had been ordered to intrench their fronts and do everything possible to strengthen their positions . A portion of the wagon-train guards had been ordered to report to Sedgwick for duty on his front . Every one on the right was on the alert , and eager to hear particulars about the fighting on the left . The various commands had been advised from time to time of the events which occurred , for it was General Grant 's invariable custom to have commanding officers on different points of the line promptly informed of what occurred at other points . Generals Grant and Meade , after discussing the situation , now decided to have Hancock and Burnside make a simultaneous attack at 6 r . M. It was then supposed that Buruside would certainly be in position by that hour // to unite in such an assault . I started for Hancock 's front to confer with him regarding this movement , and just asl joined his troops , the enemy , directed by Lee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault upon our line . It began at 4:15 P. M. The woods in front of Hancock had now taken fire , and the flames were communicated to his log breastworks and abatis of slashed timber . The wind was , unfortunately , blowing in our direction , and the blinding smoke was driven in the faces of our men , while the fire itself swept down upon them . For a time they battled heroically to maintain their position , fighting both the conflagration and the enemy 's advancing columns . At last , however , the breastworks became untenable , and some of the troops who had displayed such brilliant qualities during the entire day now fell back in confusion . The enemy took advantage of the disorder , and , rushing forward with cheers , succeeded in planting some of his battle-flags upon our front line of breastworks ; but Hancock and all the staffofficers present made strenuous exertions to rally the men , and many of them were soon brought back to the front . General Carroll 's brigade was now ordered to form and retake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , led by the intrepid Carroll in person , dashing forward at a run , and cheering as they went , swept everything before them , and in a few minutes were in possession of the works . Both the attack and counter-attackwere so handsomely made that they elicited praise from friend and foe alike . Some of Hancock 's artillery was served with great efficiency in this engagement , and added much to the result . At five o'clock the enemy had been completely repulsed , and fell back , leaving a large number of his dead and wounded on the field . Burnside made an attack at half-past five , but with no important results . The nature of the ground was a more formidable obstruction than the enemy . Warren and Sedgwick had been engaged during part of the day , and had prevented the enemy in front of them from withdrawing any troops , but notwithstanding their gallant fighting they had substantially gained no ground . GRANT 'S DEMEANOR ON THE FIELD . WHILE the most critical movements were taking place , General Grant manifested no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received communications , with a coolness and deliberation which made a marked impression upon those who had been brought into contact with him for the first time on the field of battle . His speech was never hurried , and his manner betrayed no trace of excitability or even impatience . He never exhibited to better advantage his peculiar ability in movingtroops with unparalleled speed tothe critical points on the line of battle where they were most needed , or , as it was sometimes called , ( ( feeding a fight . ) ) There was a spur on the heel of every order he sent , and his subordinates were made to realize that in battle it is the minutes which control events . He said , while waiting for Burnside to get into position and attack : " The only time I ever feel impatient is when I give an order for an important movement of troops in the presence of the enemy , and am waiting for them to reach their destination . Then the minutes seem like hours . ) ) He rode out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in company with General Meade and two officers of the staff . It was noticed that he was visibly affected by his proximity to the wounded , and especially by the sight of blood . He would turn his face away from such scenes , and show by the expression of his countenance , and sometimes by a pause in his conversation , that he felt most keenly the painful spectacle presented by the field of battle . Some reference was made to the subject in camp that evening , and the general said : ( ( I can not bear the sight of suffering . The night after the first day 's fight at Shiloh I was sitting on the ground , leaning against a tree , trying to get some sleep . It soon began to rain so hard that I went into a log-house near by to seek shelter ; but I found the surgeons had taken possession of it , and were amputating the arms and legs of the wounded , and blood was flowing in streams . I could not endure such a scene , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit there till morning in the storm . ) ) I thought of this remark while sitting by his bedside twenty-one years afterward , when he , in the last days of his fatal illness , was himself undergoing supreme physical torture . HIS PECULIARITIES IN BATTLE . AS the general felt that he could be found more readily , and could issue his orders more promptly , from the central point which he had chosen for his headquarters , he remained there almost the entire day . He would at times walk slowly up and down , but most of the day he sat upon the stump of a tree , or on the ground , with his back leaning against // a tree . The thread gloves remained on his hands , a lighted cigar was in his mouth almost constantly , and his penknife was kept in active use whittling sticks . He would pick up one small twigafter another , and sometimes holding the small end away from him would rapidly shave it down to a point ; at other times he would turn the point toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he would girdle it , cut it in two , throw it away and begin on another . We had long been accused of being a nation of whittlers , and this practice on the part of such a conspicuous representative American seemed to give color to the charge . He seldom indulged in this habit in subsequent battles . The occupation played sad havoc with the thread gloves , and before nightfall several holes had been worn in them , from which his finger nails protruded . Mter that day the gloves disappeared , and the general thereafter went without them in camp , and wore the usual buckskin gauntlets when on horseback . It was not till the Appomattox campaign that another pair of thread gloves was donned . There was a mystery about the use of those gloves which was never entirely solved . The impression was that Mrs. Grant had purchased them , and handed them to the general before he started from Washington , and that , either in deference to her , or because he had a notion that the officers in the Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armies of the West , he wore the gloves continuously for the first three days of his opening campaign in Virginia ; that is to say , as long as they lasted under the wear and tear to which he subjected them . GRANT 'S CONFIDENCE IN SUCCESS . His confidence was never for a moment shaken in the outcome of the general engagement in the Wilderness , and he never once doubted his ability to make a forward movement as the result of that battle . At a critical period of the day he sent instructions to have all the pontoon bridges over the Rapidan in his rear taken up , except the one at Germanna Ford . A short time after giving this order he called General Rawlins , Colonel Babcock , and me to him , and asked for a map . As we sat together on the ground , his legs tucked under him , tailor fashion , he looked over the map , and said : 4 do not hope to gain any very decided advantage from the fighting in this forest . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he started the enemy on the run ; but it was impossible for him to see his own troops , or the true position of the enemy , and the success gained could not be followed up in such a country . I can certainly drive Lee back into his works , but I shall not assault him there ; he would have all the advantage in such a fight . If he falls back and intrenches , my notion is to move promptly toward the left . This will , in all probability , compel him to try and throw himself between us and Richmond , and in such a movement I hope to be able to attack him in a more open country , and outside of his breastworks. * This was the second time only that he had looked at the maps since crossing the Rapidan , and it was always noticeable in a campaign how seldom he consulted them , compared with the constant examination of them by most other prominent commanders . The explanation of it is that he had an extraordinary memory as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking critically at a map of a locality , it seemed to become photographed indelibly upon his brain , and he could follow its features without referring to it again . Besides , he possessed an almost intuitive knowledge of topography , and never became confused as to the points of the compass . He was a natural " bushwhacker , ) ) and was never so much at home as when finding his way by the course of streams , the contour of the hills , and the general features of the country . I asked him , one day , whether he had ever been deceived as to the points of the compass . He said : ( ( Only once-when I arrived at Cairo , Illinois . The effect of that curious bend in the river turned me completely around , and when the sun came up the first morning after I got there , it seemed to me that it rose directly in the west . ) ) THE GENERAL-IN-CHIEF AS AID TO A DROVER . DuRING a lull in the battle late in the afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over toward the Germanna road . While we stood on the bank of a small rivulet , a drove of beef cattle was driven past . One of the animals strayed into the stream , and had evidently made up its mind to part company with its fellows and come over to our side . One of the drovers yelled out to the general , who was a little in advance of his officers : " I say , stranger , head off that beef critter for me , will you ? ) ) The general , hayingalways prided himself upon being a practical farmer , felt asmuch at home in handling cattle as in directing armies , and without // changing countenance at once stepped forward , threw up his hands , and shouted to the animal . It stopped , took a look at him , and then , as if sufficiently impressed with this show of authority , turned back into the road . The general made no comment whatever upon this incident , and seemed to think no more about the salutation he had received than if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , that the man did not recognize him . If he had supposed the man was lacking in proper military respect , he would perhaps have administered to him the same lesson which he once taught a soldier in the Twenty-first Illinois , when he commanded that regiment . An officer who had served under him at the time told me that Colonel Grant , as he came out of his tent one morning , found a strapping big fellow posted as sentinel , who nodded his head good-naturedly , smiled blandly , and said , ( ( Howdy , colonel ? ) ) His commander cried , ( ( Hand me your piece , and upon taking it , faced the soldier and came to a ( ( present arms ) ) ; then handing hack the musket , he remarked , " That is the way to say ( How do you do ) to your colonel . ) ) CONFUSION CAUSED BY A NIGHT ATTACK . IT was now about sundown ; the storm of battle which had raged with unabated fury from early dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack at six o'clock had been abandoned on account of the assault of the enemy on Hancock 's front , and the difficulty of perfecting the alinements and supplying the men with ammunition . It was felt that the day 's strife had ended , unless Lee should risk another attack . Just then the stillness was broken by heavy volleys of musketry on our extreme right , which told that Sedgwick had been assaulted , and was actually engaged with the enemy . The attack against which the general-in-chief during the day had ordered every precaution to be taken had now been made . Meade was at Grant 's headquarters at the time . They had just left the top of the knoll , and were standing in front of General Grant 's tent talking to Mr. Washburne . Staff-officers and couriers were soon seen galloping up to Meade 's headquarters , and his chief-of-staff , General Humphreys , sent word that the attack was directed against our extreme right , and that a part of Sedgwick 's line had been driven back in some confusion . Generals Grant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff-officers , x*alked rapidly over to Meade 's tent , and found that the reports still coming in were bringing news of increasing disaster . It was soon reported that General Shaler and part of his brigade had been captured ; then that General Seymour and several hundred of his men had fallen into the hands of the enemy ; afterward that our right had been turned , and Ferrero 's division cut off and forced *back upon the Rapidan . General Humphreys , on receiving the first reports , had given prompt instructions with a view to strengthening the point of the line attacked . General Grant now took the matter in hand with his accustomed vigor . Darkness had set in , but thefiringstill continued . Aides came galloping in from the right , laboring under intense excitement , talking wildly , and giving the most exaggerated reports of the engagement . Some declared that a large force had broken and scattered Sedgwick 's entire corps . Others insisted that the enemy had turned our right completely , and captured the wagon-train . It was asserted at one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales of disaster would have been enough to inspire serious apprehension in daylight and under ordinary circumstances ' . In the darkness of the night , in the gloom of a tangled forest , and after men 's nerves had been racked by the strain of a two days ' desperate battle , the most immovable commander might have been shaken . But it was in just such sudden emergencies that General Grant was always at his best . Without the change of a muscle of his face , or the slightest alteration in the tones of his voice , he quietly interrogated the officers who brought the reports ; then , sifting out the truth from the mass of exaggerations , he gave directions for relieving the situation with the marvelous rapidity which was always characteristic of him when directing movements in the face of an enemy . Reinforcements were hurried to the point attacked , and preparations made for Sedgwick 's corps to take up a new line , with the front and right thrown back . General Grant soon walked over to his own camp , seated himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh cigar , and there continued to receive further advices from the right . GRANT ADMINISTERS A REPRIMAND . A GENERAL officer came in from his command at this juncture , and said to the general-inchief , speaking rapidly and laboring under considerable excitement : " General Grant , this is a crisis that can not be looked upon too seriously . I know Lee 's methods well by // past experience ; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan , and cut us off completely from our communications ? ) The general rose to his feet , took his cigar out of his mouth , turned to the officer , and replied , with a degree of animation which he seldom manifested : ( ( Oh , I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do . Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault , and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time . Go back to your command , and try to think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to do . ) ) The officer retired rather crestfallen , and without saying a word in reply . This recalls a very pertinent criticism regarding his chief once made in my presence by General Sherman . He said : " Grant always seemed pretty certain to win when he went into a fight with anything like equal numbers . I believe the chief reason why he was more successful than others was that while they were thinking so much about what the enemy was going to do , Grant was thinking all the time about what he was going to do himself . ) ) GRANT AFTER THE BATTLE . HANCOCK came to headquarters about 8 P. M. , and had a conference with the general-inchief and General Meade . He had had a very busy day on his front , and while he was cheery , and showed that there was still plenty of fight left in him , he manifested signs of fatigue after his exhausting labors . General Grant , in offering him a cigar , found that only one was left in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply he had started out with in the morning showed that he had smoked that day about twenty , all very strong and of formidable size . But it must be remembered that it was a particularly long day . He never afterward equaled that record in the use of tobacco . The general , after having given his final orders providing for any emergency which might arise , entered his tent , and threw himself down upon his camp-bed . Ten minutes thereafter an alarming report was received from the right . I looked in his tent , and found him sleeping as soundly and as peacefully as an infant . I waked him , and communicated the report . His military instincts convinced him that it was a gross exaggeration , and as he had already made every provision for meeting any renewed attempts against the right , he turned over in his bed , and immediately went to sleep again . Txventy one years thereafter as I sat by his death-bed , when his sufferings had become agonizing , and he was racked by the tortures of insomnia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said : ( ( Ah , yes ; it seems strange that I , who always slept so well in the field , should now pass whole nights in the quiet of this peaceful house without being able to close my eyes . ) ) It was soon ascertained that although Sedgwick 's line had been forced back with some loss , and Shaler and Seymour had been made prisoners , only a few hundred men had been captured , and the enemy had been compelled to withdraw . General Grant had great confidence in Sedgwick in such an emergency , and the event showed that it was not misplaced . The attack on our right , and its repulse , ended the memorable battle of the Wilderness . The losses were found to be : killed , 2246 ; wounded , 12,037 ; missing , 3383 ; total , 17,666 . The damage inflicted upon the enemy is not known , but as he was the assaulting party as often as the Union army , there is reason to believe that the losses on the two sides were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied in fighting , and counting the casualties in both armies , it will be found that on that bloody field every minute recorded the loss of twentyfive men . As the staff-officers threw themselves upon the ground that night , sleep came to them without coaxing . They had been on the move since dawn , galloping over bad roads , struggling about through forest openings , jumping rivulets , wading swamps , helping to rally troops , dodging bullets , and searching for commanding officers in all sorts of unknown places . Their horses had been crippled , and they themselves were well-nigh exhausted . For the small part I had been able to perform in the engagement , the general recommended me for the brevet rank of major in the regular army , ( ( for gallant and meritorious services . ) ) His recommendation was afterward approved by the President . This promotion was especially gratifying for the reason that it was conferred for conduct in the first battle in which I had served under the command of the general-in-chief . THE WILDERNESS A UNIQUE cOMBAT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched in the annals of warfare . For two days nearly 200,000 veteran troops had struggled in a death-grapple , // confronted at each step with almost every obstacle by which nature could bar their path , and groping their way through a tangled forest the impenetrable gloom of which could be likened only to the shadow of death . The undergrowth stayed their progress , the upper growth shut out the light of heaven . Officers could rarely see their troops for any considerable distance , for smoke clouded the vision , and a heavy sky obscured the sun . Directions were ascertained and lines established by means of the pocket-compass , and a change of position often presented an operation more like a problem of ocean navigation than a question of military mamnuvers . It was the sense of sound and of touch rather than the sense of sight which guided the movements . It was a battle fought with the ear , and not with the eye . All circumstances seemed to combine to make the scene one of unutterable horror . At times the wind howled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dying , and heavy branches were cut off by the fire of the artillery , and fell crashing upon the heads of the men , adding a new terror to battle . Forest fires raged ; ammunition-trains exploded ; the dead were roasted in the conflagration ; the wounded , roused by its hot breath , dragged themselves along , with their torn and mangled limbs , in the mad energy of despair , to. *scape the ravages of the flames ; and every bush seemed hung with shreds of blood-stained clothing . It was as though Christian men had turned to fiends , and hell itself had usurped the place of earth .
