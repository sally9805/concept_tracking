txt The commercial exchanges which are instrumental in marketing the great staple products of the country are once more trying to defeat that compound of ignorance and demagogy , the Hatch AntiOption bill . The bill now in the hands of the House committee is not quite the same as that which passed the House and was postponed in the Senate during the last Congress , but it is based on the same fallacious notions . Its opponents claim that it is unconstitutional , because , while pretending to be a revenue measure , its purpose is not to produce revenue , but to interfere with trade , a thing which Congress has no authority to do within any State . But so many things have been done in the name of revenue whose real purpose was something else that there is no certainty that this claim would be sustained . It was virtually a confession that this bill was not a revenue measure when it was taken out of the hands of the Ways and Means Committee and referred to the Committee on Agriculture , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suppress a certain kind of trading in products of the soil . There is an assumption on the part of Chairman Hatch that the interests of the Exchanges which deal with cotton and grain and other great crop products are opposed to those of the farmers who raise them , and possibly he believes it . There are men who can make themselves believe anything , however irrational . When he asked the President of the New-York Cotton Exchange whether he thought that the farming and agricultural interests were entitled to any consideration and got for an answer the opinion that they had no adequate knowledge of the subject , he seemed to regard the reply as somewhat presumptuous . It is not very clear how far the farmers are in favor of the Anti-Option bill , but it is certain that so far as they are in favor of it they have no adequate knowledge of its purpose and effect . It is not to be presumed that they should understand the complex operations of trade any more than that members of the Produce Exchange should be experts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they really demand a suppression of dealings in futures and options , they are misled regarding their own interests . The plea of the Exchange men that the right to buy and sell is inalienable will have little effect , so Iong as supporters of the bill believe that any particular method of buying and selling is injurious to producers . A man has in reality as much right to sell an article at a certain price with the intention of . buying it at a lower price before the time of delivery , so as to make his profit , as he has to buy it at a certain price now , with the intention of selling it in the future at a higher price to get his profit . In either case he may miscalculate and incur a loss , instead of making a profit , but he does no injury to the producer . He can not control the price as determined by the law of supply and demand any more in one case than in the other , except as fluctuations may be moderated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling sides . On the contrary , his action is controlled by the irresistible course of prices , and the man who sells for future delivery may settle his transaction without buying , just as a man who buys to sell again may get out of his bargain by pa'ing to be let off . All these transactions , which are more or less speculative and based upon calculations as to supply and demand and the course of prices , do not of themselves affect the producers one way or another . The operations of the Exchanges , which involve so many speculative ventures , do have , a very material effect upon farming and . agricultural interests in the long run , but it is a beneficial effect . The system has been built up out of the necessity of providing means and methods of marketing those products of the country for which the demand is continuous and of which the supply varies largely with the season of crops . It serves the purpose of preventing wide fluctuations hi prices and of steadying the market under this variation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future delivery in advance of obtaining the article sold is a potent means of distributing in a comparatively steady stream a supply that would naturally come in periodical floods . It keeps the price from falling abnormally when the crops come in , which would cause great loss to the farmers , and from rising abnormally in the later months , to the great profit of the traders into whose hands the products would have passed . The system may have its abuses from which speculators win and lose , but it is one from which farmers benefit . If they think it injures them and that they would gain by the suppression of buying for future delivery , it is unquestionably because they have no " adequate knowledge " of the subject . The passage of the AntiOption bill would do a vast injury to the trading class , as the upsetting of any established system would , but the farmers would feel its effects most severely , and their best friends are those who seek to prevent this kind of legislation .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
