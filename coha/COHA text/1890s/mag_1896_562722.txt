txt CEarAn* words and phrases which were invented by naturalists to denote matters connected with the history of organic species have been taken over by the students of society and used to denote actions which they presume to be essentially like those to which the words were first applied . In this way such terms as natural selection , environment , atavism , etc. , have become current in fields where their significance is doubtful . In this as in other cases there is always danger that the imported word becomes what Bentham well called " a question-begging epithet , " for the reason that it has a connotation which , though true in its original use , is false in its secondary application . Thus it is with euvironment . As used by botanists and zo6logists , it had a much more limited and definite meaning than it has come to possess in the very complicated affairs of human society , where it is used to designate not only the assemblage of physical influences but those of an intellectual and moral nature as well . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of actual or supposed influences which are of the utmost importance , it may be well to examine into the limitations which we should place upon it in its transformed state . For this purpose I have selected the district of New England , which , more than any other known to me , affords a satisfactory territory for the discussion of this question . The advantages of New England as a field for an inquiry into the influences of environment are in general as follows : the country has been long inhabited by the people of our race , long enough at lea*t , for an immediate effect of the surroundings to become evident ; its physical conditions are well known ; the people have attained a high degree of differentiation as to employments ; // the opportunities of comparing the folk with the ancestral stock beyond the sea are more than usually good . In fact , if there be anywhere a chance to determine the value of physical conditions in the development of peoples , we may expect to find it here . In considering the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England is much more like Old England than is any other part of America ; this likeness is shown in many ways . To begin with , the surface of the country , unlike that of the continent in general , is extremely diversified ; it has indeed the localized character of surface soil and in a measure of climate which we find in Great Britain . When as a young man I came from the tablelaud of Kentucky to study in New England , I remarked to the elder Agassiz that impression of relatively great variety which this seaboard country made upon me . He said that the area seemed to him essentially like that of the old world in that it had an exceedingly diversified character . Between the mountains of New Hampshire and Vermont and the lowlands of Southeastern Massachusetts there are as great differences in conditions as are found in Great Britain , in passing from the Highlands of Scotland to the plains of Norfolk . In the area of almost any county of the six New England States we discover a range of soil-conditions extending from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swamps of the valleys , or it may be the marine marshes of the seashore . Everywhere there is lacking the consolidated character of the inner part , the centre ' , of this continent . Thus in New England the colonists found a fair semblance of much with which they were familiar in their native land , so that we can not expect to discern among the influences of environment any effects which would be immediately due to the ch*nge in the matter of soil , climate or shape of the country . There are , it is true , noteworthy variations in all these features , the range of temperature is greater , the seasons vary somewhat in their order and accent , the rainfall is otherwise distributed than in Great Britain , but there is no such variation as could fairly be expected to stamp itself upon the people . Turning now to the conditions which from their nature are likely to have a shaping influence upon the population of New England , we find at once a number of physical features // which not directly but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of the population . Taking these in their natural order , we may begin with the subterranean stores of mineral wealth of the district . In this subterranean field we find extremely limited resources . From the first settlement to the present day the result of explorations has been to turn the minds of the people away from the occupations of the mine , from that generally delusive and usually disasttous expectation that fortune was to be won by finding precious metals . In later days stone quarries and occasional veins of pyrite and other ores have opened the way to profit , but these are matters of modern times . The early people were by the structure of the country turned away from the underground realm . Even in this day of accurate and untiring search for mineral resources , this part of the continent remains without discovered basis for extensive mining industries . When we note the evils which the search for the precious metals has brought upon other colonies , we may regard the sterility of the under-earth as one of the good fortunes of Nexv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count for much in the life of peoples . The soil of New England is , on the whole , not unlike that of Wales and Scotland . It yields the same crops , in rather scantier measure ; as in those more rugged parts of the mother country , not more than one-half the area is or can be made in any way fit for the plow . Like as are the conditions of the earth in the old land and the new , there were certain circumstances of contact which were peculiar , and which were very effective in determining the history of the people . The whole of New England has been in a remarkable way affected by the actioi* of the ice and water of the last glacial period . Although the same calamitous period affected the British Isles as well , the diversity of actions there was much less than on the western side of the Atlantic . In the old world region the effect of the visitation , so far as the soil is concerned , was , in the main , to leave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulder clay upon the surface , which , though rather bouldery , is generally brought under tillage without much difficulty . In New England the division of the surface was usually into very stony fields , where it required from fifty to two hundred days of labor to bring about a good tilth , and into sandy areas , where the soil was ready for // the plow as soon as the forest had been cleared away , and decay had removed the roots of the trees . These two classes of soils are of such importance in the economic development of this area that their origtn should be understood . The till or boulder clay element in this and other countries is made up of a confused mixture of clay , sand , pebbles , and boulders , which became commingled with the ice as it moved forward in its slow but energetic movement . This debris descended upon the surface of the earth where the ice melted away , and has remained where it came to rest . While this till is the prevailing surface material of New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very different deposit , formed at the same time mainly in front of the slowly retreating ice fields . This com* monly takes on the character of sandy plains which are often curiously pitted . These plains were formed by the rivers which emerged from beneath the ice , carrying with them great quantities of comminuted rock , clay , sand , and pebbles ; the coarser part of this debris was deposited near the front of the glacier in the form of deltas , the finer mud being carried away to the seas . These deltas of the ancient glacial rivers are inconsiderable in area in northern New England , but they continually increase in extent to the southward , until in the region south of Boston and east of Providence they occupy more than three-fourths of the surface . Besides these two groups of accumulations which afford materials for soil , there is a third consisting of the boulders and ot*her lesser fragments which were shoved forward by the advancing ice in the brief periods when the prevailing retreat was interrupted by slight advances , or which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit remained with its outer face in one place . These moraines are infrequent and have played no important part in human affairs They are of no agricultural account . The soils formed on and of the till deposits in New England are in almost all cases of very fair fertility ; they are moreover singularly enduring to tillage . There is , however , the singular difficulty connected with them that they are strewn over and filled with boulders to such an extent that a vast amount of labor has to be expended on them before they can be tilled . This condition is due to the fact that in this part of the world the bed rocks are very much jointed , so that the ice in dragging over their // surfaces rent all amazing number of fragments from their places and bore them on in its course . When the original settlers came to this country they found every part of these naturally fertile lands defended against the encroachments of man *by a singularly perfect armor . To win an acre to the uses of husbandry demanded an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the forest , but the yet greater toil needed in placing the boulders of movable size in stone walls and in burying many others in deep pits . It is true that in the northern parts of Great Britain the earth had borne in its original state a similar though less extensive encumberment of stones , but there in the slow advance of man toward civilization centuries had been devoted to this task of clearing the land ; here the burden came at once upon a folk who had all the needs of civilized man with little more command of capital and of resources in the way of labor than their ancestors of two thousand years ago . The result was that the European colonists had to betake themselves at once to the second class soils , the sandy plains which abound in the shoreland district of this area-thus violating the general rule that the better lands of a country are the first to be occupied and tilled . The sand plains of the New England district , indeed of all countries where they are found , afford but sterile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arenaceous material which contains but little food for plants . Although with the modern resources of artificial manures they are coming again into cultivation , the experience of the early settlers was to the effect that , while these fields had the merit of being tolerably free from the vexatious boulders , they had no other advantage . Gradually , in the main , after a century or so of bitter experience with the unprofitable deltas of the glacial rivers , the soil tillers began to win with exceeding toil the better earth from its envelope of boulders . Some work of this kind appears to have been done in the first half century after the settlement , but so far as I can learn from the imperfect sources of information at my command , little had been accomplished before the beginning of the eighteenth century . The mark of the first adjustment remains in the sites of the original agricultural villages and farmsteads , which in almost all cases where they were founded in the seventeenth century are upon the open sandy fields . // The effect of these soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of the enterprising colonists away from any expectation of winning wealth from the earth ; the general understructure had denied them mineral resources , the state of the surface made it evident that they would not , like the colonists further south , look to agricultural resources as the basis of commercial success . In fact , though there was from time to time some small outgoings of field products , New England never succeeded in doing much more than supply its own demands , in the way of food such as the fields of the land afford . Baffled in the effort to found success on the subterranean or the soil resources of the country , the New Englanders quickly turned their attention to the fisheries . In this realm of the seas , the same geological events which had deprived the land of its fertility gave an excellent opportunity for profit . The irregular , usually bouldery , waste formed by the glacial actions extends far beyond the limits of the shore ; it creates at many points extensive shallows , such as George 's Bank , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have been in such large measure the basis of the commercial prosperity of the country . A bouldery field above the plane of the ocean is poor ground for the nurture of anything that man can turn to profit ; from that level downward to a depth of one hundred fathoms , a surface of this nature is admirably suited for the development of a marine life ; it is especially fitted to support and attract the cod fish , the creature which was the pilot of the New Englanders to their first commercial prosperity . Fortunately , these fishing grounds , the product of glaciation , abound along the seashores of New England , are very extensive , and lie near a great number of harbors , which , though shallow for modern ships , afforded ample room for fishing vessels . The forests , moreover , abounded in excellent timber for building ships . Thus , though the colonists were not to any considerable extent front the seafaring folk of the old country , they shortly were led , we may say driven , by their necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fishing was naturally the first step toward the larger enterprises of the sea . This industry was from the start successful . The blessed cod , perhaps the best good fish of all the known tenants of the ocean , was found in great numbers ; it was readily taken ; its flesh was savory and so easily cured that it // will keep for years . There was ai*i almost unlimited market for the product of the fisheries in the more southern plantations of the continent , where a soil more easily won was yielding a great though temporary profit to the colonists . From the cod to the whale fishery was an easy transition , and the two combined made the best possible foundations for the marine commerce which grew up among the people after they had been trained in seafaring in the most natural way through the art of fishing . In this largest part of the sailor 's work the development was again in the same way as with the fisheries , but in even greater measure , favored by the very many good harbors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glacial action . For the ships of the last century the New England coast afforded the greatest number of good havens that exist in any part of the American coast where the other conditions permitted settlement . These natural ports are very accessible , they usually carry deep waters to their shores . They are not much encumbered with ice , the back country abounds in construction woods such as the ship carpenter demands , and also afforded a fair supply of the food stores required for voyages . Thus the environment led the shore line folk of this district straight forth to the sea and stamped a large part of its people with the admirable and enduring mark of that peculiar culture . Although there are no accurate data for determ. ination , it appears likely that , in the two centuries from 1650 to 1850 , somewhere near one-fourth of the population of this district were distinctly influenced by the maritime life which had become the basis of its prosperity . The same conditions of soil which in a way compelled the New Englanders to essay fortune upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proved in its effects more lasting . The glacial event , as we have already noticed , covered the surface of the earth with a prevailingly deep deposit of very porous material ; this of itself gives the streams an uncommon steadfastness of flow . Moreover , the drift is laid on in a very irregular manner so that it forms a multitude of depressions all of which were originally lakes , though the greater number of them have now been converted into bogs or swamps ; these basins still further retard the flow of the water to the sea , delivering the rain fall in a gradual and tolerably constant manner . Furthermore , the country is tolerably elevated , so that the aggregate of available power that may be won // from the streams is very great . The value of these sources of energy for mill use was easily appreciated : very soon after the settlement , many of the lesser streams were the seats of corn mills , to which wool carding appliances were soon added . The records show that the authorities were early awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the many regulations we may note an order that the curious division of the Charles River near Boston known as Mother Brook , which leaves the main stream in Dedham and by flowing into the Neponset River makes that city an island , has a right to carry one third of the water of the Charles . This law which was established in the later part of the seventeenth century attests the value of the mill privileges at that early day . In its valuable water powers which owe their advantages to the glacial history of the country , the New Englanders found a feature which was destined in a remarkable manner to influence their future , even to the time beyond our day . At first these opportunities were sought for doinesti&amp; needs alone , but as the expansion of the marine adventures came about , the little mills grew to be great factories and their varied products found a market the world over . In a way this industry , particularly that in woollen cloths , helped the needy agriculture . r* he sheep , a thrifty feeder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle would fare ill . To prepare the way for them it was not necessary to clear the land as for tillage , the timber could be felled and burned and the animals turned into the partly cleared ground where they would find subsistence among the boulders . In time they would extirpate the brushwood and so give room for grass . A large portion of the vast area of stony fields in this part of the country thus came to be deforested . Much of these old sheep ranges has been recovered by the woods since the cheaper wool of Australia and the Mississippi Valley has made it unprofitable to keep the creatures where they have to be fed through the long winter . The forests of New England afford excellent varieties of wood for the manufacture of tools and furniture ; the bog iron ores , accumulations which often form beneath swamps , served for a time for the manufacture of iron . These advantages led to a very great diversity in the manufacturing work which depended on the water powers for the needed energy . As the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agricultural interest , the people found* that the swamps which had , by a natural process , the growth of peat , to a great extent taken the place of the glacial lakes , were no longer worthless lands but had a peculiar value , in that by slight dams at their outlets they could be converted into reservoirs for storing water to be used at the mills . The result has been the revival of hundreds if not thousands of effaced lakes and the extension of many others which had not entirely lost ; their lacustrine character . The resulting change in the aspect of southern New England has been great . The fields of fresh water which dot the landscape are probably twice as numerous and extensive as they were a century ago . Incidentally we may note that , while these reservoirs are a decided advantage to the mills , they are distinctly harmful to the health of the people ; filled in the winter time and drawn down in the summer and early autumn to their beds of ooze , they have become the breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemics of ague and fever once almost unknown in this part of the country but now a serious element in its list of diseases . Experience in many countries shows that , while a region may be very swampy , so long as the water in the bog areas remains at the same level throughout the year no malaria results , but if the level of inundation be much changed , as is necessarily the case in the reservoir system , ill effects surely follow . The combined effects of a varied relation to the sea , and the yet more diversified influences of a manufacturing industry which concerned a wider range of work than had ever been undertaken in any other country of like area , in time gave to the characteristic New Englander some peculiar qualities or habits of mind . He became , as he is now , of all the world , the aptest man to discover in any situation some measure of advantage which might be turned to profitable account . He learned the precious lesson that in every place there is something which if well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way of looking at the world may to the observant traveller be seen in every part of the area which has been subject to New England influences . Within this part of the country we find the most complete subdivision of industries which exists in any part of the world . In mrst cases these employments have taken root because of some local advan tage in the way of access to peculiar natural stores or to certain // lines of transportation . In other instances they have been founded by some discerning person who , looking over the fields of employment , has seen that his place was fit for some pursuit which had not been essayed in his neighborhood , or was perhaps altogether novel . Thus , to note but a few of these specialized occupations , we find that the Attleboros are given to making jewelry , Leicester to the manufacture of " Card clothing , " i. e. , the hook covered leather which is used for carding wool ; the region about Gardiner to the making of chairs . At least fifty towns could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar conditions being due to the development of an active-minded people cornpelled to look beyond the soil or the resources which lay beneath it for the basis of their fortunes , indeed - we may say , of their existence . Such eager and efficient application of wit and work to the possibilities of a situation has no parallel in the old world , and is unequalled in this country of expedients : it is a peculiarity of the New England conditions ; it can be accounted for by the circumstances in which the people were placed . It is , in a word , the effect of environment . The capacity to command a situation , which the training of the New England people has given , is to be remarked in their existing agriculture as well as in their other arts ; it has led to several modern and novel developments , the most important of which is the culture of cranberries . For a long time this fruit was gathered in. its wild state both in the old world and in the new , but it remained for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurture of the vines which has made this form of tillage one of the important innovations of the century : one which has changed a very poor district into one of the most prosperous seats of crop production , making of worthless land a value which is exceeded only by some of the famous vineyards of Europe , and perhaps certain of the best orange groves of Florida . No other tillage devices of modern days are so original or so important as these , which have converted the peat bogs of the coast into hydraulically engineered fields that give an annual gross return of from two hundred to a thousand dollars per acre . In a like way the use of greenhouses , though common in other parts of the country , early became important as an industry in this section . In some of the rural communities of Massachusetts these forcing establishments are the source of the principal revenue of the people . // The same eminent inventiveness which has brought about the institution of industries has made it possible for the New Englanders , when the need arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements . In the formative period the same people often followed several calliugs at once farming , fishing and shoemaking were often combined . Though the greater part of this elasticity has been lost through the more elaborate organizations of labor , it is easy to see the marks of it to this day . The quality is in the folk , it is ready to meet such changes as are by some apprehended through the Southern competition in the manufacture of cotton cloth . Should this industry betake itself to the neighborhood of the fields where the fibre is produced , it will probably change rather than lessen the industrial life of this region . We often find in New England manufacturing districts which have preserved their activities , though the nature of their labor has greatly and sometimes frequently altered . An index of the peculiar manufacturing activity of New England may be found in the history of mechanical inventions ; from no other people of like numbers have there come so many of those contrivances . If we could determine the nativity of those who have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is probable that quite one-half of the work in this country has been done by the small part of the population of the country which lies within the part of New England that has partaken of the manufacturing motives . It is plain that here , out of a people who were not by ancestral experience peculiarly concerned with mechanical work , the conditions have served in a singularly efficient way to make a folk who have a remarkable capacity for this peculiar group of tasks . Nurtured in this favorable field , the inventive mechanics of New England have been disseminated over this country , carrying with them their art , which included the power to devise new arts . To them mainly we owe the rapid and wide development of the industrial interests of this nation . The foregoing considerations suggest , if they do not make it plain , that the influence of environment on man , at least in his civilized estate , though considerable , is not direct , but is brought about in a secondary manner . That it is not direct is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people of New England and their now rather // remote kinsmen beyond the sea . No one who has had fre* quent opportunities for comparing the two peoples , and who looks beyond the superficial features of clothes and man ners , will believe that differences of climate or soil have had any immediate influence upon them . The few indices which have been obtained from physical measurements go to show a firm adherence to the primitive type ; the diversities are in mental quality , that realm in which the variations of human quality have long taken place . To see how far these variations have been induced by environment of a kind which influences the conduct of life , let us consider what would have been the probable history of the descendants of the people who settled in New England if they had settled in Virginia or Maryland . There is no reason to believe that the settlers of New England , if they had found a home in an easily tilled land such as lies beside the James River or Chesapeake Bay , would have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those more southern countries . Notwithstanding certain differences of faith , these peoples were essentially alike in all those features which serve to direct the course of populations . But the northern colonists , because they fell upon lands which bore the peculiar stamp which has been given them by the singular processes of the glacial epoch , were forced to peculiar and , to them , unnatural ways of progress . They could look to the earth for no mote than a bare and hardly earned subsistence . This incL dentally spared them the evils of slavery , for the African slave was profitable only in agricultural districts , and then only in the production of important exportable crops of which New England could produce-none . Although they were not by inheritance seafarers or manufacturers , the New Euglauders were forced to look to the deep for all their first gains and to the water powers for all their more permanent and larger profits . And in these occupations , through the impress giving effect of labor in peculiar fields , they came by their remarkable qualities . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on the New England people have come in a secondary way through the direction which it has given to their occupations , is afforded by the state of many of the isolated communities which , lying in the remoter parts of the district , have lived on from generation to generation withon t feeling in // any distinct way the influence of the ships or the workshops , which has so generally affected their fellows . Such isolated settlements show ns folk intellectually , so far as activity is concerned , far below the plane of their fellow-citizens in the districts which have had the characteristic life of the region . They are made up of just such folk as we may find in those parts of the United States where the humdrum vocation of farming has preserved the ancient repose of life . All we know of the animal man is against the supposition that he is ready to vary in his qualities through the direct influence of his surroundings . Such measure of plasticity as he may once have possessed appears to have mostly disappeared . Thns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise altered after an exposure for several generations to the very great change in climate , food , and other conditions which they have found in Virginia , or even in New Brunswick . If natural selection playezt its ancient part , environment might perhaps be more efficient in its action on mankind than we find it to be , but this agency has long since ceased to be of distinct value among civilized peoples . The only discernible way in which the surroundings can operate on man above the rudest savage state is through the occupations to which they may lead . In this way they may serve to produce varieties in intellectual qualities by two different modes of action ; they may bring together into selected communities people of a particular quality who , then intermarrying , - may in time came to have certain characteristics . Thus a seafaring town , for the reason that only men of a vigorous mould and an enterprising spirit are apt to turn to or keep in the sailor 's life , is , if the occupation be long continued , very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not " natural selection " as the term is ordinarily used . Perhaps the best term for this process is class selection , a process which is potent in our highly organized societies in a way which is not well recognized by students of sociology . It seems to me that this class selection , which operates even more in matters of the spirit than in those of the body , has been of considerable importance in the development of New England characteristics and that it is through its action that we owe and are in the future to owe much more of the ability manifested in its population . It should in this connection be noted that , from the beginning , // 739 this district has been the seat of a singular intermigration of men , both as regards dwelling-place and occupation . There has been no presumption that the son should abide with the parents in calling or residence the result has been that here probably to a greater extent than in any other equally long settled country the youths have been free to seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this element of freedom has arisen the formation of tolerably distinct groups of population , each claiming and taking its fit share of the offerings of talent , and tending , through intermarriage , to increase the capacity which has been the basis of its success . The main point of the argument concerning the influence of environment in New England is that the glacial history of the con ntry deprived it of readily tillable soil and compelled the early settlers to resort to the poorest clazs of fields . The result was that they were driven to the sea and to manufacturing . In these departments of activity the same glacial agents which had harmed the relation to the soil have in large measure favored them , giving good harbors and fishing grounds and excellent water powers . In this way some of the most important directing influences which have affected this interesting people were established ; it is not too much to say that the economic conditions of the district were thus determined . If this position be well taken , we may claim that we have here one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the effect of the geological structure of a country on the modern development of a civilized people . It may furthermore be said that what has been done in New England is buta striking example of what is taking place elsewhere in this country . The element of freedom of occupation , which is singularly characteristic of this country , permits the people to group themselves with reference to their environment according to their motives , or , in other words , according to their capacities . The result is , doubtless , to be a classification of our population , based in ability and on the resources for occupation which this land of abounding opportunities affords.
