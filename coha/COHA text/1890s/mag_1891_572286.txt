ARTICLE V.-ENTIIUSIASM FOR THE MINISTRY . By enthusiasm for the Christian ministry , I mean lofty and passionate interest in it , as a form of service to the souls of men . The beautiful feeling which Jesus had and exhibited for his mission was part of his power . It was ever a joy set before him . He not only knew the life of man better , knew the truth better , , could fit the truth to the*life better than all others ; he also did his work with such sweetness and force of conviction , with such fullness of beautiful feeling as to charm the souls of men . Whatever he did , he did with such supreme grace and power that others longed to do the same thing . He worked as he walked upon the water . The disciple who beheld was fascinated into the wish to do likewise . " Lord bid me come to thee upon the water . " That exemplifies the contagious enthusiasm of Christ in all that he said and did and endured . The preacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many reasons why he should feel deeply and nobly toward it . Let me mention a few , beginning with the less important . 1 . First because he lives by it . That fact lays upon him the obligation to do his best . Obligation always leads to conscience . Whenever a minister gets a fresh birth of conscience he gets an increase of power . He receives a material reward . He is in duty bound to give an adequate spiritual return . Thus through a reflection so elementary a man may carry a new spirit into his whole ministry . Mr. Webster used to say that that sermon was the best which took the deepest hold of his conscience . We may add that the minister who can engage his conscience most earnestly in his work will be the most powerful minister . If the primary reflection that we as ministers owe our churches a full equivalent for value received , will enlist afresh our moral nature in our word , then , I say , that reflection ought to be made . Commonplace things may open doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of an apple the law that binds into one the material universe , looked into Newton 's // earnest eyes . Throngh the fall of a sparrow Jesus bade his disciples discern the loving wisdom within whose compass all events take place . Things on the material side of life may send the mind with great celerity into the sphere of duty . " So nigh is grandeur to our dust , So near is God to man ; When Duty whispers lo , thou must ! ' The youth replies I can . " The layman has a right at the hands of his minister " to good measure , pressed down , shaken together , running over . " That is an appalling test to reflect upon after an immature , illarranged , loose and wandering sermon . The minister must at least do his best to earn the temporal support given him . lie must scorn the idea of gifts . There is something magnificent in old Samuel Johnson 's indignation over the pair of boots left at his door in college . It was a blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His boots were bad . But they must serve him until he can earn a new pair . A world of power shows itself there . As the bird shoots skyward by striking its feet against the earth , so some men rise Godward through impact upon common things . Carlyle speaks of the houses built by his father . They were object lessons in honor to the whole town . They preached the fundamental principles of truth and justice to the son . He could hear the voice of God speaking to him , through those Annandale cottages . They were symbols of all honest and honorable work . The son resolved to write his books , as the father built houses . The father lived by his trowel ; the son by his pen . Upon each the fact of sustenance imposed an obligation to do his best . Christians receive power to earn eternal life . Work out your own salvation . Ministers may theref6re receive power to earn the temporal r*tnrn for their service . They live by their calling . Let them not live upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession should inspire loyalty to it . Regimental pride is in nowise inconsistent with appreciation of the merits of other portions of the army . An enthusiastic appreciation of the Christian ministry is no barrier certainly to the recognition of the opportunities lying in other ways of serving men . There is , however , something wrong // with the minister who has the power to reflect and feel the motives that attract men to the other professions and who is almost without capacity to appreciate the transcendent privileges of his own . You find this type of man everywhere . You find him in politics . He is full of praise for countries beyond the with word of recoo'nition and encouragement seas , no for affairs at home . Overestimate of things foreign is no better that nnderestimate . Anglomania is not a whit more respectable than Anglophobia . Among the most nrgent needs of cultivated young men in our time and community is an intenser Americanism . The call is to look once more into the principles upon which this nation was fonnded , to nonrish a deeper affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul to the service of it . In one of his speeches in the senate Mr. Calhoun delivered an elaborate eulogy on the spirit of liberty . When Mr. Webster came to reply he said that he loved liberty no less ardently than the gentleman from Sonth Carolina ; but it was our dear-bought American liberty to which he was chiefly devoted . The farmer who is always looking over the fence and admiring the crops of his neighbors , the man who has eyes only for the beauty of his friend 's home , the citizen whose chief enthusiasms are beyond the sea , the churchgoer whose month is dumb as regards praise except when his pastor happens to exchange ; these are the nearest of kin to the minister who celebrates the glory of every other profession but his own . From such ministers comes the wail that the pulpit has lost its power . We all are conscious of a tendency at times to sympathize with this wail . The immense incentives to our calling are not always easily felt amid its inevitable discomforts . It is natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , their lot in life happier , their trials fewer , their burdens lighter . " The heart knoweth its own bitterness , but not that of other hearts , except by observation . When Grant went into his first battle as colonel of a regiment , he tells us that he went with trepidation . He had been through the Mexican war and in as many engagements in that conflict , as any one soldier could be . Yet when confronted by an enemy , led by a soldier of the same rank as himself , he went forward with extreme fear . To Grant , it was natural to think // the Confederate colonel a braver and a better soldier than himself . It came to him only as an inference from the rebel officer 's retreat , that other men had as good reason to fear him , as he had to fear them . The minister , in the heart of parish discomforts , is apt to picture to himself the felicities of the college professor , or the newspaper editor , the lawyer or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained by observation , is needed to convince him that these gentlemen have to bear the contradiction of sinners no less than himself . Judging from experience I should say that iu the heart of most young ministers there is a divided professional homage . Foolish ideals , as they seem to me , intrude upon the preacher and divide into two or three streanis the love that should pour along one chosen channel . One of these ideals is that of the pure thinker . If one has ever studied under a pure thinker , given himself to the critical appreciation of book after book and master after master , in the sphere of moral and metaphysical theory ; if he has ever tasted the luxury of intellectual thoroughness , the joy of extended outlooks in the world of ideas ; if he has ever come under the fascination of the desire to work out for himself an independent view of the world ; if he has ever longed , with true philosophic devoutness , for the rationalized expression of his life ; he will drag with him into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One will be the divided ideal . The pure theorizer and the preacher will fight each other . He is not satisfied with the intellectual life legitimate to the ministry and therefore he is ever cultivating alien forms , leading a forlorn hove . While he remains in charge of a parish , he can never become an authority in the teacher 's field . While he is forever trespassing in that field , he can not cultivate his own with true success . The danger is of becoming a hybrid , neither one thing nor another . The proverb has it " Jack at all trades and master of none. * ' We find this illustrated in the early career of Chalmers . He was a political economist and a mathematician , as well as a minister . While he was making the ministry a cover for scientific investigation , he had no preaching power . When after his great illness the preacher 's ideal stood out before him // clothed in divine attractions , he did not become less of a scholar or thinker ; but this ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Years afterwards , when advocating the abolition of the custom of holding a pulpit and a professor 's chair at the same time , as being more than any man could do well , and when confronted by a contradiction supplied from his early utterances , he replied that he did once hold a different opinion , He was devoted to mathematics . iMiathematics is the science of dimensions . But then , added he , with overwhelming impressiveness , " I forgot the shortness of time and the greatness of eternity . " Other ministers are tormented with the literary devil . It is the passion to print that divides the homage of their souls . They mean it to be simply the overflow of their life . The implied metaphor contains a withering correction . When there is an overflow from a river there is first a filling of its channel from bank to bank . Overflows do not come from ebbing streams . The main current of the Nile is fullest and mightiest when its waters spread over the whole adjacent region . If a minister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . lDonbtless now and then it is of this character . While the community is being flooded with the life of some great preacher , the stream running through his pulpit is swifter and completer than ever . With most men , however , this literary devotion means diversion of the intellectual and vital force . The man is cut into two , with now the literary ideal in the ascendent and again the professional ; meantime the congregation and the reading community swing between hope and fear . Sometimes you hear the sad refrain " Would that thou wert either cold or hot ; but because thou art neither I will " - aud then proceed to carry out the awful threat . The demands of two professions are more than most men can meet . It is only a Hannibal that can enter the tield against two and three commanders and hold them all at bay . Besides , the ideals are entirely distinct . The remark is attributed to Hannibal on hearing a philosopher step aside from his special field , to discuss military science , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this one beats them all . " It is not simply too much work , but work requiring distinct tastes , methods and ends . // It is like asking a distinguished violinist to be also and in virtue of that fact , a distinguished vocalist . To those hesitating between the professional and the literary ideal , I would humbly say , " Remember Lot 's wife ! " With other men the hobby is organization . Organization is good ; but it is not life . Life will make way for itself as rivers dig their own channels . The minister 's chief title is not teacher . It is not writer . IL is not organizer . It is preacher . He thinks , and writes , and organizes in the interest of Christian character . With him truth and art and order are for life . " This one thing I do " gives us the single magnificent idealism of Paul . He had reduced his battle to one issue . No man having put his hand to the plow looks back . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but soon there will be no furrow at all , the plow will be out and sliding along on the surface . Mohammed 's choice on overlooking iDamascus , the pearl of the east , must symbolize the minister 's decision : " Man can have but one Paradise and mine is in another world . " These alien ideals are not for the preacher . His is the ministry of the word . He has chosen it for better , for worse , until death them do part . 3 . This suggests another point , the intellectual opportunities of the ministry . They are other than those of the teacher and writer , but they are certainly not less . Technical scholarship is an impossibility for the modern minister . Scholarly instincts , habits , and powers may be his ; but not scholarly attainment equal to the specialist . Vast accumulations of antiquarian lore are also ruled out . So too with enormous reading . Great producers are not as a rule , great readers , and conversely , omniverous readers are lacking in creative power . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir William Hamilton remarks , that Hamilton gave so much of the strength of his mind to mere acquisition , that only a fraction of his intellectual power was left over for original work . The intellectual limitations of the ministry are obvious . We never read one half the books we resolve to read . We never take up a period in history , and cover it with anything like the thoroughness we planned . We have to bring the passion for investigation and the increase of knowledge to a halt , while we respond to the call of the sermon . Yet I think the remark // of an eminent lawyer of our time is strictly true that the ministry is the most intellectual of the professions . The subjects with which the minister is habitually dealing , if dealt with in a large and vital way , explain and enrich the intellect as no other subjects do . As men born in high countries among mountain ranges , are usually strong iji imagination and sentiment , so ministers can not live in the presence of the divine realities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies are often advocated , as furnishing the highest mental discipline . IReligion always involves philosophizing . In one fashion or another the minister is forever working upon the problems of philosophy ; God and man and their relations . These are the questions of human beings , and that which deals with them may be termed philosophy or Christianity , according to the method employed and the results arrived at . If there be intellectual vigor to be obtained from wrestling with these things , then the minister has as good ground for hope as any man . Then as respects the motives to such studies . In the case of the minister these are wonderfully stimulating . In the interest of faith he must consider the Divine Being and character . The more indispensable faith in God revealed in Christ seems to him to be to the human soul , the more the difficulties of faith are pressed upon him by men and women in the sore struggle of life , the more thoughtful , thorough and vital will be his intellectual work . To him a Theodicy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wider his human sympathies , the profounder will be his interest in ascertaining and declaring the true character of God . The suffering in life will urge him " To assert eternal Providence And justify the ways of God to men . " If the minister is interested in men , he must be interested in sinners , He will soon discover that sinners are the greatest sufferers in the universe . His own spirit will be troubled as he thinks of their unutterable distress . A conscience is a sublime and , at the same time , a terrible possession . The consideration of conscience in relation to emotion and will is the science of ethics , and every burdened sinner that the minister meets sends // him to the fresh and deeper study of that august center of human personality . He goes to the springs of moral life , to the source of moral distinctions , not from a speculative impulse , but from the most urgent practical consideration , from sympathy with the suffering of a fellow-man . With such an object in view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister hope for a clear , vigorous , and noble mind in the sphere of ethics ? The minister is driven , as Butler was , by a tremendous necessity to become , in his measure , a moral thinker . Here we note the great privilege of the minister . He need not become a mere dealer in words . He need not lose himself in meaningless abstractions . To this his professional temptation is slight . Everything about him is concrete matter of fact . His thinking may have the chief characteristic of all great thinking , a basis in fact , and an honest endeavor to explain that fact . Is it a baptism that he is engaged in ? As he lays his hand upon the infant head , as he offers his prayer over its consecrated life , the whole problem of education emerges upon his vision . Is it a marriage that he solemnizes ? Through the beautiful service he may look upon the social constitution of human life ; through it he may receive a fresh impulse to the consideration of the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discern and declare the idealism lying in the very nature of man . The beautiful service which it is the minister 's privilege to perform carries with it , for every earnest man , high intellectual opportunity . His ministry opens up every month into the heart of 2ocial problems . Again , he goes there not dreamily , but in the interest of concrete beauty and terror . Or it may be the distresses of the poor that arrest him , the hardships of the wage-earner , the strife between the labor and the capital represented in his own congregation , the waves of unrest that heave and toss their angry crests under his study windows . If the minister has eyes , sympathies , and a conscience , he must think in the presence of such facts . Thus his profession opens into the most difficult and the most turbulent region of the human life of our time . Thus looking upon the quaking industrial order the world over , watching facts , putting them together , matching outward facts with inward , he may work his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than are possible to most men . The question may be that of immortality . The death-chamber and all the intensity of sorrow must quicken the intellect , must make whatever is valid in the arguments of Plato , in the reasonings of Paul , in the weighty words of Butler , in the great thoughts of other men upon this theme , vital indeed ; must press the minister to personal convictions definite and deep , must enable him to enter into the meaning of the Lord 's words as few can- " I am the resurrection and the life . " We have a calling full of intellectual opportunity and incentive . Some of the greatest men have lived within its limits and have not felt confined . The testimony of that acute thinker and accomplished writer , James IMlartinean , is representative of sound opinion . " He who finds room , under the conditions of the sermon , to interest arid engage his whole soul , would be guilty of affectation were he to disown the occasion which wakes up his worthiest spirit , and which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is adequate to receive his best thoughts and aspirations . I am therefore well content to gle with the crowd of sermonizers. 4 . We need to remember always , that the ministry is related to the kingdom of God , as the supreme human means of its advance . After all , this must be the mainspring of our enthusiasm . There is a kingdom of God in this world , a divine dominion to be established in the conscience of all men and a human freedom to be had under it . This is the end of our whole service , the supreme end . This vast and glorious idealism must ever float before the minister 's imagination . Humanity is made to be the habitation of God through the Spirit . Humanity is interpreted in the presence of the cross . That interpretation is to be progressively realized in the world . It is to find a form of consummation in time . The kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ . It is this condition , wrought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the office of the preacher . This conception of an order of God for mankind , hinted at in the very beginnings of our race , outlined dimly in the first Hebrew who went out , not knowing whither he went ; given with ever-increasing clearness and power to the // illustrious line of prophets , fully unveiled in the Lord from heaven ; by him set forth in the comprehensive term love , the term for ideal rectitude between man and man and the ideal relation between the human child and the heavenly Father ; this conception in devotion to which Christ taught , and toiled , and died , and rose again , in homage to which he commissioned his apostles and their co-laborers , in the interest of which the whole richly varied power which we call the Christian church came into being and through which as the main channel of divine movement the Holy Spirit is sent ; this vast and thrilling conception must never be far from the minister 's thoughts . There were two ways of fighting battles , even successful battles , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his presence and no more . The field to be won today ; his thought went no further . Grant had another way . From the first , he perceived the ideas at issue between the two sections of the country . It was nationalism and freedom against sectionalism and slavery . This was the ideal background of Grant 's fighting . His clear eye took in the whole theatre of the war . After the battle of Gettysburg and the fall of Vicksbnrg he tells us he believed that although much fighting remained to be done , the rebellion was doomed . A Government of the people , and for the people , and by the people was to be reëstablished . Then it was that fresh inspiration came to him every day . Then it was that battles seemed so important , victories so telling , the calling of a soldier so grand , the movement and direction of armies so sublime . It is so with the ministry . The reign of eternal love is to be established in the souls of men . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sure that the ministry is a divine institution . Much may be done by books , much by the training of home , much by schools , much by the discipline of toil , much by the wisdom which God gives through the experiences of life . But books , and home , and schools , the interest of toil and tears , the profnsion of powers for the correction of error and the spread of truth , do not supersede the ministry . The preacher is necessary to them all . It is wonderful how slow even intelligent men are to see the spiritual import of the truth in hand . For example , let any one read // Maurice 's lecture on Newspapers , in his wonderful volume on " The Friendship of Books . " There is the newspaper , which men are reading every day , with so much in it to develop horror and pity , sympathy and humanity ; with so much in it to evoke gratitude , with so much to make one long for a wiser teacher and a nobler guide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never dreamed of . I have heard ministers say that they simply discuss the truth and leave the congregation to make their own application . That means , that the preacher declines to do the special service his congregation require . No better description need be given of the work of the preacher , than that contained in Matthew Arnold 's phrase concerning the vocation of the poet ; the application of noble ideas to life . According to this conception , which I hold to be the true one , the sermon is nothing from end to end but application . Congregations are intelligent and alert in many ways . One thing they are very inapt in and that is , in seeing the spiritual import of an idea . They may see the idea ; but its significance for life is hidden . They are fascinated by it , as one might be by sunrise and forget the whole world that it illumines . The significance for life of home , education , literature , industry , science , government , the sum of ideas that rise into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society ; that is the preacher 's work . Many a man will tell you of his noble moods and of his consequent failure in duty ; but it takes the preacher to generalize this into the maxim " then I saw that there is a way to hell even from the gate of heaven . " It takes insight and a combination of rare gifts to lay open the triumphant process of that life , to which God has given great blessings through great sorrows , " As deceivers yet true ; as unknown and yet well known ; as dying and behold we live ; as chastened and not killed ; as sorrowful yet always rejoicing ; as poor yet making many rich ; as having nothing yet possessing all things . " This is the dispensation of the spirit . According to the Christ-type he works for the perfection of human character . He works through many instrumentalities . The ministry shares , in the production of Christian character , with many co*5perating forces . Still among these it is chief . In a sense it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge is for practice ; " that is , in " our phrase , all truth is for life . Thus the preacher 's calling is at the summit of all callings . The building of a bridge across a stream requires many hands . The foundations are laid under water ; on either side the circle rises . Still the structure , to one who had never seen a bridge , would be an enigma , until the keystone is laid . That completes the arch . That explains the work . So it is with the ministry . The calling that claims all truth for life , that lives in the application of it to life , interprets all the other departments of intellectual labor and completes them in one vast and varied service to the human soul ! The Christian ministry began when Jesus said " Repent ye ; for the kingdom of God is at hand . " It will end , only with the consummation of that kingdom in the life of the race . 5 . One reason more for enthusiasm in our calling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an offering to humanity , a tribute to the Infinite . Only thus can we do our best work . No man can attain eminence or achieve much in any calling that he does not love . It is only in the hue of its loves that the mind evolves its best results . How well this is understood by eminent literary men . Carlyle would not write , except where he could love and hate . His " Cromwell " is a great book . It is so , largely because it is a labor of love . His " Life of Sterling " is the most artistic thing he ever did . Something was due to the nature of the subject , but more to the heart and imagination of the biographer . We find him giving advice to Emerson , advice expressive of the highest wisdom for all who would do their best in this world . Find some character thoroughly great and lovable , and give your powers to that . Get something to do which shall engage your whole soul , which shall hold you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful love . Then books will be born that will bless the world . Such , in substance , is Carlyle 's advice to his friend . It is applicable to every calling , especially so to ours . If we love our calling , it will be so suggestive . It will quicken our powers . It will make our nature fruitful . It will draw forth the best that is in us , the best that God can lodge in our life . This word " best " has two meanings-an outward and an inward . // If we love it , we shall find the ministry the completest means of self-expression . We shall have in it the artist 's joy in its noblest form . If you ask for the final motive of creation , you can find no satisfactory answer short of love . If yon look into this motive you discover in God 's heart the necessity and joy of self-expression . Creation is the divine self-expression and self-realization in nature , in humanity , in Christ , and in the new creation in Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the Christian creation is revealing and realizing his eternal fullness . I think it is Plato that calls God the artist . In our thought of God it is still more fitting . All things were made by him , and without him was not anything made that hath been made . Thus the infinite life eternally craves and eternally achieves self-expression and self-realization . Byron stands for the artist when he sighs " Oh that I could wreck my thought upon expression ! " That impulse is in the soul of every poet , of every genuine writer , of every true speaker ; in the soul of every man that paints a real picture , forms a real image of any thought or piles a structure high in the air . While suppressed , the idea and sentiment oppress the heart ; with utterance comes relief and power . " To me there came a thought of grief , A timely utterance gave that thought relief . " Thinking , doubtless , along this line , a distinguished preacher once remarked to me , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So exquisitely suited is the ministry , to the richest , the most varied , and the noblest utterance of life . How men have missed this wonderful side of our profession . IRoberston , of Brighton , is one of the first in our century to seize upon it . How absolutely one with his life is his preaching . It is the form of utterance into which he throws its whole conteut . He struggles to find the living God . It is an awful experience . What shall he do with it ? He makes a sermon on " The Wrestling of Jacob , " and pours into that the glorious treasure . He feels the terrible solitude in life to all true men . He takes for his theme " The Loneliness of Christ , " keeping his own life in such fine reserve , using it as eyes to behold the eternal beauty and divine sadness of Christ 's solitude , using it as imagination to draw in bold outline , like // mountain ranges , the sustaining realities of God 's presence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he had led his hearers . No man ever understood more clearly the artistic side of the ministry . No one of his generation equaled him in the adaptation of the ministry to the necessities of a rich and noble nature . Beecher 's life is perhaps most instructive here . A marvelously gifted man accepts the intellectual limitations of his calling . What a writer he might have been . He knew , however , that man has but one life , and that he can not do more than one thing well . It shows the superb moral quality lying at the basis of Beecher 's soul , that he deliberately chose the preacher 's calling , aud for the sake of eminence in it surrendered sweetly every other hope . He spoke the contents of his great heart , and the whole world listened . He used the office of the preacher in this high sense before a larger audience , for a longer term of years , than any other great preacher of our century . He is dead , and the controversies that clouded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his utterances , are now relegated to another world and to the Judge of all . His grasp of the ministry , as an instrument for the expression of a soul , freighted with a divinely purified and enriched life , was the grasp of a master . His use of it as the channel along which he poured the stream of his ideas and feelings is a striking example of its possibilities . What do we mean by the Gospel by Matthew , the Gospel by Mark , the Gospel by Luke , the Gospel by John ? Simply the presentation of Jesus through the vision of different men . Certainly Luke 's conception of Jesus is broader than Matthew 's . Certainly John 's Gospel , confessedly the greatest , is Jesus through the inspired reflection *nd divinely guided life of the beloved disciple . John 's whole life is brought to the appreciation and interpretation of his Master . It is not simply the Master , it is the Master through the life of the disciple ; hence the power of the picture . So with Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man . He preaches , not himself , but Christ . Still it is the Christ within him the hope of glory , the Christ through whom he can do all things , the Christ that lives in him with such sovereign power // as almost to efface his own individuality . This transmission of the divine through personal thought and feeling and utterance is the only method recognized in the Bible . To claim the ministry as the instrument of expression for a cultivated Christian life is to put one 's self in accord with the method of the Bible . The preacher is an artist . He has his conceptions of truth and duty and beauty . These conceptions are his life . The utterance of them is a necessity and an exhilaration . The poet and the preacher should always be on good terms . They are next of kin . Burns tells us that his sorrows took wing when he had embodied them in song . Whenever his noble spirit was oppressed by the sight of injustice , by the sufferings of the poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his own sad reverses , his one unfailing solace was his muse . I think this is so honorable in him , and so suggestive to us . Fundamentally he was a true man . He concealed nothing from himself , not even his sin and failure . He revered his art . Into the songs and poems that have become part of the literary heritage of the world , he poured the swelling fullness of his soul . David used his art in precisely the same way . His fiftyfirst psalm is his confession and consolation . The twenty-third is the utterance of happy life and immortal hope . The psalms are instinct with life and beauty , because they are the fit expression of loving and beautiful life . Dryden joins his parish priest to David : " David left him when he went to rest his lyre ; And after him he sung the best . " The association of priest and poet is true thus far-that what the psalm is to the poet , the sermon is to the priest . The sermon is not hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon is a means of grace . The love that longs for and creates utterance grows as it gains it . If I have seemed to dwell too long upon this inward motive , let me do penance by quoting the remark of a minister  --  a neighbor of mineto the effect that churches are run largely for the benefit of the clergy . There is , however , an outward motive . The artist sees to it that the expression shall reveal his idea to others and communicate its sacred impulse . All art at its highest is // unselfish . It becomes in its sublime moments unconscious . It thinks oniy of two things , adequate self-expression and adequate revelation , self-uttered and others blessed ; out of that heart of beauty all true art comes . When love is in the soul , it will not leave its work until it push it as near as possible to completeness . Shakespere got his living from writing plays . Was then bread and butter the central impulse out of which his work came ? No man could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a labor of love . It is the creation and memorial of love . It is his immeasurable loving tribute to humanity . Its range and perfection reveal the depth of the sacred impulse within . Shakespere 's greatness is human , beautiful , and infinitely touching . Did Milton write for money ? He received for " Paradise Lost , " when published , twenty-five dollars , and in all about seventy . The greatest epic in our language had another motive than money behind it . It is the organ-toned utterance of a soul whose love must find expression . Nothing but the insight , the patience , and the eloquence of love could have left us such a bequest . In the first line of his greatest poem Tennyson uncovers the secret spring of everything that deserves the name of literature : " Strong son of God , Immortal Love . " That scene in " Lear** will be recalled where cordelia , in utter loathing of the hypocrisy of her sisters in their wild expressions of affection for their father , asks : " What shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That marvelous touch of nobleness seems to teach that art is not necessary to love , that it can live without symbols . But this is only on the surCace . It can live without a symbolutterance ; but not without all symbols . It builds love into life , the vital , consnmmate , divine art , whose eternal type is , " the Word became flesh . " If we would really reach our best in preaching , we must love-love God , love Christ , love the truth , love men with a tender , passionate , exhaustless love . Our ministry must become our life , our supreme privilege as servants of mankind ; the beautiful gate for the outgoing of a supernal affection , the form into which we can throw the whole // richness and truth and intensity of our being . We must make full proof of our ministry . We live by it , and that creates an obligation . lit is our chosen profession , and that should expel all embarrassing ideals . It has unique and wonderful intellectual opportunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , as the chief instrumentality of its advance , and this should awaken the intensest enthusiasm . it is our art , our mode of self-expression , our supreme method of teaching and inspiring our fellow-men . This should consecrate it an object of the purest and most passionate love . In the nineteenth psalm the heavens are recognized as the utterance of God . At the close of the psalm the writer prays that the words of his mouth may somehow bear some resemblance to the divine . It is a whim of mine that the ideal sermon should thus copy the course of nature . Sunrise and sunset are glorious and how various ; the outgoing of the morning and evening . lI3ut all the way between is taken up with clear , pure , unadorned shining ; an element is given to work in , in which to find one another , by which to see our way through the world ; a thing unobtrusive and unostentatious ; doing its work so well as to elude notice or remark ; then as it sprung into being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close . If we can not copy the tenderness of daybreak and the splendor of sundown , we can at least imitate the clear , pure , unadorned , all-illuminating life that lies between . I have spoken of love as the ultimate source of the sermon . Paul writes to the Philippians that they need his words , and that it is not irksome to him to utter them . There is no irksomeness , no barrenness , no commonplace in love . It is an eternal romance . Let it be real ; then let it show itself , and it will always engage the human heart . It is not irksome , says Paul ; then occurs in that third chapter of his , where he tells us he writes the same things , one of the noblest of all his bursts of eloquence : revealing the supreme motive of his immortal ministry : " What things were gain tome these have I counted loss for Christ . Yea , verily , I count all things to be loss , for the excellency of the knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of all things , and do count them but refuse that I may gain Christ . "
