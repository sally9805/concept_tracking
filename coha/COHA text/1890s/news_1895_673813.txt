txt Fire started in Simpson 's dry goods store , the largest establishment of the kind in the city , at 1 o'clock this morning , and in less than thirty minutes had completely destroyed it . At this hour the fire has extended south to Wanless 's big jewelry establishment and Love 's drug store . It has also crossed Yonge Street to the Imperial Branch Bank , J. F. Brown 's furniture store , and . Charles Milne 's hardware store . It is thought the firemen will be unable to save the Tremont Hotel or the Confederation Life Assurance big brownstone building , corner of Yonge and Richmond Streets . The fire has crossed Queen Street to the north and destroyed Jamieson 's big clothing store . It appears to be under control to the north , but the high wind is spreading it to the east . The entire fire brigade is on the scene , but it is greatly handicapped by falling wires . The fire has already destroyed property valued at a million dollars . At 2:45 A. M. Knox Church was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLATT The Effort to Control New-York City Affairs Abandoned and State Machine Ills Care Now . " Save the State , even if you have to let the city go , " is now the order in the Platt clan . The opposition that has been made to Mr. Platt 's effcrt to get control of the city has spread so rapidly through the State that Mr. Platt has given up the contest to control ' the city . All the energy of his lieutenants will now be brought to bear to keep the machine in the rest cf the State intact . A high Platt authority said last night at the Fifth Avenue Hotel that Senator Lexow would move the Police Reorganization bills as rapidly as possible this week . " Let the reformers have the city , " was his comment . Mr. Platt was feeling very much better physically yesterday , and it was related with great satisfaction by his followers at the hotel that he Jumped on a cable car while It was going at full speed and that he showed as much agility as a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long conference with Speaker : Fish . A subsequent visit which Mr. Fish paid to the Mayor was said to have nothing to do wtih local affairs , although the theory was advanced that he asked the Mayor if he was going to retain Messrs . Kerwin and Murray In the Police Board . Mayor Strong has said all along that he has no present intention of removing them . Speaker Fish remarked at the Murray Hill Hotel yesterday that he proposed to let the Republicans down here kill their own coons . He did not think there was any disposition on the part of Mr. Platt to take his troubles to Albany . There would be no retaliatory legislation , and all the reform bills would be passed , he thought , with few if any amendments . Asked as to the Presidential outlook , he said : " The delegation in the State in 1896 will be solid for Gov . Morton . I do not believe any other candidate whatever will stand any chance to get delegates . " Chairman Hackett , Executive Chairman Odell , Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Lexow got orders to hurry along the Police Reorganization bill . The Platt people are working to prevent ex-Senator Warner Miller from co-operating with the antiPlatt people in the State . Ex-Senator Miller , it was reported from Platt sources Friday , was going to have a talk with exSenator Platt . Ex-Senator Miller said Friday that he had no engagement whatever with ex-Senator Platt for a conference on any topic . Charles W. Hackett , who was once so close to Mr. Miller , and is now Mr. Platt 's Chairman of the Republican State Committee , is evidently trying to give the impression that Mr. Miller will not be against Mr. Platt . Mr. Hackett said yesterday that if there was any fighting to be done he would do it under Mr. Platt 's banner , but that Mr. Miller would be with Mr. Platt . He knew that Mr. Miller was at the Windsor Hotel conference , but he did not understand that that conference attacked Mr. Platt . As to the political situation , Mr. Hackett had this to say : " The Republicans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some kind of mental strabismus. not to see that the acts of the Mayor will have a greater effect in 1896 than at the present . The appointment of Democrats to office will operate like a boomerang when the national election occurs next year . Strange that the Republicans here do not see it . It is simply putting clubs in the hands of the enemy . These very Democrats who are now appointed to office under a non-partisan administration will be fighting the Republicans in 1896 . And they will be fortified in office and possessed of a militant , aggressive spirit totally incompatible with non-partisan appointees . These facts should be brought before the Republicans , who are now so enthusiastically prating. about the beauty of a non-partisan municipal administration . Next year they will awake to the danger , but then it will be too late . It will take a. solid and united Republican Party to fight these Democratic office holders in 1896 , and that is the bugle blast Republicans should sound now . " Chairman Odell of the Republican State Committee 's Executive Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this State would split , no matter how a few hundred offices in this city were distributed . He said : " It it should go to pieces over such a thing , why , I would get out of the debris and think that it deserved to be wrecked . I do not believe there will be a split , and the better and second sober thoughts of the Republicans in the party win prevail . The distribution of a few offices can not break up the party in this State , no matter who gets them . " This talk is another indication of Mr. Platt 's intention to gisse up the tight for the control of this city . Several of the antiPlatt Assemblymen from this city . including Messrs . Lawson and Wilds , conferred with Commissioner of Public Works Brookfield In his office yesterday . There was no formal conference of the anti-Platt people in this city last night , but those who were at the Union League Club discussed the progress of the fight in a general way . One of the current reports is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to name the three Commissioners who will do the reorganizing the Mayor will appoint ex-Collector of the Port Joel B Erhardt , ex-Secretary B.
