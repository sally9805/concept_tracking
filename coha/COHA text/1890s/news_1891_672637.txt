txt The testimony of President COLEMAN of the Department of Taxes and Assessments yesterday before the Senate Committee on General Laws had little bearing on . the nominal subject of the committee 's inquiry ? thy . Sugar Trust  --  but it had an important bearing on the general question of taxation . Mr. Coimar.A , . N confirmed the prevailing impression that capital is driven out of this State and deterred from coming into it to a very large extent by oppressive taxation . In recent years there has been a , persistent effort to impose taxes more and more upon ' corporations , which has had the effect of inducing capital in this State , and . especially in this city , to seek incorporation elsewhere , if not to seek its actual employment elsewhere . In some cases concerns of large extent have located their principal works in NETJersey , when , but for the burden of taxation , they would have been located - here . One of the most unwise measures that have been adopted is that which imposes , a tax upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such a tax except that it affords a convenient means of raising a certain amount of revenue , and that object is defeated when the result is that capital goes elsewhere for incorporation . There is no question of the advantage of having capital employed in the State , and as it is engaged in some form of productive activity , giving employment to labor and life to trade , its use here is to be encouraged so far as practicable . It is also generally admitted that there is an advantage in. having capital incorporated in order that while it is widely distributed in ownership it may be concentrated in its employment and thereby made more effective . Why , then , should there be a penalty put upon incorporation in this State in the form of a special tax that appropriates a small percentage of the capital even before it is set at work ? The most justifiable of corporation taxes is that which is put upon virtual monopolies that are allowed to exercise public franchises . Transportation companies , for . instance , which carry on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges are granted that give them a virtual monopoly upon certain lines , can be reasonably required td pay a moderate tax in return for what they derive from the public . This should be proportioned , so far as possible , to the profits of their business . If a tax of this kind is not unreasonably heavy it will not have the effect of diverting capital from the business in question or from the State . The business is of , a kind that has to be done in the State or in the city , as the case may be , and the property employed in it can not be located elsewhere . This applies to railroad , telegraph , navigation , and ferry companies especially . So far as the taxation of other corporate capital is concerned , there certainly should be no discrimination against that which is incorporated within the State . So far as the property in which it is invested and the business in which it is engaged are within the State , it should bear no greater burden for being incorporated under our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New-York it should pay as much tax as if it were incorporated here . Otherwise , instead of encouraging capital to come here and contribute to our prosperity , we offer it an inducement to go elsewhere . This question of State jurisdiction must be considered in framing tax laws . If we put a heavier pressure upon capital or upon business of any kind than it has to bear in a neighboring State . we may thereby counteract whatever other advantage there might be in locating here and induce it to seek employment elsewhere . This is certainly a losing policy , and if we make any discrimination it ought to be in our favor and not against ourselves . As a general principle , taxation ought to bear as lightly as possible upon the agencies and processes of production and take its tribute from the realized gains ef production . It is bad economy to lay taxes in such a way as to check or embarrass the employment of capital or of labor and . thereby diminish the production of wealth . The great advantage of a tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically collected , that there can be no escape or evasion , and that it will bear upon a value that is absolutely propor-tioned to the profitableness of its occupation and use . ? In other words , it will be proportioned t4 the wealth that is employed:in - the use of the land , which , directly and indirectly considered , is the entire wealth of the community . The tax will necessarily be paid out of the surplus of production . When the tax is levied anywhere between the land and the wealth accumulated from its use , it falls upon the active agencies of production and interferes with their activity and fruitfulness . This induces inequality of burdens and efforts - to escape , and whenever the pressure is greater in one place than another there will be a shifting of ground as inevitably as air or water moves in the direction of the least resistance . In our efforts at tax reform we . are driven more and more back to the laud , or to what is called real property , as  --  the true basis of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
