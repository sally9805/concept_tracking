txt Gov . Lowndes was in long and serious consultation with Secretary of State Dallam and Gen. Wilmer this evening , after hearing of the lynching to-day of Andrews at Princess Anne . He was much incensed at the conduct of the mob , and the injury such acts give to the good name of our State . The Governor said this evening that he was ignorant of the details of the lynching of Andrews . " The Sheriff Alone , untie , . our laws , " he added , " is authorized to call upon the GOvetior , fair troops , and suppress riot and disoider and threatened opposition to the laws . The excitement which prevailed at the time of Andrews 's removal having subsided , it is to be presumed the Sheriff feared no Vi 0 ? lence , the less so as a special term of coda had been called , insuring a speedy trial and prompt conviction . " When the Governor first heard of the lynching he thought that it had been because the case had been removed from tha county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignity to the court and an outrage upon the course of justice had been perpetrated after so prompt a conviction and sentence of death . The Governor further said : " The lynching of Andrews to-day at Princess Anne after conviction and sentence to capital punishment , under the very eyes of the court , was a. gross outrage upon the majesty of the law , and should meet with the unqualified condemnation of law-abiding citizens . The participants in the crime against the administration of justice should be held to strict accountability by local authorities . I think the Executive should be clothed with the power of removal or trial in cases of felonious assault . " The Governor seems to feel the matter all the more keenly as he has as Executive to bear adverse criticism against the State , and yet is powerless to prevent these wrongs since the local authorities are the ones charged with the defense of the law , in such cases .
