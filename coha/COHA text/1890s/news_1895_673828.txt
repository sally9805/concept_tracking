txt Secretary Gresham has received information from Minister Taylor at Madrid , but he is not yet prepared to communicate the dispatch to the press . It is understood , ' however , that it is of a satisfactory character , and is therefore assumed to be responsive to the request that " immediate and positive orders be given to Spanish naval commanders not to interfere with legitimate American commerce passing through that ( windward ) channel , and prohibiting , all acts wantonly imperilling life and property lawfully under the flag of the United States . " It was not expected that there would be an immediate disavowal of the firing upon the Alliance- The request was for " prompt " disavowal , and that assumes the liberty of the Spanish Government to make some inquiry to satisfy itself that there has been unwarranted firing upon a vessel of a well-known mail line following a customary channel in a time of peace . Spain undoubtedly will offer again its contention , which it has made before , but which this country has not admitted , of jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its dependences . Its last assertion of this right was disputed by Mr. Evarts , when Spain responded , in the course of a protracted correspondence , that it assumed that the right was established because it had not been disputed . The attitude of Secretary Gresham is sustained without reserve by the President . That was to be expected , and the Secretary was assured of it as soon as he had laid the correspondence and the report of his action before Mr. Cleveland soon after the President 's return from the South . The President comprehended at once the annoying circumstances of the case , and appreciated as fully as the Secretary of State had done the necessity for a prompt notification to Spain of our disapproval of the act of her naval officers . The duty of the Administration was so clear , according to international law and a host of precedents , that anything less decisive than a demand for disavowal and for an immediate cessation of the annoyances would have been a temptation to Spain to indulge in more aggravated seizures . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument by Spain for recognition of the six-mile limit of jurisdiction to be offered as satisfaction for the unwarranted exercise of that right in stopping a well-known mail vessel proceeding on her course four miles from the coast . Secretary Gresham is prepared , evidently , to assert theft the right to seize such vessels , even within ' thethree-mile limit , in time of peace , does not exist . The conduct of such a vessel would not be such as to invite search . while the actions of a vessel similar in appearance , carrying the United States flag , if the vessel had been described to Spain as a filibuster and it was deemed important to be satisfied of her character , would justify Spain in visiting her even beyond the three-mile limit . That there was no reason to suspect the Alliance of hostile intentions was apparent from the fact that the Spaniard hailed her , received her salute and returned it , and did not attempt to overhaul her until the salute had been repeated and the Allianca had gone on her way . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position in this matter , and the books justify the confidence manifested by Mr. Gresham , there are evidences of a desire among some would-be critics of the Administration to find arguments at the Spanish Legation in support of Spain rather than the United States , and silly Mr. Muruaga , who has done little since the report came out about the firing upon the Allianca but commit impi.oprieties , obtains encouragement from persons who criticise Capt . Crossman 's chart with rule and compass and endeavor to prove that he is quite as thorough a liar as Muruaga has said he is . The advocates for Spain overlook the broad principle asserted and maintained by this Government , that American merchant vessels must be free from search in times of peace when upon the high seas , and thumb over a rude chart to prove that an American under oath is less to be believed than an ignorant Spaniard who feels compelled to defend an act that his Government may apologize for to-morrow . Spain will not regard as new the remonstrance made at Madrid by Secretary Gresham . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish demand to be permitted to search vessels six miles from Spain 's coast and those of her dependencies . The United States has gone so far in asserting the contrary that a Secretary of State once told our Minister to Spain that if the Madrid Government could not assure the United States that it could and would protect American ships from such interference the United States would do it , and would use its entire available force to do it . Spain may exercise the right to search merchant vessels making for Cuban ports , just as any nation may visit and inspect merchant vessels entering their harbors , but on the high seas never , except in time of war . The sympathizers with Spain may enjoy the unusual luxury of justifying that nation , but the Administration ought to be able to get along very comfortably with the support of the people w'ho will see in this stand against Spanish arrogance and indifference to International law an indication of patriotic resolution .                 @ @ @ @
