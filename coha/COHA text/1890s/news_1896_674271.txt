txt Sound Democracy in Wisconsin . Speaking of the National Democratic Convention in Wisconsin , The Milwaukee Journal says : " Those who love the old party , who can not support their ancient enemy , protection , and the party which has brought all these National woes upon us , nor yet walk in the political field with the stranger clothed in the garb of Democracy , and using her name to seduce the unwary , have now a political home , familiar in character and surroundings .

If by any act of theirs they imperil the honor and fair fame of the Republic , they can not hope to be forgiven . They will be counted as high-minded and patriotic only as they wisely direct the balance of power they hold in their party . If by any mistaken idea that they must save their party they hand the reins of control over to a party of repudiators , they can never explain the error as merely human .
