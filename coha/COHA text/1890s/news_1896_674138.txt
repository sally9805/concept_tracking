The lake was smooth when they started , but when the boats were half a - mile from shore a smart breeze came up and the high waves swamped the fragile craft . The boat in which were John Day , McConville , and young O'Dea went over first . Three times they came to the surface and caught hold of the buat , only to be washed away . John Day failed to rise the third time . The other two clung , to the gig until boats which immediately put out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Andrew O'Dea and L. B. Street , In the other gig , and they , too , went over just after the first boat upset . Their mishap , was not noticed until the survivors from the first boat were rescued , when it was seen that they , too , were struggling in the water , gripping the edge of the boat . They had been in the water a full hour when rescued . Andrew O'Dea , the coach , is still in a serious condition . Day was one of the best all-round athletes at the university , and a popular student . He was President of the sophomore class during the last semester .

A copy of a remarkable letter was shown Yesterday to a reporter for THE NEw-Yonic TIMES . ' The letter was written on ordinary typewriter paper , which bare no heading . It was unsigned , and any questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant , " Draw your own inference . " The letter read as follows : NEW-YORIC . March 213 , 1800 . Dear Sir ; In answer to your Inquiry in the matter of the JeromePark Resetivoir , you can readily see that the right of way through the Bronx Park for a railroad to be used by the contractors for the transportation of the excavation to the Sound would be of great advantage to that work , and would be worth at Least 82610,000 to the contractors . Although the park is a public property , it is unimproved , and , therefore , would be of no damage to have a railroad run through the grounds for say about seven years , more or less . Of course it requires the consent of the Park Commissioners , the Botanical Garden ' Trustees , and likely a charter from the Legislature . I am told the engineer of the Aqueduct Commission has done all he can in forwarding this matter , and - other city officials would be glad to have it granted . And as a right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Sound , as I have already stated , would be of great advantage to the contractor , I would be very much pleased , if you would assist through your friends or otherwise in bringing this matter about . Very truly yours . This letter , as said , was shown with much mystery to the reporter by a man who refused to allow his name to be mentioned , and who would givd no direct answer to any questions as to who wrote it , to whom it was addressed , or even how it came into his Possession . Its authenticity he declared was certain .
