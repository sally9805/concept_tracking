WILDCAT BANKING IN THE TEENS . THE refusal of Congress , in 1811 , to recharter the United States Bank was followed within a twelvemontli by a singular struggle for its deposits and its wealth . The bank was founded in 1791 , at a time when there were but four others in the entire country , was given a capital of $10,000,000 , was made the depository of government revenue , had power to issue bank notes which the government received in payment of all dues , and could establish branches , or , as they were called , offices of discount and deposit , in such numbers and in such places as its directors thought proper . Exercising their powers , the directors in time opened nineteen branches in the various States ; issued some $5,000,000 of notes , which passed readily from hand to hand in all parts of the country , in much the same manner as the national bank notes of our day ; and paid each year dividends of from seven to ten per cent on the capital stock . An institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of the whole country . But the adoption of the Federal Constitution , the establishment of a strong and vigorous government on the ruins of the old Confederation , the stripping from the States of the power to coin money and issue paper , and , above all , the funding of the revolutionary debt had restored ci*edit . The restoration of credit called out from attic floors and old stockings hundreds of thousands of dollars which had long lain hidden and unused ; and these , in addition to the millions of new capital created by the government funding at their face value the indents , the final settlements , the loan - office certificates , the commissary certificates , the quartermasters ' certificates , the thousand and one forms of the revolutionary indebtedness which till then had not been worth three shillings to the pound , provided an enormous fund , whose owners were eagerly seeking investment . This eagerness to invest was well displayed when , on the 4th of July , 1791 , the books of the National Bank were opened at the old State House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $8,000,000 of stock offered the public was taken . The people were astonished , and an era of wild speculation began . Stock-issuing corporations sprang up on every hand . The cities abounded with the projectors of canal companies , turnpike companies , manufacturing companies , and state banks . In the course of a twelvemonth eight banks were chartered , and the state bank as a financial institution may be said to have been introduced . Thus started , the banking system spread rapidly over the seaboard portion of the commercial States , and along the great routes of emigration westward . By the end of the century twenty-six banks existed , and of these fourteen were in New England , and two south of the Potomac . Five years later , thirty-eight others had been established , almost three fourths of which were again to be found *A New England . But the movement of population westward was filling up the region beyond the Alleghanies , and when , in 1811 , the charter of the United States Bank expired , state banks were to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland , at Steubenville , at Marietta , at Cincinnati , at Chillicothe , in Kentucky , in Tennessee , and in the Territory of Orleans . Eighty-eight were then doing business . Just what would happen in the financial world if the United States Bank should not be rechartered , and the state institutions were left to do as they pleased , was clearly foreseen and well stated when the question of recharter // was under consideration in Congress . " Two things , " it was said , " will happen . In the first place , the country will be stripped of the only circulating medium it possesses . This will be a serious blow to merchants and to the government . At present , if a trader in Ohio or Kentucky wishes to pay a debt contracted in Boston or New Orleans , he has but to procure from the nearest branch of the Bank of the United States a draft on the branch at Boston or New Orleans , and the money is paid in either city as soon as the mail can reach it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant do ? Specie he can not get ; and even if he could , the cost and risk of sending it five hundred miles would be unbearable . The notes of state banks can not be used ; for the notes of Kentucky banks do not pass current in the East . He will therefore be at the mercy of the most grasping of all men , the exchange broker : In the second place , the abolition of the bank will be followed by an enormous increase in paper money . Some of it will come from new institutions that will spring up , eager for a share of the business once done by that we are asked to destroy . Some will be put out by old institutions to take the place of the bills retired by the Bank of the United States . " This was precisely what the enemies of a national bank wanted . Indeed , in a report against granting the bank an extension of time in which to settle its affairs , made to the Senate a few weeks after the bill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well under way , and that the state banks were rapidly filling the vacuum produced by the withdrawal of the paper of the Bank of the United States . Had the new issue stopped when the vacuum was filled , there would have been small cause for complaint . But it did not . A banking mania which had long been raging in Pennsylvania now swept through the commercial States , and in a few months the number of banks was increased a hundredfold . The gr&amp;at success of the Bank of the United States , the dividend , often as high as ten per cent , paid to the stockholders each year , together with the fine business done by the Bank of Pennsylvania and its branches located in the interior of the State , were so many object lessons to the farmers of the back counties . Every day the belief gained ground that the astonishing prosperity of the seaboard cities was due largely to the existence in them of banks , and that , to share in this prosperity , the people of the inland towns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers . The facilities offered by banks to borrowers , the growing need of a circulating medium that would not be drawn away , and , more than all , the desire of the farmers to invest the money made in the brisk times before the embargo did much to make banking popular . There was one important function , however , which the federal government did not , and the state banks could not , perform , and that function was to supply the people with small change . The Bank of the United States issued no bills under ten dollars in value ; the state banks could issue none under five ; and , as the specie ( composed largely of foreign coin ) was drawn to the seaports to meet the needs of importers , the inhabitants of the inland towns and villages were often sorely tried for want of change . To stipply this , numbers of individuals and associations of individuals had gone into the banking business without charters , and , procuring plates and paper , had issued notes of all denominations far beyond their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania , in 1810 , forbade unincorporated banking associations to issue notes or bills , or to make loans , or to receive deposits . Knowing what was coming , six such associations promptly sought for charters during the session of 1809-10. // Five were refused . But the petitioners were not discouraged , and at the next session nine , and at the following session fourteen , applications were made to the legislature . One of the fourteen deserves especial mention , for those who made it were no other than the Pennsylvania stockholders of the Bank of the United States , whose charter had now expired . Taking the name American Bank , these gentlemen asked for a twenty years ' charter , with a capital of $5,000,000 , and offered , in return , to give the State $375,000 , to be used for building roads and bridges . As the session wore on , and the legislature seemed loath to act , the cash bonus was raised to $500,000 , and an offer was made to loan the State another $500,000 for internal improvements . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the petitioners could make such a bid the profits of the business must be immense , and ought to be enjoyed , not by one great bank , but by many small ones , and the petition was not granted . Nevertheless it bore fruit , and aroused such eagerness for local banks as alarmed the governor . In his message at the opening of the session of 1812-13 he cautioned the legislature against what he saw was coming ; told it that the banking capital in the State was all sufficient ; cited in evidence the fact that within six months the Philadelphia banks had subscribed $2,400,000 to the United States War loan , and had taken in addition $1,000,000 in treasury notes bearing less than bank interest ; and reminded the members that in the Harrisburg bank $100,000 had long been lying idle for want of a good investment . The people , however , were determined to have their way , and before the legislature arose applications were received for thirty-one charters , and a bill establishing a general banking system for the whole State , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the governor . Each of the twenty-three congressional districts was to be a banking district , and contain at least one of the new institutions . They were to be the people 's banks ; and that the farmers and mechanics might have a chance to subscribe and enjoy some of the riches about to be scattered broadcast , great care was taken to keep the stock out of the hands of capitalists . Nobody , therefore , could subscribe for more than one share on the day the subscription books were opened , nor for more than two shares on the second day , nor for more than three shares on the third day ; and so on to the sixth day , when , for the first time , the subscriber could buy all the stock he wanted . One per cent on the stock subscribed was to be paid each year to the State , a sum which , as the capital of the twenty-five banks was to be $9,525,000 , was far from trifling . Unhappily for the scheme , the governor vetoed the bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more determined than ever ; and when the legislature met again , it laid on the table of the governor a bill establishing forty-one new banks in twenty-seven districts . Once more he vetoed the bill ; but this time it was passed over his veto , and thirty-seven banks went into business in 1814 . In New York the struggle was still more exciting . There , when it was known that the Bank of the Inited States was not to be rechartered , some capitalists bought out the foreign holders and such resident holders of the stock as would sell , and in 1812 applied to the legislature for a charter . The name of the new institution was to be the Bank of America , the capital was to be $6,000 ,  - -  000 , and no foreign holder was to vote . As it had now become the custom to buy charters , a most liberal and tempting offer was made . For a thirty years ' charter the bank would pay $400,000 , in four annual and equal payments . If during ten years no other banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another $100,000 would be paid the State at the end of that period ; and yet another $100,000 if , at the end of twenty more years , no other bank had been established in the city . One million was offered to the State at five per cent , to be used in building the Erie Canal , and another million at six per cent , to be loaned by the State to the farmers on landed security . In the assembly the measure found many warm and earnest friends , was passed after a vigorous struggle , and was about to be passed by the senate , when the governor , to the amazement of the whole community , prorogued the legislature for fifty-five days . Many reasons for the act were given ; but the chief one was that , from the journals of both houses , it appeared that attempts had been made to bribe four assemblymen and one senator to vote for the bill . ! Far be it from me , " said the governor , " to assert that the charges are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine and refute them . " Thinking that the honor and morals of the State required it , and wishing to give time for reflection , he felt it to be his duty Jo send the members home for a few weeks . No good came of the dismissal , for the moment the members were back in their seats the bank bill was passed by both branches , and sent to the council of revision . The ' council of revision was a body made up of the governor , the chancellor , and the judges of the supreme court of the State , and possessed that veto power which in many other States was given to the governor . To it went every bill passed by the legislature . If , in the opinion of a majority of the council , the bill was an improper one , it was vetoed , and returned to the house in which it originated . If the bill was approved , or for any reason failed to be considered within ten days , it becaine law . When the six million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the six remaining members were equally divided . What should be its fate rested , therefore , with the chancellor , who , to the joy of the bank men , hastened back to Albany and cast his vote in their favor . The charter thereupon issued . In Massachusetts , the bank question was brought up by the approach of the October day , 1812 , when the charters of sixteen of the existing banks would expire . For a time the idea of replacing them by one great institution , with capital enough and branches enough to transact the banking business of the whole State , was a favorite one . But the closing of the Bank of the United States brought on the mania for local banks , and in 1812 twenty were founded , and located in eighteen towns . New Jersey established six , and , by way of bonus , reserved the right to subscribe to half the capital stock , and to appoint the president and six of the directors of each . But the law was hardly a year old when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the benefits of the banks should not be enjoyed by the Democrats alone , they passed a law for the sale of the stock owned by the State . In twenty-four hours not a share of five of them was in the hands of the governor . Delaware chartered three banks . Ohio did the same . In Virginia , an attempt to add $1,500,000 to the capital of one of the two banks was defeated . Thus in the course of two years did the mania spread over the seaboard States , and raise the number of banks from eighty-eight to two hundred and eight . As each possessed the right of issuing bills , and as each issued bills to at least three times the amount of its capital , the country entered once more upon an era of paper money . Had the banks been able to obtain enough specie to redeem even a small proportion of their paper , all would have gone well . But , unfortunately for them , much // of the specie on which their circulation depended was at that moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of non - importation , and the war were chiefly responsible . Under the restrictive system which began in 1807 , and had not yet ended , manufactures had at last begun to flourish . Greatly against their will , the people of New England had turned their attention to spinning and weaving , and , favored by the exclusion of English competitors , had begun to supply the domestic market with many articles . As early as 1811 , the effect of this was already apparent in the slow and steady flow of specie from the South and West to New England . With the opening of the war and the rigorous blockade of the coast south of Newport , this movement of specie became more rapid . The only outlet for the cotton , rice , tar , pitch , and hemp of the South , and the tobacco and flour of Virginia , was through New England , whose ports were still open to neutrals , and to the enemy disguised as neutrals . Into them came the hardware and the crockery of England , the wines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boots and slio*s , the negro cloth , the woolens , and the cotton cards made in New England , were carried by wagon to Richmond and Augusta , to be distributed over the South and West . So enormous did this trade become that , during 1813 , employment was given to more than four thousand four - horse wagons . As the needs of the South forced it to buy of the East more largely than the opportunities of the East enabled it to buy of the South , the bales of cotton the teams brought north did not begin to settle the balance , which had , in consequence , to be paid in specie . Bad as this was , it became much worse when Congress , in December , 1813 , laid an embargo , and stopped the trade of New England with the enemy and with neutrals . The South had then no market for its produce , and its banks were quickly stripped of every available dollar of specie . In effecting this settlement the banks of Boston called on those of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in their turn called on the banks yet farther south . So great was the drain that , in spite of sums used to pay for foreign merchandise , in spite of sums used to payfor British bills of exchange , in spite of sums smuggled out of the country to be sold at a high premium to the enemy , the specie in the Boston banks swelled from less than $800,000 in 1812 to more than $7,000 ,  - -  000 in 1814 . Nothing but a crisis or the first symptoni of public discredit was then needed to send every bank from New York to Savannah into bankruptcy . Both these things came to pass toward the close of August , 1814 . Landing on the shores of Chesapeake Bay , the British marched to Washington , burned the public buildings , cut off communication with the South , and attacked the city of Baltimore . That depositors , in such a time of excitement , should hasten to withdraw their money , and that people having bank notes should be eager to exchange them for specie , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the seaboard south of Baltimore , gathering what little specie they still had , packed it in boxes , carried it far into the interior , buried it , and made no attempt to redeem their notes . The banks of Baltimore did the same . Those in Philadelphia held out a few days longer . But the run began , and on the 28th of August the presidents of the six banks ordered specie payment to be suspended , and gave the public the reasons . " From the moment , " said they in their circular , " the rigorous blockade of the ports stopped the exportation of our products , foreign goods had to be paid for with coin . As the importation of foreign goods and wares into New England has been very great , there is a // heavy drain on the banks , a drain swelled yet more by a trade in British government bills of exchange which has taken great sums out of the country . To meet this demand , the course of trade has enabled us heretofore to draw from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off this source of supply , and the question arose , Shall we continue to gather all the specie of the country into our vaults merely in order that it may be sent out of the country , or suspend specie and save the coin ? Believing that the public interest is best served by taking the latter course , we have unanimously agreed to suspend , and appeal to our fellow-citizens to support us . " The appeal *was not in vain . The friends of both political parties pleaded vigorously in its behalf . The merchants , who were deeply indebted to the banks , assembled at the Coffee House , and agreed to take the bills of the institutions suspending payment . The committee of defense publicly indorsed the action as a wise measure of precaution , and the people quietly submitted . Meanwhile , the banks of New York city had suspended , and assured the people that , till specie was again in circulation , they would not increase the amount of their notes then outstanding , and would take one another 's notes in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met at the Tontine Coffee House , and in their turn resolved to avoid all negotiation requiring specie payment , to take the notes of the banks as freely in the future as they had in the past , and to do their utmost to maintain bank credit . The city , in its corporate capacity , agreed to issue bills of a penny and upwards to replace the small silver and the cents . When these things became known at Albany , the banks of that city suspended , and in a few days not a bank in any of the seaboard States , from New York to Georgia , was making specie payments . The chief sufferer from this state of things was the government . Millions of its revenue were at that moment deposited with the Southern banks . But the suspension having prevented the movement of a dollar to the frontier , where the troops , the army contractors , the thousand and one creditors , were to be paid , the treasury was practically bankrupt . In a little while numbers of acceptances for large amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army was unable to meet demands for sums so trifling as thirty dollars . The War Department was in such distress that the Secretary of the Treasury was forced to ask a bank at Georgetown to pay a debt of $3500 . At some places along the frontier , when the terms of service of the troops expired , they were paid in certificates . On attempting to sell these bits of paper for one half the face value , the soldiers could not find a man who would take them , and were forced to beg their way home . At Plattsburg , where some New York militia were discharged , not even certificates were to be had , and they , too , went about begging food and money from the citizens . When , on the 1st of December , some treasury notes fell due at Philadelphia and were presented for payment , the loan commissioner offered new stock of the United States or bills of Southern banks . Having no specie of any denomination , the Secretary was now forced to take another step , and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of taxes or dues when the amount of the note was greater than the sum due . rrhus , if the debt were nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents , the collector must not accept a twenty-dollar treasury note . This order was construed with great strictness , and when some New Bedford liquor dealers applied to the collector for licenses , and offered a note greater in value than the sum total of all their respective dues , it was refused . Thereupon the dealers declared they would go // on without licenses , and told the collector to go to law if he dared . At New York , three men , whose combined taxes footed up twenty-one dollars and fiftyone cents , offered a twenty-dollar treasury note and the rest in specie ; but this , too , was rejected , because , while less than the amount due from the three , it was greater than the amount due from any one . Unable to get a dollar in specie or move a cent from one city to another , the Secretary of the Treasury , towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public creditors at Boston , in which he openly admitted that the treasury was empty . " The suspension of specie payments , " said he , " by the greater part of the banks in the United States , and among them those in which the government 's money lies , makes it no longer possible to apply money collected in one part of the country to the payment of debts incurred in another . The public creditors , therefore , must be content to receive treasury notes in place of specie , or wait patiently till such time as the Secretary has specie with which to pay them . " Some took treasury notes , but they were few in number ; and when the first day of 1815 ar1*ived , the treasury had defaulted in the payment of dividends on the funded debt due in Boston , had defaulted in the payment of $2,800,000 of treasury notes due in many places , and had failed to take up two temporary loans of $250,000 each made by the State Bank of Boston . Up to this time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern banks . They had , indeed , small dealings with those in the East . But when a Spanish joe brought nine per cent , and an American dollar six per cent , premium in any seaboard city , it may well be supposed that great efforts were made to bring over the mountains what little specie the Mississippi Yalley contained . So serious were these efforts that , early in the new year , the Miami Ex porting Company , the Farmers and Mechanics ' Bank , and the Bank of Cincinnati , all doing business in Ohio , were , forced to suspend specie payments . The high price of specie in the East , the presidents stated in their circular , had directed the attention of " moneyed emissaries " to the West , and the refusal of the Ohio banks to pay gold or silver was a measure of self-protection . Locking up the coin by the banks bore heavily not only on the Treasury Department and the public creditors , but on the great body of the people as well . It stripped the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shilling , not a pistareen , was anywhere to be seen in the region of the suspending banks . As no financial institution could , at that time , legally issue bills of a lower denomination than twe dollars , the place of the silver pieces had to be supplied by illegal issue of small paper bills . The cities , in their corporate capacity , printed thousands of dollars ' worth of penny , two-penny , and six-penny notes , which their treasurers sold in sums of five or ten dollars to such as needed change , with the assurance that they could at any moment be redeemed in bank bills , and would be taken in payment of taxes . Thus the city of New York , in a few months , put out in this manner $190,000 , of which $150,000 were in constant circulation . The banks did likewise ; but , as they could not legally issue in their own name , they generally appointed some honest man to sign the bills for them . Merchants , tradesmen , manufacturers , stage owners , tavern keepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring came the whole seaboard south of New England was flooded with paper money of the worst description . When peace returned , when the ports were opened in March , and a brisk trade began with foreign nations and along the coast , the evils of this kind of currency were felt most severely . Specie rose in value steadily , week by week , // till , in October , American dollars , which in March brought six per cent premium , sold at sixteen per cent advance , and Spanish coin at twenty-one . Around each city were drawn a series of imaginary rings , representing so many zones of varying discount . At Philadelphia , notes of the Delaware banks were taken at two per cent discount ; those of Baltimore at three ; those of Richmond , if of chartered banks , at three ; those of Pennsylvania and Ohio at seven . Northward and eastward a better state of affairs existed , and Jersey bills were taken in Philadelphia at par , New York bills at four , and Boston bills at nine per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York state banks passed at a discount of twenty per cent , those of Philadelphia at twenty-four , and those of Baltimore at thirty . No Southern bank notes were to be seen . Treasury notes were not worth seventy-five cents on the dollar . A one hundred dollar United States six per cent bond would not bring more than sixty . Philadelphia merchants and traders who dealt largely with the West and the South were so affected by these rates of exchange that meeting after meeting was held in April , 1815 , to discuss the serious inconveniences they suffered . At last a committee was chosen to seek a remedy , and it made a report full of interest . The evil , it told the meeting , was deeply seated , and the remedy was not in the hands of the community at large . Want of a circulating medium was the true source of the difference of exchange between different States . Ab-. sence of specie put them in the position of foreign countries , the value of whose money was regulated by the balance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their paper depreciated in the State to which they were indebted . This was precisely the condition of the South and the West with regard to Philadelphia . They were in debt . The balance of trade was against them , and nothing but the restoration of a national circulating medium could bring relief . How far the national government should attempt to accomplish this was not , the committee said , for it to say . Had the banks been the only sufferers for the want of a circulating medium , they would have waited long for government aid . But they were not . Every day the Secretary of the Treasury felt the need of such a medium . Goods , wares , and merchandise were coming into the ports from foreign lands , in quantities such as had never before been known . Yet not a cent of the duty paid on them could he moved from the city at whose custom house it was collected without heavy charges for exchange . In hopes of stopping this , and forcing the banks to resume the payment of specie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that on and after August 1 the collectors would not receive the notes of banks which did not pay specie , and did not take and pay out treasury notes at par . Some , whose depositors did a largq custom-house business , or in whose vaults was government revenue , reluctantly yielded . But so many important banks did not accede that on August 15 a new circular was issued . The purpose of the proposition made to the banks by the treasury in the circular of June was , the Secretary said , to secure a circulating medium , both local and general . The local medium was to be made up of state bank notes , treasury notes , and cents , which the mint was to issue at once . The general medium was to consist of treasury notes , to be taken at par by the banks all over the country , and so afford a ready means of making remittances from place to place . This proposition , he was glad to state , had been generally accepted by the state banks . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Georgia had flatly refused to comply . Eight in New York , two in New Jersey , two in Pennsylvania , and two in Ohio had made no answer . Notice was therefore given // that , aft*r the first day of October , 1815 , the notes of these banks would no longer be received in payment of duties or taxes due the United States . this was vigorously protested against . No wonder , it was said , that New York banks will not receive and issue treasury notes at par , while banks in the South do . When those in New York city suspended specie payments , they solemnly agreed not to extend their loans above the amount then out . To this they adhered strictly , and by so doing kept the value of their paper steady , while that of Southern banks went down . When the Secretary made his proposition , treasury notes sold at three per cent discount in New York , and at three per cent premium in Baltimore . In New York , therefore , taking treasury notes at par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore it was a bonus of three per cent . But this was not all . Bills of the Baltimore banks which accepted the Secretary 's proposition were taken in payment of custom-house bonds , though the bills were seven per cent below treasury notes . In Boston , treasury notes were cheaper than bank bills . The rate of duty being the same , a Massachusetts importer would therefore pay in a currency seven per cent more valuable than the Baltimore merchant . On goods carrying a duty of twenty - five per cent ad valorcm , this was equal to two per cent , and two per cent was enough to pay the freight and insurance from Baltimore to Boston . If two merchants in these cities had each imported $5,000,000 worth of hardware and crockery , woolens and linens , the merchant of Baltimore would have paid $350,000 less revenue than his fellow in Boston . Nevertheless the notice was effective , and seven of the banks which had failed to comply in July complied before the first of November . By that time the people were growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the flood of paper money poured out on the community by individuals , counterfeiters , and banks having no charters . At a meeting made up of the merchants , tradesmen , and citizens of Albany , resolutions were passed not to accept any small bills other than those issued by the corporation of the city , nor any bank bills which did not pass current at the city banks . At Richmond , a citizen having collected ten one-hundred-dollar notes of the Bank of Virginia , presented them and demanded silver . He was refused ; and , on seeking counsel to bring suit , he could not find a member of the Richmond bar who would take the case . Repairing to the office of the clerk of the superior court , be thereupon took out a summons against the president and directors of the bank . When rule day came , as they failed to appear , a distringas was issued . Still tbe bank would not obey , and on the president refusing to submit peaceably the sheriff summoned a posse , shut the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a few days*however , the bank was doing business in a room over its old quarters , and in open contempt of the court . Shortly after this affair the Virginia legislature took up the matter , and placed on the statute book three laws concerning the currency . One required every bank in the State to resume specie payment by November 15 , 1816 . The penalty for not doing so was a writ of execution , to issue in ten days , and costs and six per cent interest on the bill from the day specie was refused in exchange for it . In order to comply with this law , the banks began to call in loans , stopped discounting , and so deranged business that tobacco and produce fell off in price from five to twenty per cent . This led a grand jury to present the law as a daring attempt to infringe the constitutional rights of the people , and a violation of that section of the Federal Constitution which limits the powers of the States . " Should the legislature , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pronounce absolute judgment of confiscation , its action may furnish a proper occasion for a popular revolution . " The second law provided that in all cases of debt , or of money due on execution , deed of trust , judgment , or mortgage , not an article should be sold unless , ten days before the sale was to take place , the persons to be benefited should write on the execution their willingness to take such notes of the chartered banks of Virginia , of the neighboring States , and of the District of Columbia as were current in the county where the sale was to be held . It was then made the duty of the judges of the courts of the counties and of the corporations to decide each month what bills were current within their jurisdiction , and to fix the rates of depreciation as compared with the notes of the Farmers ' Bank and the Bank of Virginia , the only chartered banks in the State . The third law fixed a date whereon the notes , bills , and tickets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after which to issue or receive such bill* or tickets would be a misdemeanor . In each case the remedy was again worse than the disease . In each case the law failed to accomplish its purpose , was assailed with bitterness , and in time suspended . At the court of hustings held for the corporation of Staunton , the judges flatly refused to execute the law . At a court for Augusta County , the judges declared that the paper of the chartered banks of Virginia , Maryland , Pennsylvania , District of Columbia , and of the State Bank of North Carolina should be taken at par , and that no other bank paper should be current . The court of hustings sitting at Richmond ordered that notes of the Bank of Virginia and of the Farmers ' Bank should be rated at par ; but that Philadelphia paper should pass at seven and a half per cent discount , Baltimore paper at ten , and that of the District of Columbia at twelve and a half . Rulings such as these put an end to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take at par , the people of Richmond were forbidden to take at all . Bills which at Richmond were , by order of the court , received at a discount of ten per cent were , for the same reason , current at Fredericksburg at their face value . To make matters worse , the associations and companies doing an unchartered banking business begaii to call in their paper , in order to comply with the law aimed directly at them . These companies were of two classes , were to be found in the valley rather than in the tide-water region of Virginia , and owed their existence to the bad system of state banking . In 1803 and 1812 the legislature had chartered banks , had given to them power to establish branches in certain towns , and , since the establishinent of these two , had granted no other charters . Exercising its powers , the Bank of Virginia had opened branches at Norfolk , Fredericksburg , Petersburg , and Lynchburg . The Farmers ' Bank had branches at Norfolk , Petersburg , Lynchburg , Fredericksburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Richmond . The great and fertile region lying west of Richmond was thus left without any bank or any money-loaning institution . But it was into this region that immigration had long been pouring , and it was to meet the needs of these immigrants that two classes of companies had grown up . In the one class were the associations known by such names as the Bank of Winchester in Virginia , Bank of Martinsburg , Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac , the Virginia Saline Bank , the Farmers and Mechanics ' Bank of Harper 's Ferry , and a host of others , which , without charters , did a regular banking business , made loans , discounted notes , received deposits , and issued paper money . In the other // class were the exporting companies , the companies for the encouragement of agriculture and manufactures , and the farmers ' companies , all of them great buyers and shippers of produce , who paid their debts in paper of their own issue , which soon became the circulating medium of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law carried financ.ial distress into regions where bank bills were almost unknown . By the middle of the summer the whole State was clamorous for a special session of the legislature to repeal the banking and currency laws . A special session was accordingly held in November . The law requiring the banks to resume specie payment was suspended , first for one month , and then for seven ; and fifteen unchartered banking institutions were given till the last day of August , 1817 , to call in their paper and comply with the law . To please the people of the mountain region , two new banks were created . One , called the Northwestern Bank of Virginia , was to be at Wheeling , with branches at Wellsburg , Morgantown , and Clarksburg . The other , named the Bank of the Valley in Virginia , was to be at Winchester , with two branches to be located in the neigh. boring counties , provided sufficient subscriptions were made . The experience of Virginia was the experience of every State . In the Pennsylvania house of representatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inquire into the expediency of revoking the charters of every bank within the Commonwealth that refused to pay specie . The friends of the banks rallied , and succeeded in changing the motion to one bidding the committee report on the cause of suspension and the remedy . The causes , the committee declared , were , too many banks and an enormous issue of paper . The forty-one chartered in 1814 bad not added one dollar to the specie in the State . Yet each one had put out paper far beyond the limit required for its own safety , or the good of the public , or the ability of the community to redeem in specie . The remedy was , the committee reported , a law providing that if any bank in Pennsylvania should , on demand , refuse to pay its notes in coin after January 1 , 1817 , interest at eighteen per cent should begin from the time the demand was made , and continue till the demand was fully satisfied . But if any bank , after January 1 , 1818 , refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become null and void . Having heard the report , the friends of the banks , under the lead of James Buchanan , moved a substitute which gave very different reasons , and suggested a very different remedy . During the war , they said , the ports of the Southern and Middle States had been strictly blockaded , while those of the East had been open . Foreign merchandise , even when intended for the South and Middle States , came in , therefore , through the Eastern ports . As it could no longer be paid for . in produce , it was paid for in specie , which began to flow steadily eastward . But more than this : New England had made small subscriptions to the federal loans , so small that they were far less than the federal expenditures in that region ; and to make up this difference more specie was drawn from the Middle States . Just at the time this was going on , the people in the interior of Pennsylvania , seeing that all the profits of banJdng were monopolized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the branch banks , which were drawing all the coin in the State into the vaults of the parent banks at Philadelphia , came forward in a body , and demanded that the legislature establish banks in the interior . This was done , and the new institutions , drawing on Philadelphia for their specie capital , steadily lessened the gold and silver in that city , and forced the banks to suspend . With peace many of these disturbing causes ceased . But // new ones took their places , for the importation of foreign goods so exceeded the exportation of American products that specie still continued to be sent abroad to settle the balance . This was the condition at the present time , and , under such circumstances , it was unwise to adopt measures forcing the banks to resume . As the result of these conflicting views , consideration of the report was postponed . Like attempts to drive bank paper out of circulation failed in New York and Maryland . In Ohio , in Indiana Territory , in Kentucky , notes of unchartered banks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chartered banks were so highly protected in Kentucky that when an execution issued , and the plaintiff wrote across the face of the writ the words " Notes on the Bank of Kentucky , or its branches , or notes on any other incorporated bank of this State , or notes on the treasury of the United States , will be accepted in discharge of the whole of this execution , " the defendant had but three months within which to replevy . Should the plaintiff refuse to accept such paper , the defendant might replevy at any time within a year . To the evils produced by so debased a paper currency , coming from more than four hundred sources of issue , - from banks with charters , from banks without charters , from cities , from towns , from individuals , from importing companies and exporting companies , from factories . and from the treasury of the United States , - must be added yet other evils which sprang from the opportuniiies such a currency afforded rogues and sharpers . Men without consciences printed their i*hange bills on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets of the takers . Counterfeiters plied their shameful trade so successfully that hundreds of thousands of dollars of false notes were soon afloat in the country . One gang made its headquarters in Indiana Territory . Another had its presses somewhere on the Hudson . Four members of the Western gang , who were captured at Harrisburg , had in their valises $350,000 of counterfeit notes of the Miami Exporting Company of Ohio . A member of the Eastern gang , when caught , had with him counterfeit notes of every important bank along the seaboard , from Savannah to Albany . The newspapers all over the country were full of notices of false bank notes , and , what was quite as bad , of notes of banks which had no existence . These wildcat institutions were the creation of a class of men who would have thought counterfeiting infamous . Two or three of them would associate , select a name and a city , have plates engraved in the best and most artistic manner , print bills of all denominations , and sell them to the exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the place where the bank was supposed to be located . New York , as a great commercial centre , was a favorite spot , and in it many such imaginary institutions were located . One , taking the name of the City Exchange Bank , and claiming to have $2,000,000 of capital , scattered tens of thousands of dollars in notes all over the South . Another , called the Merchauts and Mechanics ' Exchange Company , victimized the people of Augusta , of Fayetteville , and of Charleston . Notes of a third , the Ohio Exporting and Importing Company , appeared at Trenton , at Philadelphia , and in western Virginia . The owners of a fourth , known as the Commercial Bank , did a thriving business from Cooperstown to Buffalo . But this prosperity was not to endure ; for , in spite of state banks , exchange brokers , and sharpers , the day for the resumption of specie was near at hand . Congress had established the second Bank of the United States for the express purpose of regulating the currency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury to see to it that , after February 20 , 1817 , the revenue was paid in legal currency . // In obedience to the command thus laid on him the Secretary began to act , and late in July , 1816 , addressed a circular and a notice to the state banks . The circular reminded them that a return to specie payments was most desirable ; that the banks of New England and of the South and West were ready to cooperate in an attempt to bring about a general resumption ; that the reluctance of the Middle State banks was believed by the people to be caused by the profits they were making ; and that a resolution had been passed by the late Congress looking toward the forcible resumption of legal currency . The notice was to the effect that , after October 1 , debts , taxes , imposts , due the United States , when five dollars or under , must be paid in specie , or bank notes immediately convertible into specie ; that no notes greater in value than five dollars would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes under five dollars in specie ; and that , after the 20th of February , 1817 , all taxes and duties must be paid in legal currency . On the receipt of this notice , the banks of New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore met in convention , and declined to resume for a year . It did not seem likely , they declared , that the Bank of the United States and its branches would be in operation before July , 1817 . Until they were in operation a return to specie payments by the state banks would be inexpedient , and the best that could be done was to recommend that the first Monday in July , 1817 , be agreed upon as the time for a general resumption throughout the country . Considering this a refusal to comply with his request , and knowing that if the banks refused to pay out coin the people could get none wherewith to pay bheir taxes , the Secretary gave notice that no attempt would be made to collect duties in coin till February 20 , 1817 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the pressure of the public demand , the New York city banks made a slight concession , and in September , 1816 , began to pay small change in specie . Twenty-two exchange brokers , therefore , agreed not to buy or sell specie change of any denomination under fifty cents . The corporation began to call in its change tickets , the butchers agreed to lend their aid , and by the end of the first weQk in October the " silver age , " as the people called it , was come again . Meantime , physical causes which no man could foresee changed the balance of trade , stopped the export of specie , and in a few months brought it back to the United States in such quantities that on the 20th of February , 1817 , every reputable bank from New York city to Richmond began to pay out specie . By that time , too , the Bank of the United States and its chief branches were in operation , and the business community was once more enjoying cheap exchange .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
