txt At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Princeton Club of New York held yesterday the following memorial was presented and approved : " The Princeton Club of New-York , which was reorganized during the Presidency of Dr. McCosh and received from him the repeated encouragement of his presence , feels that his death is to its members the end of a stimulating friendship Dr. McCosh was so near to the New-York alumni that it was rather his striking personality than his official position and achievements that made the strongest impression upon them . He never ceased to be the in-pirer of enthusiasm among them and the far-seeing director of their efforts for the good of the college . " In all the larger plans which he made for the development of the college he was accustomed to take the club into his confidence and ask for its support . But he displayed an even keener interest in what the young men were doing for themselves . His ideas of what a young man should do were always intensely practical , but based upon aims and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength which he inculcated was the basis of the attachment of his alumni to him long after they had passed-from his personal instruction and had tested his precepts by actual work . " Now that the continuity of that friendship is broken by death , the Princeton Club of New-York desires to record its deep sorrow and to give some expression to its sense of personal loss . " It was ordered that a committee of thirtythree members be appointed by the President to attend the funeral of Dr. McCosh , and that proper notice be sent to each member of the club . The members will meet at the Old Chapel at 1:30 P. M. Tuesday .
