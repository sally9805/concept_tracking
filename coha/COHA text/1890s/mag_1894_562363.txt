txt IN every constituency in the United Kingdom the wage-earners and those whose interests are like theirs form the overwhelming majority of the electors . Their political power , if they knew how to use it , would be irresistible : they could confer the government upon whomsoever they would . In the House of Oommons , on the contrary , labor questions are thrust into the background ; prominence is given to personal squabbles and party manunvres in which the workers have not the slightest interest ; there is no leisure for the discussion of those subjects which directly affect their welfare . What is the explanation of this strange contrast between the omnipotence of the working class in the country and its impotence in Parliament ? At elections the " workingman " is always brought prominently to the fore . The election addresses of candidates are filled with professions of devotion to his welfaf'e . But so soon as the friends of workers have succeeded in persuading them to give a majority to their political party , their zeal for the interests of labor is choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Parliament . So far from successive governments making it their first object to supply the wants and gratify the wishes of the class to which they appeal almost exclusively when seeking power , social legislation is without scruple put on one side to make way for measures by which the party in power hopes to consolidate its position , or is compelled to buy the adhesion of its supporters , or for those discussions about the personal conduct of distinguished individuals , in which political people take so much delight . During the two years that // the present government has been in office , its solitary achievement in social legislation is a law for regulating the hours of railway servants on a plan drawn up by a committee of the former House of Commons . A very limited extension of the liability of employers for accidents to their workmen was abandoned , because the Government quarrelled with the House of Lords upon an amendment of no practical importance . The Radical party have tried to hide their failure to legislate , by taking party credit for administrative changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders found in progress when they succeeded to the government . Everybody who has been behind the scenes in a government office knows how little the party color of the Parliamentary head for the time being affects such developments . The reason why the class so powerful at the polls is so impotent in the House of Commons is not far to seek . It is because it has no policy in which the workers generally are agreed , and no leaders whom the workers generally trust . The Radical party tries persistently to turn labor questions into party questions , and to represent themselves as the sole friends of the working class . One of these leaders went so far as to declare a short time ago that in reference to labor questions there was more difference between the best Tory and the worst Liberal than there was between the worst Liberal and the best Liberal . But in spite of their indecent zeal , of which the above is a specimen , to arrogate to themselves the leadership of the labor party , they fail for several reasons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no policy , except the extension of franchises and the multiplication of elections . The workers look to America and Australia , where the development of democracy is complete , and perceive there labor troubles worse than our own ; their faith in Radicalism is shaken by the spectacle . Next they are committed to important sections of their followers to carry out organic changes . Until they have established Home Rule in Ireland , destroyed the Church in Wales , and carried out other items of the Newcastle programme they will not be allowed to devote the time of Parliament to social legislation . Lastly , they are embarrassed by a large number of rich capitalists among their most valued supporters  --  the " worst Liberals " for whom an apology has to be made . It is difficult for a rich man with the best intentions to acquire real sympathy for the suffering of // the poor ; it is impossible for capitalists , as a class , to prefer the interests of the workers to their own . It is an established principle of the leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition . The maxim is handed down as a tradition of the great Sir Robert Peel , who would say , " When I am called in , I will prescribe . " If , therefore , the present leaders of that party have a labor policy , they are not likely to reveal it until the next time they have a majority in parliament . Moreover they have a laudable objection to make promises and raise expectations which they do not clearly see their way to fulfil . They have never imitated the political profligacy of their opponents in arrogating to themselves the title of the sole friends of the workingman . The Conservative party has in relation to labor questions one great advantage , which the people are beginning to realize it is not pledged to organic change , and has therefore in office more leisure for social legislation . This is the explanation of the undoubted fact that more of the recent laws for the benefit of the workers have been passed under Conservative than under Radical administrations . No independent Labor party in the House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the supporters of government who take advantage of their position as trades-union leaders to claim the working-class vote for the party to which they belong . They have no definite policy upon which they are all agreed , and they must on critical occasions postpone the interests of labor to those of the government , or the party to which they are attached would cast them out . To make an independent party in Parliament , two conditions are essential : first , a leader whom the members of the party will follow ; and secondly , a policy or a principle to which the party is able and willing to sacrifice without remorse the interests of the Conservative and Radical parties alike . Mr. Parnell and the Irish once had such a party . When the labor leaders are in a position to fulfil , as he did , these two conditions , an independent labor party may become a reality . Though there is comparatively little that changes in the law can do to improve the condition of the workers , yet there are certain measures which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried without shaking the foundations of society , without altering the laws of property , amid without letting in // violent or revolutionary change . But in reference to these , no political leader has any definite plan to recommend , and at present there is no prospect of auything practical being done . The public enthusiasm is wanting which , in our Constitution , is requisite to turn a project into a law , and this want is not likely to be supplied until education has made the workers far better judges of their own interests and necessities . Let us proceed to examine some of these questions now ripe for action , and inquire what are the particular circumstances under which each of them has been brought for the moment to a standstill . First of all , there is the question , which a Royal Commission has been considering for three years , how to settle trade disputes between employer and employed without a labor war . Every one admits that it is desirable to have some method more rational and less costly than a strike or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wickedness of war , while the peoples of the world continue to convert their youth into soldiers , and to waste their labor in manufacturing instruments of destruction , so , in spite of the acknowledged folly of the system , workers go on striking , employers go on locking out , and the public sentiment in favor of industrial peace remains a mere pious opinion . The capitalist knows the losses which a strike inflicts on his industry ; the workers are aware of the heavy tax , in the shape of contributions to their union , which they have to pay in times of industrial peace , of the loss of wages , the dissipation of their property , the starvation of their wives and children , they have to endure in an industrial war . But each party is contented with fruitless lamentation ; neither stirs itself up to energetic reform . The Royal Commission of Labor , after three years ' consideration , could recommend nothing more practical than the encouragement of voluntary tribunals of conciliation and arbitration , but they pointed out in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it may be estimated from their report that the unorganized exceed the organized workers in a proportion of at least six to one . In fact it is the weaker party in a trade dispute that calls for conciliation and arbitration . The stronger will not hear of interference . The Homestead strike in Pennsylvania in 1892 would have been averted if the employers who were the stronger had been willing // to negotiate , or if any public authority had existed capable of forcing them to do so . It was proved , in the investigation of the causes of this strike by the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States , that the reductions proposed by the employers were right ; that the men were ready and anxious to negotiate ; that they would have yielded at an early stage of the conflict before bloodshed had taken place ; but that the manager of the employers persistently ref used to meet them . The result was that eleven people were killed , a large number maimed and injured , the men lost ? 200 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the amount has not been stated , and the public were put to an expense of ? 88,000 in guards , militia , and police . If any public body had been charged with the duty of mediating at the beginning of the trouble , and had possessed authority to bring the parties together , all this would have been averted . And it must be remembered that it is not only these public sensational strikes that have to be taken into account . There are petty local labor disputes going on continually all over the industrial world , which together cause a sum of misery greater than the conspicuous misfortunes of the greater strikes , which alone attract the attention of the public . Where is a political force to be found that will compel the government and legislature to take this matter in hand , and think out a scheme for the rational settlement of trade disputes ? The capitalists are interested in preventing the waste of capital which labor wars occasion ; but in the case of unorganized labor , with which they chiefly have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not desire outside interference ; and in organized trades , where they are weak , they doubt whether an award adverse to the workers would be carried out . The labor leaders , who represent organized trades only , rely exclusively on their organization , and they look upon the helplessness of the unorganized as a valuable means of driving them into combination . The nation , it is true , has the strongest moral right to interfere , for it has not only to defray the costs of keeping the ring while the fight goes on , but has its interests and welfare jeopardized in all the ramifications of its complicated industries by the stoppage of any particular branch . But public interests are not supported by the educated opinion of the workers , and are swamped in the House of Commons by those of capitalists and trades-union // members . The five-sixths of the workers , who , being defenceless in a trade dispute , would gain by the establishment of any power to stand between them and an unreasonable employer , are dnmb , ignorant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force at present to o**ercome the inertia of government and Parliament ; and the establishment of tribunals of conciliation and arbitration is not yet within the sphere of practical politics . Of all labor questions there is none upon which the workers are more nearly of one mind than the movement for shortening the hours of labor . The desire for more leisure is honorable to the workers . It is begotten , not of idleness , but of an aspiration after higher things . They wish for opportunities of better culture , nobler family life , and occupations fitting them for the position of citizens . In a very large number of industries the shortening of hours would result , as experience has shown , in greater efficiency of labor , increased output , and better workmanship . In unhealthy trades the restriction of the time during which the worker is exposed to danger and disease is called for both in his interest and in that of the community upon which the cost of maintaining disabled workers ultimately falls . In such callings as those of railway and train men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of efficiency , the restriction of hours might call up some from the army of the unemployed into the ranks of active labor . From every point of view , the end aimed at is desirable . But no practical method by which the aim of the workers can be fulfilled is yet invented . The joint committees of some of the highly organized trades in the north of England have successfully dealt with the question of hours ; and , hastily generalizing from this example , the political world declares that the end is best to be attained by trades-union effort . Yes , it possibly could be so attained by the organized workers if they were prepared to run the risk of having to go through the agonies of a strike ; but the five-sixths of the workers who are unorganized , and amongst whose industries the worst examples of unduly long hours are to be found , can not obtain their object by this method . The organization which makes the Northumberland miners or the Cleveland ironworkers so strong is for them an impossibility . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their employers , unless some outside authority comes to their support . It has taken many years to induce the manufacturing departments of // government , which are the servants of the people , and profess to be model employers of labor , to follow the example set by the best employers in the private trade . The Eight-Hours Miners ' Bill , to which the majority of the members of the House of Oommons pledged themselves at the last election , has made slow progress in Parliament . For the general body of workers nothing is being done . The universal Eight-Hours Bill everybody knows to be impracticable . The trades-union congresses pass annually resolutions by overwhelming majorities in its favor ; but trades-union leaders have no special knowledge of the case of the unorganized workers , and no mandate to speak on their behalf . If there is to be any authority to which workers generally can appeal for the curtailment of hours of labor , it must be a local authority , which will have to decide the question with regard to local circumstances . No party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of such an authority , and there is no strong public opinion to support it if it did . The existence in our great cities of masses of unemployed or half-employed workers is admitted to be a national danger , *and the question how to deal with them to be the most urgent and difficult political problem of the day . If modern civilization is destined to be swept away , this is the class which is most likely to act the part which the barbarians did towards the Roman Empire . In the organized trades the inevitable want of work in slack times or in the intervals between the close of one job and the beginning of another , is dealt with by the unions . The worker , for the time out of employment , is subsidized out of the common fund ; he was formerly helped to find work by being provided with the means to travel about in search of it ; now the more rational mode is adopted of indicating to him , by means of information supplied by the branches of the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found ; his distress and difficulty are thus reduced to a minimum . But in the unorganized trades , which 1 can not often enough impress upon the reader contain the vast majority of the workers , the malady of want of work rages unchecked . Invention of machinery and changes of fashion are continually swelling the ranks of the " unskilled 's with workers whose skill is no longer wanted . Of the men who used to make dressing-cases in London most have J*ft the trade to which they were brought up , and the residue // drag out a miserable existence in it , because dressing-cases have gone out of fashion and dressing-bags have come in . The young laborers from the country leave the tillage of the soil , in which they have no prospect but the workhouse , for the better wages which the town affords . They better their condition by displacing older workers , and when they grow old are themselves displaced in turn . There are season industries in great cities , like dock and warehouse labor , where long periods during which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calling . The misery of those who are half employed is aggravated by the chronic poverty of many in full work . Competition and the demand of the public for the cheapest article have produced the great sweated industries of East London , the cabinet trade , and the ready-made clothing trades , in which thousands of people work at barely subsistence wages . That this mass of half-starved half-employed workers is a national danger no one will deny . It exists in American and Australian cities as well , where one would have thought the abundant virgin soil afforded an inexhaustible outlet for surplus population . It seems a universal disease of the modern city . If there is no imminent danger of revolution , because the famishing unemployed are too apathetic , and in many cases too sensible , to give ear to Anarchists and disturbers of public order , there is a constant tendency for the class just above them to sink into their ranks and so swell the chronic mischief . In the case of London there is this further curious phenomenon , that while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work and starving for want of it , there are in the country within thirty miles of town thousands of acres of land lying derelict , and bringing forth thorns and thistles instead of food . How to apply this wasted labor to this wasted land is a problem which seems to baffle our accumulated wisdom . Some of the local authorities , who are willing to try experiments , are controlled by the colder counsels of the central government authority . The depopulation of the country and the congestion of labor in the towns go on year by year , lamented , but not stayed ; and all the leading statesmen of all political parties can contribute nothing more helpful than to throw cold water upon every scheme of remedy that is proposed . One practical suggestion has been made , which would not cure the evil , but which would mitigate its intensity , and afford some // measure of its extent  --  the establishment of labor registries throughout the United Kingdom . This would be an imitation and development of what the best of the trades-unions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried by voluntary associations , and by municipal authorities , with sufficient success to justify a continuance of the effort . What is now most wanted is some central clearing-house , where the excess of demand for labor in one locality can be balanced against the excess of supply in another . The places where there is the greatest rush of applicants to the registry office are precisely those where there is the worst chance of employment being found . This central clearing-house can only be effectively supplied by the Central Government ; but the Central Government will not stir , and there is every prospect of the local movement dying out for lack of this piece of requisite machinery . It is said that the tradesunion leaders are opposed to labor registries , bccanse in a strike they might be injurious to the side of the workers as providing employers with outside labor . As long as society exercises no function in a strike , except that of keeping the ring and seeing fair play in the fight , the trades-union leaders are perfectly right in jealously safeguarding the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to continue , there should be no difficulty in devising such precautions as would prevent labor registries from being so used . For more than a quarter of a century it has been admitted that the law of the liability of an employer for injury to his workman was unjust . In 1880 an inadequate amendment of the law was passed , which it has ever since been admitted required to be amended . Successive governments and successive Parliaments have in successive bills attempted to deal with this question , but we still remain exactly where we were fourteen years ago . As to the workers ' interest there is not the slightest doubt . Place upon the employer the obligation to compensate the worker for all accidents which befall him in the ordinary course of his employment , and from this obligation allow no contracting out . The risk becomes part of the costs of carrying on the industry , and can be provided for as such . There is no injustice to the employer , because , the obligation being known beforehand , he can recoup himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter has to be dealt with , not in the interest of the workers , // but in that of political partisans . The government proposal restricts the right of the workman to cases in which negligence can be proved . This was done with the full consent of the " labor members . " Their motive I will not stop to discuss ; the reason they gave , that they desired to insure the safety of the worker , was absurd . The employer is already liable for the negligence of himself and his foremen , and the government proposal adds no further motive for precaution . It was pointed out in vain that the proof of negligence was difficult , costly , and uncertain ; that no solitary worker could face the costs of a lawsuit ; that the same plan had been tried in Germany and failed ; and that at least three-fourths of the accidents that took place would be unprovided for . The government , which had its trades-union supporters to oblige , stood firm . The opposite side proposed that , as the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they were liable , they should be allowed to form societies and sell for an adequate consideration their limited right against the employer . On this the parties joined issue and quarrelled , each hoping at the next election to gain the working-class vote by the position it has taken up . If the workers had known their own interests , and had possessed enough power in Parliament to give effect to their will , this necessary reform in the law would long ago have been carried . As it is , it is impossible to say for how long it has been postponed . Few persons deny that it is right to forbid the employment of young children as wage.earners . The minimum age at which they should be allowed to work was fixed by the Berlin Conference in 1890 at 12 years . This was done with the unanimous consent of the representatives of all European nations , in which the British were instructed by their government to join . Yet the age in the United Kingdom is at this moment 11 years , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forego the earnings of children is no doubt a burden upon the families of many of the poorer workers , but it is one which to do them justice the great majority are ready cheerfully to bear . A great number recognize that to give a good education to their children is the surest way to bring about in the next generation a solid improvement in the condition of the people . I have witnessed both in Great Britain and in Ireland noble and touching examples of the sacrifice by parents of their own immediate gain for the // sake of the future welfare of their children . The Vrades-unions have at all their recent congresses passed with practical unanimity resolutions in favor of raising the age of exemption from labor . The difficulty does not come from that side . There are some industries in which the employment of child-labor is convenient ; it is dispensed with in similar trades on the continent , where the necessity of bringing up the youth of the country to be efficient soldiers makes the government more vigilant and more exigent . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a party government reluctant to stir in the matter , in the absence of any strong popular force to propel them . So soon as the mass of the people not merely acquiesce in the advantage of education for their children , but resolve that no trade interest shall obstruct their welfare , and have acquired the power to make their representatives in Parliament give effect to their will , British children will enjoy those rights which continental children have already obtained . If the social condition of workers was satisfactory , their class would have no greater interest in philanthropic legislation , than any other class of the community . But so long as the majority of the poor belong to the working class , and so long as the majority . of the workers are poor , and are sure to become paupers if they live long enough , these questions as to the treatment of the poor by society have a special interest for them , and are generally though erroneously treated as working-class questions . Happily philanthropy has not yet been monopolized by any political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its branches , a more rational system of dealing with children who commit offences against the law , the prohibition of the letting of dwellings unfit for human habitation , the building of better homes for the people in town and country , better provision for destitute children and for those who by blindness , deformity , or other affliction are incapable of earning their own living , and pensions for the deserving aged , are still discussed without party animosity . Discussion will result in practical reform when the people whose interests are most affected have power to compel the Government to take the matter in hand , and when a more enlightened public opinion forbids the miseries of the young , the aged , and the afflicted being used by society as a convenient object-lesson for teaching thrift to the able-bodied.
