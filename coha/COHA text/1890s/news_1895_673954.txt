txt The Board of Health has a puzzling que , s. tion to decide . Police Captain Pickett sent Co It yesterday the body of a dog that bad bitten two persons before it was finally killed , and asked it to determine whether the dog had been mad . The Health Board 's verdict will awaited with anxiety by Policeman Edward Buchanan of the West Thirtieth Street Police Station , and George D. Greeley of 57 West Twenty-seventh Street , both of whom were bitten on the hand by the animal before his young life was terminated with five bullets . About 700 other persons are also mildly curious to know the truth . The dog , whose breed was uncertain , was about a y.ear old , and had chosen Charles Williams , a colored man employed in a tailoring establishment at Sixth Avenue and Twenty-seventh Street , as his master . Williams says he never owned the dog ; the dog merely followed him around , and he took care of him out of charity . " He came to me one day with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night to a reporter for The New-York Times . " and I gave him a drink of water . He was grateful for my kindness , and out of gratitude he remained with me . " Mr. Williams lives at 116 West Twenty-sixth Street and the dog lodges there every night .. " I noticed that the dog was flighty In his head this morning , " continued Mr. Will ams . " He acted strangely , and ran around the store as if he had no settled purpose in his mind . He would stop suddenly and spin around on the floor like a top and foam at the mouth , but I did n't think him mad . " The dog continued to spin around on the floor at frequent intervals until shortly after 2 o'clock , when he ran out on Sixth Avenue and spun around a few times on the s dewalk . His peculiar antics attracted a crowd of people who watched him for a while with a good deal of amusement until some one shouted : " Mad dog ! " Then they became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment happened to be in the midst of an unusually good spin , and his mouth was covered with foam . He seemed to recognize in the cry a cue to bite , so he stopped suddenly , and sprang at the nearest man . That happened to be George D. Greeley , who struck at him with his right hand . The dog promptly seized the man 's hand between his teeth , and buried them deep in the flesh , so that blood started . At the sight of the blood the crowd began throwing things at the dog , which turned , and ran down Sixth Avenue . The crowd chased - him , , but he -- nrarr= aged to stop cince or twice to take a spin around , and then he sighted an approaching open horse car filled with passenzers . The crowd had swelled to several hundred wildly yelling people , and the driver stopped the car ..

The dog was not at all discouraged by the rebuff which he had just received , but , with the crowd at his heels , turned into a saloon at the corner of Twenty-sixth Street . The men in the place seemed to know instinctively that the dog was mad , and , dropping their beer steins , vaulted over the bar . The bartender , who was not aware of the cause of their action , thought he was the victim of an attack , and prepared to defend himself with a free-lunch knife , but dropped it in terror when he saw the dog . The dog did not go behind the bar , but made his exit by the side door , and ran across Twenty-sixth Street to his home , at 116 . He ran up stairs to Mr. Williams 's apartments , with Mr. Williams after him , and the crowd in the street yelling like Indians .

He then tried to carry the dog to Policeman Buchanan , who was waiting to drag him to the police station . But the dog again escaped , and as the policeman reached out to grab him the dog leaped upon him and bit his right hand . Buchanan promptly drew his revolver and shot the dog in the body , but the dog would not die so easily . He started to escape , and Buchanan shot him again . The dog then lay on the ground , but still snapping viciously , and Buchanan sent three more bullets into his body before he gave up his canine ghost .
