txt IN May , 1877 , more than sixteen years ago , I purchased of the late Mrs. Joseph Gales , at Washington , the volume which her husband had made up , not less than forty years previously , containing his own short-hand report of Webster 's reply to Hayne in 1830 , together with the manuscript copy-large parts of it in Webster 's own handwriting-from which the speech was originally printed in the National Intelligencer , of which Mr. Gales was then the editor . The volume was paid for by many others besides myself , and was presented through me to the Boston Public Library , where it has since been open to examination . A communication in the Boston Tramscript , dated July 10 , 1882 , evidently contained the results of a careful and critical investigation of its pages . That communication was published while I was in Europe . Soon after my return home , however , I prepared a brief memorandum in regard to some missing pages of the volume , and filed it between the fly-leaves , where it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter as to the missing pages , but the facts which the Transcript communication stated , in reference to the original publication of the speech , led me to recall all that I had ever known or heard on the subject . I took occasion soon afterward to put upon paper the following account of Webster 's methods-if , indeed , he had any methods-in the preparation and publication of some of his most remarkable efforts , and particularly of this reply to Hayne-the most important and remarkable effort of his life . The account bears date January , 1883 , and was thus written more than ten years ago . It was written without any definite purpose of publication , and was laid away for future consideration . Several persons - among whom I may mention my lamented friend the late Chief - Justice Waite , to whom I had communicated some of these reminiscences in familiar after-dinner conversation-have repeatedly urged me to publish them , and I have more than once been on the point of doing so . But some contentions on the subject , into which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have only consented to do so now that it may almost claim the immunity of a posthumous publication . Webster 's reply to Hayne was made in the Senate of the United States on January 26 and 27 , 1830 , occupying many hours of two successive days . It first appeared in print in the National Intelligencer , in three successive parts , on February 23d , 25th , and 27th . Nearly or quite a month thus intervened between the delivery and the publication of the speech . I was a lawstudent in Webster 's office in Boston at that time , and I remember well the public and private impatience , I might almost call it vexation , at this long delay . There were no telegraphs or railroads at that period . The communication between Boston and Washington was slow , the mails taking two or three days . There were no professional letter-writers , or , certainly , no organized corps of reporters , at Washington then , as there are now . But the fact that a triumphant defence of the Constitution and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAYNE , // Mr. Webster was soon widely circulated throughout the country , and some private letters , as well as many of the newspapers , gave glowing accounts of it . Everyone was thus eager to see and read the speech , and everyone was disappointed , as day after day they looked in vain for its appearance . The volume of Mr. Gales , now in the Boston Public Library , helps to solve the mystery of this long delay ; and the solution is in precise conformity with what I had repeatedly heard from Judge Peleg Sprague , from Governor John Davis , and from others who were associated with Webster in Congress at the time , and who were never weary of telling the story of this wonderful effortfor which , as well as for the transcendent abilities of its author , they all had the greatest admiration . Indeed , no one from that day to this has ever questioned , or ever will question , that on those two days of January , 1830  --  the 26th and 27th-Webster made the greatest and most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent and overpowering as delivered , and produced an impression on all who heard it never equalled or approached by any other speech delivered in Congress since Fisher Ames made his marvellous speech on the British Treaty in 1796-even if that is to be named in the same category . But Mr. Webster felt , and all his friends felt with him , that something more was to be accomplished than any immediate impression on those who heard him . He felt , and they all felt , that the Constitution of the United States was at stake-not for the mere hour or year of that debate , but for all time and for the whole country . He had been forced or challenged into the discussion at short notice and under embarrassing circumstances . He had mustered all his resources and energies as by magic , and had come off triumphantly . The air of the whole land was vocal with his praises . But great expectations remained to be met , involving not merely his own fame , but the highest interests of his country . He perceived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as written out by his wife , however faithfully and lovingly done , could not satisfy the general public expectation . He decided that his great argument and appeal for the Constitution and the Union must be made as impressive to readers in all time to come as it had been to hearers at the moment , and that for this end it must be carefully revised and written out by himself . Nobody else could do it ; and accordingly it was so revised and much of it written out-as I have been told by the highest authority-with his own hand . Some of his friends , who were present at its delivery , were called into consultation on the subject , and parts of the speech , if not the whole , read over to them from time to time , with an occasional question : " Is that strong enough ? " " Is that as strong as I put it in the Senate ? " In the heat and fervor of these readings and consultations , different phrases and forms of expression were adopted or recalled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked over and perfected until it satisfied his friends and himself , and until it assumed the shape in which he was willing to give it to the press . He was resolved that no labor should be spared to render it as perfect and as impressive as it was in his power to make it . This is the true history , as I have the best reason for believing , of the month 's delay in its publication , and of the numerous differences which are discovered between the speech as reported in short-hand by Mr. Gales , and the speech as we have it in print . That delay and those differences , even if there were no positive testimony , could hardly be accounted for in any other way . I remember well that Mr. Gales , proud of his own skill as a short-hand reporter , told me more than once , in showing me this very volume , that he did not think some parts of the speech were improved by all this labor . He alluded particularly to the famous peroration , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that Webster had changed it a little " in order to avoid a mixed metaphor , or for some other cause . " Mr. Gales would have been the last person in the world to detract a jot or tittle from the surpassing ability and power iiAi // of the speech in reply to Hayne , whether as dehvered in the Senate or as printed in the Intelligericer . He had been a hearer of all the important debates in Congress from his youth npward , and was familiar with all the greatest efforts of our American statesmen for half a century . He was a man , too , of remarkable accomplishments , and might have been appealed to as an umpire of the comparative excellence of all that he had heard or read . And he never hesitated to pronounce this speech of Webster 's as first without a second of all the great speeches of our country . It was his particular pride to have reported it . It was his last labor in that line , and he could never be persuaded to use his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been privileged to report this consummate effort of Webster 's . I have said that Webster was called on to make this speech at short notice . A single night was , if I remember right , all that he had for immediate preparation for the first day 's effort , and one other night for that of the second day . He could have made but few notes , and the Brief which has been published-a very short one-may have been all that he committed to writing . Before going to the Senate Chamber on the morning of the first day he told Mr. Everett that as to the defence of the Constitution he had no misgivings , that he was always ready for that ; and that his only anxiety was in regard to the personal and sectional parts of Colonel Hayne 's attack . As he entered the Senate Chamber , John M. Clayton , the senator from Delaware , said to him , " Webster , are you primed and loaded ? " " Seven fingers , " was his only reply , with a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great excitement , and with almost an air of inspiration . Of his emotions he said himself , not long afterward , " I felt as if everything I had ever seen or read or heard was floating before me in one grand panorama , and I had little else to do than to reach up and cull a thunderbolt and hurl it at him . " There is little doubt that Webster had contemplated , some years before , that such an occasion would occur , and had considered how he should meet it . At a previous session of Congress a violent attack had been made on New England , in connection with the tariff and the Constitution , by Colonel Hayne or some other senator , and Webster resolved at once to reply to it . But a Presidential election was then approaching , John Quincy Adams being a candidate ; and it was feared that a sectional controversy in the Senate at that time might impair the chances of Mr. Adams 's success . Webster was accordingly persuaded to forbear , and to postpone any reply until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject deeply in the meantime , and made the Constitution a fresh subject of study . But the occasion came at last unexpectedly , and upon a Resolution which would least be supposed likely to create it . It is , indeed , among the curiosities of parliamentary eloquence , if not of general literature , that a Resolution , moved by Mr. Samuel A. Foote , a Democratic senator of no great distinction from Connecticut , on the subject of the public lands and the Surveyor-Generaland which , I believe , was never disposed of or acted on at all-should have been the ostensible theme of that great debate . Webster had made an admirable speech on the Resolution six or seven days before , and might well have been thought to have exhausted the topic , so far as he and the public lands were concerned . But that speech had opened him to assault , when it may have been imagined that he had no more ammunition . The assault came , and roused him to the supreme effort of his life . The account which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the speech as we now have it in print , recalls the saying of some great English orator-I believe it was Charles James Fox-that for complete and permanent success in eloquence on a great occasion a man should have two speeches-one a speech for delivery , and another a speech for publication . When told that a speech read well , he always replied , " Then it was a bad speech . " Webster may be said to have fulfilled Fox 's idea - if it were Fox's-in the twofold triumph of his reply to Hayne . Upon the // spur of the moment and under the im pulse of a great exigency , he made a speech which in its power and impres4. - siveness , as delivered , was unsurpassed , if ever equalled , in Parliamentary or Congressional annals . And then , with the aid of Mr. Gales 's short-hand notes and of his own memory , and of the memory and counsel of friends who heard it , he prepared the speech for publication in a manner to command the admiration of all who shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to imply that the speech as deliv ered and the speech as printed were two speeches . They were substantially one and the same . The one great speech was made in the Senate , producing an overwhelming effect . The corrections of the report , and the changes of form or phraseology , by which it was perfect ed for the press , impair not a whit the unique grandeur of the effort . No such thing could ever happen in these days , because there are now stenographic re porters who take down every word which falls from the lips of a speaker , just as it falls and just when it falls , and the speech goes into the newspa pers irrevocably without a day 's delay . It is a striking coincidence that a similar though much longer interval had once before occurred between the delivery and the formal publication of another of Webster 's most celebrated efforts . His famous Plymouth oration , which was delivered on December 22 , 1820 , was not forthcoming in a pamphlet form , or , I believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , indeed , seems to have elapsed before it was in a condition to be sent to his friends and read by the public . The date of John Adams 's note to him , acknowledging a copy of it with so memorable a compliment , was December 23 , 1821 ; and that of Chancellor Kent bore date December 29 , 1821 . I was too young to go to Plymouth in 1820 . But though I did not hear that grand discourse , I was in the way of hearing of it , and I well remember the copy which Webster sent to my mother in the autumn or winter of 1821 . Of course , as a schoolboy , I could have known nothing of the circum stances which prevented an earlier publication of this oration ; nor do I remember having ever heard any explanation of the long delay . But I have conjectures of my own , long ago conceived , which I set down here for what they may be worth . The Convention for amending the Constitution of Massachusetts was in session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1820-21 . I remember climbing up into the gallery and seeing John Adams on the platform with the President of the Convention . Webster was a member of this Convention , and took a leading part in its deliberations and debates . One of the subjects which he discussed with great power was the Property Basis , as it was called , of the Massachusetts Senate . His reply to Levi Lincoln on this question was almost as memorable as his reply to Hayne ten years afterward . The whole town rang with the eloquence of Webster on that occasion . Now , this speech was made on December 15 , 1820 , only one week before the great oration at Plymouth , and a considerable part of the speech was taken up with a discussion of precisely the same topic which formed one of the main staples of the Plymouth oration ; namely , Property as the basis of Government . I have always thought that Webster , when he came to prepare the Plymouth oration for the press , found that he had discussed the same question substantially twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon published , contained so much of what he afterward said at Plymouth , that he could not do himself justice without a careful revision of the oration , and without allowing a sufficient interval to prevent the two efforts , as originally made , from being the subject of too close a comparison . I have never collated the two productions with a view of finding a corroboration of this theory . Indeed , Webster , in his revision , would have hardly left room for such a corroboration ; but the fact of the long interval between the delivery and publication of the Plymouth oration remains to be accounted for in this or some other way . Perhaps his engagements at the bar or // in the forun ' : i , or the state of his health , may have occasioned the delay . Before turning to some other illustrations of Webster 's methods and habits as an orator , I am tempted to mention a somewhat striking circumstance in connection with his powerful speech ( to which I have already alluded ) against changing the Property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more notable . But less than twenty years afterward , while I was sitting in the Speaker 's chair of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts , Mr. Webster 's card was brought in to me by the sergeant-at-arms , and he presently appeared personally , and took a seat at my side . He was then a senator in Congress , and had come to pay his respects to the Legislature which had elected him . It happened that Mr. Hinckley , of Barnstable , a very pronounced Democrat of that day , was making a violent speech against the Property Basis of the Senate , for the change of which an amendment to the Constitution was at that moment pending . Webster , it may be imagined , looked sterner and more solemn than ever , as he was obliged to sit and listen to the same arguments which he was thought to have demolished forever in the Convention of 1820 . But the Barustable Democrat was only moved to greater effort by the presence of Webster , and the amendment was actually adopted by a two-thirds vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some other illustrations of Mr. Webster 's habits of preparation and publication , which exhibit him in very different aspects . On January 27 , 1848 , Webster made an argument before the Supreme Court of the IJuited States on the Rhode Island government  --  a case arising out of what has been known as the Dorr Rebellion . It happened that Mr. Justice McLean dined with me on the day after this argument , and in the course of conversation he said to me : " Winthrop , your great friend Webster made one of his grandest efforts yesterday . I have never heard him when he was more powerfuL " " I am delighted to hear it , " I replied , " but I do not quite understand it ; for when I saw him the very day before , he had just arrived at Gadsby 's Hotel , and seemed wearied and worried , and was evidently in very bad spirits about the argument he was to make the next day . " " Well , " said Judge McLean , " he has rarely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or two afterward I took pains to see Webster again and tell him what McLean had said , and I then added , " Do tell me the mystery of such a triumph under such discouragements . " " Oh , sit down here , " said Webster , " and I will tell you all about it . You remember that you called to see me just after I had arrived from Boston , and you may not have forgotten that I mentioned that I had been up to the Supreme Court , and had found , to my consternation , that the Rhode Island case was in progress , and indeed that the counsel to whom I was to reply was just finishing his argument . Fortunately , only a quarter of an hour was left before the court 's regular hour of adjournment , and I succeeded in gettitig their Honors , out of regard to my detention by a storm on the road , to adjourn at once , and leave me to begin my reply the next day . Well , on coming back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine with them and kept me a good while at the table . When I escaped from them you called , and as you went away Choate came in . He was associated with me in this Rhode Island case , and spent an hour with me , telling me all about the arguments of our opp*-nents , and giving me a full idea of the case as it stood . And when Choate left me I was tired out , and went at once to bed . " I could hardly help laughing , as I replied , " But all this does not explain the great speech which you made the next morning . " " No , " said Webster , " but before I went to sleep I ordered the servant to have a fire kindled in my parlor at two o'clock in the morning , and candles lighted on my table . Before half-past two I was at work , and before breakfast I was ready for anybody ! " That was the preparation for one of Webster 's great arguments in the Supreme Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it // justifies all that Judge McLean said of it . The preparation was very much like that for his reply to Hayne , as de4 livered . But Webster was now eighteen years older , and was within a few years of his death . It must have required no little courage and self-confidence in him to seat himself at his table at half-past two o'clock of a cold winter morning , to prepare for such an effort ; and the result proves what great things he could accomplish under the spur of necessity , at the shortest notice . The early morning , indeed , was his favorite time for hard work . Some of his most elaborate letters to Lord Ashburton , at the time of the Ashburton Treaty , were well known to have been written at a heat before breakfast . But I turn to other illustrations of his habits as a speaker . Webster once said to me , not long after I entered Congress in 1840 : " Winthrop , if I were as young as you are , and just beginning my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which we are all pursuing in regard to speeches . I have lost my faith in long , labored efforts , to be printed a week after their delivery , and to be scattered over the country in pamphlets which nobody ever reads . I would speak short and often . I would take some part in every important discussion , and I would prepare every word which I proposed to say , and write it out beforehand , so as to give a copy to the reporters the moment I sat down . In this way the next morning 's paper would let my constituents and the country see and read precisely what I had said . " Now , Webster had himself tried this mode of proceeding some years before his advice to me . During the protracted debates on the Removal of the Deposits in 1833 and 1834 , he went up to the Senate Chamber morning after morn ing for several weeks together , with me morials , petitions , and protests on the subject , which had been sent to him from different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me morial submitted its own view of the act of the Administration complained of , while the place from which it came sug gested the peculiar interest which the signers had in the question . Webster was accustomed at this time to prepare short speeches for each memorial , and , after delivering them , to hand them at once to the reporters for the next morning 's Intelligencer . One morning as he entered the Senate Chamber , with one of these memorials and one of these short speeches , John M. Clayton , the Delaware senator , said to him : " Webster , you ought to have been here earlier ! You do not know what has been going on this morning . Isaac Hill has been making a violent harangue on what he calls the natural hatred of the poor for the rich . ' " " What 's that you say ? " exclaimed Webster , " the natural hatred of the poor for the rich ! ' Did he say so-those very words ? " " Those very words , " replied Clayton ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his turn to present his memorial ; and in doing so , after a few words in regard to the place from which it came and the general subject to which it related , he launched out into a most impassioned and indignant rebuke of the attempt which had just been made to misrepresent the true relations of the rich and poor . He made the Senate Chamber ring with the scorn which he poured out upon the idea of there being any natural hatred between them . The vehemence and eloquence of his denunciation of this abhorrent doctrine resounded through the Capitol . Members of the other House crowded into the Senate Chamber to hear him , and the galleries , as well as the floor , were soon thronged . After he had concluded , the report that Webster had made one of his greatest speeches pervad*j the city . Pennsylvania Avenue and the hotels were vocal with his reiterated exclamations of contempt for the doctrine and its author , and the National intelligencer of the next morning was impatiently awaited for the detailed report of the speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such matter . It represented Mr. Webster as having presented a memorial , and as having accompanied it with some plain , sensible , forcible remarks on its subject and its source ; but not a word or a syllable was there about the rich and the poor , // or about any hatred or any love between them . It seemed that Webster , on sitting down after this entirely improniptu effort , had handed to the reporter the little prepared speech , which , agreeably to his subsequent advice to me , he had written out beforehand to go into the newspapers with the memorial , and nothing but rumor remained of that memorable and masterly utterance . Most happily , however , with the aid of some short-hand notes which had been taken by others , and of his own memory and that of his friends , the speech was substantially recalled and forthcoming at an early day , and may now be read in his printed volumes . In the recently published single volume of " Webster 's Great Speeches , " it will be found at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatred of the Poor to the Rich , " from a speech delivered on January 31 , 1834 . The only occasion on which I remember hearing Webster deliver a speech fully written out , with the copy in his hand , was at Fancuil Hall , in 1832 , at the meeting called to sustain the Nullification Proclamation of General Jackson The speech was not a long one , but the occasion was a critical one for Mr. Webster , who was a strong antiJackson man , and at the same time a stronger friend to the Constitution and the Union . He evidently had resolved to guard himself against being betrayed by the excitement of the moment into any equivocal expressions . He had carefully pondered words and phrases as well as thoughts and principles , and had resolved to stick to his text . This speech will be found in the Appendix to Mr. George Ticknor Curtis 's excellent " Life of Webster . " It happened that Harrison Gray Otis made a speech on the same occasion , and said much about the famous Hartford Convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on returning to his office , where I was in the way of meeting him , that he would never again trust himself on the same platform with Otis , " who always insisted on lugging in that odious Conventioii . " " Harrison Gray Otis and the Hartford Convention , " he exclaimed , " arc as insepara ble as those Siamese twins which are now on exhibition at the Museum . " Webster was often , as we have seen , roused to great utterances on the spur of the instant by some immediate provocation , and no one could do grander things without preparation of any sort . He had really no methods or habits of preparation . Sometimes he wrote out before speaking . Sometimes he wrote out elaborately after speaking . Sometimes he had a long time for preparation ; sometimes , as in the Hayne case , a very short time . One of his grandest orations-perhaps the grandest of allwas the Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson . They died in 1826 , on the 4th of July . A week elapsed before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered on the 2d of August . Three weeks of midsummer heat was all he had for that magnificent discourse . But I have reason to believe that his habit was always to make preparation for his efforts when there was opportunity for doing so . Some one is said to have asked him once whether that splendid passage about the British power and her drumbeat , in his speech in the Senate on " The President 's Protest , " was an impromptu , struck out in the heat of debate . " An impromptu ! " said he , almost scornfully , " why , that idea first occurred to me twenty years before , while I was standing on the Heights of Abraham , and I have been trying to work it into shape ever since . But I never succeeded to my satisfaction until now ! " I once happened to witness the working of Webster 's mind under somewhat peculiar circumstances . It was in October , 1840 , at the time of the great Harrison convention on B nker Hill . I was the chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster was to preside at the mass meeting . He was to open the proceedings with a prepared address to the people , to be signed and read by him as president of the Whig convention . Franklin Dexter , who was to be the chief marshal of the procession , and I as chairman of the committee , were made responsible for seeing that Webster // and the address were forthcoming . Webster was at Marshfleld for some weeks previously , and we could get no *1 satisfactory answers to our letters ou the subject . Dexter was iu despair , and I nearly so . I sent him down at last a rough draft of a brief address of my own , hoping that it would stimulate him to prepare something worthier of his signature . In return he sent us a few sheets of rather feeble matter , which he submitted to our consideration and emendation . I was obliged to write him that Mr. Dexter and I were not content , and to beg him to prepare a more vigorous paper . No answer came for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him at the United States Hotel in Boston at one o'clock on the day before the convention was to be held . We were all excessively busy that day in receiving and entertaining the delegates from a distance , but I was punctually at the hotel , while some detention made Webster an hour late . " And now , " said he , " I understand that you and Mr. Dexter do not think my address fit for the occasion to-morrow . " " Well , " I replied , " we have hardly put it so strong as that ; but we do think that there will be great expectations , and that you can do something more spirited and striking to meet them . " " Spirited and striking ! If you think I am going to put my name to any mere caucus commonplaces or Fancuil Hall flourishes , you and Mr. Dexter are much mistaken . " " Very well , sir , we are content , if you are ; let it stand as it is . It will be known as yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my draft ' ? ** " I have it here with * " Will you be good enough to read it aloud , that we may hear how it sounds and see what 's the matter with it ? " So I read the paper aloud , page by page , or rather paragraph after paragraph , while Webster began tramping the floor . I ventured from time to time to suggest changes , omissions , and addi tions , most of which he readily accepted . Now and then he became irritated , as 4 when I criticised his use of the word " deprecate " in reference to a past event . " Why , what would you have ? " " Is not deplore ' more proper for what is past praying against ? " " Well , deplore , deplore-proceed . " But his increasing irritation made the sparks fly faster and thicker , and again and again he stopped short while he thought out and then dictated some glowing sentence . We came at length to a passage relating to the original incorporation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then recent remark of President Van Buren , in one of his Messages , in regard to corrupt influences brought to bear upon WAsHINGTON in securing his signature to the charter . At this he fired up at the instant : " Did Van Buren say that ? Take your pen , if you please , and let me dictate a thought or two , while I walk the room . " Accordingly I took the pen lying on the table , and wrote down for him the following words : " There is yet another subject of complaint to which we feel bound to advert by our veneration for the illustrious dead , by our respect for truth , by our love for the honor of our country , and by our own wounded pride as American citizens . We feel that the country has been dishonored , and we desire to free ourselves from all imputation of acquiescence in the parricidal act . The late President , in a communication to Congress , more than intimates that some of the earliest and most important measures of Washington 's administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His successor has repeated and extended this accusation , and given to it , we are compelled to say , a greater degree of offensiveness and grossness . No man , with an American heart in his bosoni , can endure this without feeling the deepest humiliation as well as the most burning scorn . The fame of WAsHINGTON and his immediate associates is one of the richest treasures of the country . His is the name which an American may utter with pride in every part of the world , and which , wherever uttered , is shouted to the skies by the voices of all true lovers of human liberty . Imputations which assail his measures so rudely , while they are abominable violations of the truth of history , are an insult to the country and an offence against // the moral sentiments of civilized mankind . Miserable , miserable indeed , must be that cause which can not support its party predominance , its ruinous schemes , and senseless experiments without thus attempting to poison the fountains of truth , and prove the government of our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts would sink within us , if we believed that such efforts could succeed ; but they must be impotent . Neither the recent nor the present President was born to cast a shade on the character of WASHINGTON or his associates . The destiny of both has been rather to illustrate , by contrast , that wisdom and those virtues which they have not imitated , and to hurl blows which the affectionate veneration of American citizens , and the general justice of the civilized world , will render harmless to others and powerful only in their recoil upon themselves . If this language be strong , so also is that feeling of indignation which suggested it ; and on an occasion like this we could not leave this consecrated spot without the consciousness of having omitted an indispensable duty had we not given utterance to the fulness of our hearts , and marked with our severest rebuke and most thorough reprobation and scoru a labored effort to fix a deep and enduring stain on the early history of the government . " Webster paced the room and poured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as fast as I could write them then . Indeed , I could hardly hold my pen steady , as they came blazing from his lips under the immediate excitement of the moment . He was thoroughly roused and inflamed , and I had the full impression of the action of his mind when at a white heat . That passage was the making of the address . " Will that do ? " said he . " Will the address do now ? " I need hardly say that I assured him that I was perfectly satisfied . Mr. Healy , his office assistant or partner , then came in and copied other parts of the address after I had left him . But before I had reached the door , he called on me to stop a few minutes longer . " Read me now the last page or two of the little draft of your own which you sent to me at Marshfield , for I think that will be the best conclusion of the whole matter . " I read it to him accordingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " thereby hangs a tale . " The paragraph to which he objected was one complimentary to John Tyler , of Virginia , the Whig candidate for the Vice-Presidency on the ticket with General Harrison . When I came to that he said at once , " Stop there ! not a word about John Tyler - not a word ! The nomination ought never to have been made . I have no confidence in him , and I will not sign any address which expresses confidence in him . " " But he is our candidate , sir , " I replied ; " the song runs Tippecanoc and Tyler too , ' you know . " " I do n't care what the song says , or what anybody may say . I shall not indorse John Tyler . Strike out every word , every word relating to him ! " " But , sir , an entire omission of the name of one of the Whig candidates will occasion great remark . Let me at least put it in parenthetically , coupling it with Harrison as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can put his name in , so as to imply no confidence in its owner , you may do so ; but I shall sign nothing which approves that nomination . " And so I arranged the paragraph accordingly , as it is printed . The subsequent relations of Webster with Tyler , after Harrison 's death and Tyler 's becoming President , render this incident somewhat amusing , to say the least . It was as Tyler 's Secretary of State that he won the proud distinction of negotiating the Ashburton Treaty , and settling the long-vexed question of our Northeastern boundary . He remained in Tyler 's Cabinet when all his colleagues left him , and the country had reason to rejoice in his doing so . A word , before closing this paper , on Webster 's style and delivery . I have heard him often , and speak from personal impressions . I was at Bunker Hill in 1825 when he delivered the Oration on the laying of the Corner-stone of the Monument . I heard his Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson in 1826 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument in the Knapp Case . I heard him in the Tuttle Hubbard Case before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts against the celebrated orator William Wirt , of Baltimore ; and in the Supreme Court of the United States against the no less celebrated counsellor of Philadelphia , Horace Binney , in the Girard College Case . I heard most of his speeches in the United States Senate while I was in Congress with him , including his famous 7th of March speech in 1850 ; and I have heard him , and spoken after him , on numerous occasions at Fancuil Hall and elsewhere . My testimony , therefore , such as it is , may well be called personal . I may say at the outset that he had none of the arts or tricks of rhetoric . He never studied gesticulation , and did not use much of it . There was a pose about him when he rose to speak , like that of the incomparable statue of Demosthenes in the Vatican , or like that of Paul on Mars Hill in the celebrated cartoon of Raphael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive . But his eloquence had nothing of the florid sort . It was the eloquence of clear , cogent argument and of occasional deep emotion , expressed in pure , forcible , Saxon words - sometimes adorned by most felicitous quotations , and sometimes by magnificent and matchless metaphors . In almost all these respects he was very unlike Everett , and still more unlike Choate . Of Edward Everett 's eloquence - consummate of its kind - delivery , description , narration and illustration , historical incident and classical allusion , were the most notable and noteworthy features . " It is hardly too much to say of him " - if I may borrow from my own tribute to him at Fanenil Hall a day or two after his death - " it is hardly too much to say of him that he established a new standard of American eloquence ; that he was the founder of a new school of occasional oratory , of * which he was at once the acknowledged master and the best pupil , and in which we were all proud to sit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowedly from memory , every sentence and every gesture were studied to produce the most striking effect . And they did produce it . He was as dramatic at times as Kean or Macready , and his audiences hung with rapture on his lips . Rufus Choate , on the other hand , was all impetuosity-pouring cut torrents of exquisite thought and brilliant language in utter disregard of the length of his sentences or the vehemence of his gesticulation . One might say of him , as Cicero said of Scawola , " Jurisperitorum eloquentissimus , eloquentium jurisperitissimus . " He was certainly the most eloquent of our jurists , and the greatest jurist of our orators . Daniel Webster , unlike both , was all deliberation , both in matter and in manner . I do not believe that it ever occurred to him what gestures he should make , or that he ever remembered what gestures he had made . His words seemed to flow spontaneously and often slowly , whether from his lips or his pen , as from a profound and exhaustless reservoir of thought . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said - " Deep on his front engraven Deliberation sat , and public care . His look Drew audience and attention still as night . " I may be permitted to conclude and sum up my description of him with the words I used at the dedication of his statue in Central Park , New York , in 1876 : " Among those who have been celebrated as orators or public speakers , in our own day or in other days , there have been many diversities of gifts and many diversities of operations . There have been those who were listened to wholly for their intellectual qualities , for the wit or the wisdom , the learning or the philosophy , which characterized their efforts . There have been those whose main attraction was a curious felicity and facility of illustration and description , adorned by the richest gems which could be gathered by historical research or classical study . There have been those to whom the charms of manner and the graces of elocution and the melody of voice were the all-sufficient recommendations to // qwq SINCE Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " American order " - in the column and capital based on Indian corn , there have not been wanting enthusiasts for an " American style . " Like the search for the philosopher 's stone , the demand for an " American style " must remain among the intellectual curiosities of civilization , since architectural style , unlike manufactured products , can not be produced by rule , law , or arbitrary combination . But though this notion crops up at intervals , and sometimes with surprising vigor , for nothing is more difficult to down than a foolish idea once it has been actively set in motion , there has really been developed among us a form of structure which , while not fulfilling the requirements of a new " style , " as it is technically understood , has nevertheless a character of its own sufficiently definite and distinctive to make it an American type . This is the high office-building , a structure which , if not actually invented in America , has here received more attention from architects and engineers , from capitalists and the general public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts of our architects are being turned to new principles of design , through it our real estate men and investors are finding a fresh source of wealth and investment , through it our cities are being transformed , and the typical modern city is becoming an assemblage of gigantic commercial buildings which overtop the loftiest church spire , and render VOL . XV . - 30 insignificant the most ambitious and ornamental structures of an earlier time . It is changing our business methods and our daily life , and in concentrating unprecedented numbers of people upon small areas is introducing fresh and difficult problems into municipal existence . The high building is neither a fashion nor a fad ; its popularity rests upon the successful manner in which it fulfils an economic necessity in current affairs . It originated in the solution of the problems present in every considerable city , occasioned by the concentration of business within a limited area . Business of every sort exhibits a strong tendency to localization , and even if not kept within bounds by natural barriers , as rivers , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move or spread over strange land . Any device which will permit the multiplication of the original area , without adding to its lateral surface , if a seemingly impossible statement be permitted , is therefore a veritable boon to the business world . All this , and much more , the high building accomplishes , and the land-owner may become , if he start with a single city lot , the owner of a dozen or more by the simple process of building upward . Simple indeed such building appears to-day , yet this comparative ease was not obtained without first conquering some fundamental difficulties . Vertical architecture would be impossible , first of all , without the elevator , the great equalizer of civilization , which // brings the fourteenth story down to the second , and , by excessively *apid " express service , " makes the twentieth floor scarcely more difficult of access than the third . In studying the growth of the high building it is not needful , perhaps , to emphasize the relative unportance of each factor that adds to its merits , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its chief merit would be gone ; without it its upper stories would be as inaccessible as a mountain-top . The development , of the high building has hastened the development of the elevator , until to-day the " express " elevator leaves nothing to be desired in swiftness of service . The elevator , with the wonderful development American ingenuity has given it , renders every floor of the high building immediately accessible ; yet it solves but half the problem . If the high building would be impossible without the elevator it would be equally impossible without a mode of construction that would enable it to be built on a lot practically of any size , and without absorbing too much of the area for foundations and supports . This is accomplished by the steel skeleton system of construction , now almost exclusively used for commercial buildings of great height , and which has the double advantage of saving floor - space and of being , above the height of an ordinary structure , absolutely less costly than a construction wholly of brick or of stone . Stated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name implies , in carrying the weight of a building upon a framework or skeleton of steel . And not only does it permit the walls being light and thin , since they have only their own weight to support , but the wall of each floor is supported by its own frame , so that it is perfectly feasible , were such a thing necessary , to begin filling in the stone- or brick-work of a building at the top floor , and so on down to the ground , instead of following the ancient , and really old-fashioned style , of beginning with the lowest floor and building upward . The high office building is a structure of an entirely new type . One may search the history of architecture from the most ancient times to the most re cent without finding so much as a hint of the form of building which has become the most conspicuous feature of all modern cities . Rome had its tenements of five or six , or perhaps more , stories , but we do not know exactly what they were like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the office building . The very demand for offices , the business system which makes them necessary and useful , is extremely recent . The high building expresses much more than the duplication of stories one upon another . It calls for , as we have seen , the employment of a system of construction totally different from any heretofore made use of in commercial buildings . In providing accommodations for a large number of tenants it necessitates the introduction of exceptional advantages and improvements . A vast mechanical plant is requisite to supply it with light and heat , and with power for its elevators . The rooms must be convenient , well lighted , and opening into agreeable halls , which must also be light and accessible . Business is no longer done in dingy offices or in discarded dwellings . The modern business man looks for every possible necessity and luxury in his office building , from fire and burglar proof vaults in his walls to a first-class restaurant under the same roof ; while such minor incidentals as janitor 's service , light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveniences are either included with the rent or most conveniently at one 's elbow . Of themselves many of these things are of no great importance , but when it is remembered that they are all , as a rule , duplicated in every important high building , no matter how close they may be to one another , the unique character of these structures becomes apparent . Miniature cities in themselves , many of them contain day populations exceeding that of a considerable town . Not since man began to pile one stone upon another has so difficult a problem been offered to the architect as the design of a high building . There is nothing more difficult than the artistic treatment of an object that has but // one direction , or in which one direction greatly predominates over all others . A thing that is high and has no breadth , can not possibly possess any other quality than altitude . It is only when joined with some appreciable breadth that height becomes dignified , and can be subjected to artistic treatment . We may learn this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedrals , in which the three elements of height , breadth , and width mutually help each other . The high office building is not always wanting in breadth , but its height so necessarily exceeds it as to become the most important element in the design . And this height can not be tapered off like some Gothic spire , or built in different stages like Sir Christopher Wren 's steeples , but must extend 299 Masonic Temple , Chicago . ii // upward for one hundred and fifty feet or more , without a projection to break the rigidity of its lines , without a recess to give shadow or variety to its walls , nothing save rows upon rows of windows which must , from the conditions of the building , be approximately of the same size , and often of the same design . The difficulty of the problem lies in its monotony and in the identity with which it is presented to the architect . Nothing like this has ever happened before , and in an art which , like architecture , depends so largely upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder that our architects have not always achieved satisfactory results . The design of a high building is a definite problem which may be expressed in a very few words . It is the arrangement of the largest number of windows of the greatest possible size in a limited space , which is fixed by external circumstances , such as the width of the lot and the number of stories high the owner is intending to build . No architect designs a fourteen - story building because its height appeals to his artistic eye , or because he imagines it to be more artistic in appearance than a ten-story one . He is given a rectangular space , prepared without any reference as to what he shall do with it , and which he must fill as best he can . This he does chiefly with windows , all performing a useful function , and every element of his design must be similarly employed . Nor is this all ; not only is the shape and size of the design fixed by conditions which can not be called architectural , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walL In ordinary cases the architect can not project any part of his building beyond the building line , because the building laws of large cities will not permit him to do so . It is quite as impossible to provide recesses or other devices which would encroach upon the area built upon , for this would mean a loss of revenue , and the high building being a commercial undertaking , intended for the making of money , without a thought of its artistic possibilities , such a proceeding would be wholly out of place . All these things need to be considered in judging the high building , and in estimating its architectural possibilities and value . They are so joined with unarchitectural conditions and limitations as to be quite inseparable . The high building can not be designed as a simple exercise in ornamental work , for the foreign elements are so essentially a part of it as to directly influence the design . Art , therefore , in so far as it is the combination of beautiful things in a beautiful manner , has a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ordinary structure , in which the foreign conditions are less strongly marked . Not that there is one rule of art for the high building and another for the low ; what is bad in the low building is equally bad in the high , and what is vicious in the high is not less vicious in the low . But a design that does admirably in an ordinarily sized structure often becomes absurd and meaningless when stretched out over a disproportionate height . A very good illustration of this is furnished by the current application of the basement to high buildings . Architecturally , the basement of a building may be defined as " that portion of the elevation of a structure which performs the function in the design of constituting a support to those portions which come above it . " Its use was best understood by the architects of the Renaissance , who treated it boldly and freely , using blocks of larger size than were employed in the upper parts , with plain windows , often of a small size , making it , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern conception of the basement , as illustrated in high office buildings , is very different . In dividing up the façades of their office buildings American architects proceed on two general lines , and these , indeed , are the only possible ones ; they cut up their fronts into as many horizontal divisions as possible , or they suppress the horizontal element in order to give full play to the vertical . Generally the former method is followed in the East , while the latter has been applied with enormous success by some Chicago architects . Neglecting . // for the present , the relative merits of the systems , it is sufficient to note that when #&lt; a high facade is divided vertically , a single story is not enough to allow for a basement . In the modern office building the basement must bear sufficient proportion to the height above in order to seem to perform its office , and to avoid the appearance of being crushed by the mass above . It is , therefore , stretched through several stories , frequently through three , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference only to the height of the front , these many-storied basements may rest on a correct theoretic basis . But their practical effect is often very bad , and especially when , as frequently happens , the basement is of a different material and a different color from the superstructure ; in which case it often assumes the aspect of a complete building itself , w hi 1 e t h e superstructure looks as though it were another building thrust on top of it . Thus the basement , admirable as it is in a building of ordinary height , can be totally misapplied to the high building . This brings us naturally to the question of the artistic treatment of the high facade . The engineer and constructive architect have long since demonstrated their ability to build structures on the skeleton system to any desired height , and will even go so far as to tell you that , had they been present at the erection of the Tower of Babel , that historic edifice would have been carried to its projected height . How far their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not yet tell ; it is sufficient for us that the mechanical knowledge of the day permits the erection of skyscrapers of any height , with ease and economy . The question of planning has further been attentively studied VOL . XV. - 31 and successfully treated by constructive experts , and mechanical genius has supplied all the devices needful to render the high building habitable and profitable . The design of the facade , the artistic treatment of the exterior , the art of the high building , is the single phase that has not been treated with uniform success , and which is justly open to comment and review . Architects have labored at the problem , in many instances notable successes have been achieved , but the method of successful treatment is still an open one . A conspicuous cause for this is that the newness of the question has not been frankly admitted . In too many instances has it been supposed that , as the high building only differs from the low one in having more floors , its artis Steel Frame of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly accomplished by duplicating the elements that have been found successful in the lower structure . Certainly , on no other 302 ) grounds can the multiplication of motifs be explained , such as the forcing in of strange elements , the building of high basements in order to reduce the 4 ! The New York Life Insurance Building in Chicago . // superstructure sufficiently to carry a classical order upon it , and the like . Then again , it is supposed that , as variety in shape and size of windows may sometimes be successfully introduced in a low building , it can be repeated with equal success , if not greater - since the opportunities are more numerous-in a high one . The result is too often a collection of windows , exhibiting to a wonderful degree the inventiveness of the architect , but testifying , in a very sad manner , to his lack of artistic perception . In fact , the craving for variety , the change insisted upon on every floor , the crowdiug of heterogeneous elements into a single front , which is characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to admit the essentially new nature of the problem . With unusual and unprecedented space at their command , architects have seemed to think their opportunities provided in order that they might multiply forms hitherto used only sparingly . The fact that they have something essentially new , something wholly different from anything attempted before , has only been slightly recognized . The conditions of high building design are such that a decorative framework or artistic covering to the front is impracticable . The high building , like many other modern structures , is not built with the idea of erecting a beautiful or artistic edifice . First , last , and all the time it is a commercial building , erected under commercial impulses , answering to commercial needs , and fulfilling a commercial purpose in supplying its owner with a definite income . Many large commercial companies have long since recognized the commercial advantages of a splendid building which shall g*ve outward and visi-303 A Contrast of the Old and New Stylen. // ble evidence of the magnitude . of their resources , and many large office buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not artistic , if you please-has been allowed considerable leeway . Yet the ordinary way of bringing about these desirable impressions has been by size alone , the greatest companies imagining , and with some show of reason , it must be Union Trust Company Building New York . admitted , that those who occupied the .. largest and highest buildings will be endowed , in the popular mind , with the most wealth . There is , however , no reason forshunning the artistic side of the commercial building , nor for maintaining that the artistic is necessarily foreign to structures erected under such conditions . Art in architecture , be the cdiflee commercial or religious , useful or festal in intention , is not the piling on of ornamental features with no other object than to gain variety or to give opportunity foi the display of the resources of the architect . It is true such an arrangement often passes as . very high art , but the true element of beauty in architecture consists in giving artistic form to constructive and essential parts . No building , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet in no building was the ornament more . judiciously applied or with greater subordination to the whole . We can learn this principle from all the great classic and medieval works* and apply it to the high building , and with this guide find a key to the great modern architectural difficulty . It may , therefore , be laid down as a fundamental proposition that the art of high building must recognize its condi-. tions , must express its needs , must give evidence of its requirements . Yet even . this elementary proposition embraces . difficulties of no mean order . It has long been accepted as a first rule of architecture that . the exterior of a building , the facade , the architectural form , as it may be called , must express the plan , and tell , as directly as it can , the story of the building it covers . Yet this is. only partially true of the high building . We can distinguish . an office building from a warehouse , and that again f r o m many other grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any other , and the necessity of utilizing every foot of space in a. great city implies a uniformity of exterior often far from . + 1* / // Printing House Square New York looking south . // keeping with the purpose of the structure . The Auditorium building of Chicago is a notable instance . This consists of an opera-house and a hotel and office building . In foreign lands , where the opera receives a government subsidy , the first of these would be quite distinct from the other two , and would be given a monumental form , as has been done in Paris , Vienna , Dresden , and many other European capitals , and which is entirely in keeping with the ornamental and festal nature of the building . In America the opera , as all other public amusements , must depend on private support , and the operahouses must be erected by private capital . It was to make up the deficit from operatic performances on a large scale , apparently unavoidable in this country , that the Chicago Auditorium was built to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income might be obtained . It was , therefore , absolutely necessary to place the operahouse in the centre of the block , and indicate is presence by some external feature , which , in this case , is a massive tower , that commercial necessities have pressed into service for offices . The solid mass of the Auditorium does not come from the taste of the architect ; nor is the hiding of the opera-house a system of planning chosen because of some imagined architectural advantage . The conditions under which the building was erected were such that no other lan could have been followed . It may , as some unfeeling and unthinking critics have said , resemble a huge packing-box , and be deficient in the variety of form and outline sometimes found in structures of this kind , but in creating this resemblance the architects were simply following the instructions of their clients to utilize every inch of ground , and the latter , in giving these instructiojis , were only following the commercial policy which would render the building profitable and possible . And these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or both will fall into grievous error . Modern rchitecture is chiefly commercial , and its greatest structures are erected for commercial purposes . It , as was the case with all previous architecture , must be made to fit the building ; not the building made to fit the architecture . The impossibility of the ia9ade 's expressing the plan and the interior is only one of many points in which current architectural practice is striking out into new paths and evolving principles of its own . The question of proportion must be studied anew , and many of the older rules and principles set to one side . If an architect has an open plot of ground on which to build , if he is not given specific directions as to size , height , number of stories ; if , in a word , he is given free scope for the exercise of his powers of design , he may , if his sense of proportion has been sufficiently cultivated , produce a thoroughly artistic , harmonious , and well - proportioned edifice . But when he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be twenty-five feet or less : in width , and told to erect upon it a structure ten stories or more high , and to neither advance beyond the building line nor go behind it , and to give each floor the greatest possible window-space , the element of proportion well - nigh disappears , and the question becomes one of hard , practical common sense . The arrangement of the windows , the economic distribution - of the materials , are of more moment than any aesthetic question of propor tion . A business building is not a tow er , though it is coming frequently to assume tower-like altitudes . The Gothic builders could , fo ' example , build a tower of any height , and give it a beauty of its own , which was thoroughly distinct , whether it was part of the edifice or detached from it . The limitations of site and the commercial nature of the high building effectually prevent any such satisfactory results in the case of the modern structure . And so , just as we must modify our Monadnock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions , and treat each one of these independently , though with some sort of ref erence to the whole . Nothing could sound better than this , nor look more reasonable when set forth in print , but it is in direct violation of the fundamental idea of treating a whole as a whole . The facade of any building , and , if degrees of comBoth elements are fixed for us , without any thought of the artistic relations they may bear to each other ; all we can do is to make the best of them without fretting over our difficulties or without trying to alter the conditions , so as to bring them within the pale of familiar things , and thus , perbaps , run the risk of making them much worse than they really are . Yet this is the very thing that is most often done in current work , and is an important factor in making so much of it unsatisfactory . Thus , for example , if a building is too high for its width , by the ordinary rules  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a favorite practic* to divide the front up into a series of parison be admissible , certainly most so of a facade practically confined to a fiat wall surface , is a single object , not a collection of heterogeneous elements , no matter how harmoniously they may be blended . In fact this very blendconception of the expression of the plan in the exterior of the high building , we must modify our notions of proportion . We can not , in a modern structure , set up a standard and maintain that such and such a height , and no other , is suitable for such and such a width . // ing , or attempt at blending , is only the introduction of a new difficulty into the problem ; baldly stated , it means that *-* --  the architect , after having cut up his * facade into as many pieces as he dares , is trying to patch them together again . A high building is necessarily big ; it can not be hid , nor can it by any physical process be made smaller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an artistic success , this quality must be admitted at the beginning . Notwithstanding this many architects , especially in the seaboard cities , apparently believe they can make the impossible real , and reduce the apparent height of the high building by dividing it horizontally as often as their imagination or their taste will permit . It would be an easy task to compose a formidable list of buildings in which this principle is illustrated in all the varying degrees of failure and badness , notwithstanding it seems to have the approval of the highest authority , and to have been enthusiastically adopted in the most artistic circles . The result is what might have been expected : instead of our architects spending their energies in designing complete buildings , they are wasting their time in designing parts of buildings , or , which is more likely to be the case , designing series of small buildings to place one on top of the other . A process that arises from the singular notion that a successful building is something like a successful market - basket , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The design for a modern high building very often commences , therefore , with a basement , two , three , or four stories high , according to circumstances - a delightfully indefinite phrase , which in this case stands more for the idea of the architect than anything else . Perhaps two sorts of material will be introduced into this , and , in order that there may be no lack of variety , each story may have some feature or " idea** of its own . Then comes the superstructure , which has been lifted well up into the . air so that all may see it , if the street be wide enough . This is divided into a varying number of divisions , sometimes each story being distinct , sometimes VOL . XV. - 32 every two stories , while some bold spirit may invent a device which will actually enable him to run through three stories before making a change . There really is no limit to what an ingenious man may do . He may take two motifs , and be satisfied with placing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each by two , ranging one over the other ; or he may take his duplicated design and place each alternately over each other , thus gaining four tiers , in which all the adjoining ones will be different . With these a further change may be introduced by using a different design for the windows in each floor , or bands of ornament may be used in one tier and omitted in another . With three motifs an even greater variety may be obtained , while with four it will be possible to exceed the highest building erected to date . There is absolutely no end to the variety which may be introduced into a facade  --  or the superstructure , to keep to the part we are considering  --  and all by the simple device of running horizontal lines across it . With all this turmoil the building is not done . The superstructure , though divided into eight or ten tiers , is only the middle . It must have an end , and the way for this is prepared , as likely as not , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top story above it . The frieze , which may be a complete story , may extend through one story or through several , depending , as so much else of the building has done , upon circumstances . It might naturally be supposed that this would be the end in any well - ordered design , but frequently it is only the beginning of the end . Some architects seem afraid , above all things , of making their buildings high , as if they , as architects , had anything to do with this . Whether their imagination gives out or not , or whether it is from an artistic fear that their facades will have a bold , bad look if not cut down to ordinary levels , it certainly is a fact ' that in New York it has become very popular to build the frieze story part way down the front , and then build one or two stories over it , which will be partly hidden by the cornice , and the // building made to seem lower than it really is . This dishonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is an attempt to deceive , has its own reward . It is quite as sensible an arrangement as if a man were to thrust his head through the crown of his hat and wear it below his head instead of above it . The trouble lies , as was said at the Title and Trust Building , Chicago . outset , in a misconception of the problem . Its difficulty is admitted on all hands , and many earnest efforts have been made toward its solution ; but the principles employed in designing low structures have been so firmly grounded in our Eastern architects , the force of precedent and of custom is so strong , that most of the energy expended upon the matter has been in a wrong direction . The height of the building , instead of being treated as its most valuable property-which it clearly is from the mercantile standpoint-has been regarded as little more than disgraceful . The men who would go into ecstasy over a solid wall of rock one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet high , are afraid to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even half of it . Little things are easier to make than big ones ; but the architect of a big building must meet his problem on the basis of its size . If he can not treat verticality as an artistic quality he must learn to do so , just as he has had to learn every other step in architectural progress . Very considerable progress in the right direction has been made in the West , especially in Chicago , where , perhaps , neither the architect nor the critic is disposed to look for the best in architecture . It is an unfortunate fact that all of Chicago architecture is not good , but in many of the high buildings her architects have shown they are moving in the right path . No buildings of the present day have been so laughed at as the high office buildings of Chicago , yet in no buildings , as a rule , have the correct principles of high building design been more frankly admitted . Chicago is so new a city that her people are not so closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East . The progressive spirit of the West has no place for precedent where it does not rest on reason and is not superior to something new . The exigencies of Chicago life having caused the evolution of the high building , Chicago architects have been quick to recognize the impossibility of following ordinary methods of design in it , and have attacked the problem in a new way , as it properly demanded . We // The D. 0 . Mills Building , San Francisco . need not concern ourselves with the individual solutions attained under this treatment , but it is clearly in order to examine the aesthetic results they illustrate . It is the tendency in the East to cut up the front horizontally , and vary it with as many devices as the ingenuity of the architect can suggest . In Chicago the tendency is to give free expression to the element of verticality , to suppress ornament , and to omit variety where it is only introduced for variety 's sake . Nothing could be simpler than this programme , yet its results are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Eastern architect is thrown to one side . Starting with this as a basis , the front of the high building is naturally divided into three parts . Every structure must have a beginning and an end , and quite as naturally what comes between must be the middle . We have , therefore , a basement to begin with , and this is unquestionably the most difficult part of the front to design successfully . Even where the architect is bold enough to express the element of height , the proportioning of the basement offers great difficulties , and varies so much according to the design above it , that no general rule can be laid down . It is , however , interesting to note that in the most successful Chicago buildings the basements are low , that is to say , of one or two stories , and are without the glaring differences 311 // of color all but universal in the East . But it is well to remember that the basement is only the beginning of a building , and important only because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by carrying it through a large number of stories in order to use up part of the superstructure . This portion , which is naturally the most important part of the front , and indeed , is the front , need not be curtailed for aesthetic reasons . The building being high , there is no more natural method of designing it than to make use of the vertical as the leading motif . In place of horizontal lines , cutting it up into as many parts as possible , the naturally high superstructure is divided by vertical lines cutting it into bays , carrying arches-round or flat  --  or lintels , as the case may be , or perhaps left without dividing lines at all , the effect depending upon the horizontal and vertical lines of symmetrically arranged windows . This last is a bold expedient , yet it has much to recommend it . The most notable instance of its use is in the older part of the Monadnock building of Chicago . This is one of the plainest high buildings ever built . It is sixteen stories high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top and bottom , which are the only breaks in its perfectly flat walls . Its longest facade is broken , it is true , by a series of shallow bow windows , but these are so well repressed , and the windows so closely approximate those of the flat wall surface , as scarcely to change the monotony of the design . For the design is monotonous , as must necessarily be the case with any facade which , as this , includes 389 windows of the same size and shape , unrelieved by mouldings , hoods , or sills . Graduates of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts will doubtless tell you there is no design in this , that it is only a passable piece of engineering , with all the unartistic solidity of typical engineering work . Yet such a criticism - unfortunately not confined to Beaux-Arts men-only means that the conditions of the building have not been understood . It is of unusual height , and its longest side is of unusual width ; it is intended solely for commercial purposes ; it is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made it a better building for its purpose to have strewn its fronts with columns and entablatures , or to have spread decorations around its windows ; on the contrary , these things would mean an added cost without an added utility . In this building , as in all high buildings , it is not what should be that is to be considered , but what is . And so there is no need for unnecessary things here more than there is need for unnecessary things in any useful object or undertaking . And why should the front be varied for variety 's sake ? Are not 389 similar windows in the same edifice better than 389 different ones ? Perhaps , after all , it is a question of taste or of appreciation , but there is a dignity and strength , and impressiveness and power , in the simple , bold design of the Monadnock which is not to be found in the riotous designs in which variety and change are the leading elements . But it is not needful to go to the extreme of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to arrive at a satisfactory system for high building design . A striking illustration of the restful results from vertical designing may be seen in the Schiller Theatre , of Chicago , which is one of the most beautiful and impressive high buildings in the world ; and that , not because the architect has loaded it with ornament , not because he has variegated his facade , changed his windows with each story , exhausted his imagination on the designing of horizontal string - courses , introduced as many motifs as possible , given his client and the public at large the full worth of their money in " high art . " The Schiller is beautiful because everyone of these things has been neglected . The architect has treated his front sensibly , dividing it vertically into shallow bays , which give sufficient relief to the front without absorbing too much space from the ground area , made his windows approximately the same throughout , and confined his ornamental parts to the basement and an arcaded balcony over it . This most naturally expresses that the building is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // tower , which has a richly ornamented and strongly projecting cornice , and is crowned by an open belvidere . The elements are of the simplest , the variety as little as could be imagined , yet the result is wonderfully fine , calm , stately , dignified , artistic . The architect has treated his problem sensibly , interpreting its commonplace features with a fine artistic instinct , and the result , though accomplished with the simplest means and in the simplest manner , is thoroughly beautiful . An important phase of the design of the high building is the use and application of ornament . To a certain extent its use depends upon the treatment selected for the building ; but ornament is a help to architecture ; in itself it is not architecture , nor does the finest style of architecture consist in the taste with which ornament is applied to structural features . The horizontal system offers boundless opportunities for the introduction of ornament , but that does not recommend it for high facade designing . Ornament readily becomes a superfluity in commercial buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eye , but business buildings for bnsi* ness purposes . The place of ornament in such designs is , therefore , naturally that of a help to the constructive feat- // ures . Of itself , ornament can perform no constructive duty , save in the form of capitals of columns ; even in stringcourses and cornices it only helps lines which are constructive by nature . Its use is thus to be restricted to helping , as best it may , the more important constructive elements . Not only is a restricted use natural , but it becomes necessary when the vast extent of a high facade is taken into account . A high front is not intended to be a vehicle for the display of ornament , and when well distributed over it the best becomes too heavy and monotonous . A motif too often repeated grows mechanical ; it is too obviously turned out at so much per foot . If it is varied , we very soon have too great variety , and this , as we have seen , is one of the cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of ornament are , therefore , very great , but it does not follow that it is to be excluded from the high front . Properly applied , that is to say , applied with reason and in a reasonable manner , there is no better aid to the architect , nor is there any help he can more wisely make use of . But , like all good things in architecture , reason must underlie its use . A very striking instance of the judicious application of ornament is furnished by the Wainwright building at St. Louis . This is designed on the vertical system , the motif of the superstructure being a series of broad piers carried to the frieze without break . The basement is two stories in height , and perfectly plain , the piers of the superstructure not appearing in it . The frieze is a series of circular windows placed in a mass of ornament , and the cornice is a strongly projecting beam . The ornament of this building , save a delicately incised decoration around the doors and the foliated decoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels , placed between the windows and extending from pier to pier , and which differ in design in each story . It thus happens that the fronts of the building , for it is located on a corner , and thus has two fronts , contain a very considerable quantity of ornament , though none of it is obtrusive , and all of it performs a useful , wellindicated function . And when to this is joined a rich variety and ingenuity in the design of the panels and of the frieze , a very great success in the application of ornament has been achieved . The chief lesson taught by this building is the limitation of ornament , and this notwithstanding that , taken as a whole , a good deal is used . It is employed naturally and where it is most serviceable . This is the principle used by the Greeks , and is the mode that has been used in all the great architectural styles in their best works . No form of architecture used so much ornament as the Gothic , nor did any form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic  --  and the most satisfactory , it is well to note  --  the ornament is only employed where it has some structural significance , and where it can help by lightening the effect of too severe construction . Vertical designing being the natural system to be followed in high facade design , in which the superstructure naturally grows out of the basement , and , in turn , forms itself the natural base of the crowning frieze , a similar following of natural law offers the safest guide in the determination and use of ornament . The high building must be , above all , harmonious , a perfectly blended whole ; its bulk is too vast for it ever to be possible to hide its imperfections . The most serious fault with our high buildings is that this simple law is ignored , wilfully or stupidly , it matters not . The result is bad , and that is sufficient to point the way to other paths . And so , if we would have an harmonious design , our ornament , as well as our structural lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ornament applied to every part of the building . The multiplicity of motifs is to be avoided in the ornament just as it is to be put to one side in the structure . For the fewer the motifs in our structure , the more dignified it will be , and the fewer the motifs in our ornament , the better it will add to the dignity of the whole . For the high building must be dignified ; it must be majestic ; it must be stately . Dignity and majesty , and strength and power , are part and pareel // with size and magnitude . Fun and gayety and variety are more natural to small bodies and small things . The high buildino is big ; it can not be made lit tle ; it must be endowed with all the dignity we can give it in order that it may have its natural beauty to the full It is this which makes some of the world 's very large buildings so satisfactory , even though the elements of which they are composed are not good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Chicago , is a notable instance of this ; a huge building which , on paper , in drawing , or in photograph , seems utterly devoid of beauty , and yet which , when one stands before it , develops a mighty dignity and power of its own through the sheer force of mass . Dignity is likewise the predominating quality in many other large high buildings , of which the Great Northern Hotel , the Ashland Block , and the Auditorium in Chicago , the Union Trust Company 's building in New York , and the Ames building in Boston , are conspicuous and beautiful examples , albeit the vertical element is not equally developed in all of them . We can not always make our big buildings dignified through mass alone ; that is an opportunity given to but a few ; but at least we can see to it that our smaller fronts are not injudiciously cut up , and , above all , decorated with unnecessary masses of ornament . Ornament is not a decoration , in the strictest architectural sense of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a help to the construction . We may decorate a book-cover , if we choose , but we apply ornament to a building . And this is naturally done , not by selecting the greatest variety of the best forms we know , but in choosing some one motif and developing it throughout the building ; using the same idea , handled in a different manner in the different parts ; varying the same lines , yet withal having sameness with variety , variety with sameness . The plant that shows leaves , buds , partly developed flower , flower in full bloom , and seed , is not less a single entity because its parts have various forms at the same time . So it is with ornament on the high building . The motif that is employed in an undevefoped state in the basement increases in growth in // the superstructure , and breaks into full bloom in the frieze , the crown and ending of what is below . The progression is natural ; the result , if a good motif is selected at the outset and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a help to the structure , and our high building stands forth complete and finished in a natural manner . It may not yet be faultless ; it may have sore spots greater care or deeper thought might have remedied , but , be the blemishes what they may , it is a manful , honest attempt to achieve an honest result . And this is what the best architecture of all times has striven to accomplish . And then there is the question of style , the greatest bugbear of the modern architect . In past times the architect did not concern himself with styles ; he worked naturally in the form in use in his own time . But the abundant knowledge of the modern architect is embarrassing , for he no sooner begins to think of a high design than , in most cases , he imagines he must first of all decide upon a style . Yet this is quite the last thing to think of . The high building , being a new thing under the sun , no past style can give any help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical style , but the most ardent Gothicist can not urge it as a basis for high building design . The Renaissance is essentially a style of breadth , developed as such , and obtained its most satisfactory results in low , broad buildings . And there is nothing else , and as these do not help us we have no historical guides . We have thrown over proportion , given up representing the plan in the facade , and there is no need to hamper ourselves with affection for a style that can not help us . Nor can we make a style of our own . The chief element of a vertical design , as we have seen , is the vertical line , which is not contained in any historical style in the way we must use it in the high building . Style then , can not dominate our edifice or our design , but becomes a matter of detail , or , rather , is only to be seen in the detail . It is possible to give any character whatsoever to the ornament , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not possible , from the conditions of the questions , from tho limitations under which we are working , to make a high building an example or an illustration of any of the historical styles . But there have been many attempts to accomplish this , just as there have been many attempts to accomplish other wrong things in architecture . Of the many fallacies anent the high building and its art that enjoy a sort of vogue in even good circles , none is more absurd than the notion that , because it is a skeleton construction , because its weight is carried on a steel framework , and the walls and piers are only curtains or external inclosures of the inner frame , that does the work , therefore the design must express this construction in order to be truthfuL This is akin to the notion that the facade must express the plan , a condition we saw to be impossible in high building design . It is a most preposterous idea , yet one that has a large support . No one will contend that mankind would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh instead of within it ; yet this is very much the proposition the construction-designers are maintaining . In any event the walls of a high building are comparatively insignificant , since the windows occupy the larger amount of vertical surface . This leaves only the piers , and it is surely better architecture to cover them with brick , stone , or terra cotta surfacing , and to give that surfacing the semblance of constructive forms , than to leave them naked , or , as is actually the case , to cover them with fireproofing and leave that as the external surface . A pier is not deceitful if it contain a steel core that performs the greater part of the work . The whole of architecture , in its highest sense , is but the application of art to constructive forms , and if we can make our buildings beautiful by giving our piers and walls the semblance of reality that is naturally theirs , we need not concern ourselves with an imaginary idea that , unless we exhibit every portion of their construction we are committing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone and brick , but there is no deceit in building these materials around a core of steel , because in that case the result is more pleasing than if we cxVOL. // XV. - 33 The Ames Building , Boston . // something not int*nded to be hibited seen . A priori propositions have no place in high building design . Ideas that , in themselves , may be good and true , are to be avoided if they have no proper place in the special problem we are considering . It stands by itself , apart from other forms of architectural design . Its distinctness and newness of conditions must be recognized , or the fullest measure of success can not be obtained . We must cast aside preconceived notions , tear up old rules , get rid of old ideas . We must not imagine that because one style of architecture is good it can be applied to every possible use , and stretched out or broadened according to the size of our building . A Greek temple can never be anything but a Greek temple , a Gothic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office building must always be an office building . The glory of each is its individuality and the directness with which it expresses its object . The Greek temple was a development of the Greek ideal in architecture ; t h e Gothic cathedral was the development of the medieval ideal ; the modern office building , if it is to have the rank in architecture to which its importance entitles it , must be the development of modern needs , ideas , necessities . The question is not one of styles , nor of suitabilities of st7yles ; it is the natural treatment of complicated and difficult conditions in a natural manner.
