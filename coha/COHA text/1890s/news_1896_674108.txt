txt First Performance Here of Walter Damroscles " Scarlet Lefler . " MUCH APPLAUSE FOR THE COMPOSER Discussion of the Book and the Music ? The Performance Appltrently nn Agreeable Success . The production of a new Opera . by an American composer may fairly be set down as a musical event , especially when the composer is a resident of New-York , and one whose industry has long made him a prominent factor in the artistic activities of the metropolis . It was to be expected that a large audience would assemble in the Academy of Music last evening when Mr. Walter Damrosch made his bow to the public as a composer of grand opera . The house was full , and the audience displayed an attitude of friendship toward the musician . The new opera was received with warm encouragement if not With unbridled enthusiasm , and the general verdict seemed to be that it was an uncommonly good piece of work for a young and inexperienced writer . " The Scarlet Letter " is the t4tle of Mr. Damrosch 's lyric drama . Extended excerpts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concerts of the Symphony Society on Jan. 4 and 5 ; 1895 . On that occasion the solo parts were sung by Mme. Nordica , Signor Campa.nazi , W. H. Rieger , Ericsson Bushnell , and Conrad Behrens . The Oratorio Society took care of the choruses . The story of the opera is , of course , that of Nathaniel Hawthorne 's famous romance ; and the construction of the libretto is the work of that novelist 's son-in-law , Mr. George Parsons Lathrop , a gentleman who has himself attained a position of some distinction in literature . It may be said at the outset that " The Scarlet Letter " offers the same obstacles to opera makers as it does to playwrights . When Mr. Mansfield acted Dimmesdale in a version of this book , made especially for him , the pertinent comment was made in this journal that the drama was over when the navel began . Hawthorne 's tale is a psychological story . It is an exposition of the inner working 's of remorse . The mood of the book is sombre . from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is no relief to the melancholy . It is a fascinating story , but , a depressing play . Mr. Lathrop could no more escape the limitations of this story than the dramatist who preceded him ; perhaps even less , for Mr. Lathrop approached his task with affectionate reverence . In the constructive part of his labor he succeeded admirably . He has made no alterations in the tale which can annoy any lover of Hawthorne , . and he has brought the salient incidents of the book together in compact forth . He has made the operation of the emotions sufficiently concise and clear , and has displayed much taste and discrimination in the - treatment of the entire material before him . The first act quickly and fully places before the audience a knowledge of Hester 's fall , her relationship to Dimmesdale , her refusal to betray him , and the fact that she is Chiilingworth 's wife . The second act shows us Hester in the forest , struggling with her grief and scorned by a band of pilgrims , who pass singing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much cunning to offer consolation to Hester. , The act ends with a long duo between Hester and Arthur , closing with . their determination to escape across the sea . In the beginning of the third act we learn that Chillingworth has detected their plan and engaged passage on the same ship . Then follow Arthur 's confession and the end . Little Pearl is mentioned once as having died before the action begins . It must be evident to those acquainted with the book that Mr. Lathrop has omitted nothing of significance . His lyric verse deserves less praise than his construction. , He has proceeded according to a theory of his own , which may hi the course of time justify itself , but which in its first exemplification does not wear the crown of victory . It IS Mr. Lathrop 's belief that fhe common laws of rhythm should not be binding on the librettist , but that he should employ a sort of complicated word melody extending through several lines . A result of Mr. Lathrop 's theory may be seen hi these lines , quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best lyrics in the book : " Fearsomely wrong , that thou abhorrest And so must flee , Whispering ever the hapless tidings ? Couldst thou but cease ; ' ? As a specimen of Verse to be set te , inesic this does not Seem to be encouraging . As we said after the performance of the excerpts at the symphony concert a year ago , Mr. Lathrop Would have done better to follow the instructive demotistration of Sidney Lanier that the metrical construction of verse and music is the same . The smoother and more Melodious the poetry the more readily it unites with music in a genuine lyric style . But , after all is said , the chief fault of this libretto is its constant gloominess of mood . Efforts tci lghteh it up have , Indeed , been made ; but they have not been rewarded with mach success . Mr. Damroseh 's music is notable rather for its promise and its revelation of unsuspected ability than for its own intrinsic loveliness . It proves beyond all question that the young conductor is a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his art , and that he possesses a talent which challenges admiration and commands respect . It is unfortunate that the composer chose Wagner as his model . The Baireuth genius is an excellent authority to study , but the last man in music to imitate . Eclecticism is better for the young composer , and a closer observance of the methods of contemporaneous French and Italian writers would have guided Mr. Damrosch into clearer paths . The use of the lest motif is not to be commended . Like the pen in the hands of men truly great it is mightier than the sword ; but a beginner in operatic writing would do better to compose with more freedom and more lyric style . Mr. Damrosch has displayed in " The Scarlet Letter " sufficient skill to prove his ability to do both . After what has been said about the libretto the reader will not be surprised to learn that the music of this work is a strain of almost unbroken misery . The curtain rises amid sounds of gloom , and there is henceforth no escape but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Damrosch shows in Hester 's solo that he can write a truly beautiful lyric , and in the madrigal he shows that he knows how to obe quaint , piquant and humorous . The first and third acts are full of choral writing , and in this the composer has shown the results of his long and earnest study of the great oratorios . The ecclesiastical coloring of his choruses comports well with the character of the Puritans , and in handling the vocal masses Mr. Damrosch has displayed breadth , firmness , judgment and a substantial knowledge of polyphonic science . The instrumentation is plainly the result of familiarity with the scores of the Wagner music-dramas . It is sonorous , deeptoned , darkly colored instrumentation , solid in texture and full of wise devices in the solo effects . That it is not brighter in color is of course due to the nature of the subject which it illustrates ; and it may be , too , that the lavish hand of youth has laid on the instrumental tints with too much generosity , so that the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent discipline for Mr. Damrosch , if he means to continue operatic composition , to write two or three dramatic scores on the model of " Ah , perficlo. " t Such exercise would open his eyes to tile possibilities of a more classic style , and would convince him of the value of occasional continence in the presence of the fleshly temptations of the contemporaneous orchestra . On the whole , criticism of Mr. Damrosch 's " Scarlet Letter " ought to be friendly and encouraging . When it is considered that before writing that work he had done practically nothing in the field of composition , his achievement is simply surprising . That he should at once have taken up the heaviest artillery of modern music and . used it with so much force and such accuracy is a subject for general congratulation . His faults , aside from those caused by his melancholy subject , are generally those of wanton youth . Experience , maturity , self-poise , will rid him of them . It is to be hoped that he will undertake further effort in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest enthusiasm by an audience which was undeniably friendly to Mr. Damrosch . It was a representative musical audience , in which every one of note in town , from Anton Seidl to Victor Harris , seemed to be present . The Oratorio Society attended in a body , and so did . the Wagner Society . The latter testified to its appreciation of Mr .. ADaniroscles : efforts by a little ceremony ' the  - -  close the second act . Mr. ? R : ? W. G. Welling followed Mr. , Damrbsch before the crtairi , and , on behalf of the Wagner Society ' , presented him with a handsome copy of Hawthorne 's " Scarlet Letter " in a silver box . Mr. Damrosch responded with feeling , paying a tribute to Hawthorne 's genius , and thanking Mr. Lathrop . After which he retired laden with flowers and followed by applause . There were striking merits and some defects in the performance . It is safe ' to say that the work would make a more agreeable impression if it were in more generally capable hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make use of those members of his company who enjoyed a speaking acquaintance with the English language . No performance , however , could produce a wholly satisfactory dramatic effect . The subject was a fatal blow to all possibilities of that sort . The honors of the evening fell easily to Fratflein Johanna Gadski , who appeared as Hester Prynne . So far as she was concerned , Hawthorne 's ideas were realized . She looked the part , and evidently had made a careful study of it . Her " maketip " and costume were appropriate and becoming , and , as she stood at the pillory in the fleet act , she bodied forth to the eye such a woman as Hester must have been . In the second act . when she threw off the burning letter and bade Dimmesdale fly with her and be free , she fully conveyed the idea of a passionate , throbbing woman , bursting the bonds of restraint . She sang the trying music of the role very well indeed , and with very few deviations from the pitch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sympathetic , winning , and convincing . It is a pity that similar praise can not be a warded to Barron Berthald , who was Arthur Dimmesdale . He looked wonderfully like Lawrence Barrett as Hamlet , but did not sing as well . He was in earnest , but his voice is hard and his vocal , nethod harder . His acting was nervous and spasmodic . William Mertens , a capable singer in some parts , was quite unhappy as Chillingworth . He acted the part as if it were a sort of Alberich and sang it in a shouting style . The other parts are of small importance and were sufficiently well done . The chorus sang admirably . It was always in tune , and it gave the charming madrigal with nice shading . It would be a pleasure to praise Mr. Damrosch 's conducting of his work ; but it is seldom that a composer makes a good effect in directing his own music . Mr. Damrosch 's anxiety and enthusiasm quite carried him away , and he conducted with such vigor that in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full cast was as follows : Hester Prynne .
