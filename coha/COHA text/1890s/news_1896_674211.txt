txt THE New-Yonic TIMES has lately concerned itself with the enforcement of the law in two cases in which the neglect of it had given rise to serious public inconvenience . One of these was the failure of the Manhattan Railway Company to run continuous trains over the Third Avenue line beyond the Harlem River . The other was the illegal obstruction of the sidewalks in the down-town district of the city . In the first case the requirement of the law was explicit . If a disposition to obey the law without compulsion could be as- ? sumed of any corporation , and particularly if such an assumption were not- absurd in the case of the Manhattan Company , the trains would long ago have been run . It is true that a general inconvenience has been inflicted upon the patrons of the road who live beyond the river , and that the neglect of the company has retarded the development of that part of the city . But " what is everybody 's business is nobody 's business . " Until THE TIMES took up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rights were , let albne trying to enforce them . But when the law was explained to them and their action instigated they have taken the case before the State Railroad Commission , which could not but decide in their favor . The commission has given the company thirty days in which to comply with the law , and the company will probably find it to its disadvantage not to keep the date . The other case was the incumbrance of the public sidewalks in clear violation of law and to the great inconvenience of the public . The law has been overridden by a series of what may be called rules of indulgences . The Controller has done his share in this , but he can plead the good motive of gaining revenue for the city . Most of the indulgences , however , have not profited the public in the least , but only the individuals who granted them . Neither the Board of Aldermen nor the Bureau of Incumbrances has any right to dispense people from obeying the law . Some of the offenders began by talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are talking big no longer . When the Board of Incumbrances was spurred into doing a little of its duty and clearing one or two very clogged and very much frequented sidewalks , the trespassers began of their own accord to take away - the obstructions . All that is needed is a few examples . It is ridiculous to plead , as the bureau pleads , that it has not force enough to remove all the incumbrances . It has , for it is the duty of the whole police force to aid it . If it is once made troublesome and dangerous for dealers to obstruct the sidewalks , they will obstruct them no longer . We may confidently look forward to a time when the sidewalks shall be as completely freed from standing merchandise as Col. WARING has freed the streets from standing trucks . Meanwhile it seems safe to say that but for the efforts of THE TIMES there Would have been no progress made toward the enforcement of the law either against the elevated railroad or against the cumberers of the sidewalks.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
