txt The Southern Pacific overland northbound train was stopped last night at 10:15 o'clock by three highwaymen near Riddles , about thirty miles south of Roseburg . Sticks of dynamite were placed on the rail , which disabled the engine by blowing the flanges off the pony trucks . Taking the fireman , two of the highWaymen proceeded through the train , and every car , from the express to the rear Pullman , was searched . Nothing was obtained from the express car , for there was no treasure on board . On the mail car better success was met with , and the Portland , Tacoma , Seattle , and Victoria ( B. C. ) registered sacks were rifled . The ' passengers were also searched . One highwayman took a hasty shot at Conductor Keanney , who was in charge of the train , but no damage resulted . Superintendent Fields of the Southern Pacific , in an hour after learning of the robbery , had two parties on the way to the scene of the crime . A posse of officers was hastily made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pass . The train was delayed several hours , it having been necessary to turn the engine around and go into Roseburg backward . The . robbers passed all who had but ap-pearance of being workingmen , but made others hold up their hands . The Sheriff of Klamath Colinty was on board with a prisoner . The robbers appropriated the Sheriff 's pistol . None of the ladies in the car were molested . The robbers outside exploded sticks of dynamite to intimidate the passengers . After the chief robber had secured his booty , he ordered the engineer to proceed north for one hour . He then " shot out " the headlight , and , firing five additional shots , which were signals to his companions , disappeared in the darkness . It can not be determined yet how much the robbers secured , but it is thought the amount is small . F. Plotner , a Western Union lineman , had $50 or $00 in his pocket , but talked the robber out of searching him .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
