Ring , for the scant salvation ! Toll , for the bonnie souls ,  --  Neighbor and friend and bridegroom , Spinning upon the shoals ! How they will tell the shipwreck When winter shakes the door , Till the children ask , " But the forty ? Did they come back no more ?

IN A LIBRARY . from Poems ( 1890 ) A precious , mouldering pleasure ' t is To meet an antique book , In just the dress his century wore ; A privilege , I think , His venerable hand to take , And warming in our own , A passage back , or two , to make To times when he was young . His quaint opinions to inspect , His knowledge to unfold On what concerns our mutual mind , The literature of old ; What interested scholars most , What competitions ran When Plato was a certainty , And Sophocles a man ; When Sappho was a living girl , And Beatrice wore The gown that Dante deified .

Tankard , or spoon , Earring , or stone , A watch , some ancient brooch To match the grandmamma , Staid sleeping there .

It can not be my spirit , For that was thine before ; I ceded all of dust I knew ,  --  What opulence the more Had I , a humble maiden , Whose farthest of degree Was that she might , Some distant heaven , Dwell timidly with thee ! Dickinson , Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall from Poems ( 1890 ) If you were coming in the fall , I ' d brush the summer by With half a smile and half a spurn , As housewives do a fly . If I could see you in a year , I ' d wind the months in balls , And put them each in separate drawers , Until their time befalls . If only centuries delayed , I ' d count them on my hand , Subtracting till my fingers dropped Into Van Diemen 's land . If certain , when this life was out , That yours and mine should be , I ' d toss it yonder like a rind , And taste eternity .

RENUNCIATION. from Poems ( 1890 ) There came a day at summer 's full Entirely for me ; I thought that such were for the saints , Where revelations be . The sun , as common , went abroad , The flowers , accustomed , blew , As if no soul the solstice passed That maketh all things new . The time was scarce profaned by speech ; The symbol of a word Was needless , as at sacrament The wardrobe of our Lord . Each was to each the sealed church , Permitted to commune this time , Lest we too awkward show At supper of the Lamb . The hours slid fast , as hours will , Clutched tight by greedy hands ; So faces on two decks look back , Bound to opposing lands . And so , when all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's crucifix , We gave no other bond .

Baptized before without the choice , But this time consciously , of grace Unto supremest name , Called to my full , the crescent dropped , Existence 's whole arc filled up With one small diadem . My second rank , too small the first , Crowned , crowing on my father 's breast , A half unconscious queen ; But this time , adequate , erect , With will to choose or to reject , And I choose  --  just a throne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Poems ( 1890 ) ' T was a long parting , but the time For interview had come ; Before the judgment-seat of God , The last and second time These fleshless lovers met , A heaven in a gaze , A heaven of heavens , the privilege Of one another 's eyes . No lifetime set on them , Apparelled as the new Unborn , except they had beheld , Born everlasting now . Was bridal e'er like this ? A paradise , the host , And cherubim and seraphim The most familiar guest . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XVI . APOCALYPSE . from Poems ( 1890 ) I 'm wife ; I 've finished that , That other state ; I 'm Czar , I 'm woman now : It ' s safer so . How odd the girl 's life looks Behind this soft eclipse !

Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) She rose to his requirement , dropped The playthings of her life To take the honorable work Of woman and of wife . If aught she missed in her new day Of amplitude , or awe , Or first prospective , or the gold In using wore away , It lay unmentioned , as the sea Develops pearl and weed , But only to himself is known The fathoms they abide . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XVIII . APOTHEOSIS . from Poems ( 1890 ) Come slowly , Eden !

Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : VI . A SERVICE OF SONG . from Poems ( 1890 ) Some keep the Sabbath going to church ; I keep it staying at home , With a bobolink for a chorister , And an orchard for a dome . Some keep the Sabbath in surplice ; I just wear my wings , And instead of tolling the bell for church , Our little sexton sings . God preaches ,  --  a noted clergyman ,  --  And the sermon is never long ; So instead of getting to heaven at last , I 'm going all along ! Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : VII .

Some vision of the world Cashmere I confidently see ! Or else a peacock 's purple train , Feather by feather , on the plain Fritters itself away ! The dreamy butterflies bestir , Lethargic pools resume the whir Of last year 's sundered tune . From some old fortress on the sun Baronial bees march , one by one , In murmuring platoon ! The robins stand as thick to-day As flakes of snow stood yesterday , On fence and roof and twig . The orchis binds her feather on For her old lover , Don the Sun , Revisiting the bog ! Without commander , countless , still , The regiment of wood and hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ? The children of whose turbaned seas , Or what Circassian land ? Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : IX . THE GRASS . from Poems ( 1890 ) The grass so little has to do ,  --  A sphere of simple green , With only butterflies to brood , And bees to entertain , And stir all day to pretty tunes The breezes fetch along , And hold the sunshine in its lap And bow to everything ; And thread the dews all night , like pearls , And make itself so fine ,  --  A duchess were too common For such a noticing . And even when it dies , to pass In odors so divine , As lowly spices gone to sleep , Or amulets of pine . And then to dwell in sovereign barns , And dream the days away ,  --  The grass so little has to do , I wish I were the hay ! Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : X.

SUMMER SHOWER . from Poems ( 1890 ) A drop fell on the apple tree , Another on the roof ; A half a dozen kissed the eaves , And made the gables laugh . A few went out to help the brook , That went to help the sea . Myself conjectured , Were they pearls , What necklaces could be ! The dust replaced in hoisted roads , The birds jocoser sung ; The sunshine threw his hat away , The orchards spangles hung . The breezes brought dejected lutes , And bathed them in the glee ; The East put out a single flag , And signed the fte away . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XII .

And still within a summer 's night A something so transporting bright , I clap my hands to see ; Then veil my too inspecting face , Lest such a subtle , shimmering grace Flutter too far for me . The wizard-fingers never rest , The purple brook within the breast Still chafes its narrow bed ; Still rears the East her amber flag , Guides still the sun along the crag His caravan of red , Like flowers that heard the tale of dews , But never deemed the dripping prize Awaited their low brows ; Or bees , that thought the summer 's name Some rumor of delirium No summer could for them ; Or Arctic creature , dimly stirred By tropic hint ,  --  some travelled bird Imported to the wood ; Or wind 's bright signal to the ear , Making that homely and severe , Contented , known , before The heaven unexpected came , To lives that thought their worshipping A too presumptuous psalm .

PURPLE CLOVER . from Poems ( 1890 ) There is a flower that bees prefer , And butterflies desire ; To gain the purple democrat The humming-birds aspire . And whatsoever insect pass , A honey bears away Proportioned to his several dearth And her capacity . Her face is rounder than the moon , And ruddier than the gown Of orchis in the pasture , Or rhododendron worn . She doth not wait for June ; Before the world is green Her sturdy little countenance Against the wind is seen , Contending with the grass , Near kinsman to herself , For privilege of sod and sun , Sweet litigants for life . And when the hills are full , And newer fashions blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy .

THE BEE . from Poems ( 1890 ) Like trains of cars on tracks of plush I hear the level bee : A jar across the flowers goes , Their velvet masonry Withstands until the sweet assault Their chivalry consumes , While he , victorious , tilts away To vanquish other blooms . His feet are shod with gauze , His helmet is of gold ; His breast , a single onyx With chrysoprase , inlaid . His labor is a chant , His idleness a tune ; Oh , for a bee 's experience Of clovers and of noon ! Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XVI .

As children caper when they wake , Merry that it is morn , My flowers from a hundred cribs Will peep , and prance again . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XVIII . Angels in the early morning from Poems ( 1890 ) Angels in the early morning May be seen the dews among , Stooping , plucking , smiling , flying : Do the buds to them belong ? Angels when the sun is hottest May be seen the sands among , Stooping , plucking , sighing , flying ; Parched the flowers they bear along . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XIX .

For whom I robbed the dingle , For whom betrayed the dell , Many will doubtless ask me , But I shall never tell ! Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XX . TWO WORLDS . from Poems ( 1890 ) It makes no difference abroad , The seasons fit the same , The mornings blossom into noons , And split their pods of flame . Wild-flowers kindle in the woods , The brooks brag all the day ; No blackbird bates his jargoning For passing Calvary . Auto-da-f and judgment Are nothing to the bee ; His separation from his rose To him seems misery . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXI . THE MOUNTAIN . from Poems ( 1890 ) The mountain sat upon the plain In his eternal chair , His observation omnifold , His inquest everywhere . The seasons prayed around his knees , Like children round a sire : Grandfather of the days is he , Of dawn the ancestor . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXII . A DAY . from Poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose ,  --  A ribbon at a time . The steeples swam in amethyst , The news like squirrels ran . The hills untied their bonnets , The bobolinks begun . Then I said softly to myself , " That must have been the sun ! " But how he set , I know not . There seemed a purple stile Which little yellow boys and girls Were climbing all the while Till when they reached the other side , A dominie in gray Put gently up the evening bars , And led the flock away . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXIII . The butterfly 's assumption-gown from Poems ( 1890 ) The butterfly 's assumption-gown , In chrysoprase apartments hung , This afternoon put on .

When winds go round and round in bands , And thrum upon the door , And birds take places overhead , To bear them orchestra , I crave him grace , of summer boughs , If such an outcast be , He never heard that fleshless chant Rise solemn in the tree , As if some caravan of sound On deserts , in the sky , Had broken rank , Then knit , and passed In seamless company . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXV . DEATH AND LIFE . from Poems ( 1890 ) Apparently with no surprise To any happy flower , The frost beheads it at its play In accidental power . The blond assassin passes on , The sun proceeds unmoved To measure off another day For an approving God . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXVI .

These are the days when skies put on The old , old sophistries of June ,  --  A blue and gold mistake . Oh , fraud that can not cheat the bee , Almost thy plausibility Induces my belief , Till ranks of seeds their witness bear , And softly through the altered air Hurries a timid leaf ! Oh , sacrament of summer days , Oh , last communion in the haze , Permit a child to join , Thy sacred emblems to partake , Thy consecrated bread to break , Taste thine immortal wine !

BECLOUDED. from Poems ( 1890 ) The sky is low , the clouds are mean , A travelling flake of snow Across a barn or through a rut Debates if it will go . A narrow wind complains all day How some one treated him ; Nature , like us , is sometimes caught Without her diadem . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXX . THE HEMLOCK. from Poems ( 1890 ) I think the hemlock likes to stand Upon a marge of snow ; It suits his own austerity , And satisfies an awe That men must slake in wilderness , Or in the desert cloy ,  --  An instinct for the hoar , the bald , Lapland 's necessity . The hemlock 's nature thrives on cold ; The gnash of northern winds Is sweetest nutriment to him , His best Norwegian wines . To satin races he is nought ; But children on the Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXXI . There 's a certain slant of light from Poems ( 1890 ) There 's a certain slant of light , On winter afternoons , That oppresses , like the weight Of cathedral tunes . Heavenly hurt it gives us ; We can find no scar , But internal difference Where the meanings are . None may teach it anything , ' T is the seal , despair ,  --  An imperial affliction Sent us of the air . When it comes , the landscape listens , Shadows hold their breath ; When it goes , ' t is like the distance On the look of death . IV . TIME AND ETERNITY . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : I. One dignity delays for all from Poems ( 1890 ) One dignity delays for all , One mitred afternoon . None can avoid this purple , None evade this crown . Coach it insures , and footmen , Chamber and state and throng ; Bells , also , in the village , As we ride grand along . What dignified attendants , What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred hats they raise ! How pomp surpassing ermine . When simple you and I Present our meek escutcheon , And claim the rank to die ! Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : II . TOO LATE . from Poems ( 1890 ) Delayed till she had ceased to know , Delayed till in its vest of snow Her loving bosom lay . An hour behind the fleeting breath , Later by just an hour than death , Oh , lagging yesterday ! Could she have guessed that it would be ; Could but a crier of the glee Have climbed the distant hill ; Had not the bliss so slow a pace ,  --  Who knows but this surrendered face Were undefeated still ? Oh , if there may departing be Any forgot by victory In her imperial round , Show them this meek apparelled thing , That could not stop to be a king , Doubtful if it be crowned !

Safe in their alabaster chambers from Poems ( 1890 ) Safe in their alabaster chambers , Untouched by morning and untouched by noon , Sleep the meek members of the resurrection , Rafter of satin , and roof of stone . Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine ; Babbles the bee in a stolid ear ; Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence ,  --  Ah , what sagacity perished here ! Grand go the years in the crescent above them ; Worlds scoop their arcs , and firmaments row , Diadems drop and Doges surrender , Soundless as dots on a disk of snow . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : V.

The birds rose smiling in their nests , The gales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes On whom the summer shone ! The quiet nonchalance of death No daybreak can bestir ; The slow archangel 's syllables Must awaken her . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : VI . FROM THE CHRYSALIS . from Poems ( 1890 ) My cocoon tightens , colors tease , I 'm feeling for the air ; A dim capacity for wings Degrades the dress I wear . A power of butterfly must be The aptitude to fly , Meadows of majesty concedes And easy sweeps of sky . So I must baffle at the hint And cipher at the sign , And make much blunder , if at last I take the clew divine . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : VII . SETTING SAIL . from Poems ( 1890 ) Exultation is the going Of an inland soul to sea ,  --  Past the houses , past the headlands , Into deep eternity ! Bred as we , among the mountains , Can the sailor understand The divine intoxication Of the first league out from land ? Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : VIII .

A train went through a burial gate from Poems ( 1890 ) A train went through a burial gate , A bird broke forth and sang , And trilled , and quivered , and shook his throat Till all the churchyard rang ; And then adjusted his little notes , And bowed and sang again . Doubtless , he thought it meet of him To say good-by to men . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : X. I died for beauty , but was scarce from Poems ( 1890 ) I died for beauty , but was scarce Adjusted in the tomb , When one who died for truth was lain In an adjoining room . He questioned softly why I failed ? " For beauty , " I replied . " And I for truth ,  --  the two are one ; We brethren are , " he said . And so , as kinsmen met a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached our lips , And covered up our names . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XI . " TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS . " from Poems ( 1890 ) How many times these low feet staggered , Only the soldered mouth can tell ; Try ! can you stir the awful rivet ? Try ! can you lift the hasps of steel ? Stroke the cool forehead , hot so often , Lift , if you can , the listless hair ; Handle the adamantine fingers Never a thimble more shall wear . Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window ; Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane ; Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling  --  Indolent housewife , in daisies lain ! Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XII . REAL . from Poems ( 1890 ) I like a look of agony , Because I know it 's true ; Men do not sham convulsion , Nor simulate a throe . The eyes glaze once , and that is death . Impossible to feign The beads upon the forehead By homely anguish strung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . from Poems ( 1890 ) That short , potential stir That each can make but once , That bustle so illustrious ' T is almost consequence , Is the clat of death .

I went to thank her from Poems ( 1890 ) I went to thank her , But she slept ; Her bed a funnelled stone , With nosegays at the head and foot , That travellers had thrown , Who went to thank her ; But she slept .

Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XVI . REFUGE . from Poems ( 1890 ) The clouds their backs together laid , The north begun to push , The forests galloped till they fell , The lightning skipped like mice ; The thunder crumbled like a stuff  --  How good to be safe in tombs , Where nature 's temper can not reach , Nor vengeance ever comes ! Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XVII . I never saw a moor from Poems ( 1890 ) I never saw a moor , I never saw the sea ; Yet know I how the heather looks , And what a wave must be . I never spoke with God , Nor visited in heaven ; Yet certain am I of the spot As if the chart were given . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XVIII .

To know just how he suffered would be dear from Poems ( 1890 ) To know just how he suffered would be dear ; To know if any human eyes were near To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze , Until it settled firm on Paradise . To know if he was patient , part content , Was dying as he thought , or different ; Was it a pleasant day to die , And did the sunshine face his way ? What was his furthest mind , of home , or God , Or what the distant say At news that he ceased human nature On such a day ? And wishes , had he any ? Just his sigh , accented , Had been legible to me . And was he confident until Ill fluttered out in everlasting well ? And if he spoke , what name was best , What first , What one broke off with At the drowsiest ? Was he afraid , or tranquil ? Might he know How conscious consciousness could grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , Meet  --  and the junction be Eternity ? Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XX . The last night that she lived from Poems ( 1890 ) The last night that she lived , It was a common night , Except the dying ; this to us Made nature different . We noticed smallest things ,  --  Things overlooked before , By this great light upon our minds Italicized , as ' t were . That others could exist While she must finish quite , A jealousy for her arose So nearly infinite . We waited while she passed ; It was a narrow time , Too jostled were our souls to speak , At length the notice came . She mentioned , and forgot ; Then lightly as a reed Bent to the water , shivered scarce , Consented , and was dead . And we , we placed the hair , And drew the head erect ; And then an awful leisure was , Our faith to regulate . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXI .

Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXII .

Afraid ? Of whom am I afraid ? from Poems ( 1890 ) Afraid ? Of whom am I afraid ? Not death ; for who is he ? The porter of my father 's lodge As much abasheth me . Of life ? ' T were odd I fear a thing That comprehendeth me In one or more existences At Deity 's decree . Of resurrection ? Is the east Afraid to trust the morn With her fastidious forehead ? As soon impeach my crown ! Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXV . DYING . from Poems ( 1890 ) The sun kept setting , setting still ; No hue of afternoon Upon the village I perceived ,  --  From house to house ' t was noon .

The stray ships passing spied a face Upon the waters borne , With eyes in death still begging raised , And hands beseeching thrown . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXVII . THE CHARIOT . from Poems ( 1890 ) Because I could not stop for Death , He kindly stopped for me ; The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality . We slowly drove , he knew no haste , And I had put away My labor , and my leisure too , For his civility . We passed the school where children played , Their lessons scarcely done ; We passed the fields of gazing grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house that seemed A swelling of the ground ; The roof was scarcely visible .

She went as quiet as the dew from Poems ( 1890 ) She went as quiet as the dew From a familiar flower . Not like the dew did she return At the accustomed hour !

To-day her only boy Went up from the Potomac , His face all victory , To look at her ; how slowly The seasons must have turned Till bullets clipt an angle , And he passed quickly round ! If pride shall be in Paradise I never can decide ; Of their imperial conduct , No person testified . But proud in apparition , That woman and her boy Pass back and forth before my brain , As ever in the sky . Dickinson , Emily , 1830-1886 : XXXIV .
