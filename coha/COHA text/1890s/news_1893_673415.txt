txt A few months ago Mr. Richard Croker , the Tammany Hall leader , said he did not believe it was good policy to have business men at the heads of departments unless they were prepared to devote their entire time to the discharge of duties devolving on the heads of departments . He was of the opinion , by way of illustration , that the head of a department could not discharge his official duties efficiently in case he devoted a few hours of the day to department duties and the remainder to business enterprises . When Mr. Croker made that declaration he did not have in his mind 's eye the business enterprises of District Leader-Police Commissioner Sheehan . If Mr. Croker gave the district leader any thought , he probably was of the opinion that all the energies of the Police Commissioner imported from Buffalo were devoted to duties devolving upon him as a member of the Police Board , for such is the impression Mr. Sheehan has endeavored to create . Mr. Sheehan is a man of larger capacity for business than Mr. Croker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man from Buffalo assumes as occasion requires : POLICE COMMISSIONER , John C. Sheehan .

In Long Island City there is a body of officials known as the General Improvement Commission . This commission was created by the last Legislature , ostensibly for the purpose of improving the streets of Long Island City , but really for the purpose of spending $1,500,000 . One of the members of this commission is William H. Williams , an official who is spoken of in Long Island City almost reverentially as the brother of Police Inspector Williams of this city . When the General Improvement Commission bill was passed at Albany , partly through the aid of " Blue-eyed Billy " Sheehan of Buffalo , some of the politicians at this end of the line took out their notebooks and made an entry to the effect that $1,500,000 was to be expended in Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader Sheehan made an entry in his notebook , to remind him later that Police Inspector Williams 's brother was a , member of the commission . All things come to him who does not wait . District Leader - Police Commissioner Sheehan of New-York has been awarded a contract to build a mile of brick sewer in Long Island City , for which he is to receive $92,764 . The work was given out by the General Improvement Commission of the city , created by the last Legislature to spend $1,500,000 improving the city 's streets . This is the commission 's first contract . There were only two bidders for the work , the restrictions requiring contractors to put up with their bids a certified check for 5 per cent . of the amount of their bid . barring out all local contractors but one firm , Smith &; Burden . The amount of their bid was $125,807.05 . The contract calls for the construction of the sewer complete . The engineer estimates that at least 10.000 cubic yards of rock will have to be excavated . The sewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city to the East River . It will be composed of three sections . One section will be a half circle in form , averaging 7 feet in height . The other two sections will be egg-shaped , and will be , on the average , 5 feet and 21/2 feet high , respectively . The boo is to be completed in 200 working days . When the bids were rendered the bidders were required to name their bondsmen . District Leader-Police Commissioner-Contractor Sheehan named three sureties . They appeared yesterday afternoon before Corporation Counsel William E. Stewart of Long Island City , who is the counsel to the Improvement Commission , and were examined as to their qualifications to serve as bondsmen . Counselor Stewart said last night that he could not tell the names of the bondsmen as he had not decided which two of the three he would accept . The bond is to be executed this morning at the office of the commission , 44 Jackson Avenue . Harris Avenue . which is the line of the proposed work , runs through a barren section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hills . It is a sparselysettled district . Houses are scattered hit or miss along the avenue . At the extreme end is a little colony known locally as Dutch Kills . District Leader-Police Commissioner-Contractor Sheehan is supposed to have mastered all the details of contract work when he was Secretary to the Board of Aqueduct Commissioners . The story of how District-Leader-Police Commissioner John C. Sheehan was brought from Buffalo and appointed Secretary of the Board of Aqueduct Commissioners in the place of James W. McCulloh , and the purposes for which he was put into that office , were related yesterday by a gentleman who is conversant with the facts . " Mr. McCulloh , " said the gentleman , " was Secretary of the Aqueduct Commission in 1885 , and among the duties that were assigned to him by the Commissioners , one was to audit all bills , vouchers , and estimates that the Commissioners certified to the Controller for payment . At that time the Aqueduct Commissioners were Mayor William it . Grace , Controller E. V. Loew , Commissioner of Public Works Rollin M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. C. Baldwin . " Mr. McCulloh was a very careful auditor , and was not satisfied with merely seeing that the accounts , as sent in , were correctly made out , but insisted on satisfying himself as to Whether the work for which the bills were Bent in had been done according to contract . O'Brien &; Clark were heavy contractors for aqueduct work . Mr. McCulloh believed that the chief engineer , Benjamin S. Church , was making allowances to the contractors that were beyond the limits of the contracts , and so he declined to certify to some of his estimates . The measurements were sent in by the division engineers , and from these the chief engineer made his estimates for the work done during the month . Mr. McCulloh refused to certify to certain estimates , and his removal was planned . " The Commissioners , however , stood by Mr. McCulloh , and refused to remove him at the instance of Mr. O'Brien , but that gentleman remarked : ' I 'll get his head yet . ' Hubert 0 . Thompson warned Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friends thereupon decided to have at least some of the Commissioners removed . Mr. O'Brien went to Albany , where he made a deal with ' BlueEyed Billy ' Sheehan in the Assembly to manage the Democratic members , and with Gen. Husted to manage the Republicans , so as to amend the law creating the Aqueduct Commission . On May 13 , 1886 a bill was passed changing the commission by dropping two members and authorizing the Governor to appoint three citizen Commissioners . " Under this law Gov . Hill appointed Edgar L. Ridgway , Oliver W. Barnes , and Hamilton Fish , Jr . Later . Mr. Fish testifiled before the Fassett committee that he had been put there to take care of his party . He said that O'Brien had come to him and told him that if he ( Fish ) would manage his party he would get the Commissioners ' patronage for Westchester . Barnes was selected ostensibly because he was an engineer , but he had been associated with O'Brien in railway contracts , and Ridgeway was a tool- of Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The O'Brien party now had three men out of a board of seven Commissioners , and they needed one more . Rollin M. Squire wo.s then under charges by the Mayor , who had asked the Governor for his removal . He said later on that if he had not done what they wanted Gov . Hill would have removed him , and that he had voted for the removal of Mr. McCulloh because self-preservation was the first law of nature . " The removal of Mr. McCulloh was accomplished on the ground that he lived in New-Jersey , and so he had to make way for John C. Sheehan , who was then a resident of Buffalo . Mr. Sheehan undertook the duties of the office without any knowledge or experience . " How did he do his work ? He simply did not do it as it should have been done , but , immediately on entering his office , proceeded to make it a headquarters for political henchmen . For some time he kept up a show of doing careful work , and then he went and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . " He had full swing in the office , and the excessive allowances began at once . He had under him an Auditor Lully , a special protege of Gov . Hill who is now Secretary of the commission . Mr. Lully was formerly a clerk for O'Brien 's Democratic Committee . His auditing consisted of seeing that the accounts were correctly footed up . " This sort of thing went on until they piled up their excessive allowances that have brought all these suits against the city . Mr. Sheehan 's other duties were to keep a correct record of the proceedings of the meetings of the board . The law requires that all such records be attested by the Secretary . Mr. Sheehan had a young stenographer who kept the minutes ostensibly under his direction . For twelve months , however , the minutes were not entered into the record book nor signed by Mr. Sheehan . They were simply printed on slips which were supplied to the Commissioners at the meetin " s of the board . While it was very convenient for the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting before him , such slips would not be available as evidence should the records of the board have to be produced in court .
