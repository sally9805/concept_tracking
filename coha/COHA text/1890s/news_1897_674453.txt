txt Mr. Dingley has very earnestly argued in justification of the rates of the new Tariff bill , but his committee has been so far affected by the criticism upon the proposition to tax scientific books and apparatus that he has restored them to the free list . In amendments agreed upon in committee to-day what is called a " broadening " of the bill was made by permitting the free importation , under bond , of works of art intended for free exhibition . Mr. DingleY 's justification of the tax on scientific books was that American works on the same subjects as the foreign works could be obtained here , and the tax would constrain those who wanted them to prefer the American books . In compliance with the protests of the fruit importers the paragraph relating to pineapples , which were made dutiable at 2 cents a pound , has been changed so as to permit pineapples In barrels or other packages to be made dutiable at 6 cents per cubic foot . When imported in bulk , the duty will be 6 cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made dutiable at 3 cents a pound . The reasons for permitting the back track to be taken do not appear to opponents of the bill to be so impressive as the fact that the bill has been abandoned in any measure . Not only has the Ways and Means Committee heard the protests of Republicans out of the Congress , but they have about come to the conclusion that the Senate may just as well be taken into account now as later on . The possible majority for the Tariff bill In the Senate is not large . It must be made up in part with the Senators from States that do not demand a very high tariff . The defection of a few Senators on account of the lumber rates would be very awkward . A Republican who to-day spoke of the objections to the increase of lumber rates said that all the Senators who came from States that have been stripped of their lumber will vote for a lower rate than $2 , while those who still have plenty of standing timber to cut will insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the bill will never be stronger than its weakest part , it is regarded as inevitable that the lumber rate will have to be broken in two . It will be some time before the public Will have a complete comparison of the rates of duty in the existing tariff and those proposed by the Dingley bill , according to Representative Millen . He said tonight that he considered himself reasonably expert with figures , and that it had been hitherto a very easy task for him to get at the rates proposed in a tariff bill . He was disposed to think that it was almost impossible to make a comparison with the existing tariff and that which the Ways and Means Committee proposes . As for the table of comparisons issued by the committee , he did not regard that as instructive . So far as he has examined it , it seemed to be merely an attempt to deceive . Representative Belden , who is only looking at the situation from the standpoint of the practical man who desires to have something done at once if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go through the House smoothly , but he looks for some obstruction in the Senate . Ex-Senator Hiscock , who is here , supposedly in some interest to be protected , has not confided to Mr. Belden the precise natconfided to Mr. Belden the precise nature ure of his errand.
