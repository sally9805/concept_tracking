txt Gen. MacArthur 's division crossed the Rio Grande to-day and advanced on Apalit , completely routing the flower of the rebel army . Most of the rebels fled to Apalit Station , where two trains were waiting them . They left hurriedly , presumably or San Fernando . The towns of San Vinente and Apalit were simultaneously burned and evacuated by the natives . Twenty prisoners were captured , including a Spaniard . The American troops also captured a Maxim gun , a brass cannon , and a quantity of arms and ammunition . The fighting lasted from noon until 4 o'clock . The American loss was one man of the Montana Regiment killed and three officers and six men wounded . The enemy were very strongly intrenched on the river bank , near both sides of the railroad bridge . Gen , Wheaton sent Col. Funston across with two companies of the Twentieth Kansas Regiment , a couple df privates swimming the swift stream with a rope under a galling fire for the purpose of guiding the raft . The men crossed in squads of twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuttled like rabbits Into covered ways and trenches . The rest of the regiment was compelled to cross the bridge in single file along the stringers . All the woodwork and much of the iron work had been removed . The First Montana Regiment followed the Kan , sans across the bridge . The First Nebraska Regiment , acting as a reserve , attacked the rebels in three lines of trenches , driving them out , killing sixteen and wounding many . In the meantime a large body of Filipinos , estimated at no fewer than 3,000 , led by Gen. Antonio Luna on a black charger , appeared in the open field about two miles to the left , evidently coming to reinforce the rebels who were engaged with the Nebraskans . Emerging from the jungle , the enemy:formed an open skirmish line . nearly two miles in length , with very thick reserves behind . They then advanged at double quick . until they were P , bout 2,000 yards from the American line , When Gen. Wheaton ordered his troops to fire . The rebels , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broke and ran in the direction of Macabele . The other Filipinos fled toward Apalit station . The heat in the early part of the afternoon was terrific , but a drenching thunder storm , which came later , greatly refreshed the Americans . Gen. Lawton 's advance has been a remarkable demonstration of the resistless energy which characterizes all his undertakings . The last troops forming his column only reached Norzagaray to-day . The men were badly played out , as during the last two days they have dragged bullock carts over roadless jungles and through swamps , cutting their own way for miles . They will rest three days . and then , with Col. Summers 's command , consisting of the Oregon and Minnesota Regiments , the troops will resume the march westward to co-operate with Gen. MacArthur 's forces . The ambulances to-day , with a strong escort , are bringing Gen. Lawton 's wounded and a few of those who have been prostrated by the heat across the country to the railroad . A report has gained wide currency among the volunteers that the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is captured . and that it is the intention to replace them at the front with regulars , who are being brought here on board transports .
