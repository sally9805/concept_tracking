txt " Anarchy as a Fine Art in Brooklyn " was the subject of the Rev. A. C. Dixon'il prelude in the Hanson Place Baptist Church yesterday . He said , among other things : The news that President Carnot of France was killed by the dagger of an Anarchist has filled us all with horror . Anarchy is rebellion against all law . Anarchists hate with meal intensity Czar and President , King and Governor and Judge-indeed , anybody who refuses to believe in his creed of lawlessness . The Anarchist is a savage in a civilized country , who is trying to turn civilization into barbarism . His watchword is liberty , the freedom of the individual , the right for every man , woman , and child to do just as his taste , his inclination , passions , and selfinterest may dictate , recognizing no higher law than himself . The Anarchist sacrifices his right to live under a Government that he inveighs against . As long as it is nothing but talk , he may be tilerated , but when he puts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , must send hint to the gallows , the chair , or the guillotine . Anarchy must be destroyed , or Clovernment is destroyed . The hideous face of anarchy we turn away from with horror . Nobody believes in the kind that Santo practiced and Herr Moet preaches and a little body of bloodthirsty , lawless men advocate in this country . They . have very few followers . But there is a. kind of anarchy which has become rather popular  --  the anarchy of persistently refusing to obey law . In principle , it is the same as the other . It deflee the stated authority of the State , and Says we will do as we please . In principle , there is not one whit of difference between the position of the extreme Anarchist and the liquor Interest of this city , which has decided that it will not obey law . They are Anarchists in principle and practice . Of course , they do not use the steel dagger , but the more refined stiletto of the vote , and they are ready to Stab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is anarchy reduced to a fine art . The hideous face of the thing we hate is covered over by the claim that it is a model Government . There is no effort in this city to enforce the excise law , so tar as it refers to closing sa. loons on Sunday . There is a little effort to enforce it against selling to minors . But it is a. part of the policy to cover over the hideous thing you call anarchy with popular phrases . Liberty is written over it  --  the right to do just as you please  --  we are free Americans . The fact is , lawlessness in Brooklyn is now ; the unwritten law which law-abiding citizens1 must obey without a protest , or be put down a ' unmitigated cranks , fanatical fools , that ought to be labeled , tarred , feathered , and sent out of town . The hideousness of this anarchy , Dr. Dixon said , in conclusion , is covered over with respectable phrases , and what is needed is to tear off the mask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
