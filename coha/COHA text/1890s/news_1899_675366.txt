txt The Rev. Dr. Newell Dwight Millis , in his sermon in Plymouth Church , Brooklyn , last evening , conceded that Christian Science , faith and mind cure were half truths . He cautioned the members of his congregation , however , not to fail to call in a physician should'oany member of their families fall ill . Dr. Hillis based his advice upon the following , which formed the text of his sermon : " The Lord bath created medicines out of the earth , and he that is wise will not abhor them , My son , in thy sickness be not negligent , but pray unto the Lord and He will make thee whole . Leave off from sin and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness . Then give place to the physician , for the Lord hath created him . Let him not go from thee , for thou hast need of him . There is a time when in their hands there is good success . For they shall also pray unto tee Lord that He would prosper that which they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xxxviii. , 4 . The theme of Dr. Hillis 's sermon was the question , " What are the half truths , and what are the whole truths of faith cure , mind cure , and science cure ? " In referring to Spiritualism and its teachings , Dr. Hillis surprised and somewhat startled his congregation by declaring : " Sometimes I believe it and sometimes I do n't ; to be frank with you , my friends , I do n't know whether I believe it or not . " Dr. Hillis described the wonderful structure of the human frame , and said that the human being was intended for a life of 100 years , and that none should die at an earlier age than 90 years . " By our failure to care properly for our bodies , " he said , " one-fifth ' of the human race has to support the other four-fifths . " Continuing , Dr. Hillis said : " The books of such persons as Dresser , Wood , Eddy , Hazard , Marston , Grimke , all represent practically the same thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of those who are interested in the school of science are persons of great refinement , of the highest intellectuality , of disposition most amiable and beautiful . Many of the ideas taught by such writers as Henry Wood and Mrs. Eddy are full of sweetness and light . These writers have seized upon important Christian truths that some other students have neglected , and have used them so as to fill the life with gentle trust and serene hope . " Yet , in praising and fully accepting the Christian element in the ' science ' teaching , it does not follow that we must accept its philosophy , that flies in the face of every scholar renewed as chemist or physicist or philosopher . The genius of the system is that ' mortal errors , ' misnamed mind , ' produce all diseases ; that mind alone suffers ; that the body can no more feel a pain than can an iron wheel or a piece of granite ; that when the mortal senses say ' we are sick ' . God says the real man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cure is the discovery made by- , a- , sichserson that he is well ; that food neither ' Strengthens the body nor weakens it : that strength comes from the mind ; that diet ; exercise , bathing ? and rubbing have no effect upon the health , but that subtle mental practices can dechemicalize disease ; that every appalent instance of disease and suffering is a figment of the mind , and that health and happiness alone exist did man but know it . " Many of those who hold this philosophy are bringing their children up in a way that is very beautiful . They teach their babes that there is no such thing as fear , either in the darkness or in the daylight . They rear them without medicine , and without any thought of disease or accident . So long as the parents are prosperous and can shield the child , and so long as the child succeeds in escaping accident or maiming , all is well . but the day ' of shock and revelation is inevitable , when these children will enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or legs , and 50.000 brakemen who in the last twenty-five years have lost hands or arms . Nevertheless many of the science cures and the mind cures are real cures ; they are also manifold in number and important in nature . " It follows that in these cases the removal of fear , anxiety , and remorse has ' been followed by a return of nerve force  --  a fact that opens up a vast field for mental therapeutics ; but , having affirmed the influence of the emotions as curative agents , it remains for us to note their limitations . In at least three realms mind cure and faith cure have never availed for any influence whatever : " First  --  Every form of science cure fails in times of extreme accident through maiming by electric cars or railway collisions . No finger has ever been restored ; no organ or.ce lost has been recovered , " Second  --  Insanity through accidents has never been cured . During the late war a soldier 's skull was injured by an explosive shell . For several years he wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case lifted a piece of the skull . The moment the pressure was removed , intelligence flashed into the eye . and the man exclaimed : ' Yesterday we were at the battle of Manassas . Where are we to-day ? ' " Third  --  The mind cure and the faith cure avail not for changing the nature or interfering with the effects of drugs or foods . The authoress of ' Science and Health ' affirms exricity that the influence of foods and drugs is determined , by the prevalent belief regarding them . If the human race ccrne to believe that alcohol is a food . a mild and delicious beverage , rich in nourishment , we are told that alcol , n1 would probably become the customary nourishment for infants . and that , if the race should come to believe that milk is intoxicating , pledges would have to be circalated against the use of milk as an intoxicating beverage . Experience has proved this idea to be both foolish and false , and with the fall of this principle fall more structures based thereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Providence , reason asks , Is there a rational ground for these great truths ? Through overworking and overeating many have incurred physical ailments , and through lack of foresight and thrift many have incurred want and trouble . For such persons to run to God with their troubles as a method of saving doctors ' bills and avoiding the consequences of sin makes prayer almost contemptible , makes the praying man one who pesters God with small matters and runs to Him as one runs to a storehouse or a granary . In such cases prayer would seem to be of the nature of a premium upon self-indulgence . " But prayer is not the asking of a beggar . On its highest side prayer has a thousand noble uses . It is the soul in its luminous hours , in its Kegn ant moods , pouring forth its finest thoughts . its most refined emotions . its deepest and sweetest penitence , its highest hopes and aspirations in the presence of its Divine friend . As some child approaches an all-loving mother or father , as the aspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some eager student pours out his heart to some wise and worthy teacher , so the soul pours out i its deepest thoughts , its finest feelings , unto Him who is kinder than the kindest , nobler than the noblest , friendlier than the friendliest.
