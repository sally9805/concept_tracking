txt It is simply not possible to describe as a civilized community any community in which a man can be taken by a mob and publicly burned to death without protest on the part of anybody . It does not in the least matter what the crime is-or which the victim of such an outrage is accused . It can not possibly be more brutal and barbarous than the crime which is thus Com . mitted upon him . The public roasting to death of a negro in Texarkana , Ark. , may seem to belong to the same order of offenses as the shooting of the Italians at New-Orleans . But really the two acts have nothing in common except their unlawfulness and . the genuineness of the popular indignation that prompted them . The lynching at NewOrleans can not be justified , but it can be excused upon grounds that permit the perpetrators of it to be still regarded . as civilized beings . No such excuse is possible for the lynchers of Texarkana . The wide and crucial differences between the two offenses are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense that they restrained their wrath against men whose blood-guiltiness nobody doubted until the law had been set in operation and had failed to avenge the dead or to protect the , living . The same conspiracy in pursuance of which the murders had been committed had proved powerful enough to paralyze the ordinary machinery of justice . Either the conspirators were to go unpunished , after this terrifying demonstration of their superiority to , the law , or else the citizens to - whom this impunity was intolerable must take the law into their own hands . In the second place , the penalty unlawfully inflicted . upon these criminals was no more severe than that they would have suffered under the law if the law had not broken down . Indeed , to be shot - to death is a more merciful fate than to be choked to death . They were simply done to death in the most expeditious way , without torture or wanton brutality , and . New-Orleans has ever since been a safer place for honest men , and a less safe place for criminals - than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lynchers of New-Orleans that forfeited the good . opinion of their neighbors , or that would disincline a civilized man to associate with them as civilized . men . But can anybody say that of the act of the men who poured oil on their helpless victim and set him on fire . That is a performance that might have occurred in Europe during the Middle Ages , or that might occur in Central Africa at this time , but that could not , we repeat , ocetirin a civilized community . . The story is rendered still more horrible by the fact . that the woman who liad.heen the negro 's victim herself lighted the fire that was to consume him . Among the Pi-Utes or the dwellers in the neighborhood of Lake Tanganyika this Would be regarded as a happy thought and a stroke of poetical justice , but civilized men and civilized Women can regard it only With disgust . It is the settled custom of many Southern communities to make no pretense of abiding the decision of the law upon the particular offense - which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only the " cruel and unusual " mode of inflicting capital punishment without due ' process of law that makes this case conspicuously repulsive . It may be granted that the ? ofFense is one that is especially and with reason dreaded at the South , and one . to which the African race is particularlyprone . That is a reason for visiting it with the utmost penalty of the law . Many Southern States have , in fact , made it capital , hilt without in the least diminishing the activity of the local lynching parties . Assuredly there was no danger that the law would not be executed in this case , or that . the man 's guilt could . not be legally established . If the law of Arkansas is not severe enough , the public sentiment that supports the unlawful infliction of capital punishment would support the lawful infliction of it . Between the two there is in the first place the difference that mobs are much more apt than juries to hang the wrong man ; and , in the second place , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of a barbarous community . In truth , the infliction of capital punishment by a mob , when punishment is provided by law and there is no danger that the law will not be enforced , is not the execution of justice at all . The men who take part in it are actuated by the motives not of ? executioners but of murderers . The notion that society shall put itself upon the level of the criminal , and , when he has been especially cruel and barbarous , shall be especially cruel and barbarous in its turn , is one that ; belongs to a low stage of human development , before self-restraint or any other quality that can rightly be called moral has begun to operate at all . To roast a particularly noxious criminal to death with frightful tortures is , to people in that stage of development , the appropriate disposition to make of him ; and this is the view entertained by the Pi-Utes and . the Central Africans and the inhabitants of Texarkana.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
