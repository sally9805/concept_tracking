txt There is an interesting situation in the Jerseyville school district , and matters in that rural community are so complicated that it will be some time before the honest old farmers and their neighbors will have their minds set at rest . Jerseyville is situated on the road leading from this place to Farmingdale . It is a staid and quiet little hamlet or 200 inhabitants and used to be called Blue Bath The schoolhouse is causing all the trouble . A proposition was raised to enlarge the building and add all the necessary improvements . About two months ago County Superintendent Samuel Lockwood of this place condemned the school building , alleging that it was not fit to keep school in . The Trustees called a meeting to vote on the question of raising funds to erect a new schoolhouse . The meeting was held and the proposition was voted down by a large majority . Afterward some of the residents said that they bad not understood the real object of the meeting and did not know at the time what the were voting for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object of which was fully explained to the satisfaction of the audience . The appropriation was again voted down by a vote of 3t to .33 . When the school authorities condemn a schoolhouse that district can secure no money from the State fund until a new schoolhouse has beer built . The Jerseys ille school district will , therefore , according to the New Jersey statutes , be v.ithont , money to carry on the schools next year .

Last year there were 104 school children in the district and the school money amounted to $656.58 . The matter has stirred up quite a feeling among the residents , and Jerscyvi ile , seldom ruffled by either political or social brawl , is not the place it was two months ago .
