txt The announcement that an iron works in Pennsylvania is building a bridge to facilitate the British advance southward in the Soudan must be interesting , and ought to be gratifying to all American citizens . The British War Office , like every other purchaser , wants its work to be done as well , as cheaply , and as expeditiously as possible . But the British War Office may be supposed to entertain a particular predilection for the work of its own countrymen , and , when it comes to competitive bidding , to lean as heavily as decency will permit in the direction of the British against the foreign bid . In this case the deciding factor is said to have been expedition . In this respect the American bidders were at a geographical disadvantage , as compared with the British . Their handicap can not have been less than a week , when it was a question of manufacturing a bridge " at home , " and setting it up in the Soudan . Yet upon the point of expedition they were able to underbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bridge of a fifth of a mile in length . This is a just occasion of National pride . It is not the first nor the hundredth . In locomotives , in bridges , in all sorts of " manufactures of iron and steel , " American ingenuity , enterprise , pluck , have over and over proved themselves capable of " downing the foreigner " in his own market . But what interests us is why there should be one department of " American manufactures of iron and . steel " which so lags behind the rest that it is all the time demanding that it shall be protected from competition with the foreigner . We refer , of course , to shipbuilding . When ships were manufactures of wood and canvas we entered into the international competition With such effect that American ships had the call over European ships in every port in the world and commanded the highest freight rates . Suddenly shipbuilding was converted from a manufacture of wood to a manufacture of iron and steel . American manufacturers were for a time without doubt put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most departments they have not only entirely recovered from this disadvantage , but they are able to compete in foreign markets . The " protection " which they enjoy under the tariff may be of advantage to them when the question is of making a combination to control the home market and make the simple-minded and longsuffering American citizen pay more than the market price for what he wants . But for any other purpose a protective duty on American manufactures of Iron and steel is as obsolete and superfluous as a protective duty on wheat . The Americans who manufacture iron and steel into ships still hold out . They are protected not only by a differential but by an absolute prohibition . They have absolutely persuaded our good President into extending their monopoly of our own coasting trade to the coastwise trade of Puerto Rico , and also to the trade between that island and this continent . How did they do it ? How did they pull the wool over the eyes of that excellent man ? They have done more and worse than that . Not content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation could controls they have been trying to persuade Congress to pay them money for embarking in the competition in which other manufacturers of iron and steel make money in open competition without help from anybody : What is it that they have to say for themselves ? How do they account for the imbecility that puts them at such a disadvantage with other manufacturers who work upon the same material as themselves ? It would be interesting to know how they justify their application , but they are careful not to address it to the public , but only to Senators in private . But the public would really like to know . If the shipbuilders pretend that they can not do what all the other manufacturers of Iron and steel can do , the public would be apt to tell them that it was time they got out of the business of building ships and left it to locomotive builders and . bridge builders . It might even remind them of the old legal maxim according to which no man was permitted to stultify himself     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
