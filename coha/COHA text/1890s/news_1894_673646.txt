txt The unwillingness of the Reformer to pull the beams from his personal eyes has always been one of his most prominent characteristics . There is a large association of women formed for the express object of compelling men to abandon various practices upon which women look with disfavor . If these women could have their way , the law would forbid men to drink wine , or to smoke cigars , or to put animals to death in the interests of science , or to do a variety of other things which women dislike . While thus sternly opposing all masculine vices , the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union has as yet preserved a profound silence as to that peculiarly feminine vice , excessive indulgence in pasteboard boxes . Alen must , in the estimate of the Temperate Female Christians , be made moral by law , but women are to be allowed to gratify to any extent their unholy thirst for boxes . It may be frankly admitted that there is nothing ? immoral per se in the moderate use of pasteboard boxes . A. woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and yet be a good wife and mother . It is when : the longing for boxes becomes excessive , and the woman weakly yields to it , that . she may properly be classed among the victims of vice . Too many women , alas ! yield to this craving for boxes , with the result that once happy homes are ruined and husbands and children are dragged down into misery and shame . The most common form in which this vice is manifested is in the simple collection of boxes . A large proportion of the purchases that women make when engaged in shopping are sent home in paper boxes , and there are certain articles purchased by men which are also put up in boxes . The good and innocent housewife promptly throws away all these boxes . The woman who has a , depraved thirst for boxes carefully preserves them . In the course of a few months the house becomes full of useless boxes . The husband goes to his closet to reach some article4rthat is on the upper shelf , and suddenly a. hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or he enters the room where what are known among women : - as " moth bundles " are stored ; and finds that the floor is a foot deep in empty boxes . As for the smaller articles of his dress which once he could find the moment he opened his bureau drawers , they have now become hopelessly buried in countless boxes , and in order to find a fresh necktie or a single handkerchief he has to open at least a dozen different boxes . In these circumstances it is hardly to be wondered at that he loses his temper and perhaps gives way to lam. - gnage to which no wife can listen without bursting into tears . If he is more than usually exasperated he may throw a box across the room or even kick it up to the ceiling . , This partially relieves his feelings , but it enables his wife to inform her intimate friends that she is married to a brute and that her home is little better than a. miniature Chicago . ? It is when a husband is required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasteboard boxes that hip heart fully learns its own bitterness . Into a trunk of the capabity of , say , fifty cubic feet he is expected to stogy at least eighty cubic feet of boxes and still leave room for half a dozen dresses and a. vast variety of other k  --  f Which he is told ' Will be utterly ruined if they are . squeezed . In a like situation few men can resist pointing , out that to use a box a foot square and a foot deep for the sole purpose of containing two small handkerchiefs , and that to use six slightly smaller boxes for the accommodation of from two to three hairpins each , is a waste of space . To this suggestion the wife immediately replies by asking if she is to be grudged the possession of a few poor little boxes that never cost her husband a penny , and whether he thinks he is capable of judging what articles are indispensable to the toilet of a decent woman . Naturally there can be no answer made to such remarks , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The unhappy husband contents himself with expressing his views of boxes in general in an undertone , and proceeds to fin the trunk by secretly smashing a box fiat whenever his wife 's back is turned . By this means he sometimes succeeds in finishing the task intrusted to him , but there is a fearful day of reckoning in store for him when his wife comes to open that trunk and discovers the condition of her beloved boxes . There are husbands who can live in a cloud of boxes , so to speak , and still preserve their serenity . Such , however , is not the ordinary husband . Scarcely a day passes that he is not irritated by some impertinent and exasperating box , and the inevitable result is that he becomes embittered and morose , and that his wife goes about the house either in tears or wearing an expression of martyrdom which is even harder to bear than the loudest lamentations and upbraidings would be . It is the opinion of one of the most experienced Judges in Illinois that fully 67 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe their origin to the domestic misery caused by the wife 's addiction to pasteboard boxes . And yet , in the face of facts like these , women band themselves together to compel men to abandon their most pleasant vices , but never Make the slightest effort to reform those of their own sex who have become the victim of the box habit . When women first cast out the pasteboard boxes from their own closets it will be time for them to pluck the cigars and wine bottles from their husbands ' closets . Undoubtedly the reforming women mean ' well , but they have the feminine tendency to see only one side of any question . They have a perfect right to believe - that some men drink and smoke too much and that such men ought to be told that their ways are evil . But before setting out to reform the masculine world the women should first sign a pledge of total abstinence from pasteboard boxes in any and every form , and keep it at least as long as the average man keeps the so-called temperance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
