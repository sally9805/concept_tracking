txt In his admirable proclamation calling for a strict observance and enforcement of the election laws Gov . FLOWER very justly says that these laws " have established almost every possible safeguard around the sanctity of the ballot . " One of the most important of these safeguards is that which limits canvassing boards to the purely ministerial function of making out certificates of election according to the face of the returns made to them . - without any power to change those returns or reject votes , provides for a judicial determination of the question of the validity of votes or returns in case of dispute , and requires the final certificate to conform to that determination . Without this safeguard the results of elections could be easily falsified by dishonest canvassing boards . But in a conspicuous instance in Dutchess County two years ago this safeguard was thrown down and trampled upon , and even the adjudication of the courts was boldly defeated . The chief agent in that outrage is now on the bench of the Court of Appeals by Gov . FLOWER 'S appointment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Exalted place . The Governor says that failure on the part of public officers to discharge their full duty in the complete enforcement of the laws will be considered sufficient cause for their removal . In that case procuring a. violation of the law , and giving it effect by " removing " an election return from a public office where the law required it to be filed , should be considered sufficient cause for keeping the person guilty of such acts off the bench , if not in jaiL Mr. OTTO IRVING WISE comes off worst and most damaged in the three-cornered fight in the Twenty-first District . Re is uninjured in personal character  --  fortunately all three of the candidates are men of good standing  --  but he has been overbeating as a Republican boss , and many of the eminent Republicans of the district , who look upon him as a vulgar little upstart , with wonderfully brusque manners for one so recently come inside the party lines , are going to vote for LEAvrFT . HERRMAN Will lose heavily , it seems , through dissatisfaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine in the district . The Good . Government young men , who are making a house-tohouse canvass for LEAVITT , report a general disposition among the voters to leave the regular party candidates in the lurch and elect the independent candidate . Mr. LEAVITT is a sound Democrat , and by far the ablest and best equipped of the three candidates . He ought to be sent to represent the district . The political storm-centres this morning appear to be over Kings and Erie Counties , at opposite ends of this State , but there are signs of atmospheric disturbance all the way between these two points . If there should be anything akin to a cyclone , its beginnings may be traced from Poughkeepsie in December , 1891 , and its progress may be marked at Albany in February , 1892 ; Syracuse , May , 1892 ; Albany and Buffalo in the Spring of the present year ; Saratoga early in October , and in the striking developments now visible in Kings and Erie Counties . All through this period and over this wide area there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heavens . It is peculiarly the duty of every Democrat who believes in the tariff reform mission of his party to vote to-day against Judge MAYNARD , and in Brooklyn against Mayor BOODy . If the party in this State shall submit to the disgraceful rule of the State machine and the machine , the danger of its overthrow next year will be very great , and with that overthrow the party throughout the Union will be greatly weakened . It is true in this case , as in all like cases , that the good work of the party is deeply endangered when the evil done in the party name is not rebuked . To get the felon boss of Gravesend behind the bars and throw out his polluted election returns should be the aim of Mr. GAYNOR . Every honest voter in Brooklyn should remember that his vote may decide the election of Mayor , and that decides the fate of the ring for the next two years .                  @ @ @
