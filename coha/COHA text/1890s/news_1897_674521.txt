txt The protest of the Austrian Government against an import duty as an offset to an export bounty on sugar is specious , but not , we think , well founded . It pleads a violation of the most-favored nation clause in its treaty with this country . Whether such a duty levied by act of Congress would be a violation of the treaty is a question that has not been clearly decided . Even if it were , the American courts would probably sustain the law and not the treaty . A case involving this point arose under a treaty with Denmark which contained this clause : " No higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the United States of any article the produce or manufacture of the dominions of his Majesty the King of Denmark * * * than are or shall be payable on the like articles , the produce or manufacture of any other foreign country . " Congress , by law , under the treaty with Hawaii , admitted sugar free , and the importers of sugar from Danish possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought suit to recover , pleading the ' clause we have quoted . They lost . the suit on the doctrine , as laid down by Judge Cuwris : " If an act of Congress should levy a duty upon imports which an existing commercial treaty declares shall not be levied , so that this treaty is in conflict with the act , " the later act of Congress " gives the rule of decision in a judicial tribunal of the United States in a case to which one rule or the other must be applied . " It may also be replied to the ' Austrian protest that the action of Congress under the Hawaiian treaty having been in operation for twenty years , and involving precisely the same fundamental difference in the treatment of the two countries , it is too late now to raise this question . But there is another phase of the matter . The import duty to offset an export bounty is not a discrimination against Austria specifically . It applies to the imports from all countries that give the bounty , and in exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other nation acting as Austria acts is treated . Nor can it be fairly said that sugar on which a bounty is paid is put at a disadvantage with that which has received no bounty . On the contrary , the duty puts them on an equality which it was the purpose of the bounty to destroy . Of course , if the duty on sugar were imposed for revenue only , it would be foolish to make it higher because its export to this country had been encouraged by a bounty . The greater the bounty the more would come and the - more revenue we should get . But our duty is imposed largely for the same purpose that the bounty is paid by Austria and other countries  --  to favor the sugar industry , either the growing or the refining . We regard both as very poor business , but it does not lie with Austria to complain because we do in one way exactly what she tries to do in another .                @ @ @ @ @
