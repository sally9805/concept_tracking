txt The whereabouts of the papers in the case of Joseph P. Kearney , a driver employed by Rees &; Rees , dyers of 232 East Fortieth Street , has caused Howell C. Rees any amount of trouble since the first of the month . Kearney was arrested on the charge of stealing $3.40 which he had collected . In the Yorkville Police Court he was held in $500 bail for trial in General Sessions . He was arrested Oct. 31 and examined Nov. 2 . Bail was furnished by William O'Brien , a liquor dealer of 151 West Fifty-third Street . Until yesterday Mr. Rees was unable to get any trace of the papers . They had not been received by the District Attorney . At the Yorkville Police Court he says he was not treated courteously by the court attaches . Justice Grady was sitting in the police court when Kearney was examined . He was followed by Justice Burke . Mr. Rees appeared before Justice Burke yesterday and explained how he had been unable to find the papers . They were not , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smilingly said they probably were not there , as they had never been sent there . Smythe finally divulged that the papers had been sent to the Court of Special Sessions . Why they had been sent there when Kearney was held for General Sessions , he did not explain . The principal witness for Rees &; Rees is a traveling salesman in their employ . Without his testimony they fear conviction could not be had . This man will be obliged to depart for Europe in a few days . The delay in the case , Mr. Rees fears , may defeat justice . Kearney , Mr. Rees intimates , has a friend who has been able to use his influence in his behalf . Clerk Smythe explains that Justice Grady neglected to sign his name somewhere on the papers . This , he says , happens sometimes in the rush of court business .
