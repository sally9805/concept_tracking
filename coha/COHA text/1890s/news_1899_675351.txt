txt The Chronicle will say to-morrow : " Chicago financiers are the moving spirits in a scheme of railroad reorganization and consolidations that is more colossal than any previous project in American history . From private Eastern advices it is learned that the Big Four ' in Ameri- ' earl Steel and Wire interests , John W. Gates , William Edenborn , Isaac L. Elwood , and John Lambert , have joined hands with E. H. Harriman and the other meilibers of the famous Harriman-Gould syndicate in a comprehensive plan of campaign which has for its object the consolidation of the leading trunk railways in America . " The scope of the plan is said to be not merely one of traffic alliances , but the consolidation of actual ownership , in a determined effort to uphold traffic rates independent of the Inter-State Commerce Commission or other Governmental act . It is also said that the magnates of the Steel and Wire Trust have already unloaded or are about to unload their large holdings in American Steel and Wire and Federal Steel securities . " The entry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad reorganization field dates back more than a year , but only within the last few weeks has it become apparent that these men are now the head and front of the railroad syndicate that is reaching out to absorb or consolidate all the weak lines of the Middle West and South . " Shrewd railway men assert that the Chicago financiers are relied upon by the Morgan and Gould interests to bring about ultimate consolidation of the roads with the great Vanderbilt trunk lines . Should the latter be accomplished and the Pennsylvania interests be also merged , the railroad world would be confronted with a stupendous combination controlling one-half of the trunk mileage of the United States .
