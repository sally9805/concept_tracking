txt The suit of Miss Lesbia M. Bostwia against Count Malta Lierven Steingranat of Sweden for $50,000 damages for breach of promise of marriage , ended yesterday the Supreme Court with a verdict for $45.86 . Miss Bostwick is indignant , says the sum awarded to her is ridiCulous , and is anxious to know how it was reached . The 86 cents she regards as a mathematical insult added to a moral injury . She does not believe that any twelve men can figure down the value of a young woman 's affections , aspirations , fond hopes , and tender dreams to the cent , that the lost light of deathless love can be weighed as if it was tallow candles at so much a pound , or that a life 's ambition can be measured and assessed as if it was toweling goods sold by cents and fractions the yard . She indicated yesterday afternoon that she felt like a Blighted Soul Marked Down from $46 to $45.86 . Miss Bostwick lives with her mother at ' 306 West Fifty-sixth Street . She is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a remarkably fine pair of dark eyes . She weighs 1.75 pounds , and was dressed yesterday in black satin , with diamonds at her throat and in her ears , . and a becoming hat adorned with black feathers . The ' defendant is a fine-looking young man , 6 feet and 3 inches high . " When we were introduced , " she sighed , " 1 was told that he was my mate , physically and intellectually . " The Count , however , was not wearing any diamonds yesterday to match Miss Bost-wick 's . He has been in retirement in Ludlow Street jail , and appeared in his last Winter 's suit , looking forlorn , 111-kept , and shabby . It appeared , from Miss Bostwick 's testimony , that she and the Count were introduced by a mutual friend on Friday , Jan. 23 , last . He visited her on Saturday and Sunday , declared his love formally by word of mouth on Monday , and put it in writing on Tuesday . On Feb. 1 he asked and obtained the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . He told Miss Bostwick that his family in Sweden ranked next to that of King Oscar , his father having been Court Chamberlain , and that he was heir to great estates and a large fortune in cash . She calculated from what he told her that , reducing Swedish crowns to dollars , their own income would be $2,000 to $3,000 a year to begin with , but no rent to pay , and a farm of several thousand acres to depend on for market supplies . The Count assured Miss Bostwick that her existence on a limited income would be only for a few years , as he was sole heir to the estates of an uncle who was enormously rich and ninety years old . He planned a magnificent home to be built for her on their estates , and urged a private and immediate marriage by Father Van Rensselaer . Miss Bostwick consented , and bought traveling and Court dresses and other things . The wedding was postponed on one pretext and another , and then the Count borrowed from his promised bride $125 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger brother , who had been robbed . Miss Bostwick says the baleful influence of this younger brother , whom she now knows to be clerk in a grocery store in One Hundred and Thirty-sixth Street , broke off the match . She is convinced that the Count was persuaded by this brother that she wt s not rich enough . The brother himself had ambitions . The Count broke off the engagement in April . In court yesterday he gave several reasons for this . One was that Miss Bostwick asked too many personal questions , and another that a man named Padden had told him he would have to pay $20.000 before he could be married in ' this country . Miss Bostwick heard he intended to run away to Sweden , and employed a detective who hired messenger boys and others to chase him around on bicycles . In the absence of his rich uncle , he complained to a Police Magistrate and his pursuers were fined , paid their fines , and immediately mounted their wheels and proceeded to pursue him as diligently as before .

And I love him , too . It 's all the fault of that brother of his . I think that jury must have been crazy , do n't you ? I expected at the very least $5,000 . Of course the Count could n't pay anything , but his family would have paid it and I could have gotten a judgment here and carried it to Sweden against him . I know he has property there . " You may say I am not at all pleased with the verdict . I think it is ridiculous . No . I do n't suppose we will do anything more about it . I never did get my $125 back . What do you suppose that jury was thinking about ? I believe it was because the Count looked so shabby and miserable . He did that on purpose . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose her was as much punishment as a man should be required to endure . " That was said all around the court , " replied Miss Bostwick , smiling with some complacency ; " everybody said the Count must be crazy not to marry such a flnelooking girt when he could . " Count Steingranat will probably remain in jail pending the payment of the $45.86 and costs . His brother says he has tried f0 pay Miss Bostwick the $125 borrowed of her , but could not find her at home Miss Bostwick denies this , and says she thinks the Count should be prosecuted criminally for obtaining the money under promise of marriage . A member of the jury says the estimates of the damage done to Miss Bostwick 's affections ranged from 6 cents to $250 . The jurors added their estimates together , and by the simple process of dividing the total by twelve . reached the average opinion , which was $4,1.86 . That amount was therefore made the verdict . It was suggested that even money would look better , but no juror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOY 'S LIFE . Charles B. Morris Sued the Metropolitan Street Railway Company for $25,000 .
