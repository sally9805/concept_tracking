txt We published yesterday a dispatch from Helena , Mon. , saying that brewers in Germany had made contracts for the ex , portation of 2,500,000 bushels of barley from Montana to Germany in the coming season . It appears , therefore , that American growers of barley are able to Under , sell their competitors from all other countries in that foreign market , without the assistance of any tariff duty whatever . And yet they and their representative 's in Congress complain that our present duty of 30 per cent . on foreign barley is not sufficient to protect them here at home against an incoming " flbod " of the very barley from abroad which is unable to compete successfully with their own in Germany and Great Britain on even terms . In the fiscal year 1894 the exports of barley from the United States were 5,219,405 bushels , while the imports *ere 791,061 bushels .

At the sable time , however , large quantities of American barley were being exported to England , and British Columbia was taking barley grown on this side of the line . It may be recalled that we import soft deal on the Pacific coast from British Columbia and . export similar coal across the lower lakes into Canada . Sufficient attention has not been paid , in connection - with tariff discussion , to the official returns relating to exports . As a rule , it is true that a domestic industry , whether it be the growing of barley or the manufacture of nails or some one of many others that might be mentioned , which exports a large quantity of its product and sells the Barrie in European markets , can not make out a good case , even from the protectionist point of view , in support of a demand for a tariff duty to Protect it against foreign competition here at home . Large exports are in themselves a sufficient answer , for if the industry can undersell foreign competitors abroad without protection , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the : ame foreign competitors in its home market without the aid of a tariff handicap upon them .
