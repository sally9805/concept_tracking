txt There are indications that the men who have been elected to seats in the next Senate will be invited to assume active duty very soon after March 4 in an extra session of the Senate . Secretary of State Blaine spent several hours in the Capitol to-day in close consultation with Republican members of the Committee on Foreign Relations . He had not been long in the committee room before the re ? port spread throughout the chamber that an extra session of the Senate would soon be called , to meet early in March . Later in the day several Senators admitted that they would not be surprised if they were detained in Washington after the end of the present session . It goes without saying that the purpose of an extra Senate session , if one is called , will be to promote Mr. BlaMe 's enthusiastic scheme for reciprocity with our southern neighbors and Cuba , and possibly Canada . So far as the reciprocity convention just arranged with Brazil is concerned , no ratitioatton by the Senate is necessary . It rested solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the act . But that law is limited in its reciprocity provisions to a few specified articles . If the Administration desires to go outside of this limited list in conducting reciprocity negotiations with other Governments it must do so in a formal treaty , and the treaty must be approved by the Senate before it can be put into effect . That such treaties are being negotiated with certain Governments , including Spain , is generally believed , and those Senators who look for an extra session think they will be asked to act upon such conventions as will not be concluded in time for presentation to the Senate before the end of the present session . Some of the Senators , however , do not put much faith in the rumor of an extra session . One of the leading Democratic Senators , who is credited with a full knowledge of what is going on at the State Department , said this afternoon that he knew of no diplomatic matters now before the Senate or likely to come before it in the near future that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see no reason for expecting an extra session . Another prominent Senator declared that the only thing that could possibly cause an extra session was the Force bill , and that was " as dead as a salt mackerel . " Senators on the Republican side of the chamber were quite generally admitting that an extra Senate eession was quite within the possibilities . It was intimated by one Senator that Mr. Blaine 's mission to the Foreign Relations Committee would be made evident when the Senate voted to raise the salaries of the several United States Consuls named in the Consular and Diplomatic Appropriation bill . Sir Julian Pauncefote is likely to be leas communicative hereafter than he was Monday last , when be saw the reporter who suddenly made him conspicuous in England and in America . There has been some effort made to soften the embarrassment that he naturally felt upon being criticised for speaking hastily and enthusiastically . But that is not pleasant for the reporter who had the conversation with him , in which he expressed his gratification at the decision of the bupremn Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph to-day m which the manner of ootaining the interview with hint is described : - The interviewer was Mr. R. M. Lamer , a well-known correspondent here . He was riding down from the Capitol in an F Street car . At the Baltimore and Ohio station Sir Julian Pauncefote entered the car , scrupulously attired , as he always is , evidently returning from an afternoon reception . Mr. Lerner saluted Sir Julian , and the latter acknowledged the salutation . The Supreme Court had just a few hours previous decided in favor of the owners of the Canadian sealer , and Mr. Larner'a journalistic instinct suggested that a word from Sir Julian on the subject might be interesting . Desiring to take no advantage of the British Minister because of courtesies previously extended in connection with other matters , Mr. Lamer says he presented his business card , so that Sir Julian might know that he was being addressed by a newspaper man in his business capacity . " The Minister took the card , read the inscription , and remarked that ho remembered having Met the correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court was first mentioned Sir Julian appeared uninformed on the subject , and Mr. Lerner promptly related the substance of the ruling made by Chief Justice Fuller . Sir Julian even helped him in the legal phraseology , showing just what the Canadians asked the court to do . He then went on to Bay that he had believed from the first the supreme Court had jurisdiction , and hoped the case might be disposed of before the fishing season commenced . He talked on with his usual freedom until the City Hall was reached , when he excused himself to call ou Lawyer Carlisle . He placed no restriction upon Mr. Lerner , who cabled the interview to London as the representative of one of the ( ) able news associations . " s.e From now until the close of this session of Congress people at the capital who find time hang heavy on their hands after dark will find a new place of entertainment open to them . The Senate decided to-day to hold night sittings for the rest of the session , excluding Saturday nights . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax the capacity of the galleries . The decision was far from unanimous . Mr. Cockrell declared that the transaction of public business would not be facilitated , and others expressed the belief that a quorum would rarely be on hand . Mr. Teller asserted that night sessions were generally failures and sometimes worse than failures , and , after the Senate had voted for the sessions by a majority of two to one , the Colorado Senator asked to be excused from attending at night , and had his request granted . During most of this session the Senate has been at work from 11 A. M. until 6 P. M. , yet it is very far behind in the work that must be done before the 4th of March . The necessity for night sessions now is due to the obstinate folly of Mr. Hoar and his fellow-radicals in exoluding all other business but consideration of the Force bill and the gag rule for so many long weeks . ? ? The House went into Committee of the Whole to-day , Mr. Payson of Illinois in the chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the decision of the Chair on Mr. Mason 's point or order raised against Mr. Candler 's amendment to the section appropriating $40,000 for expenses of the World 's Columbian Commission and the Board of Lady Managers . This amendment made it impossible for a dollar of the money to be utilized except upon an Itemized voucher approved by the Secretary of the Treasury . After brief debate Mr. Payson ruled the amendment out of order as changing existing laws . The President to-day sent to the Senate the the following nominations : Surveyors of Customs . ?
