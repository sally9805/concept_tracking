Sept. , ARTICLE V.-THE ETHICS OF EVOLUTION . THIS subject has recently been discussed in like Forum by Mr. Lilly . But his criticism was a very diluted reproduction of a much stronger Article in the Nineteenth Century a year or so before . The position assumed was one that would suggest to most readers Mr. Lilly 's desire to set aside evolution as the precondition to constructing a system of ethics . Some of the objections were effective enough , in so far as they would require a conception of evolution consistent with ethical facts , but the tone of hostility against the general application of that doctrine to ethics conveyed the impression that we were obliged to choose between one or the other alternative . This may have been very far from Mr. Lilly 's intention . But we venture to assert that this was the feeling of most readers , while the great disparity between the irresistible cogency of the arguments for evolution and the inefficiency of Mr. Lilly 's arqumenturn ad consequentiam against it was such as to tempt every reader who is sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with evolution , with all its real or apparent consequences , rather than to trust the keeping of their reason to a spirit which has always been opposed to scientific progress . It was easy to see that the theory was sweeping everything before it like a whirlwind , and victory is always a powerful means to conversion . In the middle ages the form and fortunes of a religious creed were to a large extent contingent upon the issue of a battle . Half-hearted believers were always ready for submission . Although the pressure and interests at present are of a different kind from those to which we have just alluded they are quite as effective in deciding the attachments of certain orders of minds . Of this we do not complain , because it is inevitable in the nature of the case . A choice has to be made and the presumptions , owing to repeated successes , are so overwhelmingly in favor of well supported scientific theories that the force of any other possibility is hardly felt , and even if it were felt , could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular // decision is too often based upon a very slight knowledge of the facts of evolution , and a less acquaintance with the meaning of the doctrine . In such cases , faith becomes the resource of men that may have laughed at it all their lives when applied to any other doctrine . iBut this is , perhaps , incidental to the main topic of consideration . Yet it is the most effective way of calling attention to the difficulties with which the critic of evolutionary ethics has to contend . On the one hand , the theory of evolution is so well supported by vast multitudes of facts , by the success of its explanatory power when applied to those facts , and by the acceptance of the best scientific minds , that it seems foolhardy to question it . On the other hand , the temper of public confidence in science is so sympathetic with the prestige gained by the achievements of the past , and so powerless to dispute the general claims of evolution , that every criticism designed to correct false impressions is construed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of overwhelming evidence . This is an unfortunate state of affairs ; for it is such a baneful hindrance to the knowledge of the truth . But a man is not necessarily opposed to evolution because he will not join in that optimistic view of it which so many of its apostles would like us to accept . Pessimistic forecasts of its possible influence and tendencies are not false because they are pessimistic . The truth may often have very unwelcome consequences in its wake , and those who revolt against pessimistic fears are as often harboring illusions as their less hopeful opponents . The fact is , and few are more conscious of this than Mr. Huxley , that the doctrine of evolution contains the possibilities of the most tremendous moral consequences of any theory ever proposed by man . We have scarcely yet begun to feel its influence and may realize comparatively little for a hundred years to come , except that history moves more rapidly in decades now than in centuries of the past . As an evidence of its influence we may adduce its effect upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Huxley , Darwin , Spencer , and Carlyle . Its destructive influence is demonstrable in these cases : whether for good or ill every one must decide for himself . But this levelling power , which it has exercised and will exercise to a much greater extent in the future when // it becomes as fully a staple of general knowledge as the theory of gravitation , consists entirely in the impression that man must regulate his conduct , as he does his thinking , according to the laws of " nature . " While this is true within certain limits , it is false beyond them . But distinctions are not always drawn , and our dependence upon " nature " in many respects is extended to dependence upon it in all . In the weakness of theories which were not founded upon natural laws , we get into the habit of regarding " nature " with its ultimata as the supreme guide to our minds , and so expect or endeavor to explain existing phenomena , or to deduce from the action of " nature " the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evolution for a principle upon which to construct ethics , looking to the realization of a better state of things than actually exist , we meet only with the right of the strong as the determining factor of all that has ever been realized , and must stand aghast at the consequences of applying any such principle to the amelioration of society . Hence , the humiliating conception of man which evolution teaches in contrast with that better idea of himself , which , if it was mistaken , nevertheless was a stimulus to higher achievement ; and the hopeless endeavor to find any exemplary encouragement in the action of " nature , " or some noble purpose and method which it was the aim of " nature " to realize , have only had the effect of turning man 's ideals and hopes into illusions . The only means which " nature " exhibits in the process of gaining her ends is opposed to all that is moral . When we consult her oracles , therefore , for a basis of ethics , we find or are told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome of evolution is not yet general . It may be that it is not a legitimate consequence of it . But evolntionists are not industrious to prevent deception in this matter , while the general development of their own minds shows that they are succumbing more and more to the pessimistic influence of their doctrine precisely in the direction we have indicated . A combination of circumstances , political , social , moral , and perhaps economical , prevents any such practical consequences as may be brought about by a long period of time , with successive generations of men , and the changes they involve , but this is no disproof of the possibilities which we are // considering and which represent evolution as radically modifying our ethical conceptions . We said that this tendency of the doctrine could be illustrated in the experience of four of the leading minds in this century . We proceed to show this in a conclusive manner , and the inference from it will be easy . We wish to show that the principles upon which evolution is based , at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influences which have tended to snstain the ideal aims of ethics , and are setting up in their stead conceptions that can only turn civilization into Pandemonium . Mr. Huxley 's is a striking instance of the tendencies of the doctrine and its influence upon the mind . In his earliest work on " Man 's Place in Nature , " his optimism is predominant and he ventures to emphasize the vast moral superiority of man over the brutes , although tracing his physical kinship with the apes . " No one , " he says , " is more strongly convinced than I am , of the vastness of the gulf between civilized man and the brutes ; or is more certain that whether from them or not , he is assuredly not of them . iNo one is less disposed to think lightly of the present dignity , or despairingly of the future hopes of the only consciously intelligent denizen of this world : " and then at a length which we can not reproduce in these pages , he expatiates upon the grandeur of human history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method by which his results were attained . But many years afterward , in the Nineteenth Century , after mature reflection upon the theory of evolution he expresses himself in a very different tone . Here are two significant passages : " In the cycle of phenomena presented by man , the animal , no more moral end is discernible than in that presented by the lives of the wolf and the deer . However imperfect the relics of pre-historic men may be , the evidence which they afford clearly tends to the conclusion that for thousands and thousands of years , before the origin of the oldest known civilizations , men were savages of a very low type . They strove with their enemies and their competitors ; they preyed upon things weaker or less cunning than themselves ; they were born , multiplied without stint , and died , for thousands of generations , alongside the mammoth , the urus , the lion , and the hyena , whose lives were spent in the same way ; and they were no more to be praised or blamed on moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // And again in a thrust at Frederic Harrison he uses similar vigorous language : " I know no study which is so unutterably saddening as that of the evolution of humanity as it is set forth in the annals of history . Out of the darkness of pre-historic ages , man emerges with the marks of his lowly origin strongly upon him . He is a brute , only more intelligent than the other brutes ; a blind prey to impulses , which as often as not lead him to destruction ; a victim to endless illusions which make his mental existence a terror and a burden , and fill his physical life with barren toil and battle . He attains a certain degree of physical comfort and develops a more or less workable theory of life , in such favorable situations as the plains of Mesopotamia and of Egypt , and then for thousands and thousands of years struggles with varying fortunes , attended by infinite wickedness , bloodshed , and misery , to maintain himself at this point against the greed and ambition of his fellowmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who first try to get him to move on ; and when he has moved on a step , he foolishly confers post mortem deification on his victims . He exactly repeats the process with all who want to move a step yet farther . " Schopenhaur could not give a more painful picture than this , and no one will question the source of the influence which produces so terrible a view of the past and so hopeless , a prospect for the future . Of Mr. Spencer 's case , a word will suffice . Readers of his " Social Statics , " published first in 1850 , will recall the fact that one chapter , that on " The Divine Idea , and the Conditions of its Realization , " was in entire sympathy with theism . In the preface to the American edition in 1864 he expressly states that he no longer abides by the teleological implications of that chapter . In 1875 , a foot-note to the same chapter says : " Were I now to re-write this chapter the theological implications of the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the first edition of Darwin 's " Origin of Species " appeared in 1859 , and recur to the still more important fact that the principal works of Mr. Spencer upon evolution were written between 1850 and 1875 , we easily discover what influence had drawn him away from the " Divine Idea . " The general reader is more familiar with the incident of Darwin 's gradual alienation from his early religious beliefs , and the frank manner in which he avowed the agnostic conclusions to which his study of the phenomena of evolution had brought him shows the tendencies of the doctrine in spite of // optimistic claims to the contrary . In the " Descent of Man , " he spoke of " The ennobling belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God , " but his " Life and Letters " show that the contemplation of the immoral spectacle represented in the fearful struggle for existence , apparent everywhere in the known nniverse , had effectually enervated those beliefs which had enabled him to look upon the administration of nature as a moral scheme , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the struggle for existence , the corollary of Malthusianism , turned these beliefs into illusions . The case of Carlyle is more striking and significant , because all his life he had rejected with disdain every doctrine which was offensive or dangerous to moral idealism . How he felt toward evolution is told in an anecdote of his meeting with Mr. Huxley after the latter 's return from his lectures on the subject in iftew York . Mr. Huxley was accosted in the following manner : " You are spending all yonr life to prove that men are descended from monkeys , while it takes more than our civilization to prevent them from being ogres . " But it was at the close of his life when the vehemence of his yonth was exhausted , and when scientific conquests in regard to man 's origin had been almost completed , that the moral ontlook of things extorted from him an unwilling confession , that the conception upon which he depended for combatting indifference to morals was falling into mm , or vanishing behind the all-devouring eclipse of evolution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerlessness and despair is recorded of any man . It appeared as the death knell to his philosophy , and the intellectual collapse which it foreshadowed is depicted in the following language of Mr. Fronde : " He refused Darwin 's transmutation of species as unproved ; he fought against it , though I could see he dreaded that it might turn out true . If the life of man was no more than the life of an animal , if he had no relation , or none which he could discern , with any being higher than himself , God would become an unmeaning word to him . Carlyle often spoke of this and with evident uneasiness . He was perplexed by the indifference with which the Supreme Power was allowing its existence to be obscured . I once said to him , not long before his death , that I could only believe in a God which did something . With a cry of pain , which I shall never forget , he said , He does nothing . " ' // This was a surrender , and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of morals is the correct one , because it is permeated throughout by too much reverence for mere power or force , and the motives inspired by the notion of mere authority , ne *ertheless the instinct which led him to recognize the dan0er of removing a conception that has been in many instances the highest moral ideal yet attained by humanity , is to be respected for what it implies , namely : that we can not go to the lower animal world for the principles of conduct . The principle by which man has been elevated is an ideal , not the imitation of what is below him . But the tendency of evolution to discredit many of the traditional beliefs connected with man 's progress has carried with it the moral ideals that have been the vitalizing impulse to his achievements , and it is these that are threatened by adopting Darwinism which aspires to be the universal solvent of philosophic problems . The relaxation of moral enthusiasm which it produced in the instances quoted , or if habit , environment , education , and inherited influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestness in any of them , the tendency to that relaxation is marked by the consciousness that nature is only a spectacle of remorseless cruelty and a poor object of reverence in the place of the moral being which evolution abandons . But we are not engaged in a refutation of evolution . So far as the present discussion is concerned , every aspect of the doctrine may be true . It certainly does give a truer conception of what man i8 and ha8 been , than all those systems which magnified the chasm between him and the *brute . Man 's vanity and pride have assigned him a rank and a dignity which the facts of his conduct will not justify . He has flattered himself that he is only a little lower than the angels , which may be true for all that we know . But his conduct only shows him a little worse than the devil . The cynic and the pessimist are right . What we call civilization has accomplished less than some would have us believe . Man 's real nature and habits are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theological dogma of that name might indicate . The means he employs to deceive and injure his // 267 fellows , the cruelty he practices upon his inferiors in nature , his cunning and knavery in politics , in commercial trade , and in social aspirations , his greed and ambition , his universal selfishness in public and private , with a catalogue of vices that would make a volume ,  --  all these present a creature that would discourage the hopes of any moralist who is not deceived by fanciful notions about the superior character of man . We can see that good may come out of knowing these facts , and so be grateful to evolution for proving and emphasizing them . But all this is irrelevant to the question whether the theory furnishes the principle or the ideal end by which man is to be made better . Unless it does provide this condition , it must fail as an ethical theory . We may grant it all the power it claims for explaining the origin of things , but this is not to idealize its facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imitation . A sense of idealization must have occurred before any feeling of duty could either originate or be effective , and this idealization must either represent something better than reality , or reality must come up to the standard of what is ideal . In the former case the doctrine of evolution does not supply the condition demanded by ethics . In the latter case , its advocates either misrepresent the administration of nature , or they must admit the inadequacy of their doctrine for ethical purposes . The whole difficulty originates in a circumstance not sufficiently considered by either the friends or foes of evolution . This is the long standing antithesis between the ideas of nature and of God , in connection with the doctrine that nature is a creation and a revelation of God . The history and development of this antithesis can not be discussed here although it would be valuable as preparing the way for an analysis of an important question . But we must content ourselves with remarking the fact that the conception of nature has always been the smybol for that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not impossible , to associate with a free will and intelligence except by robbing them of all moral character . Even in the mythological stage of reflection , a period which Lotze so finely calls " the beautiful youth of man , " and when the phenomena of nature were looked upon as a carnival of spirits , human consciousness was not wholly // exempt from a belief in the fixity of events which appeared to disturb the loveliness of its illusions . A fearful spectre always loomed np in the backgronnd . It assumed the form of Fate , which , as every one knows , produced a nightmare upon the Greek mind , and , as knowledge increased , the idea of personal spirits above man was gradually eliminated from the problem of philosophy and morals . But man has never been able permanently to look with composnre upon the Gorgon face of brnte reality , and hence under the influence of a system of cooperating forces philosophical , religious , and political , after the decline of Greek and IRoman civilization , he has endeavored to conceal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . But a dangerous paralogism was lurking in the twofold character of that conception . On the one hand , it was that of a cause or power which subordinated nature to its sovereignty . This was the only escape from philosophic dualism and at the same time forced the conclusion that the handiwork must contain traces of its creator 's character . On the other hand , the conception of God was a moral ideal transcendently superior to anything discoverable in nature , and so was not assured of having either a personal reality outside of human conscionsuess , or an interest in a moral administration of the physical world which did not reveal it . As long as the study of nature was neglected , idealism succeeded in minimizing or in keeping out of view the difficulties involved in the contrast between the ideal character of God and the thoroughly unideal character of his creation . But when scientific curiosity could no longer be suppressed and when evolution came in to consummate our knowledge of nature , a spectacle was revealed in " natural selection , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival of the fittest " that simply paralyzes every mind that had looked upon the administration of nature as a type of infinite wisdom and goodness . The wisdom might be there , but the goodness was not , and in addition to the doubt raised about the existence of God by such facts , the quick and easy inference drawn from them was , or is likely to be , that man can hardly be bound by any conceptions or laws which the author of nature has not seen fit to embody in his own action . This is the impression which is so fatal to common moral ideals , and which will play such terrible havoc with the ordi // nary mind when traditional influences have been eliminated by the general acceptance of evolution . We have shown what effect it had upon the minds of its chief apostles and may expect it to exercise a more revolutionary influence upon minds which are not so well protected against its disintegrating power . Man can not alter definite and long established convictions with impunity when a moral ideal is involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are proofs of this . Evolution changes our point of view from the theocentric to the physiocentric , and in so doing has exhibited beneath the surface of nature a method of action which is the very antithesis of morals and can no more be made the principle of virtue than civilization can be based upon perpetual war . The theocentric position may not be true , but its assumed alternative , the physiocentric , with its struggle for existence and the moral upheaval it threatens , is less true , and makes it impossible to contemplate the vast difference between the idealism of the past and the pessimistic realism of nature , as described by Mr. Huxley , without recalling Carlyle 's allusion to Vesuvius . " The earth , green as she looks5 rests everywhere on dread foundations were we farther down , and Pan to whose music the Nymphs dance has a cry in him that can drive all men distracted . " Can any means be discovered to calm alarm , or to show that men 's apprehensions are illusory ? " Nature , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reverence . " Now it is reverence of some kind that is the primary condition of morals . We shall not affirm that it must be the reverence of God , although we can be true to the facts of experience only if we admit that the conception of God , when idealized , has always shed a beautiful lustre over the speculations of history and of hope , and has had not a little influence in the moral development of man , even after accepting the *rorst and the most that can be said of the sins committed in that name . Hence it is no wonder that Carlyle uttered a cry of despair when he saw the doctrine of evolution driving everything before it . It was carrying with it , in his estimation , the foundation of ethics . His error could easily be pointed out had we the time and space to do so : but when we appreciate what the ideals have been that have accompanied // man 's development , it is not strange that Carlyle and all who assume the need of relying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in order to encourage moral action , should feel compelled , after the disclosures of evolution , only to stand by and watch the immortal idea of God vanishing in thunderclouds . It is reverence for an ideal above the laws of nature that is the basis of morals . But if , in the revelation of development , Ixion discovers that he has been embracing a cloud , he is not likely , when disenchanted of his illusion , to find in anything that is left an object of respect to supply the inspiration which has been lost . But we are not invoking the bngbear of consequences in order to refute evolution : for we do not think any remedy can be produced to avoid them by an attempt to resuscitate metaphysics or theology . Evolution has come to stay and will modify our ethics whether we will or no . But it is proper to present the contrast between the struggle for existence , or the right of the strong , and the principle upon which we endeavor to rise above the " laws of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is founded upon those laws , can reconstruct ethics or supply the ideal by which man regulates his moral conduct . If it does not , we can demand either that the theory be modified , or that it be confessed inadequate to meet the necessities of the problem . The fact is , as we have seen , nature is a Medusa head on which no moralist can look and live , and althongh we can not ignore evolution in ethics , we have only to remark one crucial fact which effectually assigns that doctrine a secondary place in the determination of moral conduct . Upon this fact we concentrate all the emphasis possible . It is that the whole of man 's moral achievements have been effected by putting limits to the struggle for existence . The value and importance of this generalization can not be exaggerated and is the most direct refutation of the claim that evolution , as embodied in the " laws of nature , " has the first and last word to say in fixing the maxims of ethics . Mr. Huxley has admitted this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays , but without any consciousness of its vast significance or of the limitations it imposes upon the interference of evolution in morals . Mr. Spencer is similarly unconscious of what he // concedes when he says , " that ethics has for its subject matter that form which universal conduct assumes during the last stages of evolutiou . " After this statemeut he ought to have seeu that what had been said of the conduct of infusoria and polyps is irrelevant to the problem , although very interesting and instructive . But to raise the structure of ethics above everything embodied in the struggle for existence or the conduct of the animal creation , and to condition many s improvement upon the discovery and use of some means to frustrate the terrible operation of such a law , or to limit it , is granting all that the most obstinate opponent could demand , and offers the hopeful prospect of something better than despair or pessimism as the ' ideal of the future . It is true enough that such a criticism does not oppose evolution . It is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a science which is not mainly historical . Evolution is doing a very legitimate work in destroying illusions , but the confidence which it inspires in this field can not be transferred to any attempted reconstruction under shelter of that doctrine upon the idea of " nature , " because the antithesis between this and the moral ideal has been so sharply drawn that this antithesis requires previous consideration in order to avoid consequences worse than the illusions which are dissipated by Darwinism . The truth of this will be seen if we thoroughly realize what consequences to life would be involved in adopting as the highest norm of conduct the maxim which is the expressed formula of evolution ; that might is the only right which the struggle for existence or the survival of the fittest seems to exemplify . Nor is it the religious interests alone that are concerned in such a warning . Criticisms of evolutionistic morals are most likely to come from that school of thought , and so to awaken suspicion , perhaps with some justice , when we consider the uniform series of defeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its derelictions or to indicate a position from which it may be justified , there are men whose religious presuppositions will not be in the way of the cogency of their opinions . They are John Morley and John Stuart Mill . Not having been absorbed in that kind of study which makes the physical // formuhe of evolution the associating centers of thought they were both conscious of a contrast between the ideal and the real , and the significance it had for morals which the habitual student of evolution does not always realize , but does not question when brought to his notice . They as students of man , independently of the mere physical causes which co*5perated in his development , were moralists , and in both of them will be found that sympathy for humanity which is not only the highest characteristic of a thinker , but also insures an appreciation of conceptions above the application of mere power to the moral elevation of the race . Hence both of them plainly tell us that " nature " is no source for the moral ideals which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , " the idea of " nature " as it is so constantly represented . There may be a vast difference between " nature " and our conception of nature , but in constructing the basis of morals as a theory , we can deal only with the idea of nature , and unless that provides something equal in moral value to the principles to be guaranteed by it we must either give up what has hitherto passed for ethics , or confess the inadequacy of our supposed foundation of it . Most readers are familiar with Mill 's terrible arraignment of nature in his posthumous essays on religion . He closes that impeachment with the statement that " conformity to nature has no connection whatever with right and wrong . The idea can never be fitly introduced into ethical discussions at all . " " It has two principal meanings : it either denotes the entire system of things , with the aggregate of all their properties , or it denotes things as they would be , apart from human intervention . In the first of these senses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he has no power to do anything else than follow nature . In the other sense , the doctrine that he ou* ht to make the spontaneous course of things the model of his voluntary actions , is equally irrational and immoral . Irrational , because all human action whatever consists in altering , and all useful action in improvi* g , the spontaneous course of nature ; immoral , because the course of natural phenomena , being replete with everything which when committed by human beings is most worthy of abhorrence ; any one who endeavored in his actions // to imitate the natural course of things would be universally seen and acknowledged to be the wickedest of men . " Diderot , in a delicate case of conscience , where the virtue of a wife was pitted against the life of herself and children , observed : " In truth , I think nature heeds neither good nor evil ; she is wholly wrapped up in two objects , the preservation of the individual and the propagation of the species. ** " True , " remarks John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong is so much wrung from the forces that iDiderot here calls nature . " Both of these views are but different versions of what has been admitted by Huxley ; namely , that all moral achievement is proportioned to the extent to which man can assign limits to the struggle for existence , and any system of evolution which disregards that fact or that principle will be found wanting . The most common error of both the speculative and the ordinary mind is that it fails to distinguish adequately between the process and the theory of evolution . The latter aims to formulate the basis , law , or principle which will explain the series of phenomena represented in the process , and the connection of each unit with every other . But we are not always assured that we have recognized in the theory all that exists in the process . If so , the formulated theory is defective , not in its scientific conception of the facts , but in its explanation of them . A theory may then be partly true , and partly false ; true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or false in assumi ? g that the principle behind the process is equal to the fnnctions assigned it . And we may go farther , and assert that a theory may be perfectly adequate in the causal explanation of a process , but inadequate in its deduction of moral rules from the principle which serves as a physical explanation of phenomena . This is precisely the prime error of evolutionists in their application of their doctrine to ethics . The principle of the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest may be an adequate explanation of certain phenomena , but they afford no basis for legislative purposes , and ethics is legislative , not explanatory . They are merely principles of force and indicate the means of making an idea effective , not of constituting its worth and legitimacy . // The explanation of a fact is one thing and the moral value both of the fact and the principle which accounts for it is another . Hence we may easily enough accord the struggle for existence all the causal explanatory power claimed for it , but deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even psychologically or logically explaining , moral principles and moral ideals . These must transcend the struggle for existence , although they may employ the principle represented in it to make their own existence effective . The value of keeping this limitation in view consists in the fact that it will serve as a check to misplaced confidence and enthusiasm regarding the all-sufficiency of the doctrine of evolution . The actual achievements of the theory have concealed this limitation , while the assumed dependence of ethics upon a general philosophic theory of the universe has carried with the admission of evolution its application to that field of phenomena in their nature and validity as well as their origin . But in the first finsh of fairly won victory we may not always count the cost and the consequences of it , and they may be sufficient to impair the value of the victory itself . Precisely thus we may be hailing a triumph that is destined to issue in the loss of all the moralization the race has gained , merely because the elimination of the moral from the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethics founded upon it . Even the establishment of a truth may be at the expense of a moral ideal , when that truth happens to antagonize a view with which the ideal was associated . Our solicitude should be to avoid this consequence which may not be a necessary one , except to the logic of association . But it is nevertheless inevitable when our fundamental principle is divested of all affinities with the moral . Thus the idea of " nature , " conceived as excluding the moral , leaves the problem of ethics untouched and unsolved ; conceived as including it , it is valueless for antagonizing any of the theories to which evolution is opposed . But it generally has the former conception in all speculative efforts and produces an influence to accord with the implications involved . There is a fixed connection between what a man believes or admires and what he is . If it be a moral ideal above the principle of " nature , " something // by which to measure his imperfection , he may hope to direct his will by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or example of what is below him ; if he can aim at nothing higher than the exercise of force , he may well despair of the future , for it would only present him as the victim of hopeless illusions . " Nature , " viewed from the plane of ethics , is only a spectacle of non-moral forces . It is the fierce indignation at injustice and wrong everywhere manifested by mere conformity to natural law , and the splendid endeavor to realize some unattained ideal , that makes man 's conduct ethical , and invests life with so much moral grandeur , although for the moment that it passes it may be marked by a shadow .
