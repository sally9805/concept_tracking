txt THE Sierra bear , brawn or gray , the sequoia of the animals , tramps over all the park , though few travelers have the pleasure of seeing him . On he fares through the majestic forests and cai'ions , facing all sorts of weather , rejoicing in his strength , everywhere at home , harmonizing with the trees and rocks and shaggy chaparral . Happy fellow ! his lines have fallen in pleasant places , - lily gardens in silver-fir forests , miles of bushes in endless variety and exuberance of bloom over hill-waves and valleys and along the banks of streams , cailons full of music and waterfalls , parks fair as Eden , - places in which one might expect to meet angels rather than bears . In this happy land no famine comes nigh him . All the year round his bread is sure , for some of the thousand kinds that he likes are always in season and accessible , ranged on the shelves of the mountains like stores in a pantry . From one to another , from climate to climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn , - enjoying as great variety as if he traveled to far-off countries north and south . To him almost everything is food except granite . Every tree helps to feed him , every bush and herb , with fruits and flowers , leaves and bark ; and all the animals he can catch , - badgers , gophers , ground squirrels , lizards , snakes , etc. , and ants , bees , wasps , old and yonng , together with their eggs and larvie and nests . Crannched and hashed , down all go to his marvelous stomach , and vanish as if cast into a fire . What digestion ! A sheep or a wounded deer or a pig he eats warm , about as quickly as a boy eats a buttered muffin ; or should the meat be a month old , it still is welcoined with tremendous relish . After so gross a meal as this , perhaps the next will be strawberries and clover , or raspberries with mushrooms and nuts , or puckery acorns and chokecherries . And as if fearing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he breaks into cabins to look after sugar , dried apples , bacon , etc . Occasionally he eats the mountaineer 's bed ; but when lie has had a full meal of more tempting dainties he usually leaves it undisturbed , though lie has been known to drag it up through a hole in the roof , carry it to the foot of a tree , and lie down on it to enjoy a siesta . Eating everything , never is he himself eaten except by man , and only man is an enemy to he feared . " B'ar meat , " said a hunter from whom I was seeking information , " b'ar meat is the best meat in the mountains ; their skins make the best beds , and their grease the best butter . Biscuit shortened with b'ar grease goes as far as beans ; a man will walk all day on a couple of them biscuit . " In my first interview with a Sierra bear we were frightened and embarrassed , both of us , but the bear 's behavior was better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a narrow strip of meadow , and I was concealed behind a tree on the side of it . After studying his appearance as he stood at rest , I rushed toward him to frighten him , that I might study his gait in running . But , contrary to all I had heard about the shyness of bears , he did not run at all ; and when I stopped short within a few steps of him , as he held his ground in a fighting attitude , my mistake was monstrously plain . I was then put on my good behavior , and never afterward forgot the right manners of the wilderness . This happened on my first Sierra excursion in the forest to the north of Yosemite Valley . I was eager to meet the animals , and many of them came to me as if willing to show themselves and // make my acquaintance ; but the bears kept out of my way . An old mountaineer , in reply to my questions , told me that bears were very shy , all save grim old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years without seeing one , unless I gave my mind to them and practiced the stealthy ways of hunters . Nevertheless , it was only a few weeks after I had received this information that I met the one mentioned above , and obtained instruction at first-hand . I was encamped in the woods about a mile back of the rim of Yosemite , beside a stream that falls into the valley by the way of Indian Cai'ion . Nearly every day for weeks I went to the top of the North Dome to sketch ; for it commands a general view of the valley , and I was anxious to draw every tree and rock and waterfall . Carlo , a St. Bernard dog , was my companion , - a fine , intelligent fellow that belonged to a hunter who was compelled to remain all summer on the hot plains , and who loaned him to me for the season for the sake of having him in the mountains , where he would be so much better off . Carlo knew bears through long experience , and he it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed as much surprised as the bear at my unhunter-like behavior . One morning in June , just as the sunbeams began to stream through the trees , I set out for a day 's sketching on the dome ; and before we had gone half a mile from camp Carlo snuffed the air and looked cautiously ahead , lowered his bushy tail , drooped his ears , and began to step softly like a cat , turning every few yards and looking me in the face with a telling expression , saying plainly enough , " There is a bear a little way ahead . " I walked carefully in the indicated direction , until I approached a small flowery meadow that I was familiar with , then crawled to the foot of a tree on its margin , bearing in mind what I had been told about the shyness of bears . Looking out cautiously over the instep of the tree , I saw a big , burly cinnamon bear , about thirty yards off , half erect , his paws resting on the trunk of a fir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried in grass and flowers . He was listening attentively and trying to catch the scent , showing that in some way he was aware of our approach . I watched his gestures , and tried to make the most of my opportunity to learn what I could about him , fearing he would not stay long . He made a fine picture , standing alert in the sunny garden walled in by the most beautiful firs in the world . After examining him at leisure , noting the sharp muzzle thrust inquiringly forward , the long shaggy hair on his broad chest , the stiff ears nearly buried in hair , and the slow , heavy way in which he moved his head , I foolishly made a rush on him , throwing up my arms and shouting to frighten him , to see him run . He did not mind the demonstration much ; only pushed his head farther forward , and looked at me sharply as if asking , " What now ? If you want to fight , I in ready . " Then I began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was afraid to run , lest he should be encouraged to pursue me ; therefore I held my ground , staring him in the face within a dozen yards or so , putting on as bold a look as I could , and hoping the influence of the human eye would be as great as it is said to be . Under these strained relations the interview seemed to last a long time . Finally , the bear , seeing how still I was , calmly withdrew his huge paws from the log , gave me a piercing look as if warning me not to follow him , turned , and walked slowly up the middle of the meadow into the forest ; stopping every few steps and looking back to make sure that I was not trying to take him at a disadvantage in a rear attack . I was glad to part with him , and greatly enjoyed the vanishing view as he waded through the lilies and columbines. // Thenceforth I always tried to give bears respectful notice of my approach , and they usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came around my camp in the night , only once afterward , as far as I know , was I very near one of them in daylight . This time it was a grizzly I met ; and as luck would have it , I was even nearer to him than I had been to the big cinnamon . Though not a large specimen , he seemed forinidable enough at a distance of less than a dozen yards . His shaggy coat was well grizzled , his head almost white . When I first caught sight of him he was eating acorns under a Kellogg oak , at a distance of perhaps seventy-five yards , and I tried to slip past without disturbing him . But he had either heard my steps on the gravel or caught my scent , for he came straight toward me , stopping every rod or so to look and listen ; and as I was afraid to be seen running , I crawled on my hands and knees a little way to one side and hid behind a libocedrus , hoping he would pass me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood looking ahead , while I looked at him , peering past the bulging trunk of the tree . At last , turning his head , he caught sight of mine , stared sharply a minute or two , and then , with fine dignity , disappeared in a mauzanita - covered earthquake talus . Considering how heavy and broadfooted bears are , it is wonderful how little harm they do in the wilderness . Even in the well-watered gardens of the middle region , where the flowers grow tallest , and where during warm weather the bears wallow and roll , no evidence of destruction is visible . On the contrary , under nature 's direction , the massive beasts act as gardeners . On the forest floor , carpeted with needles and brush , and on the tough sod of glacier meadows , bears make no mark , but around the sandy margin of lakes their magnificent tracks form grand lines of embroidery . Their well-worn trails extend along the main cai'ions on either side , and though dusty in some places make no scar on the landscape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pines and oaks to get the nuts , but this pinning is so light that few mountaineers ever notice it ; and though they interfere with the orderly lichen-veiled decay of fallen trees , tearing them to pieces to reacb the colonies of ants that inhabit them , the scattered ruins are quickly pressed back into harmony by snow and rain and overleaning vegetation . The number of bears that make the park their home may be guessed by the number that have been killed by the two best hunters , Duncan and old David Brown . Duncan began to be known as a bear-killer about the year 1865 . He was then roaming the woods , hunting and prospecting on the south fork of the Merced . A friend told me that he killed his first bear near his cabin at Wawona ; that after mustering courage to fire he fled , without waiting to learn the effect of his shot . Going back in a few hours he found poor Bruin dead , and gained courage to try again . Duncan confessed to me , when we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first mortally afraid of bears , but after killing a half dozen be began to keep count of his victims , and became ambitious to be known as a great bear-hunter . In nine years lie had killed forty - nine , keeping count by notches cut on one of the timbers of his cabin on the shore of Crescent Lake , near the south boundary of the park . He said the more he knew about bears , the more he respected them and the less he feared them . But at the same time he grew more and more cautious , and never fired until he had every advantage , no matter how long he had to wait and how far he had to go before he got the bear just right as to the direction of the wind , the distance , and the way of escape in case of accident ; making allowance also for the character of the animal , old or young , // cinnamon or grizzly . For old grizzlies , he said , he had no use whatever , and he was mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even hundred ; then he was going to confine himself to safer game . There was not much money in bears , anyhow , and a round hundred was enough for glory . I have not seen or heard of him lately , and do not know how his bloody count stands . On my excursions , I occasionally passed his cabin . It was full of meat and skins hung in bundles from the rafters , and the ground about it was strewn with bones and hair , - infinitely less tidy than a bear 's den . He went as hunter and guide with a geological survey party for a year or two , and was very proud of the scientific knowledge lie picked up . His admiring fellow mountaineers , he said , gave him credit for knowing not only the botanical names of all the trees and bushes , but also the " botanical names of the bears . " The most famous hunter of the region was David Brown , an old pioneer , who early in the gold period established his main camp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merced , which is still called " Brown 's Flat . " No finer solitude for a hunter and prospector could be found ; the climate is delightful all the year , and the scenery of both earth and sky is a perpetual feast . Though he was not much of a " scenery fellow , " his friends say that he knew a pretty place when he saw it as well as any one , and liked mightily to get on the top of a commanding ridge to " look off . " When out of provision , he would take down his old - fashioned long - barreled rifle from its deer-horn rest over the fireplace and set out in search of game . Seldom did he have to go far for venison , because the deer liked the wooded slopes of Pilot Peak ridge , with its open spots where they could rest and look about them , and enjoy the breeze from the sea in warm weather , free from troublesome flies , while they found hiding - places and fine aromatic food in the deer-brush chaparraL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well the little mountaineer understood the object of every hunt , whether deer or bears , or only grouse hidden in the fir - tops . In deer - hunting Sandy had little to do , trotting behind his master as he walked noiselessly through the fragrant woods , careful not to step heavily on dry twigs , scanning open spots in the chaparral where the deer feed in the early morning and toward sunset , peering over ridges and swells as new outlooks were reached , and along alder and willow fringed flats and streams , until he found a young buck , killed it , tied its legs together , threw it on his shoulder , and so back to camp . But when bears were hunted , Sandy played an important part as leader , and several times saved his master 's life ; and it was as a bear-hunter that David Brown became famous . His method , as I had it from a friend who had passed many an evening in his cabin listening to his long stories of adventure , was simply to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go slowly and silently over hill and vah hey in the loneliest part of the wilderness , until little Sandy came upon the fresh track of a bear , then follow it to the death , paying no heed to time . Wherever the bear went he went , however rough the ground , led by Sandy , who looked back from time to time to see how his master was coming on , and regulated his pace accordingly , never grow* ing weary or allowing any other track to divert him . When high ground was reached a halt was made , to scan the openings in every direction , and perchance Bruin would be discovered sitting upright on his haunches , eating manza* nita berries ; pulling down the fruit-laden branches with his paws and pressing them together , so as to get substantial mouthfuhs , however mixed with leaves and twigs . The time of year enabled the hunter to determine approximately // where the game would be found : in spring and early summer , in lush grass and clover meadows and in berry tangles along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes ; in late sum mer and autumn , beneath the pines , eating the cones cut off by the squirrels , and in oak groves at the bottom of cafions , munching acorns , mauzanita berries , and cherries ; and after snow had fallen , in alluvial bottoms , feeding on ants and yellow-jacket wasps . These food places were always cautiously approached , so as to avoid the chance of sudden encounters . " Whenever , " said the hunter , " I saw a bear before he saw me , I had no trouble in killing him . I just took lots of time to learn what he was up to and how long he would be likely to stay , and to study the direction of the wind and the lay of the land . Then I worked round to leeward of him , no matter how far I had to go ; crawled and dodged to within a hundred yards , near the foot of a tree that I could climb , but which was too small for a bear to climb . There I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my boots so as to climb quickly if necessary , and , with my rifle in rest and Sandy behind me , waited until my bear stood right , when I made a sure , or at least a good shot back of the fore leg . In case he showed fight , I got up the tree I had in mind , before he could reach me . But bears are slow and awkward with their eyes , and being to windward they could not scent me , and often I got in a second shot before they saw the smoke . Usually , however , they tried to get away when they were hurt , and I let them go a good safe while before I ventured into the brush after them . Then Sandy was pretty sure to find them dead ; if not , he barked bold as a lion to draw attention , or rushed in and nipped them behind , enabling me to get to a safe distance and watch a chance for a finishing shot . " " Oh yes , bear-hunting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowed just right , though , like every other business , especially the wild kind , it has its accidents , and Sandy and I have had close calls at times . Bears are nobody 's fools , and they know enough to let men alone as a general thing , unless they are wounded , or cornered , or have cubs . In my opinion , a hungry old mother would catch and eat a man , if she could ; which is only fair play , anyhow , for we eat them . But nobody , as far as I know , has been eaten up in these rich mountains . Why they never tackle a fellow when he is lying asleep I never could understand . They could gobble us mighty handy , but I suppose it s nature to respect a sleeping man . " Sheep-owners and their shepherds have killed a great many bears , mostly by poison and traps of various sorts . Bears are fond of mutton , and levy heavy toll on every flock driven into the mountains . They usually come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep with a stroke of the paw , carry it off a little distance , eat about half of it , and return the next night for the other half ; and so on all summer , or until they are themselves killed . It is not , however , by direct killing , but by suffocation through crowding against the corral wall in fright , that the greatest losses are incurred . From ten to fifteen sheep are found dead , smothered in the corral , after every attack ; or the walls are broken , and the flock is scattered far and wide . A flock may escape the attention of these marauders for a week or two in the spring ; but after their first taste of the fine mountainfed meat the visits are persistently kept up , in spite of all precautions* Once I spent a night with two Portuguese shepherds , who were greatly troubled with bears , from two to four or five visiting them almost every night . Their camp was near the middle of the park , and the wicked bears , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now until dark , they came out of the brush in broad daylight , and boldly carried off as // many sheep as they liked . One evening , before sundown , a bear , followed by two cubs , came for an early supper , as the flock was being slowly driven toward camp . Joe , the elder of the shepherds , warned by many exciting experiences , promptly climbed a tall tamarack pine , and left the freebooters to help themselves ; while Antone , calling him a coward , and declaring that he was not going to let bears eat up his sheep before his face , set the dogs on them , and rushed toward them with a great noise and a stick . The frightened cubs ran up a tree , and the mother ran to meet the shepherd and dogs . Antone stood astonished for a moment , eying the oncoming bear ; then fled faster than Joe had , closely pursued . He scrambled to the roof of their little cabin , the only refuge quickly available ; and fortunately , the bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , - only held him in mortal terror a few minutes , glaring and threatening , then hastened back to her cubs , called them down , went to the frightened , huddled flock , killed a sheep , and feasted in peace . Antone piteously entreated cautious Joe to show him a good safe tree , up which he climbed like a sailor climbing a mast , and held on as long as he could with legs crossed , the slim pine recommended by Joe being nearly branchless . " So you too are a bear coward , as well as Joe , " I said , after hearing th' story . " Oh , I tell you , " he replied , with grand solemnity , " bear face close by look awful ; she just as soon eat me as not . She do so as eef all my sheeps b'long every one to her own self . I run to bear no more . I take tree every time . " After this the shepherds corralled the flock about an hour before sundown , chopped large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the corral every night , and one with a gun kept watch on a stage built in a pine by the side of the cabin , while the other slept . But after tbe first night or two this fire fence did no good , for the robbers seemed to regard the light as an advantage , after becoming used to it . On the night I spent at their camp the show made by the wall of fire when it was blazing in its prime was magnificent : the illumined trees round about relieved against solid darkness , arid the two thousand sheep lying down in one gray mass , sprinkled with gloriously brilliant gems , the effect of the firelight in their eyes . It was nearly midnight when a pair of the freebooters arrived . They walked boldly through a gap in the fire circle , killed two sheep , carried them out , and vanished in the dark woods , leaving ten dead in a pile , trampled down and smothered against the corral fence ; while the scared watcher in the tree did not fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hit some of the sheep , as the bears got among them before he could get a good sight . In the morning I asked the shepherds why they did not move the flock to a new pasture . " Oh , no use ! " cried Antone . " Look my dead sheeps . We move three four time before , all the same bear come by the track . No use . To-morrow we go home below . Look my dead sheeps . Soon all dead . " Thus were they driven out of the mountains more than a month before the usual time . After Uncle Sam 's soldiers , bears are the most effective forest police , but some of the shepherds are very successful in killing them . Altogether , by hunters , mountaineers , Indians , and sheepmen , probably five or six hundred have been killed within the bounds of the park , during the last thirty years . But they are not in danger of extinction . Now that the park is guarded by soldiers , not only has the vegetation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the wild animals are increasing in numbers . No guns are allowed in the park except under certain restrictions , and after a permit has been obtained from the officer in // charge . This has stopped the barbarous slaughter of bears , and especially of deer , by shepherds , hunters , and hunting tourists , who , it would seem , can find no pleasure without blood . The Sierra deer - the blacktail - spend the winters in the brushy and exceedingly rough region just below the main timber-belt , and are less accessible to hunters there than when they are passing through the comparatively open forests to and from their summer pastures . near the summits of the range . They go up the mountains early in the spring as the snow melts , not waiting for it all to disappear ; reaching the High Sierra about the first of June , and the coolest recesses at the base of the peaks a month or so later . I have tracked them for miles over compacted snow from three to ten feet deep . Deer are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roughest mountains ; seeking not only pasturage , but a cool climate , and safe hidden places in which to bring forth their young . They are not supreme as rock-climbing animals ; they take second rank , yielding the first to the mountain sheep , which dwell above them on the highest crags and peaks . Still , the two meet frequently ; for the deer climbs all the peaks save the lofty summits above the glaciers , crossing piles of angular boulders , roaring swollen streams , and sheer-walled cafions by fords and passes that would try the nerves of the hardiest mountaineers , - climbing with graceful ease and reserve of strength that can not fail to arouse admiration . Everywhere some species of deer seems to be at home , on rough or smooth ground , lowlands or highlands , in swamps and barrens and the densest woods , in varying climates , hot or cold , over all the continent ; maintaining glorious health , never making an awkward step . Standing , lying down , walking , feeding , running even for life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation to every landscape , - a charming animal , and a great credit to nature . I never see one of the common blacktail deer , the only species in the park , without fresh admiration ; and since I never carry a gumi I see them well : lying beneath a juniper or dwarf pine , among the brown needles on the brink of some cliff or the end of a ridge commanding a wide outlook ; feeding in sunny openings among chaparral , daintily selecting aromatic leaves and twigs ; leading their fawns out of my way , or making them lie down and hide ; bounding past through the forest , or curiously advancing and retreating again and again . One morning when I was eating breakfast in a little garden spot on the Kaweah , hedged around with chaparral , I noticed a deer 's head thrust through the bushes , the big beautiful eyes gazing at me . I kept still , and the deer ventured forward a step , then snorted and withdrew . In a few minutes she returned , and came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two others . After showing themselves for a moment , they bounded over the hedge with sharp , timid snorts and vanished . But curiosity brought them back with still another , and all four came into my garden , and , satisfied that I meant them no ill , began to feed , actually eating breakfast with me , like tame , gentle sheep around a shepherd , - rare company , and the most graceful in movements and attitudes . I eagerly watched them while they fed on ceanothus and wild cherry , daintily culling single leaves here and there from the side of the hedge , turning now and then to snip a few leaves of mint from the midst of the garden flowers . Grass they did not eat at all . No wonder the contents of the deer 's stomach are eaten by the Indians . While exploring the upper cafion of the north fork of the San Joaquin , one evening , the sky threatening rain , I searched for a dry bed , and made choice of a big juniper that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting stubbornly on its knees high enough to let me lie under its broad trunk . Just below my shelter there was another juniper on the very brink of a precipice , and , examining it , I found a deer-bed beneath it , completely protected and concealed by drooping branches , - a fine refuge and lookout as well as resting-place . About an hour before dark I heard the clear , sharp snorting of a deer , and looking down on the brushy , rocky ca ? ion bottom discovered an anxious doe that no doubt had her fawns concealed near by . She bounded over the chaparral and up the farther slope of the wall , often stopping to look back and listen , - a fine picture of vivid , eager alertness . I sat perfectly still , and as my shirt was colored like the juniper bark I was not easily seen . After a little she came cautiously toward me , sniffing the air and gazing , and her movements , as she descended the cafion side over boulder piles and brush and fallen timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or made apparent efforts , although jumping high here and there . As she drew nigh she sniffed anxiously , trying the air in different directions until she caught my scent ; then bounded off , and vanished behind a small grove of firs . Soon she came back with the same caution and insatiable curiosity , - coming and going five or six times . While I sat admiring her , a Douglas squirrel , evidently excited by her noisy alarms , climbed a boulder beneath me , and witnessed her performances as attentively as I did , while a frisky chipmunk , too restless or hungry for such shows , busied himself about his supper in a thicket of shadbushes , the fruit of which was then ripe , glancing about on the slender twigs lightly as a sparrow . Toward the end of the Indian summer , when the young are strong , the deer begin to gather in little bands of from six to fifteen or twenty , and on the approach of the first snowstorm they set out on their march down the mountains to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight or ten miles below the summits , as if loath to leave . About the end of November , a heavy , far - reaching storm drives them down in haste along the dividing ridges between the rivers , led by old experienced buc*ks whose knowledge of the topography is wonderful . It is when the deer are coming down that the Indians set out on their grand fall hunt . Too lazy to go into the recesses of the mountains away from trails , they wait for the deer to come out , and then waylay them . This plaii also has the advantage of finding them in bands . Great preparations are made . Old guns are mended , bullets moulded , and the hunters wash themselves and fast to some extent , to insure good luck , as they say . Men and women , old and young , set forth together . Central camps are made on the well-known highways of the deer , which are soon red with blood . Each hunter comes in laden , old crones as well as maidens smiling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each armed with an antlered head , play at buck-fighting , and plague the industrious women , who are busily preparing the meat for transportation , by stealing up behind them and throwing fresh hides over them . But the Indians are passing away here as everywhere , and their red camps on the mountains are fewer every year . There are panthers , foxes , badgers , porcupines , and coyotes in the park , but not in large numbers . I have seen coyotes well back in the range at the head of the Tuolumne Meadows as early as June 1st , before the snow was gone , feeding on marmots ; but they are far more numerous on the inhabited lowlands around ranches , where they enjoy life on chickens , turkeys , quail eggs , ground squirrels , hares , etc. , and all kinds of fruit . Few wild sheep , I fear , are left hereabouts ; for , though safe on the high peaks , they are driven down the // eastern slope of the niountains when the deer are driven down the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fall to a great depth , and there they are within reach of the cattlemen 's rifles . The two squirrels of the park , the Douglas and the California gray , keep all the woods lively . The former is far more abundant and more widely distributed , being found all the way up from the foothills to the dwarf pines on the summit peaks . He is the most influential of the Sierra animals , though small , and the brightest of all the squirrels I know , - a squirrel of squirrels , quick mountain vigor and valor condensed , purely wild , and as free from disease as a sunbeam . One can not think of such an animal ever being weary or sick . He claims all the woods , and is inclined to drive away even men as intruders . How he scolds , and what faces he makes ! If not so comically small , he would be a dreadful fellow . The gray , Sciurus fossor , is the handsomest , I think , of all the large American squirrels . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clearer in color , and more lithe and slender . He dwells in the oak and pine woods up to a height of about five thousand feet above the sea , is rather common in Yosemite Valley , HetchHetchy , Kings River Caffon , and indeed in all the main cafions and Yosemites , but does not like the high fir-covered ridges . Compared with the Douglas , the gray is more than twice as large ; nevertheless , he manages to make his way through the trees with less stir than his small , peppery neighbor , and is much less influential in every way . In the spring , before pine-nuts and hazel-nuts are ripe , he examines last year 's cones for the few seeds that may be left in them between the half-open scales , and gleans fallen nuts and seeds on the ground among the leaves , after making sure that no enemy is nigh . His fine tail floats , now behind , now above him , level or gracefully curled , light and radiant as dry thistledown . His body seems hardly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , emphatic bolt of life , fiery , pungent , full of brag and show and fight , and his movements have none of the elegant deliberation of the gray . They are so quick and keen they almost sting the onlooker , and the acrobatic harlequin gyrating show he makes of himself turns one giddy to see . The gray is shy and oftentimes stealthy , as if half expecting to find an enemy in every tree and bush and behind every log ; he seems to wish to be let alone , and manifests no desire to be seen , or admired , or feared . He is hunted by the Indians , arid this of itself is cause enough for caution . The Douglas is less attractive as game , and is probably increasing in numbers in spite of every enemy . He goes his ways bold as a lion , up and down and across , round and round , the happiest , merriest , of all the hairy tribe , and at the same time tremendously earnest and solemn , sunshine incarnate , making every tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can not think he will bleed . He seems above the chance and change that beset common mortals , though in busily gathering burs and nuts he shows that he has to work for a living , like the rest of us . I never found a dead Douglas . He gets into the world and out of it without being noticed ; only in prime is he seen , like some little plants that are visible only when in bloom . The Townsend tamias , a plump , slow , sober , well-dressed chipmunk , nearly as large as the Douglas squirrel , may occasionally be seen about the roots of the firs or fallen trunks , solemnly staring as if he never had anything to do . The little striped species , 1 ' . quadr'ivittatus , is more interesting and a hundred times more numerous than the Townsend . A brighter , cheerier chipmunk does not exist . He is smarter , more arboreal and squirrel-like , than the familiar Eastern // species , and is distributed as widely on the Sierra as the Douglas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caflon however brushy or bare , is cheered and enlivened by this happy little animal . You are likely to notice him first on the lower edge of the coniferous belt , where the sabine and yellow pines meet ; and thence upward , go where you may , you will find him every day , even in winter , unless the weather is stormy . He is an exceedingly interesting little fellow , full of odd , quaint ways , confiding , thinking no evil ; and without being a squirrel - a true shadow - tail - he lives the life of a squirrel , and has almost all squirrelish accomplishments without aggressive quarrelsomeness . I never weary of watching him as he frisks about in the bushes , gathering seeds and berries ; poising on slender twigs of wild cherry , shad , chinquapin , buckthorn bramble ; skimming along prostrate trunks or over the grassy , needle - strewn forest floor ; darting from boulder to boulder on glacial pavements and the tops of the great domes . When the seeds of the conifers are ripe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winter store , working diligently , though not with the tremendous lightning energy of the Douglas , who frequently drives him out of the best trees . Then he lies in wait , and picks up a share of the burs cut off by his domineering cousin , and stores them beneath logs and in hollows . Few of the Sierra animals are so well liked as this little airy , fluffy half squirrel , half spermophile . So gentle , confiding , and busily cheery and happy , he takes one 's heart and keeps his place among the best loved of the mountain darlings . A diligent collector of seeds , nuts , and berries , of course he is well fed , though never in the least dumpy with fat . On the contrary , he looks like a mere fluff of fur , weighing but little more than a field mouse , and of his frisky , birdlike liveliness without haste there is no end . Douglas can bark with his mouth closed , but little quad always opens his when he talks or sings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his movements , some of them sweet and liquid , like water dripping into a pool with tinkling sound . His eyes are black and animated , shining like dew . He seems dearly to like teasing a dog , venturing within a few feet of it , then frisking away with a lively chipping and low squirrelish churring ; beating time to his music , such as it is , with his tail , which at each chip and churr describes a half circle . Not even Douglas is surerfooted or takes greater risks . I have seen him running about on sheer Yosemite cliffs , holding on with as little effort as a fly and as little thought of danger in places where , if he had made the least slip , he would have fallen thousands of feet . How fine it would be could mountaineers move about on precipices with the same sure grip ! Before the pine - nuts are ripe , grass seeds and those of the many species of ceanothus , with strawberries , raspberries , and the soft red thimbleberries of Rubn*s nutkanus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neater eater is not to be found in the mountains . Bees powdered with pollen , poking their blunt noses into the bells of flowers , are comparatively clumsy and boorish . Frisking along some fallen pine or fir , when the grass seeds are ripe , he looks about him , considering which of the tufts he sees is likely to have the best , runs out to it , selects what he thinks is sure to be a good head , cuts it off , carries it to the top of the log , sits upright and nibbles out the grain without getting awns in his mouth , turning the head round , holding it and fingering it as if playing on a flute ; then skips for another and another , bringing them to the same dining-log . The woodchuck - Arctomys monax - dwells on high bleak ridges and boulder piles ; and a very different sort of mountaineer is he , - bulky , fat , aldermanic. // and fairly bloated at times by hearty indulgence in the lush pastures of his airy home . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the midst of what we regard as storm-beaten desolation , high in the frosty air , beside the glaciers , he pipes and whistles right cheerily , and lives to a good old age . If you are as early a riser as he is , you may oftentimes see him come blinking out of his burrow to meet the first beams of the morning and take a sunbath on some favorite flat-topped boulder . Afterward , well warmed , he goes to breakfast in one of his garden hollows , eats heartily like a cow in clover until comfortably swollen , then goes a-visiting , and plays and loves and fights . In the spring of 1875 , when I was exploring the peaks and glaciers about the head of the middle fork of the San Joaquin , I had crossed the range from the head of Owen River , and one morning , passing around a frozen lake where the snow was perhaps ten feet deep , I was surprised to find the fresh track of a woodchuck plainly marked , the sun having softened the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so early while all the ground was snow-buried ? The steady trend of his track showed he had a definite aim , and fortunately it was toward a mountain thirteen thousand feet high that I meant to climb . So I followed to see if I could find out what he was up to . From the base of the mountain the track pointed straight up , and I knew by the melting snow that I was not far behind him . I lost the track on a crumbling ridge , partly projecting through the snow , but soon discovered it again . Well toward the summit of the mountain , in an open spot on the south side , nearly inclosed by disintegrating pinnacles among which the sun heat reverberated , making an isolated patch of warm climate , I found a nice garden , full of rock cress , phlox , silene , draba , etc. , and a few grasses ; and in this garden I overtook the wanderer , enjoying a fine fresh meal , per . haps the first of the season . How did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and far off , and what told him that it was in bloom while yet the snow was ten feet deep over his den ? For this it would seem he would need more botanical , topographical , and climatological knowledge than most mountaineers are possessed of . The shy , curious mountain beaver - Haplodon - lives on the heights , not far from the woodchuck . He digs canals and controls the flow of small streams under the sod , cuts large quantities of grass , lupines , and other plants , lays them out in neat piles with the stems all one way to dry , like hay , and stores them in underground chambers . These hayfields on the mountain tops , showing busy , thoughtful life where one deemed himself alone , are startling . And it is startling , too , when one is camped on the edge of a sloping meadow near the homes of these industrious mountaineers , to be awakened in the still night by the sound of water rushing and gurgling under one 's head in a newly formed canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campers that is quite as exciting as the haplodon 's plan ; that is , by a series of firm upward pushes when they are driving tunnels and shoving up the dirt . One naturally cries out , " Who s there ? " and then discovering the cause , " All right . Go on . Goodnight , " and goes to sleep again . The wood rat - Neotoma - is one of the most interesting of the Sierra animals . He is scarcely at all like the common rat , is nearly twice as large , has a delicate soft fur of a bluish slate color , white on the belly , large ears thin and translucent , eyes full and liquid and mild in expression , nose blunt and squirrelish , slender claws sharp as needles , and as his limbs are strong he can climb about as well as a squirrel ; while no rat or squirrel has so innocent a look , is so easily approached , or in general ex // presses so much confidence iii one s good intentions . He seems too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , rough hut is as unlike himself as possible . No other animal in these mountains makes nests so large and striking in appearance as his . They are built of all kinds of sticks ( broken branches , and old rotten moss-grown chunks , and green twigs , smooth or thorny , cut from the nearest bushes ) , mixed with miscellaneous rubbish and curious odds and ends , - bits of cloddy earth , stones , bones , bits of deer-horn , etc. : the whole supply piled in conical masses on the ground in chaparral thickets . Some of these cabins are five or six feet high , and occasionally a dozen or more are grouped together ; less , perhaps , for society 's sake than for advantages of food and shelter . Coming through deep , stiff chaparral in the heart of the wilderness , heated and weary in forcing a way , the solitary explorer , happening into one of these curious neotoma villages , is startled at the strange sight , and may imagine he is in an Indian village , and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place so wild . At first , perhaps , not a single inhabitant will be seen , or at most only two or three seated on the tops of their huts as at the doors , observing the stranger with the mildest of mild eyes . The nest in the centre of the cabin is made of grass and films of bark chewed to tow , and lined with feathers and the down of various seeds . The thick , rough walls seem to be built for defense against enemies - fox , coyote , etc.  --  as well as for shelter , and the delicate creatures , in their big , rude homes , suggest tender flowers , like those of Salz'ia carduacea , defended by thorny involucres . Sometimes the home is built in the forks of an oak , twenty or thirty feet from the ground , and even in garrets . Among housekeepers who have these bushmen as neighbors or guests they are regarded as thieves , because they carry away and pile together everything trans portable ( knives , forks , tin cups , spoons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as eatables of all sorts ) , to strengthen their fortifications or to shine among rivals . Once , far back in the High Sierra , they stole my snow - goggles , the lid of my teapot , and my aneroid barometer ; and one stormy night , when encamped under a prostrate cedar , I was awakened by a gritting sound on the granite , and by the light of my fire I discovered a handsome neotoma beside me , dragging away my ice-hatchet , pulling with might and main by a buckskin string on the handle . I threw bits of bark at him and made a noise to frighten him , but he stood scolding and chattering back at me , his fine eyes shining with an air of injured innocence . A great variety of lizards enliven the warm portions of the park . Some of them are more than a foot in length , others but little larger than grasshopper* . A few are snaky and repulsive at first sight , but most of the species are handsome and attractive , and bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see into their charming lives . Small fellow mortals , gentle and guileless , they are easily tamed , and have beautiful eyes , expressing the clearest innocence , so that , in spite of prejudices brought from cool , lizardless countries , one must soon learn to like them . Even the horned toad of the plains and foothills , called horrid , is mild and gentle , with charming eyes , and so are the snakelike species found in the underbrush of the lower forests . These glide in curves with all the ease and grace of snakes , while their small , undeveloped limbs drag for the most part as useless appendages . One specimen that I measured was fourteen inches long , and as far as I saw it made no use whatever of its diminutive limbs . Most of them glint and dart on the sunny rocks and across open spaces from bush to bush , swift as dragonflies and humming-birds , and about as brilliantly // 629 colored . They never make a long-sustained run , whatever their object , but dart direct as arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly stop , and as suddenly start again . These stops are necessary as rests , for they are short-winded , and when pursued steadily are soon run out of breath , pant pitifully , and may easily be caught where no retreat in bush or rock is quickly available . If you stay with them a week or two and behave well , these gentle saurians , descendants of an ancient race of giants , will soon know and trust you , come to your feet , play , and watch your every motion with cunning curiosity . You will surely learn to like them , not only the bright ones , gorgeous as the rainbow , but the little ones , gray as lichened granite , and scarcely bigger than grasshoppers ; and they will teach you that scales may cover as fine a nature as hair or feathers or anything tailored . There are many snakes in the caftons and lower forests , but they are mostly handsome and harmless . Of all the tourists and travelers who have visited Yosemite and the adjacent mountains , not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while thousands have been charmed by them . Some of them vie with the lizards in beauty of color and dress patterns . Only the rattlesnake is venomous , and he carefully keeps his venom to himself as far as man is concerned , unless his life is threatened . Before I learned to respect rattlesnakes I killed two , the first on the San Joaquin plain . He was coiled comfortably around a tuft of bunch-grass , and I discovered him when he was between my feet as I was stepping over him . He held his head down and did not attempt to strike , although in danger of being trampled . At that time , thirty years ago , I imagined that rattlesnakes should be killed wherever found . I had no weapon of any sort , and on the smooth plain there was not a stick or a stone within miles ; so I crushed him by jumping on him , as the deer are said to do . Looking me in the face he saw I meant mischief , and quickly cast himself into a coil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not strike when traveling , therefore I threw handfuls of dirt and grass sods at him , to tease him out of coil . He held his ground a few minutes , threatening and striking , and then started off to get rid of me . I ran forward and jumped on him ; but he drew back his head so quickly my heel missed , and he also missed his stroke at me . Persecuted , tormented , again and again he tried to get away , bravely striking out to protect himself ; but at last my heel came squarely down , sorely wounding him , and a few more brutal stampings crushed him . I felt degraded by the killing business , farther from heaven , and I made up my mind to try to be at least as fair and charitable as the snakes themselves , and to kill no more save in self-defense . The second killing might also , I think , have been avoided , and I have always felt somewhat sore and guilty about it . I had built a little cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the sake of music and society , I led a small stream from Yosemite Creek into it . Running along the side of the wall it was not in the way , and it had just fall enough to ripple and sing in low , sweet tones , making delightful company , especially at night when I was lying awake . Then a few frogs came in and made merry with the stream , - and one snake , I suppose to catch the frogs . Returning from my long walks , I usually brought home a large handful of plants , partly for study , partly for ornameat , and set them in a corner of the cabin , with their stems in the stream to keep them fresh . One day , when I picked up a handful that had begun to fade , I uncovered a large coiled rattler that had been hiding behind the flowers . Thus suddenly brought to light face to // face with the rightful owner of the place , the poor reptile was desperately embarrassed , evidently realizing that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that he showed , but a good deal of downright bashfulness and embarrassment , like that of a more than half honest person caught under suspicious circumstances behind a door . Instead of striking or threatening to strike , though coiled and ready , he slowly drew his head down as far as he could , with awkward , confused kinks in his neck and a shamefaced expression , as if wishing the ground would open and hide him . I have looked into the eyes of so many wild animals that I feel sure I did not mistake the feelings of this unfortunate snake . I did not want to kill him , but I had many visitors , some of them children , and I oftentimes came in late at night ; so I judged he must die . Since then I have seen perhaps a hundred or more in these mountains , but I have never intentionally disturbed them , nor have they disturbed me to any great extent , even by accident , though in danger of being stepped on . Once , while I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arch made by my arm . He was only going away from the ground I had selected for a camp , and there was not the slightest danger , because I kept still and allowed him to go in peace . The only time I felt myself in serious danger was when I was coming out of the Tuolumne Cafion by a steep side cai'ion toward the head of Yosemite Creek . On an earthquake talus , a boulder in my way presented a front so high that I could just reach the upper edge of it while standing on the next below it . Drawing myself up , as soon as my head was above the flat top of it I caught sight of a coiled rattler . My hands had alarmed him , and he was rea ( ly for me ; but even with this provocation , and when my head came in sight within a foot of him , he did not strike . The last time I sauntered through the big cafion I saw about two a day . One was not coiled , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the river , his head below the level of them , ready to shoot up like a Jack-in-the-box for frogs or birds . My foot spanned the space above within an inch or two of his head , but he only held it lower . In making my way through a particularly tedious tangle of buckthorn , I parted the branches on the side of an open spot and threw my bundle of bread into it ; and when , with my arms free , I was pushing through after it , I saw a small rattlesnake dragging his tail from beneath my bundle . When he caught sight of me he eyed me angrily , and with an air of righteous indignation seemed to be asking why I had thrown that stuff on him . He was so small that I was inclined to slight him , but he struck out so angrily that I drew back , and approached the opening from the other side . But he had been listening , and when I looked through the brush I found him confronting me , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain that I only wanted my bread ; he stoutly held the ground in front of it ; so I went back a dozen rods and kept still for half an hour , and when I returned he had gone . One evening , near sundown , in a very rough , boulder-choked portion of the cai'ion , I searched long for a level spot for a bed , and at last was glad to find a patch of flood-sand on the river-bank , and a lot of driftwood close by for a camp-fire . But when I threw down my bundle , I found two snakes in possession of the ground . I might have passed the night even in this snake den without danger , for I never knew a single instance of their coming into camp in the night ; but fearing that , in so small a space , some late comers , not aware of my presence , might get stepped on , when I was replenishing the fire , to avoid possible crowding I encamped on one of the earthquake boulders . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was exploring the basin of Yosemite Creek I thought I had discovered a new one . I saw a snake with curious divided appendages on its head . Going nearer , I found that the strange headgear was only the feet of a frog . Cutting a switch I struck the snake lightly until he disgorged the poor frog , or rather allowed it to back out . On its return to the light from one of the very darkest of death valleys , it blinked a moment with a sort of dazed look , then plunged into a stream , apparently happy and well . Frogs abound in all the bogs , marshes , pools , and lakes , however cold and high and isolated . How did they manage to get up these high mountains ? Surely not by jumping . Long and dry excursions through weary miles of boulders and brush would be trying to frogs . Most likely their stringy spawn is carried on the feet of ducks , cranes , and other waterbirds . Anyhow , they are most thoroughly distributed , and flourish famously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how bravely their krink and tronk concerts enliven the rocky wilderness ! None of the high - lying mountain lakes or branches of the rivers above sheer falls had fish of any sort until stocked by the agency of man . In the High Sierra , the only river in which trout exist naturally is the middle fork of Kings River . There are no sheer falls on this stream ; some of the rapids , however , are so swift and rough , even at the lowest stage of water , that it is surprising any fish can climb them . I found trout in abundance in this fork up to seventy-five hundred feet . They also run quite high on the Kern . On the Merced they get no higher than Yosemite Valley , four thousand feet , all the forks of the river being barred there by sheer falls , and on the main Tuolumne they are stopped by a fall below HetchHetchy , still lower than Yosemite . Though these upper waters are inaccessible to the fish , one would suppose their eggs might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of doing such things . In this case she waited for the agency of man , and now many of these hitherto fishless lakes and streams are full of fine trout , stocked by individual enterprise , Walton clubs , etc. , in great part under the auspices of the United States Fish Commission . A few trout carried into Hetch-Hetchy iii a common water-bucket have multiplied wonderfully fast . Lake Tenaya , at an elevation of over eight thousand feet , was stocked eight years ago by Mr. Murphy , who carried a few trout from Yosemite . Many of the small streams of the eastern slope have also been stocked with trout transported over the passes in tin cans on the backs of mules . Soon , it would seem , all the streams of the range will be enriched by these lively fish , and will become the means of drawing thousands of visitors into the mountains . Catching trout with a bit of bent wire is a rather trivial business , but fortunately people fish better than they know . In most cases it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching men , for the saving of both body and soul , is important , and deserves all the expense and care bestowed on it.
