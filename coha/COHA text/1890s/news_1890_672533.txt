txt News was received on the Cotton Exchange yesterday morning of the mysterious death of William Bornemann , one of the best known and wealthiest representatives of the European cotton merchants in this country . When the details of his death became known they revealed a story in many ways resembling that of the sad fate of the late Charles Delmonico , whose body was found In the Orange Mountains . On Saturday a dispatch from Charleston , B. C. , announced the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Bornemann . He was a member of the firm of Knoop , Frerichs &; Co. , a house ranking among the most prominent cotton concerns of the world , and having headquarters in Moseovr , with branches in.New-York , Charleston , New-Orleans , Galveston , Bremen , and Manchester , England . Mr. Bornemann was Vice Consul for the Netherlands , and , in conjunction with William K. Steedman , who was associated with him in business , had charge of the Charleston and New-Orleans branches of the firm of Knoop , Frerichs &; Co . For some time Mr. Bornemann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give witylo fits of melancholia . It was also stated that he had been heard to remark that , if business did not improve , there - would be nothing left for him to do but to " jump off the dock " ; but no attention was paid . to these remarks at the time . Last Friday morning Mr. Bornemann was found to be missing from his home in Hasel Street , Charleston , and in view of his state of mind the general supposition was that he had taken his own life . When the report of his disappearance had been circulated throughout the city of Charleston , Charles E. Rainer , engineer of the tug Hercules , and Capt . James J. Igoe of the pilot boat I Go , who had been on the South Atlantic , Wharf in that city between -1 and 5 o'clock Friday morning , made a statement to the effect that about that time , the weather being " thick , " they heard a splash in the water as if a person had jumped from the pier . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if from a drowning person . The tugboat 's engineer and the pilot boat 's Captain apparently investigated this occurrence to the best of their ability , and when they heard of Mr. Bornemann'e disappearance they naturally came to the conclusion that it was he who had committed suicide by jumping into the water from the wharf . This was believed to be the correct solution of the cotton broker 's abgenes from his home and office on Friday until , as dispatches received yesterday by K. Meissner and Adolph Norden , members of the Cotton Exchange in this city , stated , the body of Mr. Bornemann was found yesterday morning in a marsh at Magnolia , a suburb of Charleston . These dispatches also said that there was not the slightest doubt that the dead man had wandered away from his home while suffering from aberration of mind . It seems that on Thursday night Mr. Bornemann 's associate in business , Mr. Steadman , passed the evening with him and remained at the Hasel Street house until about 11 o'clock . At that hour Mr. Bornemann 's housekeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , remarking that she would then be able to get Mr. Bornemann to his room and give him a " sleeping draught " to keep him quiet . For some time past , it appears . in addition to suffering from melancholia , Mr. Bornemann had been suffering from insomnia , and had been forced to induce sleep by taking drugs , whether or not . The dispatches say that ho went quietly to his room Thursday night and placed his watch , purse , and other valuables on a bureau near his bed . That is the last the housekeeper saw of him alive . Between midnight and 1 o'clock Friday morning a colored man saw Mr. Bornemann walking rapidly through one of the streets of Charleston apparently in the boat of health and spirits . This was the last seen of him until his body was found in the marsh at Magnolia . The general theory ie that . finding himself unable to sleep , he resolved to take a walk , and in his enfeebled state of mind wandered on and on until , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He left his watch , money , and collar and cuffs on the bureau in his bedroom . From K. Meissner , the chief representative of Knoop , Frerichs &; Co. in this country , whose offices are in the Cotton Exchange Building , and from Adolph Norden of 52 Exchange Place the following particulars as to the deadman 's career were obtained : Mr. Bornemann was born in Bremen about forty-three years ago . He came to this country in 1866 and entered the New-York office of Knoop , Frerichs &; Co . He came of an excellent family , and was a nephew of Baron Knoop , the bead of the firm . boon after his arrival in this country young Bornemann was placed in charge of a branch house which Knoop , Frerichs &; Co. then had in savannah , Ga. , and when that branch was abolished he was plaood in charge of the Charleston house . After several yews in Charleston , Mr. Bornemann married Miss Bischoff of that city , by whom ho had three children , Some time ago Mr. Bornemann took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome residence for them in Bremen . About five weeks ago lie returned to this city by the steamship Ems , leaving his family at Bremen . His friends in this city then noticed that his health seemed to be improved , though he was still suffering slightly from his old complaint , melancholia .. and was in the habit of worrying over trifles , though his financial condition was said to be most satisfactory . He was looked upon as a rich man outsiae of the fact that his Charleston business was worth about $120,000 a year to him . When Mr. Bornemann returned to this country he was accompanied by his mother-in-law and by a brother . All reports as to Mr. Bornemann having committed suicide are positively denied by Messrs . Meissner andNordeu.
