txt Senor Lopez , secretary to Agoncillo , the Washington representative of Aguinaldo , called at the State Department at 1 o'clock this afternoon and lodged with the chief clerk a communication from Agoncillo. which , according to the common expectation , marked the critical stage in the Philippine question . In his communication Agoncillo calls attention to the fact that on Jan. 11 he addressed a letter to the Secretary of State upon the question of recognition , forwarding with it a memorandum demonstrating that according to all American precedents , the Philippine Republic was entitled to recognition and in the same letter invited the attention of the Secretary to the present strained conditions at Manila , where over-zeal on either side might create a condition resulting in grievous loss of life , and urging the necessity of an early and frank communication between the representatives of the two countries . He now desires t ' call attention to certain conditiors which in his opinion , require immediate alleviation . There are , he says , at the pre , sent time 20,000 American troops at Manila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war vessels are stationed in the harbor , and many other American men-of-war and transports are to be found within the archipelago , although the actual possession of the American troops extends over not more than 143 square miles out of more than 200,000 . " Despite the enormous forces now in this extremely circumscribed area , " he continnPS , " we are informed through the public prints that other vessels of war have been ordered from distant parts of the globe to reinforce th- e now among the islands in question , while a few days ago a transport sailed from New York carrying about 2000 soldiers , and having Manila as its destination , and , we are further informed , regiments of troops are under orders to proceed by way of San Francisco to the Philippine : The public prints inform us also that an attack is contemplated upon the Philippine Islands ; the islands to be taken in detail  --  the smaller ones first , the larger ones blockaded so that - they may not assist those first attacked . " He says the t it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these warlike preparations indicate existing or immediate military operations in the Orient , and they readily conceive that it must be contemplated that such operations are to be leveled at the existing Government of the Philippines . " As the representative of the Philippine Government , ' he goes on , " I hesitate to give adhesion to this idea , for I can not believe that there is any present or future difficulty between the American and Philippine Governments justifying warlike activity , and , as a believer in the humanity of the American people , refuse to acquiesce in the idea that America has designs on the Philippine Islands . " He points out that the Philippines are in a state of order , possessing a Government satisfactory to their inhabitants , and without an enemy within their borders offering any resistance to its operations , and are at peace with all the world , and says that , notwithstaading the difficuty he labors under in not having been formally received , he considers it his imperative duty to call the attention of the Secretary to the disturbing conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such assurances as will satisfy his Government that it is not the intention of America to make war upon the new republic , which will explain to it the reason why large armies and navies should be dispatched to the Philippine Islands , and which will relieve his countrymen of the fear that now possesses them that their liberties are in danger at the hands of the Republic whose name they have always believed was associated with freedom and to which they first came for recognition .
