txt In her address proroguing the British , Parliament the Queen says : " . I have given notice to the King of the Belgians and the German Emperor to terminate the treaties of 1862 and 1865 , whereby I am prevented from making with my colonies such fiscal arrangements within my empire as seem to me expedient . " This is not a very complete or entirely candid statement of what the British Government has really sought . The trouble with these treaties was that they forbade the admission of British goods into British colonies at rates lower than were charged on the goods of Belgium and Germany . Canada , partly in return for certain financial advantages , desired to give better terms to imports from the mother country than to any others . In order to permit Canada to do this the treaties had to be terminated . We ' note that our protectionist friends say that this is a step away from free trade by Great Britain . It is really a - step toward giving the colonies greater commercial independence than they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protectionism in it for England . She does not agree or propose to tax the imports of goods from other countries any higher than those from the colonies . On the contrary , the treaties will probably be renewed'on practically the same basis as at present , except-that they will not apply to the colonies , or at least to Canada . The project for taxing foreign trade and leaving trade between the colonies and England free has not yet been advocated openly - even by Mr. CHAMBERLAIN . Were he to undertake it , it would probably be fatal to his reputation as a politician and statesman . The English trader is too hard-headed to wish to see four-fifths of his business taxed on the chance that the other fifth may be benefited . He has some queer streaks , but he rarely plays the part of the dog on the bridge and lets go the substance to snap at the shadow .
