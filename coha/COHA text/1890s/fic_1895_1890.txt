" P.S. -- He is not verry torl but growin . My brutther is a verry good hite. i am sharp and can rede and rite and can hadd figgers if you like . " * * * * * * * CHAPTER I. I had advertised for a page-boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less illegible and impossible to understand , had come to the last one of the packet , of which the above is an exact copy . The epistle was enclosed in a clumsy envelope , evidently home-made , with the aid of scissors and gum , and was written on a half-sheet of letter-paper , in a large hand , with many blots and smears , on pencilled lines . There was something quaint and straightforward in the letter , in spite of the utter ignorance of grammar and spelling ; and while I smiled at the evident pride in the " brutther " who was a " verry good hite , " and the offer to take less wages if " I would do his washin , " I found myself wondering what sort of waif upon the sea of life was this not very tall person , over thirteen , who " would serve me well . " I had many letters to answer and several appointments to make , and had scarcely made up my mind whether or not to trouble to write to my accomplished correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rite , and hadd figgers , " when , a shadow falling on the ground by me as I sat by the open window , I looked up , and saw , standing opposite my chair , a boy ,  - -  the very smallest boy , with the very largest blue eyes I ever saw . The clothes on his little limbs were evidently meant for somebody almost double his size , but they were clean and tidy . In one hand he held a bundle , tied in a red handkerchief , and in the other a bunch of wild-flowers that bore signs of having travelled far in the heat of the sun , their blossoms hanging down , dusty and fading , and their petals dropping one by one on the ground . " Who are you , my child ? " I said , " and what do you want ? " At my question the boy placed his flowers on my table , and , pulling off his cap , made a queer movement with his feet , as though he were trying to step backwards with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep that it quite startled me , so strangely did it seem to belong to the size of the clothes , and not the wearer ,  --  " Please 'm , it 's J. Cole ; and I 've come to live with yer . I 've brought all my clothes , and every think . " For the moment I felt a little bewildered , so impossible did it seem that the small specimen of humanity before me was actually intending to enter anybody 's service ; he looked so childish and wistful , and yet with a certain honesty of purpose shining out of those big , wide- open eyes , that interested me in him , and made me want to know more of him . " You are very small to go into service , " I said , " and I am afraid you could not do the work I should require ; besides , you should have waited to hear from me , and then have come to see me , if I wanted you to do so . " " Yes , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nervously fidgeting with his bundle ; " leastways not in hite ; but my arms is that long , they 'll reach ever so ' igh above my ' ed , and as for bein ' strong , you should jest see me lift my father 's big market basket when it 's loaded with ' taters , or wotever is for market , and I hope you 'll not be angry because I come to-day ; but Dick -- that 's my brutther Dick -- he says , ' You foller my advice , Joe , ' he says , ' and go after this ' ere place , and do n't let no grass grow under your feet . I knows what it is goin ' after places ; there 's such lots a fitin ' after ' em , that if you lets so much as a hour go afore yer looks ' em up , there 's them as slips in fust gets it ; and wen yer goes to the door they opens it and sez , " It ai n't no use , boy , we 're sooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know ? So , ' sez he , ' Joe , you look sharp and go , and maybe you 'll get it . ' So I come , mum , and please , that 's all . " " But about your character , my boy , " I said . " You must have somebody to speak for you , and say you are honest , and what you are able to do . I always want a good character with my servants ; the last page- boy I had brought three years ' good character from his former situation . " " Lor ! " said Joe , with a serious look , " did he stay three years in a place afore he came to you ? Wotever did he leave them people for , where he were so comfortable ? If I stay with you three years , you wo n't catch me a leavin ' yer , and goin ' somewheres else . Wot a muff that chap was ! " I explained that it did not always depend on whether a servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employers to keep him . " ' Praps he did somethin ' , and they giv ' ' im the sack , " murmured Joe ; " he was a flat ! " " But about this character of yours , " I said ; " if I decide to give you a trial , although I am almost sure you are too small , and wo n't do , where am I to go for your character ? Will the people where your brother lives speak for you ? " " Oh , yes ! " cried the little fellow , his cheeks flushing ; " I know Dick 'll ask ' em to give me a caricter . Miss Edith , I often cleaned ' er boots . Once she come ' ome in the mud , and was a-goin ' out agin directly ; and they was lace-ups , and a orful bother to do up even ; and she come into the stable-yard with ' er dog , and sez : ' Dick , will you chain Tiger up , and this little boy may clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' So I cleaned ' em , and she giv ' me sixpence ; and after that , when the boots come down in the mornin ' , I got Dick always to let me clean them little boots , and I kep ' em clean in the insides , like the lady 's maid she told me not to put my ' ands inside ' em if they was black . Miss Edith , she 'll giv me a caricter , if Dick asks ' er . " Just then the visitors ' bell rang ; and I sent my would-be page into the kitchen to wait until I could speak to him again , and told him to ask the cook to give him something to eat . " Here are your flowers , " I said ; " take them with you . " He looked at me , and then , as if ashamed of having offered them , gathered them up in his hands , and with the corner of the red handkerchief wiped some few leaves and dust-marks off my table , then saying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ad beauties of yer own , like them in the glass pots , but I 'll giv ' ' em to the cook . " So saying , he went away into the kitchen , and my visitors came in , and by and by some more friends arrived . The weather was very warm , and we sat chattering and enjoying the shade of the trees by the open French window . Presently , somebody being thirsty , I suggested lemonade and ice , and I offered strawberries , and ( if possible ) cream ; though my mind misgave me as to the latter delicacy , for we had several times been obliged to do without some of our luxuries if they entailed " fetching , " as we had no boy to run errands quickly on an emergency and be useful . However , I rang the bell ; and when the housemaid , whose temper , since she had been what is curiously termed in servants ' - hall language " single- handed , " was most trying , entered , I said , " Make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberries quickly , and bring them , with some cream . " Mary looked at me as who should say , " Well , I 'm sure ! and who 's to do it all ? You 'll have to wait a bit . " And I know we should have to wait , and therefore resigned myself to do so patiently , keeping up the ball of gossip , and wondering if a little music later on would perhaps while away the time . Much to my amazement , in less than a quarter of an hour Mary entered with the tray , all being prepared ; and directly I looked at the strawberry-bowl I detected a novel feature in the table decoration . A practised hand had evidently been at work ; but whose ? Mary was far too matter-of-fact a person . Food , plates , knives and forks , glasses , and a cruet-stand were all she ever thought necessary ; and even for a centre vase of flowers I had to ask , and often to insist , during the time she was single-handed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when unadorned , with its pure white porcelain stem , intwined with a wreath of blue convolvulus , and then a spray of white , the petals just peeping over the edge of the bowl , and resting near the luscious red fruit ; the cream-jug , also white , had twining flowers of blue , and round the lemonade-jug , of glass , was a wreath of yellow blossoms . " How exquisite ! " exclaimed we all . " What fairy could have bestowed such a treat to our eyes and delight to our sense of the beautiful ? " I supposed some friend of the cook 's or Mary 's had been taking lessons in the art of decoration , and had given us a specimen . Soon after , my friends having gone , I thought of J. Cole waiting to be dismissed , and sent for him . Cook came in , and with a preliminary " Ahem ! " which I knew of old meant , " I have an idea of my own , and I mean to get it carried out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I might be so bold , did you think serious of engagin ' the boy that 's waitin ' in the kitchen ? " " Why do you ask , Cook ? " I said . " Well , ma'am , " she replied , trying to hide a laugh , " of course it 's not for me to presume ; but , if I might say a word for him , I think he 's the very handiest and the sharpest one we 've ever had in this house , and we 've had a many , as you know . Why , if you 'd only have seen him when Mary come in in her tantrums at ' aving to get the tray single-handed , and begun a-grumblin ' and a-bangin ' things about , as is her way , being of a quick temper , though , as I tells her , too slow a-movin ' of herself . As I were a-sayin ' , you should have seen that boy . If he did n't up and leave his bread and butter and mug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' arty as you like , and , ' Look ' ere , ' says he , ' giv ' me the jug . I 'll make some fine drink with lemons . I see Dick do it often up at his place . Giv ' me the squeezer . Wait till I washes my ' ands . I wo n't be a minnit . ' Then in he rushes into the scullery , washes his hands , runs back again in a jiffy . ' Got any snow sugar ? I mean all done fine like snow . ' I gave it him ; and , sure enough , his little hands moved that quick , he had made the lemonade before Mary would have squeezed a lemon . ' Where do yer buy the cream ? ' he says next . ' I 'll run and get it while you picks the strawberries . ' Perhaps it was n't right , me a trustin ' him , being a stranger , but he was that quick I could n't say no . Up he takes the jug , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden with the strawberries , if he had n't been and put all them flowers on the things . He begs my pardon for interfering like , and says , ' I ' ope you 'll excuse me a-doin ' of it , but the woman at the milk-shop said I might ' ave ' em ; and I see the butler where Dick lives wind the flowers about like that , and ' ave ' elped ' im often ; and , please , I paid for the cream , because I 'd got two bob of my own , Dick giv ' me on my birthday . Oh , I do ' ope , Mrs. Cook , ' he says , ' that the lady 'll take me ; I ' ll serve ' er well , I will , indeed ; ' and then he begins to cry and tremble , poor little chap , for he 'd been running about a lot , and never eaten or drank what I gave him , because he wanted to help , and it was hot in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he is , crying ; and just now , when the bell rung , which was two great big boys after the place , he says , ' Oh , please say " We 're sooted , " and ask the lady if I may stay . ' So , I 've taken the liberty , ma'am , " said Cook , " for somehow I like that little chap , and there 's a deal in him , I do believe . " So saying , Cook retired ; and , in a moment , J. Cole was standing in her place , the blue eyes brimming over with tears , and an eager anxiety as to what his fate would be making his poor little hands clutch at his coat-sleeves , and his feet shuffle about so nervously , that I had not the courage to grieve him by a refusal . " Well , Joseph , " I said , " I have decided to give you a month 's trial . I shall write to the gentleman who employs your brother ; and if he speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And may I stay now , please ? " he said . " May I stay before you gets any answer to your letter to say I 'm all right ? I think you 'd better let me ; there ai n't no boy ; and Mrs. Cook and Mary 'll ' ave a lot to do . I can stay in the stable , if you do n't like to let me be in the house , afore you writes the letter . " " No , Joe , " I replied : " you may not be a good , honest boy , but I think you are ; and you shall stay here . Now go back to Mrs. Wilson , and finish your milk , and eat something more if you can , then have a good rest and a wash ; they will show you where you are to sleep , and at dinner , this evening , I shall see if you can wait at table . " " Thank you very kindly , " said the boy , his whole face beaming with delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can for you . " Then he went quickly out of the room ; for I could see he was quite overcome , now that the uncertainty was over . Alone once more , I reasoned with myself , and felt I was doing an unwise thing . Just at that time my husband was away on business for some months ; and I had no one to advise me , and no one to say me nay either . My conscience told me my husband would say , " We can not tell who this boy is , where he has lived , or who are his associates ; he may be connected with a gang of thieves for what we know to the contrary . Wait , and have proper references before trusting him in the house . " And he would be right to say so to me , but not every one listens to conscience when it points the opposite way to inclination . Well , J. Cole remained ; and when I entered the dining-room , to my solitary dinner , he was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls evidently soaped too , to make them go tidily on his forehead . The former page having left his livery jacket and trousers , Mary had let Joe dress in them , at his earnest request . She told me afterwards that he had sewn up the clothes in the neatest manner wherever they could be made smaller ; and the effect of the jacket , which he had stuffed out in the chest with hay , as we discovered by the perfume , was very droll . He had a great love of bright colors , and the trousers being large , showed bright red socks ; the jacket sleeves being much too short for the long arms , of which he was so proud , allowed the wristbands of a vivid blue flannel shirt to be seen . I was alone , so could put up with this droll figure at my elbow ; but the seriousness of his face was such a contrast to the comicality of the rest of him , that I found myself beginning to smile every now and then , but directly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become grave at once . The waiting at table I could not exactly pronounce a success ; for , although Joe 's quick eyes detected in an instant if I wanted anything , his anxiety to be " first in the field , " and give Mary no chance of instructing him in his duties , made him collide against her more than once in his hasty rushes to the sideboard and back to my elbow with the dishes , which he generally handed to me long before he reached me , his long arms enabling him to reach me with his hands while he was yet some distance from me , and often on the wrong side . I also noticed when I wanted water he lifted the water-bottle on high , and poured as though it was something requiring a " head . " Mary nearly caused a catastrophe at that moment by frowning at him , and saying , sotto voce , " Whatever are you doing ? Is that the way to pour out water ? It ai n't hale , stoopid ! " Joe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized a dish-cover , and hastily went out of the room with it , returning in a moment pale and serious as became one who at heart was every inch a family butler with immense responsibilities . Joe was quiet and sharp , quick and intelligent ; but I could see he was quite new to waiting at table . To remove a dish was , I could see , his greatest dread ; and it amused me to see the cleverness with which he managed that Mary should do that part of the duty . When only my plate and a dish remained to be cleared away , he would slowly get nearer as I got towards the last morsel , and before Mary had time , would take my plate , and go quite slowly to the sideboard with it , leisurely remove the knife and fork , watching meanwhile in the mirror if Mary was about to take the dish away ; if not he would take something outside , or bring a decanter , and ask if I wanted wine . I was , however , pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been , and when , having swept the grate and placed my solitary wineglass and dessert-plate on the table , he retired , softly closing the door after him , I felt I should make something of J. Cole , and hoped his character would be good . CHAPTER II . The next morning a tastefully arranged vase of flowers in the centre of the breakfast-table , and one magnificent rose and bud by my plate , were silent but eloquent appeals to my interest on behalf of my would-be page ; and when Joe himself appeared , fresh from an hour 's self-imposed work in my garden , I saw he had become quite one of the family ; for Bogie , my little terrier , usually very snappish to strangers , and who considered all boys as his natural enemies , was leaping about his feet , evidently asking for more games , and our old magpie was perched familiarly on his shoulder . " Good-morning , Joe , " I said . " You are an early riser , I can see , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , yes , " replied Joe , blushing , and touching an imaginary cap ; " I 'm used to bein ' up . There was ever so much to do of a mornin ' at ' ome ; and I ' ad to ' elp father afore I could go to be with Dick , and I was with Dick a'most every mornin ' by seven , and a good mile and a arf to walk to ' is place . Shall I bring in the breakfust , mum ? Mary 's told me what to do . " Having given permission , Joe set to work to get through his duties , this time without any help , and I actually trembled when I saw him enter with a tray containing all things necessary for my morning meal , he looked so over-weighted ; but he was quite equal to it as far as landing the tray safely on the sideboard . But , alas ! then came the ordeal ; not one thing did poor Joe know where to place , and stood with the coffeepot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at the end of the table , or whether he was to pour out my coffee for me . I saw he was getting very nervous , so took it from him , and in order to put him at his ease , I remarked ,  --  " I think , perhaps , I had better show you , Joe , just for once , how I like my breakfast served , for every one has little ways of their own , you know ; and you will try to do it my way when you know how I like it , wo n't you ? " Thereupon I arranged the dishes , etc. , for him , and his big eyes followed my every movement . The blinds wanted pulling down a little presently , and then I began to realize one of the drawbacks in having such a very small boy as page . Joe saw the sun 's rays were nearly blinding me , and wanted to shut them out ; but on attempting to reach the tassel attached to the cord , it was hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched to their utmost , till the sleeves of the ex-page 's jacket retreated almost to Joe 's elbows , but no use . I watched , curious to see what he would do . " Please ' m , might I fetch an ' all chair ? " said Joe ; " I 'm afraid I 'm not big enuf to reach the tossle , but I wo n't pull ' em up so ' igh to- morrow . " I gave permission , and carefully the chair was steered among my tables and china pots . Then Joe mounted , and by means of rising on the tips of his toes he was able to accomplish the task of lowering the blinds . I noticed at that time that Joe wore bright red socks , and I little thought what a shock those bright-colored hose were to give me later on under different circumstances . That evening I had satisfactory letters regarding Joe 's character , and by degrees he became used to his new home , and we to him . His quaint sayings and wonderful love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome in the somewhat exclusive circle in which my housekeeper , Mrs. Wilson , reigned supreme . Many a hearty burst of laughter came to me from the open kitchen- window across the garden in the leisure hour , when , the servants ' tea being over , they sat at work , while Joe amused them with his stories and reminiscences of the sayings and doings of his wonderful brother Dick . This same Dick was evidently the one being Joe worshipped on earth , and to keep his promises to Dick was a sacred duty . " You do n't know our Dick , Mrs. Wilson , " said Joe , to the old housekeeper ; " if you did , you 'd understand why I no more dare go agen wot Dick told me , than I dare put my ' and in that ' ere fire . When I were quite a little chap , I took some big yaller plums once , out of one of the punnits father was a-packin ' for market , and I eat ' em . I do n't know to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember they were such prime big uns , big as eggs they was , and like lumps of gold , with a sort of blue shade over ' em . Father were very partikler about not ' avin ' the fruit ' andled and takin ' the bloom off , and told me to cover ' em well with leaves . It was a broilin ' ' ot day , and I was tired , ' avin ' been stoopin ' over the baskits since four in the morning , and as I put the leaves over the plums I touched ' em ; they felt so lovely and cool , and looked so juicy-like , I felt I must eat one , and I did ; there was just six on ' em , and when I 'd bin and eat one , there seemed such a empty place left in the punnit , that I knew father 'd be sure to see it , so I eat ' em all , and then threw the punnit to one side . Just then , father comes up and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be forty on ' em . Twenty picked large for Mr. Moses , and twenty usuals for Marts ! '  - -  two of our best customers they was . Well , Dick , he counts ' em , and soon misses one . ' Thirty-eight , thirty-nine , ' he sez , and no more ; ' but ' ere 's a empty punnit , ' he sez . I was standing near , feelin ' awful , and wished I 'd said I 'd eat the plums afore Dick begun to count ' em , but I did n't , and after that I could n't . ' Joe ! ' sez Dick , ' I wants yer ! ' Ow come this empty punnit ' ere , along of the others ? there 's plums bin in it , I can see , ' cos it 's not new . Speak up , youngster ! ' I looked at Dick 's face , Mrs. Wilson , and his eyes seemed to go right into my throat , and draw the truth out of me . ' Speak up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've prigged ' em , say so , and you 'll get a good hidin ' from me , for a-doin ' of it ; but if you tells me a lie , you 'll get such a hidin ' for that as ' ll make you remember it all your life ; so speak up , say you did it , and take your hidin ' like a brick , and if you did n't prig ' em , say who did , ' cos you must ' av ' seen ' em go . ' " I could n't do nothin ' , Mrs. Wilson , but keep my ' ed down , and blubber out , ' Please , Dick , I eat ' em . ' " ' Oh , you did , yer young greedy , did yer , ' he sez ; ' I 'm glad yer did n't tell me a lie . I 've got to giv ' yer a hidin ' , Joe ; but giv ' us yer ' and , old chap , first , and mind wot I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wotever you do , " and take your punishment ; it 's ' ard to bear , but when the smart on it 's over yer forgets it ; but if yer tells a lie to save yerself , yer feels the smart of that always ; yer feels ashamed of yerself whenever yer thinks of it . ' And then Dick give me a thrashin ' , he did , but I never ' ollered or made a row , tho ' he hit pretty ' ard . And , Mrs. Wilson , I never could look in Dick 's face if I told a lie , and I never shall tell one , I ' ope , as long as ever I live . You should just see Dick , Mrs. Wilson , he is a one-er , he is . " " Lor ' bless the boy , " said Mary , the housemaid ; " why , if he is n't a- cryin ' now . Whatever 's the matter ? One minnit you 're makin ' us larf fit to kill ourselves , and then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your great eyes runnin ' over like that . Now get away , and take the dogs their supper , and see if you ca n't get a bit of color in your cheeks before you come back . " So off Joe went , and soon the frantic barking in the stable-yard showed he had begun feeding his four-footed pets . Time went on ; it was a very quiet household just then -- my husband away in America , and my friends most of them enjoying their summer abroad , or at some seaside place -- all scattered here and there until autumn was over , and then we were to move to town , and spend the winter season at our house there . I hoped my dear sister and her girls would then join us , and , best of all , my dear husband be home to make our circle complete . Day by day Joe progressed in favor with everybody ; his size was always a trouble , but his extreme good nature made everybody willing to help him over his difficulties . He invented all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marvels he would perform with a long stick and a sort of claw at the end of it were quite astonishing . I noticed whenever I spoke of going to town Joe did not seem to look forward to the change with any pleasure , although he had never been to London , he told me ; but Dick had been once with his father , and had seen lots of strange things ; among others a sad one , that made a great impression on Dick , and he had told the tale to Joe , so as to have almost as great an effect on him . It appeared that one night Dick and his father were crossing Waterloo Bridge , and had seen a young girl running quickly along , crying bitterly . Dick tried to keep up with her , and asked her what was the matter . She told him to let her alone , that she meant to drown herself , for she had nothing to live for , and was sick of her life . Dick persuaded her to tell him her grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had both been drowned in a steamer , and she was left with a little brother to take care of ; he had been a great trouble to her , and had been led away by bad companions until he became thoroughly wicked . She had been a milliner , and had a room of her own , and paid extra for a little place where her brother could sleep . She fed and clothed him out of her earnings , although he was idle , and cruel enough to scold and abuse her when she tried to reason with him , and refused to let him bring his bad companions to her home . At last he stole nearly all she had , and pawned it ; and among other things , some bonnets and caps belonging to the people who employed her , given as patterns for her to copy . These she had to pay for , and lost her situation besides . By degrees all her clothes , her home , and all she had , went for food ; and then this wicked boy left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been taken up with a gang of burglars concerned in a jewel robbery . That day she had seen him in prison , and he was to be transported for seven years ; so the poor creature , mad with grief , was about to end her life . Dick and his father would not leave her until she was quiet , and promised them she would go and get a bed and supper with the money they gave her , and they promised to see her again the next day at a place she named . The next morning they went to the address , and found a crowd round the house . Somebody said a young woman had thrown herself out of a window , and had been taken up dead . It was too true ; and the girl was the wretched , heart-broken sister they had helped over night . Her grief had been too much for her , and , poor thing , she awoke to the light of another day , and could not face it alone and destitute ; so , despairing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital , and were allowed to see all that remained of the poor creature ; and Dick 's description of it all , and his opinion that the brother " might have been just such another little chap at first as Joe , " and " What would that brother feel , " said Dick , " when he knew what he had done ? for he done it , " said Dick ; " he done that girl to death , the same as if he 'd shov 'd her out of that winder hisself . " " And , " said Joe , " I wonder if them chaps is goin ' about London now wot led her brother wrong ? I do n't like London ; and I wish we could stop ' ere . " I assured Joe that in London there was no danger of meeting such people if he kept to himself , and made no friends of strangers . Joe was also much afraid of having to wait at table when there were guests . In spite of all I could do , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on more than two or three people ; and as I expected to entertain a good deal when we were in town , I could not help fearing Joe would be unequal to the duties . I could not bear the idea of parting with the little fellow , for , added to his good disposition , Joe , in his dark brown livery , with gilt buttons , his neat little ties , and clean hands ; his carefully brushed curls , by this time trained into better order , and shining like burnished gold in the sun ; his tiny feet , with the favorite red socks , which he could and did darn very neatly himself when they began to wear out ( and when he bought new ones they were always bright red ) ,  - -  Joe , let me tell you , was quite an ornament in our establishment , and the envy of several boys living in families round about , who tried in vain to get acquainted with him , but he would not be friends , although he always refused their advances with civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note or message for me , and try to draw Joe into conversation . In a few minutes I would hear Joe 's deep voice say , " I think you had better go on now . I 've got my work to do , and I reckon you 've got yours a-waiting for yer at your place . " Then the side-door would shut , and Joe was bustling about his work . CHAPTER III . In the beginning of October we arrived in London . There had been much packing up , and much extra work for everybody , and Joe was in his element . What those long arms , and that willing heart , and those quick little hands got through , nobody but those he helped and worked for could tell . Whatever was wanted Joe knew where to find it . Joe 's knife was ready to cut a stubborn knot ; Joe 's shoulders ready to be loaded with as heavy a weight as any man could carry . More than once I met him coming down-stairs with large boxes he himself could almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not find them too heavy . " You see , Missis , " he said , " I 'm that strong now since I 've been here , with all the good food I gets , and bein ' so happy like , that I feel almost up to carryin ' anything . I do believe I could lift that there pianner , if somebody would just give it a hoist , and let me get hold of it easy . " Yes , Joe was strong and well , and I am sure , happy , and I had never had a single misgiving about him since he stood with his fading flowers and shabby clothes at my window that summer day . At last we were settled in town , and the winter season beginning . Our house was situated in the West End of London , a little beyond Bayswater . One of a row of detached houses , facing another row exactly similar in every way , except that the backs of those we lived in had small gardens , with each its own stable wall at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the stable facing the mews , and having the entrance from there ; the mews ran all along the backs of these houses . On the opposite side the houses facing ours had their gardens and back windows facing the high-road , and no stables . There was a private road belonging to this , Holling Park as it was called , and a watchman to keep intruders out , and to stop organ-grinders , beggars , and such invaders of the peace from disturbing us . Somehow I was never as comfortable as in my snug cottage in the country . Rich , fashionable people lived about us , and all day long kept up the round of " society life . " In the morning the large handsome houses would seem asleep , nothing moving inside or out , except a tradesman 's cart , calling for orders , or workmen putting up or taking down awnings , at some house where there would be , or had been , a ball or entertainment of some kind . About eleven a carriage or two would be driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take some one for a morning drive ; but very seldom was anybody on foot seen about . In the afternoon it was different ,  - -  carriages rolled along incessantly , and streams of afternoon callers were going and coming from the houses when the mistress was " at home ; " and at my door , too , soon began the usual din of bell and knocker . Joe was quite equal to the occasion , and enjoyed Friday , the day I received . Dressed in his very best , and with a collar that kept his chin in what seemed to me a fearful state of torture , but added to his height by at least half an inch , Joe stood behind the hall-door , ready to open it directly the knocker was released . He ushered in the guests as though " to the manner born , " giving out the names correctly , and with all the ease of an experienced groom of the chambers . The conservatory leading out of the drawing-room was Joe 's especial pride ; it was his great pleasure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plants . Many shillings from his pocket-money were spent in little surprises for me in the form of pots of musk , maiden-hair , or anything he could buy ; his wages were all sent home , and he only kept for his own whatever he had given to him , and sometimes a guest would " tip " him more generously than I liked , for his bright eyes and ready hands were always at everybody 's service . After my husband 's return home , who from the first became Joe 's especial care , as to boots , brushing of clothes , etc. , it became necessary to give two or three dinner-parties , and I must confess I felt nervous as to how Joe would acquit himself . In our dining-room was a very large bear-skin rug , and the floor being polished oak , it was dangerous to step on this rug , for it would slip away from the feet on the smooth surface , and even the dogs avoided it , so many falls had they met with upon it . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a friend to dine , and had been talking about Joe in the few moments before dinner . My husband had been laughing at the size of my page , and scolding me a little , or rather pretending to do so , for taking a written character . " Little woman , " he said , " do n't be surprised if one night a few country burglars make us a visit , and renew their acquaintance with Mr. J. Cole . " " You do n't know Joe , " I replied , " or you would never say that . " " Do you know him so well , little wife ? " said my dear sensible husband ; " remember he has only been in our service six months . In the country he had very little of value in his hands , but here , it seems to me , he has too much . All the plate , and indeed everything of value , is in his pantry , and he is a very young boy to trust . One of the women servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where does this paragon sleep ? " " Down-stairs , " I said , " next to the kitchen , at the back of the house ; and you should see how carefully every night he looks to the plate-basket , counts everything , and then asks Mrs. Wilson to see it is right , locks it up , and gives her the key to take care of . No one can either open or carry away an iron safe easily , and there is nothing else worth taking ; besides , I know Joe is honest , I feel it . " " Well , I hope so , dear , " was my husband 's reply , but I could see he was not quite comfortable about it . At dinner that day Joe had an accident ; he was dreadfully nervous , as usual , and when waiting , he forgot to attend to my guests first , but always came to me . The parlor-maid , a new one , and not a great favorite with Joe , made matters worse by correcting him in an audible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told Joe to hand it . The poor boy , wishing to obey quickly , forgot to give the bear-skin a wide berth , slipped on it , and in a moment had fallen full length , having in his fall deposited the contents of the sauce- tureen partly into a blue leather armchair , and the rest onto my sister 's back . The boy 's consternation was dreadful . I could see he was completely overcome with fright and sorrow for what he had done . He got up , and all his trembling lips could say was , " Oh , please , I 'm so sorry ; it was the bear as tripped me up . I am so very sorry . " Even my husband could scarcely keep from smiling , the sorrow was so genuine , the sense of shame so true . " There , never mind , Joe , " he said kindly ; " you must be more careful . Now run and get a sponge , and do the best you can with it . " After that Joe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him telling the parlor-maid about it . " You mind , " he said , " or that bear 'll ketch ' old of yer . I sha n't forget how he ketched ' old of my leg that day and knocked me over ; so you 'd better take care , and not go nigher than you can ' elp . He 's always a-lookin ' out to ketch yer , but he wo n't ' ave me no more , I can tell him . " This fall of Joe 's made him still more nervous of waiting at table , and at last , when he had made some very serious mistakes , I had to speak to him and tell him I was afraid , if he did not soon learn to wait better , I must send him away , for his master was annoyed at the mistakes he made , such as pouring port instead of sherry , giving cold plates when hot ones were required , handing dishes on the wrong side , etc . My little lecture was listened to quietly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , to my surprise and distress , he suddenly burst into a perfect passion of tears and sobs . " I will try and learn myself , " he said , as well as his sobs would let him , " indeed , I will . I know I 'm stoopid . I sez to myself every time company comes , ' I 'll mind wot I 'm about , and remember dishes left- ' anded , pour-in 's out right , sherry wine 's yeller , and port wine afterwards with the nuts , grapes , and things ; and the cruits when there 's fish , and begin with the strangerest lady next to master 's side , and ' elp missus last . ' I knows it all , but when they 're all sittin ' down , and everybody wantin ' somethin ' , I do n't know if Jane 's a-goin ' to giv ' it ' em , or I am ; and I gets stoopid , and my ' ands shakes , and somehow I ca n't do nothin ' ; but please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the master . I 'll ask Jane to learn me better . You see if I do n't . Oh , please 'm , say you 'll try me ! " What could I say but " yes , " and for a day or two Joe did better , but we were a small party , and the waiting was easy ; but shortly we were to have a large dinner-party , and as the time drew near , Joe became quite pale and anxious . About this time , too , I had been awakened at night by curious sounds down-stairs , as of somebody moving about , and once I heard an unmistakable fall of some heavy article . My husband assured me it was nothing alarming , and he went down- stairs , but could neither hear or see anything unusual . All was quiet . Another night I felt sure I heard sounds down-stairs ; and in spite of my husband 's advice to remain still , I called Mrs. Wilson , and entreated her to come down to the kitchen-floor with me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter the house from the back , and there being a deep area all round , they could work away with their tools at the ground-floor back windows unseen . Any one could get on the top of the stable from the mews , drop into the garden , and be safe ; for the watchman and policeman were on duty in the front of the house only , the back was quite unprotected . True , there were iron bars to Joe 's window and the kitchen , but iron bars could be sawed through , and I lived in dread of burglars . This night Mrs. Wilson and I went softly down , and as we neared the kitchen stairs , I heard a voice say in a whisper , " Make haste ! " " There , Mrs. Wilson , did you hear that ? " I said . " Was that imagination ? " " No , ma'am , " she replied ; " there 's somebody talking , and I believe it 's in Joe 's room . Let us go up and fetch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband stood with us at the door of Joe 's room . " Open the door , Joe ! " cried my husband . " Who have you got there ? " " Nobody , please , sir , " said a trembling voice . " Open the door at once ! " said the master , and in a moment it was opened . Joe stood there very pale , but with no sort of fear in his face . There was nobody in the room , and as Joe had certainly been in bed , we concluded he must have talked in his sleep , and , perhaps , walked about also , for what we knew . The day before the dinner-party , Cook came and told me she felt sure there was something wrong with Joe . He was so changed from what he used to be ; there was no getting him to wake in the morning , and he seemed so heavy with sleep , as if he had no rest at night . Also Cook had proofs of his having been in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; chairs were moved , and several things not where she had left them . She had asked Joe , and he replied he did go into the kitchen , but would not say what for . I did not like to talk to Joe that day , so decided to wait till after the dinner , and I would then insist on the mystery being cleared up . I knew Joe would tell the truth ; my trust was unshaken , although circumstances seemed against him . That night Mrs. Wilson came to my door , and said she was sure Joe was at his nightwork again , for she could see from her bedroom window a light reflected on the stable wall , which must be in his room . " How can we find out , " I said , " what he is doing ? " " That is easily done , " said my husband . " We can go out at the garden- door , and down the steps leading from the garden into the area ; they are opposite his window . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and see for ourselves . He wo n't be able to see us . " Accordingly , having first wrapped up in our furs , we went down , and were soon at Joe 's window , standing in the area that surrounded the house . The laths of the blind were some of them open , and between them we saw distinctly all over the room . At first we could not understand the strange sight that met our gaze . In the middle of Joe 's room was a table , spread with a cloth , and on it saucers from flower-pots , placed at intervals down each side ; before each saucer a chair was placed , and in the centre of the table a high basket , from which a Stilton cheese had been unpacked that morning , - this was evidently to represent a tall ? pergne . On Joe 's wash-stand were several bottles , a jug , and by each flower-pot saucer two vessels of some kind -- by one , two jam-pots of different sizes ; by another , a broken specimen glass and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe , softly but quickly , on tiptoe , now with bottles which contained water . We could see his lips move , and concluded he was saying something to imaginary persons , for he would put a jampot on his tray , and pour into it from the bottle , and then replace it . Sometimes he would go quickly to his bed , which we saw represented the dinner-wagon , or sideboard , and bring imaginary dishes from there and hand them . Then he would go quickly from chair to chair , always correcting himself if he went to the wrong side , and talking all the time softly to himself . So here was the solution of the mystery ; here melted into air the visions of Joe in league with midnight burglars . The poor boy , evidently alarmed at the prospect of the dinner-party , and feeling that he must try to improve in waiting at table before that time somehow , had stolen all those hours nightly from his rest , to practise with whatever substitutes were at hand for the usual table requisites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far less during the day were soundly sleeping , had that anxious , striving little heart shaken off fatigue , and the big blue eyes refused to yield to sleep , in order to fight with the nervousness that alone prevented his willing hands acting with their natural cleverness . I felt a choking in my throat , when I saw the thin , pale little face , that should have been on the pillow hours before , lighted up with triumph as the supposed guests departed ; the dumb show of folding the dinner napkins belonging to myself and the master , and putting them in their respective rings , told us the ordeal was over . What a weird scene it was ,  - -  the dim light , the silent house , the spread table , and the empty chairs ! One could imagine ghostly revellers , visible only to that one fragile attendant , who ministered so willingly to their numerous wants . The sort of nervous thrill that heralds hysterical attacks was rapidly overcoming me , and I whispered to my husband , " Let us go now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silently drew my attention again to the window . Joe was on his knees by his bedside , his face hidden in his hands . What silent prayer was ascending to the Throne of Grace , who shall say ? I only know that it were well if many a kneeling worshipper in " purple and fine linen " could feel as sure of being heard as Joe did when , his victory won , he knelt , in his humble servant 's garb , and said his prayers that night in spite of the aching head and weary limbs that needed so badly the few hours ' rest that remained before six o'clock , the time Joe always got up . Silently we stole away , and in my mind from that moment my faith in Joe never wavered . Not once , in spite of sad events that came to pass later on , when even I , his staunchest friend , had to recall to memory that kneeling little form in the silence of the night , alone with his God , in order to stifle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all by circumstances I must soon relate . The famous dinner passed off well . Joe was splendid ; his midnight practice had brought its reward , and he moved about so swiftly , and anticipated everybody 's wants so well , that some of my friends asked me where I got such a treasure of a page ; he must have had a good butler or footman to teach him , they said ; he is evidently used to waiting on many guests . I was proud of Joe . The next day he came to me with more than a sovereign in silver , and told me the gentlemen had been so very kind to him , " and a'most every one had given him somethin ' , tho ' he never arst , or waited about , as some fellers did , as if they would n't lose sight of a gent till he paid ' em . But , " said Joe , " they would giv ' it me ; and one gent , he follered me right up the passage , he did , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sez , and he give me a whole ' arf-crown . Whatever for , I do n't know . " But I knew that must have been Dr. Loring , a celebrated physician , and my husband 's dearest friend . We had told him about Joe 's midnight self-teaching , and he had been much interested in the story . You little thought , Joe , the hand that patted your curly head so kindly that night would one day hold your small wrist , and count its feeble life-pulse beating slowly and yet more slowly , while we , who loved you , should watch the clever , handsome face , trying in vain to read there the blessed word " Hope . " CHAPTER IV . And now I must confess to those -- for surely there will be a few -- who have felt a little interest , so far , in the fortunes of J. Cole , that a period in my story has arrived when I would fain lay down my pen , and not awaken the sleeping past , to recall the sad trouble that befell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this happened many years ago , when my hair was golden instead of silver . I was younger in those days , and now am peacefully and hopefully waiting God 's good time for my summons . Troubles have been my lot , many and hard to bear . Loss of husband , children , dear , good friends , many by death , and some troubles harder even than those , the loss of trust , and bitter awakening to the ingratitude and worthlessness of those in whom I have trusted ,  - -  all these I have endured . Yet time and trouble have not sufficiently hardened my heart that I can write of what follows without pain . Christmas was over , and my dear husband again away for some months . As soon as I could really say , " Spring is here , " we were to leave London for our country home ; and Joe was constantly talking to Mrs. Wilson about his various pets , left behind in the gardener 's care . There was an old jackdaw , an especial favorite of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident , resulting in the loss of an eye ; a more evil-looking object than " Cyclops , " as my husband christened him , I never saw . Sometimes on a dark night this one eye would gleam luridly from out the shadowy recesses of the garden , and an unearthly cry of " Hoo-oo-t , " fall on the ear , enough to give one the " creeps for a hour , " as Mary , the housemaid , said . But Joe loved Cyclops , or rather " Cloppy , " as he called him ; and the bird hopped after Joe about the garden , as if he quite returned the feeling . All our own dogs , and two or three maimed ones , and a cat or two , more or less hideous , and indebted to Joe 's mercy in rescuing them from traps , snares , etc. ,  - -  all these creatures were Joe 's delight . Each week the gardener 's boy wrote a few words to Joe of their health and wonderful doings , and each week Joe faithfully sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there was Joe 's especial garden , also a sort of hospital , or convalescent home rather , where many blighted , unhealthy-looking plants and shrubs , discarded by the gardener , and cast aside to be burnt on the weed-heap , had been rescued by Joe , patiently nursed and petted as it were into life again by constant care and watching , and , after being kept in pots a while , till they showed , by sending forth some tiny shoot or bud , that the sap of life was once more circulating freely , were then planted in the sheltered corner he called " his own . " What treasures awaited him in this small square of earth . What bunches of violets he would gather for the Missis ; and his longing to get back to his various pets , and his garden , was the topic of conversation on many a long evening between Joe and Mrs. Wilson . Little Bogie , the fox-terrier , was the only dog we had with us in town , and Bogie hated London . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tramping of horses , and callings of coachmen , shrill cab-whistles , and all the noises of a fashionable neighborhood at night during a London season , were most objectionable to Bogie ; he could not rest , and often Joe got out of bed in the night , and took him in his arms , to prevent his waking all of us , with his shrill barking at the unwonted sounds . As I have said before , I am very nervous , and the prospect of spending several more weeks in the big London house , without my husband , was far from pleasant ; so I invited my widowed sister and her girls to stay with me some time longer , and made up my mind to banish my fears , and think of nothing but that the dark nights would be getting shorter and shorter , and meanwhile our house was well protected , as far as good strong bolts and chains could do so . One night I felt more nervous than usual . I had expected a letter from America for some days past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail was due , and I waited anxiously for the last ring of the postman at ten o'clock ; but I was doomed to listen in vain . There was the sharp , loud ring next door , but not at ours ; and I went to my room earlier than the others , really to give way to a few tears that I could not control . I sat by my bedroom fire , thinking , and , I am afraid , conjuring up all sorts of terrible reasons for my dear husband 's silence , until I must have fallen asleep , for I awoke chilly and cramped from the uncomfortable posture I had slept in . The fire was out , and the house silent as the grave ; not even a carriage passing to take up some late guest . I looked at the clock , half-past three , and then from my window . It was that " darkest hour before dawn , " and I hurried into bed , and endeavored to sleep ; but no , I was hopelessly wide awake . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " sheep going through a hedge , " had any effect , and I found myself lying awake , listening . Yes , I knew that I was listening for something that I should hear before long , but I did not know what . " Hark ! what was that ? "  - -  a sudden thud , as if something had fallen somewhere in the house ; then silence , except for the loud beating of my heart , that threatened to suffocate me . " Nonsense , " I said to myself , " I am foolishly nervous to-night . It is nothing here , or Bogie would bark ; " so I tried again to sleep . Hush ! Surely that was a footstep going up or down the stairs ! I could not endure the agony of being alone any longer , but would go to my sister 's room , just across the landing , and get her to come and stay the rest of the night with me . I put on my slippers and dressing-gown , and opening my door , came face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let me come in , " she said , " and do n't let us alarm the girls ; but I feel certain something is going on down-stairs . Bogie barked furiously an hour ago , and then was suddenly silent . " " That must have been when I was asleep , " I replied ; " but no doubt Joe heard him , and has taken him in . " " That may be , " said my sister , " but I have kept on hearing queer noises at the back of the house ; they seemed in Joe 's room at first . Come and listen yourself on the stairs . " It is strange , but true , that many persons , horribly nervous at the thought of danger , find all their presence of mind in full force when actually called upon to face it . So it is with me , and so it was on that night . I stood on the landing , and listened , and in a few moments heard muffled sounds down-stairs , like persons moving about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelly , " I said to my sister , " and they are down in the basement . If we could creep down quietly and get into the drawing-room , we might open the window and call the watchman or policeman ; both are on duty until seven . " " But think , " said my sister , " of the fright of the girls if they hear us , and find they are left alone . The servants , too , will scream , and rush about , as they always do . Let us go down and make sure there are thieves , and then see what is best to be done . The door at the top of the kitchen stairs is locked , so they must be down there ; and perhaps if we could get the watchman to come in quietly , we might catch them in a trap , by letting him through the drawing-room , and into the conservatory . He could get into the garden from there , and as they must have got in that way from the mews , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would try to escape the same way , and the watchman would be waiting for them , and cut off their retreat . " I agreed , and we stole down-stairs into the drawing-room , where we locked ourselves in , then very gently and carefully drew up one of the side blinds of the bay window . The morning had begun to break , and everything in the wide road was distinctly visible . In the distance I could see the policeman on duty , but on the opposite side , and going away from our house instead of towards it . He would turn the corner at the top of the road , and go past the houses parallel with the backs of our row , and then appear at the opposite end of the park , and come along our side ; there was no intermediate turning --  nothing but an unbroken row of about forty detached houses facing each other . What could we do ? I dared not wait until the policeman came back ; quite twenty minutes must pass before then , and day being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the burglars would surely not leave without visiting the drawing-room and dining-room , and would perhaps murder us to save themselves from detection . If I could only attract the policeman 's attention , but how ? My sister was close to the door listening , and every instant we dreaded hearing them coming up the kitchen stairs . I could not understand Bogie not barking , and Joe not waking , for where I was I could distinctly hear the men moving about in the pantry and kitchen . " I wonder , " I said to my sister , " if I could put something across from this balcony to the stonework by the front steps ? It seems such a little distance , and if I could step across , I could open the front gate in an instant , and run after the policeman . I shall try . " " You will fall and kill yourself , " my sister said ; " the space is much wider than you think . " But I was determined to try ; for if I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen in the twenty minutes before he would come back . The idea of one of the girls waking and calling out , or Joe waking and being shot or stabbed , gave me a feeling of desperation , as though I alone could and must save them . Luckily the house was splendidly built , every window-sash sliding noiselessly and easily in its groove . I opened the one nearest to the hall door steps , and saw that the stone ledge abutted to within about two feet of the low balcony of the window ; but I was too nervous to trust myself to spring across even that distance . At that moment my sister whispered :  --  " I hear somebody coming up the kitchen stairs ! " Desperately I cast my eyes round the room for something to bridge the open space , that would bear my weight , if only for a moment . The fender-stool caught my eye ; that might do , it was strong , and more than long enough . In an instant we had it across , and I was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned the handle of the heavy iron gate , I looked down at the front kitchen window . A man stood in the kitchen , and he looked up and saw me -- such a horrible-looking ruffian , too . Fear lent wings to my feet , and I flew up the road . The watchman was just entering the park from the opposite end ; he saw me , and sounded his whistle ; the policeman turned and ran towards me . I was too exhausted to speak , and he caught me , just as , having gasped " Thieves at 50 ! " ( the number of our house ) , I fell forward in a dead swoon . When I recovered , I was lying on my own bed , my sister , the scared servants , and the policeman , all around me . From them I heard that directly the man in the kitchen caught sight of me , he warned his companion , who was busy forcing the lock of the door at the head of the kitchen stairs , and my sister heard them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder against the stable-wall . They must have pulled this up after them , and tossed it into the next garden , where it was found , to delay pursuit . The park-keeper had , after sounding his whistle , rushed to our house , got in at the window , and ran to the door at the top of the kitchen stairs , but it was quite impossible to open it ; the burglars had cleverly left something in the lock when disturbed , and the key would not turn . He then went through the drawing-room into the conservatory , where a glass door opened on the garden ; but by the time the heavy sliding glass panel was unfastened , and the inner door unbolted , the men had disappeared . They took with them much less than they hoped to have done , for there were parcels and packets of spoons , forks , and a case of very handsome gold salt-cellars , a marriage gift , always kept in a baize- lined chest in the pantry , the key of which I retained , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the lock had been burnt all round with some instrument , most likely a poker heated in the gas , and then forced inwards from the burnt woodwork . " How was it , " I asked , " Joe did not wake during all this , or Bogie bark ? " As I asked the question , I noticed that my sister turned away ; and Mrs. Wilson , after vainly endeavoring to look unconcerned , threw her apron suddenly over her head , and burst out crying . " What is the matter ? " I said , sitting up ; " what are you all hiding from me ? Send Joe to me ; I will learn the truth from him . " At this the policeman came forward , and then I heard that Joe was missing , his room was in great disorder , and one of his shoes , evidently dropped in his hurry , had been found in the garden , near some spoons thrown down by the thieves ; his clothes were gone , so he evidently had dressed himself after pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets were taken away , used no doubt , the policeman said , to wrap up the stolen things . " Is it possible , " I asked , " that you suspect Joe is in league with these burglars ? " " Well , mum , " said the man , " it looks queer , and very like it . He slept down-stairs close to the very door where they got in ; he never gives no alarm , he must have been expecting something , or else why was he dressed ? And how did his shoe come in the garden ? And what 's more to the point , if so be as he 's innercent , where is he ? These young rascals is that artful , you 'd be surprised to know the dodges they 're up to . " " But , " I interrupted , " it is impossible , it is cruel to suspect him . He is gone , true enough , but I 'm sure he will come back . Perhaps he ran after the men to try and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not likely , mum , " said he , with a pitying smile at my ignorance of circumstantial evidence ; " he 'd have called out to stop ' em , and it ' ai nt likely they 'd have let him get up their ladder , afore chucking of it into the next garden , if so be as he was a- chasing of ' em to get ' em took . No , mar 'm ; I 'm very sorry , particular as you seem so kindly disposed ; but , in my humble opinion , he 's a artful young dodger , and this ' ere job has been planned ever so long , and he 's connived at it , and has hooked it along with his pals . I knows ' em , but we 'll soon nab him ; and if so be as you 'll be so kind as to let me take down in writin ' all you knows about ' J. Cole , ' which is his name , I 'm informed , where you took him from , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in laying hands on him ; and when he 's found we 'll soon find his pals . " Of course , I told all I knew about Joe . I felt positive he would come back , perhaps in a few minutes , to explain everything . Besides , there was Bogie , too . Why should he take Bogie ? The policeman suggested that " perhaps the dawg foller 'd him , and he had taken it along with him , to prevent being traced by its means . " At length , all this questioning being over , the household settled down into a sort of strange calm . It seemed to us days since we had said " Good-night , " and sought our rooms on that night , and yet it was only twenty-four hours ago ; in that short time how much had taken place ! On going over all the plate , etc. , we missed many more things ; and Mrs. Wilson , whose faith in Joe 's honesty never wavered , began to think the poor boy might have been frightened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so proud of having the plate used every day in his charge , when he discovered it had been stolen , he might have feared we should blame him so much for it , that he had run away home to his people in his fright , meaning to ask his father , or his adored Dick , to return to me and plead for him . I thought , too , this was possible , for I knew how terribly he would reproach himself for letting anything in his care be stolen . I therefore made up my mind to telegraph to his father at once ; but , not to alarm him , I said :  --  " Is Joe with you ? Have reason to think he has gone home . Answer back . " The answer came some hours after , for in those small villages communication was difficult . The reply ran thus :  --  " We have not seen Joe ; if he comes to-night will write at once . Hoping there is nothing wrong . " So that surmise was a mistake , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went home , and be there in two hours . All the household sat up nearly all that night , or rested uncomfortably on sofas and armchairs ; we felt too unsettled to go to bed , though worn out with suspense , and the previous excitement and fright . Officials and detectives came and went during the evening , and looked about for traces of the robbers , and before night a description of the stolen things , and a most minute one of Joe , were posted outside the police-stations , and all round London for miles . A reward of twenty pounds was offered for Joe , and my heart ached to know there was a hue and cry after him like a common thief . What would the old parents think ? and how would Dick feel ?  - -  Dick whose good counsels and careful training had made Joe what I knew he was , in spite of every suspicion . The next day I still felt sure he would come , and I went down into the room where he used to sleep , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets sheets were on the little bed , all ready for him . So many things put me in mind of the loving , gentle disposition . A little flower-vase I valued very much had been broken by Bogie romping with one of my nieces , and knocking it down . It was broken in more than twenty pieces ; and after I had patiently tried to mend it myself , and my nieces , with still greater patience , had had their turn at it , we had given it up as a bad job , and thought it had long ago gone onto the dust-heap . There were some shelves on the wall of Joe 's room where his treasures were kept ; and on one of these shelves , covered with an old white handkerchief , was a little tray containing the vase , a bottle of cement , and a camel's-hair brush . The mending was finished , all but two or three of the smallest pieces , and beautifully done ; it must have taken time , and an amount of patience that put my efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's was a labor of love , and did not weary him . He would probably have put it in its usual place one morning , when mended , and said nothing about it until I found it out , and then confessed , in his own queer way , " Please , I knew you was sorry it was broke , and so I mended it ; " then he would have hurried away , flushed with pleasure at my few words of thanks and praise . On the mantelpiece were more of Joe 's treasures , four or five cheap photographs , the subjects quite characteristic of Joe . One of them was a religious subject , " The Shepherd with a little lamb on his shoulders . " A silent prayer went up from my heart that somewhere that same Good Shepherd was finding lost Joe , and bringing him safely back to us . There were some pebbles he had picked up during a memorable trip to Margate with Dick , a year before I saw him ; which pebbles he firmly believed were real " aggits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made into brooch and earrings for Mrs. Wilson . There was a very old-fashioned photograph of myself that I had torn in half , and thrown into the waste-paper basket . I saw this had been carefully joined together and enclosed in a cheap frame -- the only one that could boast of being so preserved . I suppose Joe could only afford one frame , and his sense of the fitness of things made him choose the Missis 's picture to be first honored . How sad I felt looking round the room ! People may smile at my feeling so sad and concerned about a servant , a common , lowborn page-boy . Ay , smile on , if you will , but tell me , my friend , can you say , if you were in Joe 's position at that time , with circumstantial evidence so strong against you , poor and lowly as he was , are there four or five , or even two or three of your friends who would believe in you , stand up for you , and trust in you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I had gone up to my sitting-room , after telling Mary to light the fire in poor Joe 's room , and let it look warm and cosey ; for I had some sort of presentiment that I should see the poor boy again very soon -- how , I knew not , but I have all my life been subject to spiritual influences , and have seldom been mistaken in them . We were all thinking of going early to rest , for since the robbery none of us had had any real sleep . Suddenly the front door-bell rang timidly , as if the visitor were not quite sure of its being right to pull the handle . " Perhaps that 's Joe , " said my sister . But I knew Joe would not ring that bell . We heard Mary open the door , and a man 's voice ask if Mr. Aylmer lived there . " Yes , " said Mary , " but he is abroad ; but you can see Mrs. Aylmer . " Then came a low murmuring of voices , and Mary came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Dick , Joe 's brother ; and he says may he see you ? " " Send him in here at once , " I replied . And in a moment Dick stood before me -- Dick , Joe 's beau-ideal of all that was good , noble , and to be admired . I must say the mind-picture I had formed of Dick was totally unlike the reality . I had expected to see a sunburnt , big fellow , with broad shoulders and expressive features . The real Dick was a thin , delicate-looking young man , with a pale face , and black straight hair . He stood with his hat in his hand , looking down as if afraid to speak . " Oh , pray come in , " I cried , going forward to meet him . " I know who you are . Oh , have you brought me any news of poor Joe ? We are all his friends here , his true friends , and you must let us be yours too in this trouble . Have you seen him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I saw Dick 's face as it was . If ever truth , honor , and generosity looked out from the windows of a soul , they looked out of those large blue eyes of Dick's -- eyes so exactly like Joe 's in expression , that the black lashes instead of the fair ones seemed wrong somehow . " God bless you , lady , for them words , " said Dick ; and before I could prevent it , he had knelt at my feet , caught my hand and pressed it to his lips , while wild sobs broke from him . " Forgive me , " he said , rising to his feet , and leaning with one hand on the back of a chair , his whole frame shaking with emotion . " Forgive me for givin ' way like this ; but I 've seen them papers about our Joe , and I know what 's being thought of him , and I 've come here ashamed to see you , thinkin ' you believed as the rest do , that Joe robbed you after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , rather than I 'd believe that of my little lad , as I thrashed till my heart almost broke to hear him sob , for the only lie as he ever told in all his life ; if I could believe it , I 'd take father 's old gun and end my life , for I 'd be a beast , not fit to live any longer . And I thought you doubted him too ; but now I hear you say you 're his friend , and believes in him , and do n't think he robbed you , I know now there 's good folks in the world , and there 's mercy and justice , and it ai n't all wrong , as I 'd come a'most to think as it was , when I first know 'd about this ' ere . " " Sit down , Dick , " I said , " and recover yourself , and let us see what can be done . I will tell you all that has happened , and then perhaps you can throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " Dick sat down , and shading his eyes with his hand that his tears might not betray his weakness any more , he listened quietly while I went over all the events of that dreadful night . When I had finished , Dick sat for some moments quite silent , then with a weary gesture , passing his hand across his forehead , he remarked sadly :  --  " I ca n't make nothing of it ; it 's a thing beyond my understanding . I 'm that dazed like , I ca n't see nothin ' straight . However , what I 've got to do is to find Joe , and that I mean to do ; if he 's alive I 'll find him , and then let him speak for hisself . I do n't believe he 's done nothing wrong , but if he has done ever so little or ever so much , he 'll ' own up to it whatever it is , ' that 's what Joe 'll do . I told him to lay by them words and hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll do as I told him . I 've got a bed down Marylebone way , at my aunt 's what 's married to a policeman ; I 'm to stay there , and I 'll have a talk with ' em about this and get some advice . I know Joe 's innercent , and why do n't he come and say so ? But I 'll find him . " I inquired about the old people , and how they bore their trial . " Father 's a'most beside hisself , " said Dick ; " and only that he 's got to keep mother in the dark about this , he 'd have come with me ; but mother , she 's a-bed with rheumatics , and doctor told father her heart was weak-like , and she must n't be told , or it would p'raps kill her . She thinks a deal of Joe , does mother , being the youngest , and always such a sort of lovin ' little chap he were . " And here Dick 's voice broke again , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some refreshment before leaving , and he promised to see me again the first thing in the morning , when he had talked to his friend , the policeman . Scarcely had Dick gone , when a loud , and this time firm ring , announced another visitor , and in a cab , too , I could hear . Evidently there was no going to rest early that night , as ten o'clock was then striking . Soon , to my surprise , I heard a well-known voice , and Mary announced Dr. Loring , my husband 's old friend , of whom I have already spoken . " Well , my dear , " he cried , in his pleasant , cheerful voice , that in itself seemed to lift some of the heaviness from my heart , " are you not astonished to see me at such an hour ? " " Astonished , certainly , " I replied ; " but very , very glad . You are always welcome ; and more than ever now , when we are in trouble and sorrow . Do sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I will , for an hour , gladly , " he said . " But there 's something outside that had better be brought in first . You know I 've only just arrived from Devonshire , and there are two barrels of Devonshire apples on that cab , one for you , and one for the wife , that is why you see me here ; for I thought it would not be ten minutes out of my road to pass by here , and leave them with you , and so save the trouble of sending them by carrier to-morrow . " I rang for Mary , and the doctor suggested the apples being put somewhere where the smell of them could not penetrate up-stairs ; for , as he truly remarked , " Though a fine ripe pippin is delicious to eat at breakfast or luncheon , the smell of them shut up in a house is horrible . " " I dare say Mrs. Wilson will find a place in the basement , " I said ; " for we do n't use half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel to be stowed away , I soon settled my visitor comfortably in an armchair by the fire , with a cup of his favorite cocoa by his side . " And now , my dear , " said he , " tell me about this burglary that has taken place , and which has made you look as if you wanted me to take care of you a while , and bring back some color to your pale cheeks . And what about this boy ? Is it the same queer little fellow who chose midnight to play his pranks in once before ? I 'm not often deceived in a face , and I thought his was an honest one . I "  --  " So it was , " I interrupted ; " do n't say a word until I 've told you all , and you will "  --  I had scarcely begun speaking , when a succession of the most fearful screams arose from down-stairs , each rising louder and louder , in the extreme of terror . My sister , who had gone to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their dressing-gowns , just as they were preparing for bed , followed , calling out , " Auntie ! O Auntie ! what is it ? Who is screaming ? What can be the matter ? " Hardly were they in the room when Mary rushed in , ghastly , her eyes staring , and in a voice hoarse with terror , gasped out , " Come ! come ! he 's found ! he 's murdered ! I saw him . He 's lying in the cellar , with his throat cut . Oh , it 's horrible ! " Then she began to scream again . The doctor tried to hold me back , but I broke from him , and ran down- stairs , where I could find no one ; all was dark in the kitchens , but there was a light in the area , and I was soon there , followed by Dr. Loring . By the open cellar-door stood Mrs. Wilson , and the cabman with her . Directly she saw me , she called out , " Oh , dear mistress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight for you . Take her away , Dr. Loring , she mus n't see it . " " What is it ? " I cried ; " Mary says it 's "  - -  I could not say the words , but seizing the candle from Mrs. Wilson 's hand , I went into the cellar . The good doctor was close to me , with more light , by the aid of which we beheld , in the far corner , facing us , what seemed to be a bundle of blankets , from which protruded a head , a horrible red stream surrounding it , and flowing , as it were , from the open mouth . One second brought me close . It was Joe -- Joe , with his poor limbs bound with cruel ropes , and in his mouth for a gag they had forced one of those bright red socks he would always wear . Thank God , it was only that red sock , and not the horrible red stream I had feared . He was dead , of course ; but not such a fearful death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his mouth , and the good- natured cabman , who evidently felt for us , helped to cut the ropes , and lift up the poor cold little form . As they lifted him , something that was in the blankets fell heavily to the ground . It was poor Bogie 's dead body , stabbed in many places , each wound enough to have let out the poor dumb creature 's life . By this time help had arrived , and once more the police took possession of us , as it were . Of course , now everything was explained . The burglars had evidently entered Joe 's room , and Bogie , being in his arms , had barked , and wakened him . A few blows had soon silenced poor Bogie , and a gag and cords had done the same for Joe . When the man saw me from the kitchen window he must have known that help would soon come , and to prevent Joe giving information too soon they had hastily seized him , bed-clothes and all , and put him into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps they did not really mean to kill the poor child , and if we had been in the habit of using that cellar we might have found him in a few hours or less ; but , unfortunately , it was a place we never used , it reached far under the street , and was too large for our use . Our coal-cellar was a much smaller one , inside the scullery ; the door of poor Joe 's prison closed with a common latch . Had there been any doubt in the detective 's mind as to Joe 's guilt , he might have taken more trouble , and searched for him , even there ; but from the first everybody but ourselves had been sure Joe had escaped with the burglars , so the cellar remained unsearched . Mrs. Wilson , wishing to spare me the smell of the apples , thought that cellar , being outside the house , a very suitable place for them , and on opening the door had caught sight of something in the distant corner , and sent Mary to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard , and Mary had rushed out of the cellar half mad with fright . In less time than it has taken me to relate this , Joe was laid on the rug before the drawing-room fire , and I summoned courage to look on the changed face . " Could that be Joe -- so white , so drawn , so still ? " Dr. Loring was kneeling by the little form , chafing and straightening the poor stiffened arms , so bent with their cruel pinioning behind the shoulders . " Doctor , " I said , " why do you do any more ? Nothing can bring back the poor fellow , murdered while doing his duty . " Then I , too , knelt down , and took the poor cold hands in mine , " Oh , my poor child ! " I cried , " my little brave heart ; who dared say you were false ? Let those who doubted you look at you now , with dry eyes , if they can . " " My dear , " said Dr. Loring suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , doctor , " I said ; " yes . Why do you ask ? Do you mean -- is it possible -- there is life ? " And I took Joe 's little head in my arms , and forgot he was only a servant , only a poor , common little page- boy . I only know I pressed him to my breast , and called him by all the endearing names I used to call my own children in after years , when God gave me some , and kissed his white forehead in my joy at the blessed ray of hope . No want of willing arms to carry Joe up-stairs . Mrs. Wilson had the bath filled before the doctor was in the room with his light burden . " A few drops of brandy , to moisten the lips , first of all , " said the good doctor , " then the bath and gentle friction ; there is certainly life in him . " Now my good sister 's clever nursing proved invaluable . All that night we fought every inch of ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , good doctor never relaxed in his efforts to bring back life to the cramped limbs . The burglars had unknowingly helped to keep alight Joe 's feeble spark of life by wrapping the blankets round him ; they had meant , no doubt , to stifle any sound he might make ; but by keeping him from actual contact with the stone floor , and protecting him from the cold , they had given him his little chance of life . Oh , how I blessed that kind thought of Dr. Loring 's to bring me a barrel of apples ! Had there been no occasion to open the cellar-door , Joe would have died before another morning had dawned , died ! starved ! What a horrible death ! And to know that within a few steps were food , warmth , and kind hearts -- hearts even then saddened by his absence , and grieving for him . What hours of agony he must have passed in the cold and darkness , hearing the footsteps of passers-by above his living tomb , and feeling the pangs of hunger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in their fearful darkness , until insensibility mercifully came to his aid , and hushed his senses to oblivion . Morning was far advanced when , at last , Joe 's eyelids began to flutter , and his eyes opened a very little , to close again immediately ; even the subdued light we had let into the room being too much for him to bear after so long a darkness ; but in that brief glance he had recognized me , and seeing his lips move , I bent my head close to them . Only a faint murmuring came , but I distinguished the words : " Missis , I could n't ' elp it ! Forgive me . Say ' Our Father . ' " I knelt down , and as well as I could for the tears that almost choked me , repeated that most simple , yet all-satisfying petition to the Throne of Grace . Meanwhile the doctor held Joe 's wrist , and my sister , at a sign from him , put a few drops of nourishment between the pale lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " did you say the boy 's brother was in London ? " " Yes , " I replied , " but I have no address , as I expect him here this morning . " " That is well ; he may be in time . " " In time ? " I repeated ; " in time for what ? Is he dying ? Can nothing be done ? " The good doctor looked again with moistened eyes on the little white face , and said sadly --  " I fear not , but the sight of this brother he seems to have such a strong love for may rouse him for a while . As it is , he is sinking fast . I can do no more , he is beyond human skill ; but love and God 's help may yet save him . Poor little fellow , he has done his duty nobly , and even to die doing that is an enviable fate ; but we want such boys as this to live , and show others the way . " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round I saw Dick -- Dick with wild , dumb entreaty in his eyes . I pointed to the bed , and with a whispered " Hush ! " beckoned him to enter . The shock of seeing his loved little lad so changed was too much for even his man 's courage , for , with a cry he in vain strove to smother , he sunk on his knees with his face hidden in his hands . But only for a moment he let his grief overcome him ; then , rising , he took Joe 's little form in his arms , and in a voice to which love gave the softest and gentlest tones said :  --  " Joe , lad ! Joe , little chap ! here 's Dick . Look at poor old Dick . Do n't you know him ? Do n't go away without sayin ' good-by to Dick wot loves you . " Slowly a little fluttering smile parted the lips , and the blue eyes unclosed once more . " Dick ! " he gasped ; " I wanted to tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  I minded it all . Kiss me -- Dick . God -- bless -- missis . Dick -- take me -- home -- to --  mother ! " And with a gentle sigh , in the arms of the brother he loved , Joe fell into a deep sleep , a sleep from which we all feared he would no more awake on earth , and we watched him , fearing almost to move . Dick held him in his arms all that morning , and presently towards noon the doctor took the little wrist , and found the pulse still feebly beating ; a smile lit up his good , kind face , and he whispered to me , " There is hope . " " Thank God ! " I whispered back , and ran away into my own room to sob out grateful prayers of thanksgiving to Heaven for having spared the life so nearly lost to us . When I went back , Joe had just begun to awaken , and was looking up into his beloved Dick 's face , murmuring : " Why , it 's Dick . Are you a- crying about me , Dick ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And having drank some wine the doctor had ordered should be given him , he nestled close to Dick 's breast , and again fell into a sweet sleep , a better , life-giving sleep this time , for the faint color came to his pale little lips , and presently Dick laid him down on the pillows , and rested his own weary arms . He would not move from Joe 's side for fear , he might wake and miss him , but for many hours our little fellow slept peacefully , and so gradually came back to life . We never quite knew the particulars of the robbery , for , when Joe was well enough to talk , we avoided speaking of it . Dr. Loring said , " The boy only partly remembers it , like a dream , and it is better he should forget it altogether ; he will do so when he gets stronger . Send him home to his mother for a while ; and if he returns to you , let it be to the country house where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did get strong , and came back to us , but no longer as a page-boy ; he was under-gardener , and his time was spent among his favorite flowers and pet animals , until one day Dick wrote to say his father had bought more land to be laid out in gardens , and if Joe could be spared he and Dick could work together , and in time set up for themselves in the business . So Joe left us , but not to forget us , or be forgotten . On each anniversary of my birthday I find a bunch of magnificent roses on my breakfast table --  " With J. and R. Cole 's respectful duty , " and I know the sender is a fine , strong young market-gardener ; but sometimes I look back a few years , and instead of the lovely roses , and the big , healthy giver , I seem to see a faded dusty bunch of wild-flowers , held towards me by the little hot hand of a tired child with large blue eyes , and I hear a timid voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I 've come to stay with yer ! " THE END .
