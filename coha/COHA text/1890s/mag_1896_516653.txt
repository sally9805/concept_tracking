// BY WOODROW WILSON . ON a May day in 1758 , as he spurred upon the way to Williamsburg , under orders from the frontier , Washington rode straight upon an adventure lie had not looked for . He was within a few hours ' ride of the little capital ; old plantations lay close upon the way ; neighborly homes began to multiply ; and so striking a horseman , riding uniformed and attended , could not thereabouts go far unrecognized . He was waylaid and haled to dinner , despite excuses and protests of public business calling for despatch . There was a charming woman to be seen at the house , his friend told him , if a good dinner was not argument enough-and his business could not spoil for an hour 's stay in agreeable company . And so , of a sudden , under constraint of Virginian hospitality , lie was hurried into the presence of the gracious young matron who was at once , and as if of right , to make his heart safe against further quest or adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth and beauty were added that touch of quiet sweetness and that winning grace of selfpossession which come to a woman wived in her girlhood , and widowed before age or care has checked the first full tide of life . At seventeen she had married Daniel Parke Custis , a man more than twenty years her senior ; but eight years of quiet love and duty as wife and niother had only made her youth the more gracious in that rural land of leisure and good neighborhood ; and a year 's widowhood had been but a suitable preparation for perceiving the charm of this stately young soldier who now came riding her way upon the public business . His age was her own ; all the land knew him and loved him for gallantry and brave capacity ; he carried himself like a princeand lie forgot his errand to linger in her company . Dinner was soon over , and his horses at the door ; there was the drilled and dutiful Bishop , trained servant that he was , leading his restless and impatient charge back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his young colonel tarried , absorbed and forgetful ; man and beast alike had been in the service of the unhappy Braddock , *and might seem to walk there lively memorials of duty done and undertaken . But dusk came ; the horses were put up ; and the next morning was well advanced before the abstracted young officer got at last to his saddle , and spurred on belated to Williamsburg . His business concerned the preparations then afoot for General Forbes 's advance upon Duquesne . " I came here at this critical juncture , " said Washington to the President of the Council , " by the express order of Sir John St. Clair , to represent in the fullest manner the posture of our affairs at Winchester " - lack of clothes , arms , and equipage , lack of money , lack of wise regulations touching rank and discipline . General Forbes had been in Philadelphia a month already , awaiting the formation of his army in Virginia ; Sir John St. Clair , his qnartermaster-general , had come into the province to see that proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters should be pressed forward very diligently and at once ; and Washingtoi ) , when once at the seat of government , was not slack to urge and superintend official action . But , the troublesome business once in proper course , he turned back to seek Mrs. Custis again , this time at her own home , ere lie went the long distance of the frontier . The onset was n ) ade with a soldier 's promptness and audacity . He returned to his post , after a delay too slight to deserve any reasonable man 's remark , and yet with a pledge given and taken which made him look forward to the end of the campaign with a new longing as to the winning of a real home and an unwonted happiness . The campaign dragged painfully far into the drear autumn . December had come before the captured post on Ohio could be left to the keeping of Colonel Mercer and a little garrison of provincials . But when at last he was free again there was no reason why Washington should wait longer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 6th of January , 1759 . The sun shone very bright that day , and there was the fine glitter of gold , the brave show of resplendent uniforms , in the little church where the marriage was solemnized . Officers of his // Vliajesty 's service crowded there , in their gold lace and scarlet coats , to see tl ) eir comrade wedded ; the new Governor , Francis Fauquier , himself came , clad as befitted his rank ; and the bridegroom took the sun not less gallantly than the rest , as he rode , in blue and silver and scarlet , beside the coach and six that bore his bride homeward amidst the thronging friends of the country-side . The young soldier 's love of a gallant array and a becoming ceremony was satisfied to the full , and he must have rejoiced to be so brave a horseman on such a day . For three months of deep content he lived with his bride at her own residence , the White House , by York IRiver side , where their troth bad been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning gratefully the new life of quiet love and homely duty . These peaceful , healing months gone by , he turned once more to public business . Six months before his marriage he had been chosen a member of the House of Burgesses for Frederick County  --  the county which had been his scene of adventure in the old days of surveying in the wilderness , and in which ever since Braddock 's fatal rout he had maintained his headquarters , striving to keep the border against the savages . Small wonder that he led the poll taken there in Winchester , where through so many seasons men had seen him bear himself like a capable man and a gallant , indomitable soldier . T was no unwelcome duty , either , to take his young wife to Williamsburg in " the season , " when all Virginia was in town in the persons of the Burgesses and the country gentry come to enjoy the festivities and join in the business then sure to be afoot . The young soldier was unused to assemblies , however , and suffered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidst the novel Parliamentary scene . He had hardly taken his seat when the gracious and stately Robinson , Speaker of the House and Treasurer of the colony these twenty years , rose , at the bidding of the Burgesses , to thank him for the services of which all were THE OLD CAPITOL AT wILLIAMsBURG. // speaking . This sudden praise , spoken with generous warmth there in a public place , was more than Washington knew how to meet . He got to his feet when Mr. Speaker was done , but he could utter not a syllable . He stood there , instead , hot with blushes , stammering , all atremble from head to foot . " Sit down , Mr. Washington , " cried the Speaker ; " your modesty is equal to your valor , and that surpasses the power of any language that I possess . " Agiain and again , as the years passed , Washington returned at each session to Williamsburg to take his place in the Assembly ; and with custom came familiarity and the ease and firmness he at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; all the uses of peace contributed to give him facility and knowledge and a wide comradeship in affairs . Along with quiet days as a citizen , a neighbor , and a country gentleman , came inaturity and the wise lessons of a various experience . No man in Virginia lived more or with a greater zest henceforth than Colonel Washington . His marriage brought him great increase of wealth as well as increase of responsibility . Mr. Custis had left many thousand acres of land , and fortyfive thousand pounds sterling in money , a substantial fortune , to the young wife and the two little children who survived him ; and Washington had become , by special decree of the Governor and Council in General Court , trustee and manager of the whole . It needed capacity and knowledge and patience of no mean order to get good farming out of slaves , and profitable prices out of London merchants ; to find prompt and trustworthy ship-masters by whom to send out cargoes , and induce correspondents over sea to ship the perishable goods sent in return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the bigger your estate the more difficult its proper conduct and economy , the more disastrous in scale the efTOL XcII. - No. 552-103 fects of mismanagement . No doubt the addition of Mrs. Custis 's handsome property to his own broad and fertile acres at Mount Vernon made Coonel Washington one of the wealthiest men in Virginia . But Virginian wealth was not to be counted till crops were harvested and got to market . The current price of tobacco might leave you with or without a balance to your credit in London-your only clearing-house , as it chanced . Your principal purchases , too , must be made over sea and through factors . Both what you sold and what you bought must take the hazards of the sea - voyage , the whims of sea-captains , the chances of a foreign market . To be farmer and merchant at once , manage your own negroes and your own overseers , conduct an international correspondence , to keep the run of prices current , duties , port dues , and commissions , know the fluctuating rates of exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants or in markets , three thousand miles away , required an amount of information , an alertness , a steady attention to detail , a sagacity in farming and a shrewdness in trade , such as made a great property a burden to idle or inefficient men . But Washington took pains to succeed . He had a great zest for business . The practical genius which had shone in him almost prematurely as a TEE WHITE HOUSE , ALExANDRIA , VIRGINIA . // boy now grew heartily in him as a man of fortune . Messrs . Robert Cary and Company , his factors in London , must soon have learned to recognize his letters in the mere handling , by their bulk . No detail escaped him , when once he had gotten into the swing of the work . They must be as punctilious as he was , they found , in seeing to every part of the trade and accounting with which he intrusted them , or else look to lose his lucrative patronage . He was riot many years in learning how to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such in England . Barrels of flour marked " George Washington , Mount Vernon , " were erelong suffered to pass the inspectors at the ports of the British West Indies without scrutiny . It was worth while to s*rve so efficient a man to his satisfaction-worth while or not , he would not be served otherwise . He had emerged , as it were , after a tense and troubled youth , upon a peaceful tract of time , where his powers could stretch and form themselves without strain or hurry . He had robust health , to which he gave leave in unstinted work , athletic strength , and an insatiable relish for being much afoot and in the open , which he satisfied with early rounds of superintendence in the fields where the men were at their tasks , with many a tireless ride after the hounds , or steadfast wait at the haunts of the deer ; a planning will that craved some practical achievement every day , which he indulged by finding tasks of betterment about the estate , and keepin* , his men at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful and for understanding how to be so , which he suffered his neighbors , his parish , his county , the colony itself , to employ when there was need . To a young man , bred these ten years in the forests and in the struggle of warfare upon a far frontier , it had been intolerable to live tamely , without executive tasks big and various enough to keep his energy from rust . The clerical side of business he had learned very thoroughly . in camp , as well as the exceeding stir and strain of individual effort  --  the incessant letter - writing necessary to keep promised performance afoot , the reckoning of men and of stores , the nice calculations of time and ways and means ; the scrutiny of individual men , too , which is so critical a part of management , and the slow organization of effort : he had been in a fine school for these things all his youth , and would have thought shame to himself not to have learned temperance , sagacity , thrift , and patience wherewith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service to keep him from restlessness . His love took his allegiance , and held him to his home as to a post of honor and reward . He had never before had leave to be tender with children , or show with what a devotion he could preside over a household all his own . His home got strong hold upon him . His estates gave him scope of command and a life of action . T was no wonder he kept his factors busy , and shipped goods authenticated by the brand . The soldierly young planter gave those who knew him best , as well as those who met him but to pass , the impression of a singular restraint and self-command , which lent a peculiar dignity and charm to his speech and carriage . They deemed him deeply passionate , and yet could never remember to have seen him in a passion . The impression was often a wholesome check upon strangers , and even upon friends and neighbors , who would have sought to impose upon him . No doubt he had given way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the march , when inefficiency , disobedience , or cowardice angered him hotly and of a sudden . There were stories to he heard of men who had reason to remember how terrible he could be in his wrath . But he had learned , in the very heat and discipline of such scenes , how he must curb and guard himself against surprise , and it was no doubt trials of command made in his youth that had given him the fine self - poise men noted in him now . He had been bred in a strict school of manners at Belvoir and Greenway Court , and here at his own Mount Vernon in the old days , and the place must have seemed to him full of the traditions of whatsoever was just and honest and lovely and of good report as he looked back to the time of his gentle brother . It was still dangerous to cross or thwart him , indeed . Poachers might look to be caught and soundly thirashed by time master himself if he chahced their way . Negligent overseers might expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if necessary work went wrong by their fault . He was exacting almost to the // point of harshness in every matter of just right or authority . But he was open and wholesome as the day , and reasonable to the point of pity in every affair of humanity , through it all . Now it was " my rascally overseer , Hardwick , " in his diary , when certain mares were sent home " scarce able to highlone , much less to assist in the business of the plantations " ; but not a month later it was " my worthy overseer , Hardwick , lying in Winchester of a broken leg . " It was not in his way to add anything to the penalties of nature . *A quiet simplicity of life and a geuinne love of real sport rid him of morbid humors . All up and down the English world , while the eighteenth century lasted , gentlemen were commonly to be found drunk after dinner-outside New England , where the efficient Puritan Church had fastened so singular a discipline in manners upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep drinking which they had been at some pains to deserve . A rural society craves excitement , and can get it very simply by such practices . There is always leisure to sleep afterwards , even though your dinner come in the middle of the day ; and there is good reason you should be thirsty if you have been since daybreak in the saddle . To ride hard and to drink hard seemed to go together in Virginia as inevitably as the rhymes in a song ; and t was famous hard riding after the fox over the rough fields and through the dense thickets . If Washington drank only small-beer or cider and a couple of glasses of Madeira at dinner , it was no doubt because he had found his quick blood tonic enough , and had set himself a hard regimen as a soldier . He did not scruple to supply drink enough for the thirstiest gathering when he presented himself to the voters of the country-side as a candidate for the House of Burgesses . " A hogshead and a barrel of punch , thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dinner for his friends , " was what he cheerfully paid for at his first election , and the poll footed but a few hundred votes all told . Mount Vernon saw as much company and as constant merriment and good cheer as any house in Virginia ; and the master was - no martinet to his guests , even though they came upon professional errands . " Doctor Laurie came here , I may add drunk , " says his quiet diary , without comment , though the doctQr had come upon summons to attend Mrs. Washington , and was next morning suffered to use his lancet for her relief . No doubt a good fellow when sober , and not to be lightly chidden when drunk , like many a gallant horseman and gentleman who joined the meet of the country-side at the hospitable place to follow the hounds when the hunting was good . There was fox-hunting winter and summer , in season and out , but the sport was best in the frosty days of January and February , when the year was young and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall or Mount Vernon two or three times a week to warm their blood in the hale sport , and dine together afterwards  --  a cordial *mpany of neighbors , with as many topics of good talk as foxes to run to cover . The hunt went fastest and most incessantly when Lord Fairfax came down from his lodge in the Valley and joined them for days together in the field and at the table . Washington loved horses and dogs with the heartiest sportsman of them all . He had a great gust for stalking deer with George Mason on the broad forested tracts round Gunston Hall , and liked often to take gun or rod after lesser game when the days fell dull ; but best of all he loved a horse 's back , and the hard ride for hours together after the dogs and a crafty quarry  --  a horse it put a man to his points to ride , a country where the running was only for those who dared . His own mounts could nowhere be bettered in Virginia . There was full blood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood as was to be found in the colony in his Blueskin and Ajax , Valiant and Chinkling . His hounds he bred " so flew 'd , so sanded , " so matched in speed and habit , that they kept always tune and pace together in the field . " A cry more tuneable was never holla 'd to , nor cheered with horn , " than theirs when they were let " spend their mouths " till echo replied " as if another chase were in the skies . " T was first to the stables for him always in the morning , and then to the kennels . It had been hard and anxious work to get his affairs into prosperous shape again when the war was over and those long , hopeless summers on the stricken frontier . Stock , buildings , fences-everything // had to be renewed , refitted , repaired . For the first two or three years there were even provisions to buy , so slow was the place to support itself once more . Not only all his own ready money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more besides , was swallowed up , and he found himself in debt before matters were finally set to rights and profitable crops made and marketed . But , the thing once done , affairs cleared and became easy as if of their own accord in the business of the estate . The men he had to deal with presently knew their master : the young planter had matured his plans and his discipline . Henceforth his affairs were well in hand , and he could take his wholesome pleasures both handsomely and with a free heart . There was little that was debonair about the disciplined and masterful young soldier . He had taken Pallas ' gift : " Self-reverence , self-knowledge , self-control , these three alone lead life to sovereign power . And because right is right , to follow right were wisdom in the scorn of consequence . " But he took heed of his life very genially , and was matured by pleasure no less than by duty done . He loved a game of cards in almost any company , and paid his stakes upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not find Annapolis , or even Philadelphia , too far away to be visited for the pleasure of seeing a good horse - race or enjoying a round of balls and evenings at the theatre , to shake the rustic dulness off of a too constant stay at home . Mrs. Washington enjoyed such outings , such little flings into the simple world of provincial fashion , as much as he did ; and they could not sit waiting all the year for the short season at Williamsburg . A young man at once so handsome , so famous , and so punctilious in point of dress as Colonel Washington could not but make a notable figure in any society . " I want neither lace nor embroidery , " was the order he sent to London . " Plain clothes , with a gold or silver button ( if worn in genteel dress ) , are all I desire . My stature is six feet ; otherwise rather slender than corpulent . " But he was careful the material , the color , and the fit should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very elegant stuffs should be provided from over sea for Mrs. Washington and her children , and very substantial for the servants who were to be in attendance upon the household  --  a livery of white and scarlet . T was a point of pride with Virginians to know how to dress , both well and in the fashion ; and the ' master of Mount Vernon would have deemed it an impropriety to be less careful than his neighbors , less well dressed than his station and fortune warranted . He watched the tradesmen sharply . " T is a custom , I have some reason to believe , with many shopkeepers and tradesmen in London , " he wrote bluntly to the Messrs . Cary , " when they know goods are bespoken for exportation , to palm sometimes old , and sometimes very slight and indifferent goods upon us , taking care at the same time to advance the price , " and he wished them informed that their distant customers would not be so duped . He longed once and again to be quit of the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little upon the broader English stage at home . " But I am tied by the leg , " he told his friends there , " and must set inclination aside . My indulging myself in a trip to England depends upon so many contingencies , which , in all probability , may never occur , that I dare not even think of such a gratification . " But the disappointment bred no real discontent . There could be no better air or company to come to maturity in than were to be had there in Virginia , if a young man were poised and master of himself . " We have few things here striking to European travellers ( except our abundant woods ) , " he professed , when he wrote to his kinsman Richard Washington in England ; " but little variety , a welcome reception among a few friends , and the open and prevalent hospitality of the country ; " but it was a land that bred men , and men of affairs , in no common fashion . Especially now , after the quickening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sweep of continental , even of international , forces across the colonial stage , hitherto set only for petty and sectional affairs . The colonies had grown self - conscious and restless as the plot thickened and thrust them forward to a rGle of consequence in the empire such as they had never thought to play , and the events which succeeded hurried them to a quick maturity . It was a season a young man was sure to m'ipen in , and there was good company . The House of Burgesses was very quiet the year Washington // first took his place in it , and stood abashed to hear himself praised ; but before Mr. Robinson , its already veteran Speaker , was dead , a notable change had set in . Within five years , before the country on the St. Lawrence and the lakes was well out of the hands of the French , the Parliament in En*land had entered upon measures of government which seemed meant of deliberate purpose to set the colonies agog , and every body of counsellors in America stood between anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so put upon . The threat and pressure of the French power upon th' frontiers had made the colonies thoughtful always , so long as it lasted , of their dependence upon England for succor and defence should there come a time of need . Once and again-often enough to keep them sensible how they must stand or fall , succeed or fail , with the power at home-their own raw levies had taken part with the King 's troops out of England in some clumsy stroke or other against a French stronghold in the North or a Spanish fortress in the South ; and now at last they had gone with English troops into the field in a national cause . Provincials and redcoats had joined for a final grapple with the French , to settle once and for all who should be owners and masters on the coveted continent . The issue had been decisive . By the summer of 1760 Washington could write his kinsman in England that the French were so thoroughly drubbed and humbled that there remained little to do to reduce Canada from end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the success wrought a revolution in the relations of the colonies to the mother-country . It rid them of their sense of dependence . English regiments had mustered their thousands , no doubt , upon the battle-fields of the war in order that the colonies might be free to possess the continent , and it was hard to see how the thing could have been accomplished without them . But it had been accomplished , and would not need to be done again . Moreover , it had shown the colonial militia how strong they were even in the presence of regulars . They had almost everywhere borne an equal part in the fighting , and , rank arid file , they had felt with a keen resentment the open contempt for their rude equipment and rustic discipline which too many arrogant offi cers and insolent men among the regulars had shown . They knew that they had proved themselves the equals of any man in the King 's pay in the fighting , and they had come out of the hot business confident that henceforth , at any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves . They had lost both their fear of the French and their awe of the English . T was hardly an opportune time for statesmen in London to make a new and larger place for England 's authority in America , and yet that was what they immediately attempted . Save Chatham and Burke arid a few discerning men who had neither place nor power , there was no longer any one in England who knew , though it were never so vaguely , the real temper and character of the colonists . T was matter of common knowledge and comment , it is true , that the men of Massachusetts were beyond all reason impatient of command or restraint , affecting an independence which was hardly to be distinguished from contumacy and insubordination ; but what ground was there to suppose that a like haughty and ungovernable spirit lurked in the loyal and quiet South , or among the prudent traders and phlegmatic farmers who were making the middle colonies so rich , and so regardful of themselves in every point of gain or interest ? Statesmen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the feeling of Englishmen in America , and had , with a wise and salutary neglect , ' ' suffered them to take their own way in every matter of self-government . Though ministry after ministry had asserted a rigorous and exacting supremacy for the mother-country in every affair of commerce , and had determined as they pleased what the colonies should be suffered to manufacture , and how they should be allowed to trade-with what merchants , in what commodities , in what bottoms , within what limits-they had nevertheless withheld their hands hitherto from all direct exercise of authority in the handling of the internal affairs of the several settlements , had given them leave always to originate their own legislation and their own measures of finance , until self-goveminent had become with them a thing as if of immemorial privilege . Sir William Keith , sometime Governor of Pennsylvania , had suggested to Sir Robert // Walpole that he should raise revenue from the colonies . " What ! " exclaimed that shrewd master of men . " I have Old England set against me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But men had come into authority in England now who lacked this stout sagacity , and every element of sound discretion . English arms and English money , they could say , had swept the French power from America in order that the colonies might no longer suffer menace or rivalry . A great debt had been piled up in the process . Should not the colonies , who had reaped the chief benefit , hear part of the cost ? They had themselves incurred burdensome debts , no doubt , in the struggle , and their assemblies would very likely profess themselves willing to vote what they could should his Majesty call upon them and press them . But an adequate and orderly system of taxation could not be wrought out by the separate measures of a dozen petty legislatures ; t were best the taxation should be direct and by Parliament , whose authority , surely , no man outside turbulent Boston would be mad enough seriously to question or resist . It would , in any event , be wholesome now the colonies were likely to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother 's power to use and restrain  --  a power by no means lost because too long unexercised and neglected . It was with such wisdom the first step was taken . In March , 1764 , Parliament voted it " just and necessary that a revenue be raised in America , " passed an act meant to secure duties on wines and sugars , and took measures to increase the efficiency of the revenue service in America . George Grenville was Prime Minister . He lacked neither official capacity nor acquaintance with affairs . He thought it just the colonists should pay their quota into the national treasury , seeing they were so served by the national power ; and he declared that in the next session of Parliament he should propose certain direct taxes in addition to the indirect already in force . He saw no sufficient reason to doubt that the colonies wonld acquiesce , if not without protest , at least without tumult or dangerous resistance . It was a sad blunder . Virginia resented threat and execution alike in such a matter as deeply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quiet year 1732 , when bluff Sir Robert was Prime Minister , there had been an incident which Governor Keith , maybe , had forgotten . The ministry had demanded of Massachusetts that she should establish a fixed salary for her governors by a standing grant ; but she had refused , and the ministers had receded . The affair had not been lost upon the other colonies . That sturdy onetime royal Governor Alexander Spotswood , in Virginia , had noted it very particularly , and spoken of it very bluntly , diligent servant of the crown as lie was , to Colonel William Byrd , when he came his way on his " progress to the mines . " He declared " that if the Assembly in New England would stand bluff , he did not see how they could be forced to raise money against their will ; for if they should direct it to be done by act of Parliament , which they have threatened to do ( though it be against the right of Englishmen to be taxed but by their representatives ) , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act in execution . " No observing man could so much as travel in Virginia without finding very promptly what it was that gave point and poignancy to such an opinion . That quiet gentleman the Rev. Andrew Burnaby , Vicar of Greenwich , was in Virginia in 1759 , and saw plainly enough how matters stood . " The public or political character of the Virginians , " he said , " corresponds with their private one ; they are haughty and jealous of their liberties , impatient of restraint , and can scarcely bear the thought of being controlled by any superior power . Many of them consider the colonies as independent states , not connected with Great Britain otherwise than by having the same common King and being bound to her with natural affection . " Not only so , but " they think it a hardship not to have an unlimited trade to every part of the world . " All this , and more , Grenville might have learned by the simple pains of inquiry . One had but to open his eyes and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost feudal South ; and , for all they had never heard revolutionary talk thence , ministers ought to have dreaded the leisure men had there to think , the provocation to be proud , the necessity to be masterful and individual , quite as much as they had ever dreaded the stubborn temper and the quick capacity for // united action they had once and again seen excited in New England . It was not necessary to try new laws to see what the colonies would do if provoked . The difficulty already encountered in enforcing the laws of trade was object-lesson enough ; and the trouble in that matter had grown acute but yesterday . For long , indeed , no one in the colonies questioned the right of Parliament to regulate their trade ; but it was notorious that the laws actually enacted in that matter had gone smoothly off in America only because they were not seriously enforced . " The trade hither is engrossed by the Saints of New England , " laughed Colonel Byrd , " who carry off a great deal of tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny a pound . " The Acts of Trade practically forbade direct commerce with foreign countries or their dependencies , especially in foreign bottoms ; but ships from France , Spain , and the Canary Isles came and went very freely notwithstanding in colonial ports ; for royal officials liked to enjoy a comfortable peace and the esteem of their neighbors , and very genially winked at such transgressions . Cargoes without number were sent to the Dutch and Spanish West Indies every year , and as many brought thence , which were undoubtedly forfeit under the navigation laws Parliament had been at such pains to elaborate and enforce ; and privateering as well as smuggling had for long afforded the doughty seamen of Boston , Salem , Charleston , and New York a genteel career of profit . Things had come to such a pass that where business went briskly the people of the colonial ports demanded as of right " a full freedom of illegal trade , " and broke sometimes into riot when it was denied them . The Boston News Letter had been known very courteously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's customs because , " with much humanity , " he had been used to take " pleasure in directing masters of vessels how they ought to avoid the breach of the Acts of Trade . " Seacaptains grew accustomed to very confidential relations with owners and consignees , and knew very well , without official counsel , how to take the advice " not to declare at the Custom - house " ; and things went very easily and cordially with all parties to the understanding . In 1761 that understanding was of a sudden rudely broken and the trouble began , which Grenville had the folly to add to . The Board of Trade determined to collect the duties on sugar , molasses , and rurh , so long and so systematically evaded in the trade between New England and the West Indies , at whatever cost of suit and scrutiny , and directed their agents in Boston to demand " writs of assistance " from the courts , giving them leave to enter what premises they would in search of smuggled goods . There was instant exasperation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the officers of the law , with or without just and explicit ground of suspicion a , ainst him , no English subject anywhere would submit to ; and yet these writs authorized nothing less . Issued under a questionable extension to America of an exceptional power of the Court of Exchequer , they violated every precedent of the common law , no less than every principle of prudent administration ; and the excitement which they provoked was at once deep and ominous . Sharp resistance was made in the courts , and no officer ever ventured to serve one of the obnoxious writs . Such challenge of the process was uttered by colonial counsel upon trial of the right , moreover , that ministers would be without excuse should they ignore the warning , so explicit and so eloquent of revolutionary purpose . It was James Otis who uttered it . He had but the other day carried the royal commission in his pocket as Advocate-General in his Majesty 's Court of Admiralty ; but he would not have scrupled , even as his Majesty 's servant , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already cost one King his head and another his throne . To oppose in such a case was to defend the very constitution under which the King wore his crown . That constitution secured to Englishmen everywhere the rights of freemen ; the colonists had , besides , the plain guarantees of their own charters ; if constitution and charter failed , or were gainsaid , the principles of natural reason sufficed for *4efence against measures so arrogant and so futile . No lawyer could justify these extraordinary writs ; no King with an army at his back could ever force them to execution . Protest not only , but defiance rang very clear in these fearless words ; and ministers must avow themselves very ignorant // should they pretend they did not know how Mr. Otis had kindled fire from one end of the colonies to the other . But Grenville was resolute to take all risks and push his policy . He did not flinch from the enforcement of the measures of 1764 , and in the session of 1765 calmly fulfilled his promise of further taxation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue stamps upon all their commercial paper , legal documents , pamphlets , and newspapers ; and that , at once as a general measure of convenience and a salutary exhibition of authority , his Majesty 's troops stationed in the plantations should be billeted on the people . Parliament readily acquiesced . It was thus Grenville purposed " defraying the expenses of defending , protecting , and securing " the colonies ; but he came near losing them instead . The act was passed in March ; it was not to go into effect until November ; but the colonists did not keep him waiting until November for their protests . It was the voice of a veritable tempest that presently came over sea to the ear of the startled minister . And it was not the General Court of turbulent Massachusetts , but the House of Burgesses of loyal Virginia that first spoke the general indignation . Already in the autumn of 1764 , upon the mere threat of what was to come , that House had spoken very urgently against the measures proposed , in a memorial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loyalty and affection , had plainly declared it the opinion of his Majesty 's subjects in Virginia that such acts would be in fiat violation of their undoubted rights and liberties ; and the committee by which that memorial was drawn up had contained almost every man of chief consequence in the counsels of the colony , the King 's Attorney-General himself not excepted . But it was one thing to protest against measures to come and quite another to oppose their execution when enacted into laws . The one was constitutional agitation ; the other , fiat rebellion-little less . It was very ominous to read the words of the extraordinary resolutions passed by the Burgesses on the 30th of May , 1765 , after the Stamp Act had become law , and note the tone of restrained passion that ran through them . They declared that from the first the settlers of " his Majesty 's colony and dominion of Virginia had possessed and enjoyed all the privileges , franchises , and immunities at any time enjoyed by the people of Great Britain itself ; and that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their charters , " to all intents and purposes as if they had been abiding and born within the realm of England " ; " that the taxation of the people by themselves or by persons chosen by themselves to represent them " was " a distinguishing characteristic of British freedom , without which the ancient constitution " of the realm itself could not subsist ; " and that his Majesty 's liege people of this most ancient colony " had " uninterruptedly enjoyed the right of being thus governed by their assemblies in the article of their taxes and internal police , " had never forfeited or relinquished it , and had seen it " constantly recognized by the Kings and people of Great Britain . " Spoken as it was in protest against actual legislation already adopted by Parliament in direct despite of all such privileges and immunities , this declaration of rights seemed to lack its conclusion . The constitutional rights of Virginians had been invaded . What then ? Resolved , therefore , " that his Majesty 's liege people , the inhabitants of this colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ordinance whatever designed to impose any taxation whatsoever upon them , other than the laws or ordinances of the General Assembly aforesaid , " and " that any person who shall , by speaking or writing , assert or maintain " the contrary " shall be deemed an enemy of his Majesty 's colony . " Such had been the uncompromising conclusion drawn by the mover of the resolutions . What other conclusion could any man draw if he deemed the colonists men , and proud men at that ? But the Burgesses would not go so far or be so explicit . They feared to speak treason ; they were content to protest of their rights , and let the issue bring conclusions to light . It had been hot fighting to get even that much said . The men hitherto accepted always as leaders in the House had wished to hold it back from rash and heated action , and there had been bitter debates before even those significant premises for a revolutionary conclusion had been forced to adoption . Old leaders and new , young men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1764 ; but now that the Stamp Act // was law , conservative members shrank from doing what must look so like a flat defiance of Parliament . Only young men would have had the audacity to urge such action ; only very extraordinary young men would have had the capacity to in ( luce the House to take it . But such young men were at hand , their leader as veritable a democrat as bad ever taken the floor in that assembly . Patrick Henry was not of the aristocracy of the colouy . Good Scots blood ran in his veins , quickened by the lively strain of an old Welsh stock . His father came of a race of scholars , and , good Churchman though he was , knew his Livy and his Horace better than his Bible . His mother came of a vivacious line of easy-going wits and talkers , which but a touch more of steadiness and energy might any day have made famous . His father had served his county of Hanover very capably and acceptably as surveyor , colonel , maoistrate an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor of quiet parishes . But they had been no voL . XcII. - No. 552. -I 04 long time in the colony ; they lived back from the tide-water counties where the real aristocracy had its strength and supremacy ; they were of that middle class of yeomen-gentlemen who love liberty but do not affect rank . " A vigorous aristocracy favors the growth of personal eminence even in those who are not of it , but only near it , ' and these plain men of the middle counties were the more excellent and individual in the cultivation of their powers by reason of the contact . But there was a touch of rusticity , a neglect of poliTh , a rough candui- of speech , about them which set them apart and distinguished them sharply enough when they came into the presence of the courtly and formal gentlemen who practised the mannei-s of London in the river counties . Patrick Henry , at any rate , must have seemed a very rustic figure to the Burgesses x*flien he first came to take his seat amongst them on a May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many . This was the man , they must have known , who had won so strange a verdict from a jury WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE , WILLIAMSBURG , AT THE PRESENT DAY . // two years ago in the celebrated parsons ' case at Hanover court-house , against the law and the evidence . But his careless dress and manner , his loose , nagainly figure , his listless , absent bearing , must have set many a courtly member staring . For such men as Washington , indeed , there can have been nothing either strange or unattractive in the rough exterior and unstudied ways of the new member . Punctilious though lie was himself in every point of dress and bearing , Washington 's life had most of it been spent with men who looked thus , and yet were stuff of true courage and rich capacity within . The manner of a man could count as no test of quality with him . His experience had covered the whole variety of Virginian life . He was an aristocrat by taste , not by principle . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same growth as he in essential quality and principle , though by another way . Henry 's ife had been wilful , capricious , a bit haphazard ; Washington 's all the while subject to discipline ; but both men had touched and seen the whole energy of the commonwealth , knew its hope , could divine its destiny . There was but one Virginia , and they were her children . It could not take long to bring them to an understanding and comradeship in affairs . It was characteristic of the new member that he should step at once and unhesitatingly to a place of leadership when debate of the Stamp Act stirred the House , and that he should instantly sweep the majoi-ity into his following with a charm and dash of eloquence that came like a revelation upon the quiet assembly . He was but twenty- nine years old , but he had spent all his life in learning how the world went , and by what manner of speech it was moved and governed . He had roamed the woods with no thought but for sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy in the shade of the trees . He had kept a country store , and let gossip and talk of affairs of colony and coun try-side take precedence of business . Finally he had turned with a permanent relish to the law , and had set himself to plead causes for his neighbors in a way that made judges stare and juries surrender at discretion . In everything he had seemed to read the passions of men . Books no less than men , the chance company of an old author no less than the constant talk of the neighborly land lie lived in , seemed to fill him with the quick principles of the people and polity to which he belonged , and to lend him as inevitably every living phrase in which to utter them . The universal sympathy and insight which made his plea santrv so engaging to men of every stamp rendered his power no less than terrible when lie turned to play upon their passions . He was not conscious of any audacity when he sprang to his feet upon the instant lie saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was of the ardor of his nature to speak when coniviction moved him strongly , without thought of propriety or precedence ; and it was like him to stand there absorbed , reading his resolutions from a fly-leaf torn from an old law-book , WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE . // It seemed no doubt a precious piece of audacity in the eyes of the prescriptive leaders of the House to hear this almost unknown man propose his high recital of Virginia 's liberties and his express defiance of Parliament-in tones which rang no less clear and confident upon the clause which declared " his Majesty*s liege people " of the colony in no way bound to yield obedience , than in the utterance of the accepted matter of his premises . Debate flamed up at once , hot , even passionate . The astounding , moving eloquence of the young advocate , his instant hold upon the House , the directness with which he purposed and executed action in so grave a matter , stirred the pulses of his opponents and his followers with an equal power , and roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great as his own . The old leaders of the House , with whom he now stood face to face in this critical business , were the more forrnidable because of the strong reason of their position . No one could justly doubt that they wished to see the Old Dominion keep and vindicate her liberty , but they deemed it folly to be thus intemperately beforehand with the issue . Almost to a man they were sprung of families who had come to Virginia with the great migration that had brought the Washingtons , in the evil day when so many were fleeing England to be quit of the Puritan tyranny-royalists all , and touched to the quick with the sentiment of loyalty . T was now a long time since Cromwell 's day , indeed ; generations had passed . and a deep passion forVirginia had been added to that old reverencc for the wearer of the crown in England . But these men prided themselves still upon their loyalty ; made it a point of honor to show themselves no agitators , but constitutional statesmen . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were most dear to them thus violated and denied , but it did not make them hasty to quarrel with the Parliament of the realm . They hind intended opposition , but they feared to throw their cause away by defiance . T was as little wise as dignified to flout thus at the sovereign power before all means had been exhausted to win it to forbearance . It was not the least part of the difficulty to face the veteran Speaker , John Robinson , so old in affairs , so stately in his age , so gravely courteous , and yet with such a threat of good manners against those who should make breach of the decorous traditions of the place . But the men chiefly to be feared were on the floor . There was Richard Bland , " wary , old , experienced , " with " something of the look , " a Virginian wit said , " of old musty parchments , which he handleth and studieth much , " author of a " treatise against the Quakers on water-baptism " ; with none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law and the precedents of public business , a very formidable man in counsel . Quiet men trusted him , and thought his prudence very wise . George Wythe was no less learned , and no less HANOVER COURT-HOUSE. // influential . Men knew him a man of letters , bringing the knowledge of many wise books to the practice of affairs , and set great stoie by his sincerity , as artless as it was human , and sweetened with good feeling . It made Randolph and Pendleton and Nicholas , the elder orators of the House , seem the more redoubtable that they should have such men as these at their elbows to prompt and steady them . And yet they would have been formidable enough of themselves . Edmund Pendleton had not , indeed , the blood orthe breeding that gave his colleagues prestige . He had won his way to leadership by his own steady genius for affairs . He read nothing but law-books , knew nothing but business , cared for nothing but to make practical test of his powers . But be took all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every stroke with so serene a self-possession , was so quick to see and act upon every advantage in his business of debate , and was withal so transparent , bore himself with such a grace and charm of manner , was so obviously right-minded and upright , that it meant a great deal to the House to bear him intervene in its discussions with his melodious voice , his cool , distinct , effective elocution. iRobert Carler Nicholas added to like talents for business and debate a reverent piety , a title to be loved and trusted without question , which no man ever thought to gainsay . And Peyton Randolph , with his " knowledge , temper , expeiience , judgment , integrity " as of a true Roman spirit , was a sort of prince among the rest . No man could doubt he wished Virginia to have her liberties . He had gone over sea to speak for her in Dinwiddie 's day , though he was the King 's attorney , and had lost his office for his boldness . But there were traditions of lox-alty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore . His father before him had won knighthood and the royal favor by long and honorable service as his Majesty 's attorney in the colony . Pride and loyalty had gone hand in hand in the annals of a proud race , and had won for the Randolphs a prestige which made it impossible Sir John 's son should very long be kept from the office he had so honorably inherited . Aiid so Peyton Randolph was now once again the King 's attorney . It was not as the King 's officer , however , but as an experienced Parliamnentary tactician , a trained debater , a sound man of affairs , that lie had set himself to check Henry in his revolutionary courses . Henry found himself , in truth , passionately setupon . Even threats were uttered , and abuse such as proud men find ill to bear . They cried " Treason ! treason ! " upon him when lie dared declare the King would do well to look to the fate of Ca*sar and Charles the First for profitable examples . But he was notdaunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most of it , " was his defiance to them . One ally who might have stood with him , had he known , was absent . Richard Henry Lee would have brought to his support a name as ancient and as honorable as any in the colony , and an eloquence scarcely less than his own . But , as it was , he was left almost TAZEWELL HALL , THE HOME OF THE RANDOLPHS . Afier a print in Omitted Chapters of Hhsloqe diactosed ha the life and Papers of Edmund Randolph .

Randolph flung out of the House , muttering in his heat that he " would have given five hundred guineas for a single vote . " Henry , taking the triumph very simply , as was his wont , and knowing his work for the session done , quietly made his way homeward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , chatting with a friend , his legs clad in buckskin as if for the frontier , his saddle-bags and the reins of his lean nag slung carelessly over his arm . The Assembly had adopted Henry 's declaration of rights , not his resolution of disobedience , and had softened a little the language lie would have used ; but its action seemed seditious enough to Fanquier , the Governor , arid he promptly dissolved them . It did little good to send Virginians home , however , if the object was to check agitation . The whole nianner of their life bred thought and concert of action . Where men have leave to be individual , live separately and with a proud self-respect , and yet are much at each other 's tables , often in vestry council together , constantly coming and going , talking and planning throughout all the country-side , accustomed to form their opinions in league , and yet express each man his own with a dash and flayer of independence ; where there is the leisure to reflect , the habit of joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abundant PEYTON RANDOLPH . // opportunity to be frank withal - if you will , you may look to see public views form themselves very confidently , and as easily without assemblies as with them . Washington had taken no part in the stormy scenes of the House , but had sat calmly apart rather , concerned and thoughtful . He was not easily caught by the excitement of a sudden agitation . He had the soldier 's steady habit of selfpossession in the presence of a crisis , and his own way of holding things at arm slength for scrutiny- " like a bishop at his prayers , " a wa* ' said . He had a soldier 's loyalty , too , and slowness at rebellion . His thought , no donbt , was with the conservatives . whatever may have been the light that sprang into his quiet eye when Henry 's voice rang out so like a clarion , calling Virginia P her standard ; and lie went home , upon the dissolution , to join and aid his neighbors in the slow discussion which must shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had run like a flame through the colonies-not as the Burgesses had adopted them , but as Henry had drawn* them , with their express threat of disobedience . Nor was that all . October , 1765 , saw delegates from nine colonies come together in New York , at the call of Massachusetts , to take counsel what should be done . Every one knew that Virginia , North Carolina , and Georgia , the only colonies absent from the " congress , " would have sent delegates too had their Governors not prevented them by the dissolution of their Assemblies before they could act on the call . A deep excitement and concern had spread everywhere throughout the settlements . Not only did the impending enforcement of the act engross " the conversation of the speculative part of the colonists , " as Washington wrote to Francis Dandridge in London ; it promised to engross also the energies of very active , and it might be very violent , men in many quarters , and it began to grow evident that some part of government itself would be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judicature , " declared Wash in gton , " must inevitably be shut up for it is impossible ( or next of kin to it ) , under our present circumstances , that the act of Parliament can be complied with ... ; and if a stop he put to our judicial proceedings , I fancy the merchants of Great Britain trading to the colonies will not be among the last to wish for a repeal of it .

" The ministry could not stand the pressure . They gave way to Lord Rockingham , and the act was repealed . Meanwhile Washington , his *alrn tei* " per unshaken , was slowly coming to a clear vision of affairs in all their significance . Fox-hunting did not cease . He was much in the saddle and at table with the Fairfaxes , whom nothing could shake from their allegiance , and who looked with sad forebodings up'n the temper the colony was in . It was proper they should speak so if th*j deemed it just , and Washington had no intolerance for what they urged . But George Mason , the neighbor whom he most trusted , was of a very different mind , and strengthened and confirmed him in other counsels . Mason was six years his senior ; a man , too , cast by nature to understand men and events , how they must go and how he guided . They conferred cou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their intimate life , in the field or in the library , mounted or afoot in the forests , and came very deliberately and soberly to their statesman ' s view . Randolph and Pendleton and Wythe and Bland had themselves turned , after the first hesitation , to act with ardent men like Lee in framing the memorials to King , Lords , and Commons which were to go from the Burgesses along with the resolutions of the Stamp Act Congress in New York ; and Washington , who had never hesitated , but had only gone slowly and with his eyes open , with that self-poise men had found so striking in him from the first , came steadily with the rest to the at last common purpose of resolute opposition . The repeal of the act came to all like a great deliverance . Governor Fauquier had deemed it his duty to dissolve the Assembly upon the passage of Henry 's resolutions , but he had acted without passion in the matter , and had kept the respect of the men he dealt with . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seriously , having been bred a man of fashion and a courtier rather than a master of affairs . He loved gay company and the deep excitement of the gaming - table , not the round of official routine . Affable , generous , elegant , a scholar and real lover of letters , he vastly preferred the talk of vivacious women and accomplished men to the business of the General Court , and was a man to be liked rather than consulted . Washington , always admitted to the intimacy of official circles at Williamsburg , very likely relished the gallant Fauquier better than the too officious Dinwiddie . It was , unhappily , no portent to see a man still devoted to dissipation at sixty-two , even though lie were Governor of one of his Majesty 's colonies and a trusted servant of the crown ; and Fauquier 's gifts as a man of wit and of instructed tastes made his companionship no less acceptable to Washington than to the other men of discernment who frequented the ballrooms and receptions , ate formal dinners , and played quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . It did not seriously disturb life there that the Governor upheld the power of Parliament to tax , while the Burgesses strenuously opposed it . Washington , for one , did not hesitate on that account to be seen often in friendly VOL. xcII. - No. 552-105 talk with the Governor , or to accept frequent invitations to the " palace . " He was of the temper which has so distinguished the nobler sort of Englishmen in politics : he might regard opposition as a public duty , but he never made it a ground of personal feeling or private spite . In a sense , indeed , he had long been regarded as belonging to official circles in the colony more intimately than any other man who did not hold office . He had been put forward by the Fairfaxes in his youth ; men in the Council and at the head of affairs had been his sponsors and friends from the first ; he had been always , like his brother before him , a member of one of the chief groups in the colony for influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even understood that he was himself destined for the Council , when it should be possible to put him in it without seeming to give too great a preponderance to the Fairfax interest , already so much regarded in its make-up . The first flurry of differing views and conflicting purposes among the Virginian leaders had passed off . The judgment of high - spirited men everywhere sustained Henry - gave him unmistakable authentication as a leader ; put all public men in the way of understanding their constituents . Some were bold and some were timid , but all were animated by the same hope and purpose , and few were yet intemperate . " Sensible of the importance of unanimity among our constituents , " said Jefferson afterwards , looking back to that time when he was young and in the first flush of his radical sentiments , " although we often wished to have gone faster , we slackened our pace , that our less ardent colleagues might keep up with us ; and they , on their part , differing nothing from us in principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself have advised . " Patrick Henry was received to the place he had earned ; and although the older leaders resumed that sway in counsel to which their tried skill and varied experience in affairs fairly entitled them , there was no longer any jealous exclusion of new men . Henry 's fame crept through the colonies as the man who had first spoken the mind not of Virginians only , but of all just men , with regard to the liberties o* Englishmen in America . Before a year was out Richard Bland himself , // parchment man and conservative that he was , had written and published a pamphlet entitled " An Inquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies , " which said nothing less than that in all that concerned her internal affairs Virginia was " a distinct , independent state , " though " united with the parent state by the closest league and amity , and under the same allegiance . " A colony " treated with injury and violence , " he exclaimed , " is become an alien . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spoke thus , there were surely signs of the times . The government at home kept colonial sentiment very busy . Even Lord Rockingham 's government , with Burke to admonish it . coupled its repeal of the stamp duties with a " declaratory act " which sought to quiet controversy by giving the lie direct to every argument urged against its authority in the colonies . " Parliament has power to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever , " was its round assertion : " a resolution for England 's right to do what the Treasury pl*ased with three millions of freemen , " cried Chatham . Though Rockiiigham 's government would not act on that right , its successors , without scruple , would ; and they were soon about it , for Rockingham 's ministry retained office scarcely a twelvemotith . Grenville was , indeed , discredited ; hut Grafton and Townshend were as bad , as stubborn in temper , as reckless in policy . The year 1767 saw taxes proposed and enacted on glass , paper , painters ' colors , and tea imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries to the crown 's officers in the colonies out of the proceeds , and the contested ground was all to go over again . To show their temper , the new ministers suspended the legislative powers of the Colonial Assembly in New York for refusing to make provision for troops quartered upon the colony . To complete their fiscal arrangements they presently created a custom - house and hoard of revenue commissioners for America . It was an ominous year , and set opinion forward not a little in the colonies . The House of Burgesses broke , at its next session ( 1768 ) , into fresh protests and remonstrances , and there was no one to restrain or rebuke it . Fauquier was dead , and gone to his reckoning ; the reins of government were in the hands of gentle John Blair , President of the Council , a Virginian every inch , and with never a thought of checking his fellowcolouists in the expression of their just opinions . The autumn brought Lord Botetourt , the new Governor-General , who came in showy state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his arrival made little difference . The Burgesses smiled to see him come to open their session of 1769 with pageant of coach and six , brave display of royal insignia , and the manner of a sovereign meeting Parliament , and turned from him almost in contempt to denounce once more the course of the ministers , argue a gain the rights of America , declare they would draw the colonies together in concerted opposition , and call upon the other colonies to concur with them alike in their principles and in their purpose . Botetourt came hot foot to dissolve them ; but they only shifted their place of meeting , gathered again at the private house of Mr. Anthony Hay , and there resolved no longer to import the things which Parliament had taxed in despite of them . George Mason had drawn the resolutions , at Washington 's request , and Washington himself presented them . Mason 's thought had hastened very far along the path of opposition under the whip of England 's policy , and Washington 's quite as far . The government had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that protested , but had advised the King to press prosecutions for treason in the colonies , and , should there be deemed sufficient ground , transport the accused to England to be tried by special commission . It was this last measure that had provoked the Burgesses to their hottest outburst . " At a time when our lordly masters in Great Britain will be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of American freedom , " wrote Washington to Mason , with a sudden burst of passion , " it seems highly necessary that something should be done to avert the stroke , and maintain the liberty which we have derived from our ancestors . . . . That no man should scruple , or hesitate a moment , to use a-ms in defence of so valuable a blessing , on which all the good and evil of life depends , is clearly my opinion . Yet a-ins , I would beg leave to add , should be the last resource . " Addresses to the throne // and remonstrances to Parliament had failed : it remained to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that at last would arrest their attention . No doubt even that would prove of little avail ; but it was at least peaceable and worth the trial . The next month , accordingly , he got unhesitatingly to his feet in the private meeting of the Burgesses at Mr. Hay 's and moved George Mason 's resolutions ; nor did he forget to subscribe his quota to the fund which was to defray the expenses of the " association " there formed . The next evening he attended the " Queen 's Birth-Night " at the palace with the same naturalness of demeanor and frankness of dealing towards the Governor as before . Botetourt was not all show and gallantry , but was a genuine man at bottom . He had come to Virginia thinking the colonists a pleasureloving people who could be taken by display and cajoled by hospitality : he had been told they were such in London . But he knew his mistake almost as soon as he had made it ; and was prompt , even while he upheld prerogative , to do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . He had acquiesced very heartily at the outset of his administration in a decision of the Council that writs of assistance could not legally be issued in Virginia ; for the process had been tried there too . He made such representations with regard to the state of the colony to the ministers at home as were both just and wise ; was assured in reply that the ministers were willing to make every necessary concession ; pledged his word in Virginia that there should be a substantial change of policy ; and died the sooner ( October 15 , 1770 ) because the government would not , after all , redeem his promises . " Your Governor is becoming very popular , as we are told here , " wrote Arthur Lee to his brother , from London , " and I have the worst proof of it in the mci-eased orders for fineries from the ladies . " Virginians did not find it easy to break an immemorial habit in order to starve the English trades and manufactures ; and it was more than once necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and merchants at Williamsburg and by means of local associations throughout the colony . But Washington was punctilious to observe to the letter the agreements he hnd himself proposed . Again and again he bade his mercantile agents in London assist him to guard against any inadvertent breach of them : not to send him the articles Parliament had picked out for taxation in the colonies . Life still continued to go , it is true , with something of the old sumptuousness at Mount Vernon . It was in June , 1768 , that Colonel Washington ordered a new chariot , " made in the newest taste , handsome , genteel , and light , to be made of the best seasoned wood , and by a celebrated workman , " which was to cost him , fittings and all , one hundred and thirtythree pounds . For all he grew uneasy lest the colonies ' disagreement with England should come at last to a conflict of arms , he pushed his private interests with no abatement of thoroughness or self-possession , as if there were no fear but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not run surveyor 's lines for Lord Fairfax or assisted to drive the French from the Ohio without seeing what fair lands lay upon the western rivers awaiting an owner ; and , though there was still doubt how titles were to be established in that wilderness , he took care , through the good offices of an old comrade in arms , at least to be quietly beforehand with other claimants in setting up such titles as might be where the land lay richest and most accessible . " A silent management " was what he advised , " snugly carried on under the guise of hunting other game , " lest there should be a premature rush thither that would set rival interests a-clashing . A strange mixture of the shrewdness of the speculator and the honesty of the gentleman - claims pushed with privacy , but without trickery or chicane-ran through his letters to Captain Crawford , and drew as canny replies from the frontiered soldier . Business gave way often to sport and pleasure , too , as of old , when politics fell dull between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunning party in the woods ; and again a day or two aboard his schooner , dropping down the river , and drawing the seine for sheep's-heads upon the bar at Cedar Point . Even politics was mixed with diversion . He must needs give a hall at Alexandria on the evening of his election to the House which was to meet Lord Botetourt , no less than on other like occasions , of // whatever kind the business of the Assembly was likely to be . He did not lose his passion for fine horseflesh , either , at the thickest of the plot . In 1770 he was with Governor Eden , of North Carolina , at the Jockey Club races in Philadelphia , no doubt relieved by the news that all but the tea tax had been repealed . The next year it was the races in Annapolis that claimed him ; and in 1773 Jacky Custis held him again at Philadelphia on the same errand . It was wholesome to be thus calmly in pursuit of diversion in the intervals of trying business . It bespoke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was one matter to which Washington felt it his bounden duty as a soldier and a man of honor to devote his time and energies , whether politics pressed or not . A grant of two hundred thousand acres of the western lands had been promised by the government of the colony to those who enlisted for the war against the French and Indians in 1754 ; but nothing had ever been done to fulfil the promise , and Washington undertook to act as agent for his comrades in the business . In the autumn of 1770 , accordingly , he turned away for a space from the deepening trouble in the east to plunge once more into the western ways and search out proper tracts for the grant along the reaches of the Ohio* T was a two months ' journey , for he did not stop till he had gone close upon three hundred miles beyond Fort Pitt . And when he was home again no one in the government who could lend a hand in the matter got any peace from the stirring , thorough man until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tidy profit in the grant for himself : for his own share was large , and he providently bought , besides , the shares of others who were unwilling to spend or co-operate in the matter . But there were months upon months of weary , unrequited service for his comrades , too , given with hearty diligence and without grudging . Their portions were as well placed as his own , they were to find , when it caine to the survey . He came off from the business very rich in western landsbuying the Great Meadows , among the rest , for memory 's salle  --  but richer still in the gratitude and admiration of the men for whom he had labored . Meanwhile events darkened ominously . A new administration had been formed in England under Lord North , and had begun its government by repealing all the taxes of 17*39 except that on tea . But it was Parliament 's right to tax them that the colonists were fighting , not the taxes themselves , and one tax was as hateful as a hundred . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a broil between townsmen and troops in the streets of Boston , in which arms had been used and men slain , and in the heated imaginations of the colonists the affair had taken on the ugly aspect of a massacre . The year 1771 went quietly enough for Virginians . Botetourt was dead , and that good merchant of York , William Nelson , President of the Council , sat in the place of authority throughout the year . Although the whole country refused the taxed tea , the attention of the ministers , as it happened , was fixed chiefly upon Massachusetts , where trade centred at a growing port and opposition had a local habitation . In Virginia there was no place to send troops to , unless the whole country were occupied , and so long as Mr. Nelson was acting Governor , Colonel Washington could go without preoccupation to the races , and gentlemen everywhere follow their own devices in the quiet counties . There was riotint-rebellion even-in North Carolina , so uneasily did affairs go there ; but Governor Tryon was a soldier as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble his neighbors about that . It was not until the first months of 1772 that Virginians began to read plain signs of change in the face of their new Governor , John Murray , Earl Dunmore  --  a dark and distant man , who seemed to the Virginians to come like a satrap to his province , who brought a soldier with him for secretary and confidential adviser , set up a fixed etiquette to be observed by all who would approach him , spoke abruptly and without courtesy , displayed in all things an arbitrary temper , and took more interest , it presently appeared , in acquiring tracts of western land than in conducting the government of the colony . The year of his coming was marked by the secret destruction of the revenue - schooner Gasp* in Rhode Island , and by many significant flaws of temper here and there throughout the colonies ; and 1773 saw affairs at last come to a crisis . Dunmore had summoned the Burgesses to meet him upon his first coming , but S // had liked their proud temper as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call them together again till March , 1773 , though he had promised to convene them earlier . There was instant trouble . In view of the affair of the Gasp* , Parliament had again resolved upon the trial of malcontents in England , and the Burgesses were hot at seeing the sentiments of the colonies so flouted . Conservative men would still have waited to try events , but their fellow-members of quicker pulse were diligent to disappoint them . Leadership fell to those who were bold enough to take it ; and Patrick Henry , Richard Henry Lee , Dabney Carr , and Thomas Jefferson , radicals all , drew together , a self - constituted committee of guidance . Evening after evening they met in a private room at the Raleigh , with now and again one or two other like spirits called into counsel , to consult what should he done . Richard Henry Lee proposed that the colonies should be invited to join Virginia in appointing committees of correspondence , through which to devise steady concert of action , and that Virginia 's committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look into the character of the new court of trial lately establisl ? ed in Rhode Island . Dabney Carr was directed to move the resolutions , and the eloquence of Lee and Henry won for them an instant and hearty acceptance . Dunmore promptly dissolved the Assembly , and Washington was free to set out for New York to place Jacky Custis at King 's College , lingering on the way in Philadelphia to see the races , and pick up the talk of the hour during half a dozen evenings at the rooms of the Jockey Club , at the balls and assemblies of the gay town , and at the hospitable tables of his friends . The opening of the year had found Washington in a very genial humor , his letters touched with pleasantry and gossip . " Our celebrated fortune , Miss French , whom half the world was in pursuit of , " he wrote , in February , to Colonel Bassett , " bestowed her hand on Wednesday last , being her birthday ( you perceive , I think myself under a necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is to take her to Maryland . .... Mentioning of one wedding puts me in mind of another "  --  and so through the news of Miss More , " remarkable for a very frizzled head and good singing , " and the rest of the neighborhood talk . But the year turned out a very sad one for him . He had been scarcely ten days back from New York when Patsy Custis , whom4 he loved as his own daughter , died . It called forth all the latent Christian faith of the thoughtful , steadfast man to withstand the shock . And Master Jack Custis , the girl 's wayward brother , gave him little but anxiety . He would not study , for all Washington was so solicitous he should have the liberalizing outlook of books , and be made " fit for more useful purposes than horse - racer , " and though he was but twenty , could hardly be induced to see the year out at college before getting married . It was no doubt very well that public affairs of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxieties , which could not but be dwarfed in the presence of transactions which threatened to shake the continent . As the year drew on , the government in England undertook to force cargoes of the East India Company 's tea into the ports . When all resisted , and Boston , more forward even than the rest , threw three hundred and forty odd chests of tea into the harbor , acts passed Parliament giving dangerous increase of power to the Governor of Massachusetts , and directing that Boston port be closed to all commerce on and after the first day of June , and it became evident that vigorous action must be taken in response . The Burgesses in Virginia ( May , 1774 ) resolved that June 1st should be set apart as a day of fastin'g and prayer-prayer that civil war might be averted and the people of America united in a common cause . Again Dunmore dissolved them ; but they gathered in the long room of the Raleigh tavern , and there resolved to urge a congress of all the colonies , and to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day of August to take action for the colony . They showed no spleen towards the Qovernor . Washington dined with him the very day of the dissolution , spent the evening at the palace , even rode out with him to his farm on the following morning and breakfasted there ; and the Burgesses did not fail to give the ball they had planned in honor of Lady Dunmore and her daughters on the evening of the day they had held their meeting in the " Appolo room " at the Raleigh . But there were fasting and // prayer on the 1st of June ; the convention met on the first day of August ; very outspoken resolutions were adopted ; and Peyton Randolph , Richard Henry Lee , Patrick Henry , Richard Bland , EdmundPendleton , George Washington , and Benjamin Harrison were directed to attend the congress of the colonies appointed to meet in Philadelphia on the fifth day of September . When the time came for the journey , Henry and Pendleton joined Washington at Mount Vernon . It must have been with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to ride through the long August day towards the north .
