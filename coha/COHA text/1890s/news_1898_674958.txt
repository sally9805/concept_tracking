txt Assistant Secretary of War MeikieJohn to-day issued an order which will assure the early completion of the records of the Union and Confederate Armies during the rebellion . That work . when it was planned by Col. R. W. Scott , was designed to fill something like fifty volumes , in four series . The first series , just completed , was expanded to fill 111 volumes , and the other three series are yet incomplete . The second series , which should have been put in half a dozen volumes , was expanded in compilation to fill fifteen or eighteen voturnes . Aside from the tendency to expansion and the printing of irrelevant and superfluous matter , the work stagnated , and it began to look as if it might be protracted Indefinitely . The war , of which the publication is to be a record , had been over thirty-three years , and another war had been begun and ended , yet the tag-end of the rebellion record was keeping ' a number of men in employment at considerable expense and for no good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a complete state in three years , but would probably not have reached completion in six . Mr. Meikicjohn has been considering the matter attentively and taking advantage of a pgrt of one of the acts passed by the last Congress directing- that no part of the appropriation for the rebellion record should be expended for the unnecessary employ ' ment of any person , he has directed that the second series of the record be kept down to the six volumes into which it was ordered to be compressed by a former Secretary of War , and has insisted that the further employment of unnecessary persons shall cease .
