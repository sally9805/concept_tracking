txt The Executive Committee of the Civic Federation of Chicago has authorized its Ptesident , - Franklin H. Head , to appoint a committee of twenty-five to organize a National civic federation . This committee is to be composed of men representing different sections of the country , and different phases of social , economic , and political questions of the day . The object of such an organization is stated to be to provide for a thorough discussion and consideration of questions of National import affecting either the foreign or domestic policy of the ' United States ; to aid in the crystallization of the most enlightened lightened public sentiment in the country ' in respect thereto , and to promote necessary legislation in accordance therewith . The leaders of the Chicago Federation have contemplated this move for some time , deeming it essential if a National work were to become anything more than educational . in January , 1898 , the Chicago Civic Federation called a National conference on primary elections and municipal reform , which was held in New York . and was attended by representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . In August , 1895 , it called at Saratoga a National conference on the foreign policy of the United States which , after two ( jays of animated debate by leading men of all parties , unanimously agreed upon some broad general principles which called for further effort to render it of permanent value to the country . This work could not be followed up by the Chicago organization . The four days ' trust conference , recently held in Chicago , was not expected to agree upon general principles , but it was believed the free discussion by representatives of so many schools of thought would furnish material and a basis for more thorough work hereafter . It is to make it possible to follow up the practical lines suggested by the conference , that the National Civic Federation is projected .
