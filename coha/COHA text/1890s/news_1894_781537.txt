He is to appear in a concert with Darnroseh 's Orchestra , in this city , on Wednesday evening next , and at a matinee on the following Saturday afternoon at Carnegie Hall . Herr Stavenhagen is a well-developed type of the German . He has a full , cheerful , manly face , beaming with good nature ; light-brown eyes , light mustache , hair a shade darker , and nose and mouth which indicate strength of character and great determination .

His musical talent was early developed , and when seven years of age he was sufficiently proficient to compose for the piano .

While yet a child , Stavenhagen appeared many times in public , but his first professional appearance was made in London in April , 1880 , at the time when he was traveling with Liszt . Liszt was his musical godfather , and in introducing him to the Brit-ish public , as he did , he foretold a great future for the young pianist . That which Liszt foretold has come to pass , and Herr Stravenhagen 's name and talent are known and recognized throughout England and the Continent . Herr Stavenhagen was engaged for the present Winter to perform in the Russian capital , but , owing to the death of the late Czar , he was enabled to obtain a release from his contract and come to this country , as he had long desired to do .
