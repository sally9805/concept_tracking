txt From The Cincinnati Enquirer , Oct. 5 . The recent erection of a modest slab over the grave of Salmon Portland Chase by friends in the East called forth the Remark from a local paper that " citizens of Cincinnati were too thoughtless  --  we will not say too mean , for that would not be true . It remained for somebody in New-England to send a humble slab to be placed on that grave . " This is a decided mistake . The slab that now marks the grays of Mr. Chase was erected by private subscription taken up in Washington , the movement being begun by a former resident of Cincinnati , who is now in the employ of the Government at the capital . More than two years ago an old resident of Cincinnati , and a lifelong friend of Mr. Chase , who still resides here , wrote to Mrs. Kate Chase Sprague at Washington for permission to erect a monument over the grave a her father .

The letter , which bears the date of June 12 , 1803 , was then written to Mrs. Sprague , and is as follows : " I trust you will pardon me for what I am about to say . The love and friendship I had for your noble father , my ever faithful friend , will , I trust , be accepted by you as my apology . " There is nothing in Spring Grove Cemetery indicating the last resting place of the mortal remains of your father . I hope that the day will come when an appropriate monument , built by American citi-zens , will mark the spot . In the meantime it has occurred to me that I would like to see his grave marked in some way before I die , and my object in writing you now is to ask if it will be agreeable to you , and if you will permit me to put a granite slab at the head of his grave . properly inscribed , this to be done at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the depth of my heart I hope it will , I will send you a sketch or drawing of what I propose . While it will not be very ex-pensive , I promise you that it shall be re-spectable and appropriate . " Mrs. Sprague never replied to this letter , and this faithful old friend of the great Ohioan only learned yesterday that it was by personal application that Mrs. Sprague gave her consent for the erection of the humble slab that now marks the last resting place of her illustrious father . The monument he proposed to erect was to be in the form of a tomb of granite , the inscription being in raised letters on the slab covering the top of the grave , and would have cost $300 . The inscription was as follows : deleted table Failing to hear from Mrs. Kate Chase Sprague , this old friend of her father placed a codicil in his will directing his executor to contribute $100 at any time that a fund for a , suitable monument is started .
