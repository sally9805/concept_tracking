txt As the Democrats were responsible for legislation at the session at which this was dune , they had to take the penalty of the reaction in popular feeling which it produced . It was a result of this infamous race-track legislation that the Republicans got control of the Legislature last Fall , and there is ground for the suspicion that a desire to save it from repeal was at the bottom of the fatuous effort to prevent the majority from organizing the Senate In point of fact , it made the repeal all the easier , now that the validity of the acts passed without the help of the Democratic Senators has been established . The action of Gen. McCook in the Denver disturbances has been judicious and successful . It was based on a twofold authority . The army regulations empower commanding officers to act at their discretion , when there is no time for instructions , in case of the robbery or interruption of the mails " or other equivalent emergencies , " and there was Government property to protect in Denver . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that request the Government was bound to respond , under the provision of the Constitution that the United States shall protect every State " on application of the Legislature , or of the Executive when the Legislature can not be convened , against domestic violence . " It is true that when Gov . Waite found that the infantry from Fort Logan did not propose simply to take orders from him and back up the militia in his controversy with the Police Board he was as anxious to get rid of as he had been to summon it . But that he could not accomplish . The troops remained , under orders from Washington , to look after public property , although they were not to be used without a specific additional request from the Governor , based on " domestic violence " which the militia could not control . Then that official wisely concluded to resort to the courts . Meanwhile , the presence of the regulars , holding aloof from the squabble , has been a guarantee of peace and order .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
