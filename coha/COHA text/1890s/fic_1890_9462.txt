( the General stares speechlessly at Tom , gasps two or three times , but is unable to speak ) Daisy . Daisy Armitage ( with emotion ) I love you too , as you know , Tom , but will never marry you until your father not only consents , but asks me to do so . ( goes down r . ) Gen. G en . Rufus Stanhope I ask you to marry my son ! You may be very sure I 'll never demean myself so far as that . ( goes c . ) Tom . Tom Stanhope Now look here , father . There 's no need for you to bluster and make a row . I should be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting in respect for you , but I love Daisy with all my heart , and I intend to marry no one else . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope And I intend , sir , that you shall marry Isabel Howard , my ward  --  her future has been entrusted to my care and it is her best interests I consult when I desire her to marry you . Tom . Tom Stanhope Of course , I can not help feeling extremely flattered by what you say , father , but  --  ( sits on table r. ; Daisy sits r . ) Ned . Ned Moreland But Isabel loves me , General , as I 've already told you , Tom 's a very nice fellow , but she do n't care a row of pins for him ' longside of me . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Care for you , sir ? Miss Howard fix her affections on an insignificant little person like you , sir ? Ned . Ned Moreland Well , General , I may be a person , but I hope I 'm a gentleman . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . So do I. Tom . Tom Stanhope ( rises and goes l. of table r . ) Father , your want of self-control is positively painful  --  if you were a younger man you 'd get well thrashed for your trouble and serve you right . But your great age protects you . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Age , sir , age ! You talk to me as if I were a doddering old man . Why , how old do you wish to make me ? Tom . Tom Stanhope Old enough to know better . Old enough to show a little more respect for the feelings of others . ( goes in front of table r . ) ( Daisy goes to Tom ) Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope I am thinking more of others than of myself when I entirely forbid Miss Howard to marry this  --  this  --  Ned . Ned Moreland Insignificant little person , General . ( Tom sits on table r . ) Gen. G en . Rufus Stanhope This  --  Mr. Moreland . I 'm thinking of my dear old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who realised that in so placing her she would have the benefit of the strict discipline that we as youngsters were all brought up to in the good old days that have gone . When , sir , children spoke to their parents respectfully , and when in their presence , sir , invariably stood up until  --  they sat down . ( as calmly as he can ) I do n't believe for one moment that Isabel has shown any pronounced partiality for Mr. Moreland . She has probably been kind and gentle  --  Ned . Ned Moreland She has , indeed . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope As is her wont . Tom . Tom Stanhope No , father , as is her will . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Be good enough not to interrupt me. ( to Ned ) You sir , have construed her simple courtesy into an expression of a deeper feeling for yourself , and perhaps have not been slow to take advantage of a young girl 's impulsive nature to get her consent to an engagement that I may tell you I do not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the feelings of a gentleman you will release her from at the earliest opportunity . ( bows , crosses to r. corner ; Daisy and Tom follow him ) Enter Isabel c. , creeps up behind Ned , blindfolds him , and then kisses him ; Tom , Daisy , and General turn sharply ) Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Isabel , how dare you kiss that  --  ! ( crosses c. ; Daisy goes down r. ; Tom goes r. of table r . ) Ned . Ned Moreland Insignificant little person , General . Isa . Isabel Howard Ned ! Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope ( with effort ) . Come here , Isabel . ( Isabel goes to him ) It seems that you young people have formed plans for yourselves without consulting me  --  that you have , in short , set your cap  --  at a young man who has neither the wit to appreciate you nor the means to support you as his wife . It seems that you have engaged yourself without my consent to marry this  --  this  --  gentleman . ( goes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , father , you 've said it at last . Ned . Ned Moreland Thank you , General . ( goes c ) When once you 've said it , it 's not so bad , is it ? ( Isabel goes down l . ) And now , if you please , I will give Isabel the opportunity of releasing herself from our engagement . ( goes to Isabel ) Isabel , sweet , the General is under the impression that I have by divers subtle arts induced you to believe that you are in love with me , when in reality you are only deceived by the glamour of my simple courtesy . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Do n't twist my words , sir . Ned . Ned Moreland I do n't want your words , General ; as a rule I have no use for them . Tom . Tom Stanhope ( laughs ) Ha ! Ha ! Ned . Ned Moreland The General thinks I have ensnared you into promising to become my wife when in your heart you do not really and truly love me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him her hand ) This is my answer , Ned . ( to the General , crosses c . ) I should never have given him my word if my heart had not been his already . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Well of all the d  --  Tom . Tom Stanhope Father !

Ned goes up l. , exit Isabel r.u.e . rather frightened ; General goes up l.c. a little . Daisy . Daisy Armitage You horrid old man ! ( goes c. , Daisy talks to Ned up l.c . ) Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope ( to Tom ) As for you , sir , I forbid you ever to enter my presence again . I 'll make a new will ( down r. ) this very day , and cut you off with a shilling . Tom . Tom Stanhope What , only one ? ( goes r. c. , then goes c . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it half a crown ? Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope ( takes Tom 's hat off table r. , going up to Tom ) I daresay you consider that very clever , very clever indeed . Tom . Tom Stanhope No , I do n't , but you need n't take my hat . General puts back hat on table and takes his own hat . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope But you 'll find , sir , I 'm not to be trifled wich. ( up door r . ) Oh , I 'll send for my lawyer this instant . Oh you  --  you  --  you  --  ! ( exit r. in great rage ) Tom . Tom Stanhope Ha ! ha ! ha ! Poor dad , how angry he thinks he is. ( laughing ) Daisy . Daisy Armitage ( in dismay ) Oh ! Tom , I shall never forgive myself . ( c . ) Tom . Tom Stanhope Why , darling ? ( c . ) Daisy . Daisy Armitage For bringing this misfortune upon you . Tom . Tom Stanhope Nonsense , my dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round presently . Ned . Ned Moreland ( coming l.c. back of chair ) I think not , and fear he means to disinherit you . Tom . Tom Stanhope If he does , I 'll contest the will . Daisy . Daisy Armitage My love for you has made you a beggar . Tom . Tom Stanhope ( embracing her ) You are wrong , dearest . I am richer possessing your love than millions could make me without it . Daisy . Daisy Armitage But Tom , we can never marry now . Tom . Tom Stanhope Ca n't we ? Just come with me to the nearest registry office and I 'll soon show you that we can . Daisy . Daisy Armitage Would you marry me against the wishes of your father ? Tom . Tom Stanhope Against the wishes of the whole world , if you agree to it ! Daisy . Daisy Armitage No , Tom . ( goes l. with emotion ) I will never marry you without your father 's consent . Tom .

Tom Stanhope ( down to Daisy ) Then he shall give his consent , before I 'm a week older , or my name 's not Tom Stanhope. ( embraces and kisses her as General enters r.u.e . ) Gen.Gen . Rufus Stanhope Stop that , sir ! ( Tom turns ) Did n't I tell you to go ? Tom . Tom Stanhope Yes , but you did n't say when . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Now . Tom . Tom Stanhope But where ? Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Anywhere out of my sight . ( sits r . ) Tom . Tom Stanhope Come , now , father , you do n't mean it ? ( goes to General ) Gen.Gen . Rufus Stanhope Do n't mean it ? You 'll find it out soon enough . ( Tom patting him ) Take your hands off me , sir . Tom .

Ned Moreland Good-bye , Tom . ( Tom shakes hands with Ned , goes up to settee c. to General ) Tom . Tom Stanhope Good-bye , father . ( Ned comes down to back of table and talks to Daisy ) Gen.Gen . Rufus Stanhope Go to the devil . Tom . Tom Stanhope Last chance , Daddy . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope ( furiously ) Leave me , sir , this moment . Tom . Tom Stanhope ( pause ; business with cigarette ) You have n't got such a thing as a light , have you ? ( exit c. to l . ) Gen. G en . Rufus Stanhope ( rises , looking after him ) Well , of all impudent rascals . ( goes c . ) ( Daisy , going towards General angrily , General backs away down r . ) Daisy .

( up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned takes up pause and seats himself in chair r. of table l. laughing ) Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope ( after a pause up c. , during which he looks after her , gasping speechlessly ; looking after her ) I 'll be hanged if she is n't a devilish plucky sort of girl . That rascal Tom ( down c. ) is n't so much to blame for loving her after all . ( turns to Ned , who is still laughing , and glares at him ; Ned pulls himself up ) Ned . Ned Moreland I 'm glad to see you 're coming round , General . Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope ( snarling at him ) I 'm not coming round , sir . Ned . Ned Moreland But you just said Miss Armitage was  --  Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope The sauciest minx I ever saw . Ned . Ned Moreland But you said Tom  --  Gen. Gen. Rufus Stanhope Tom 's an ungrateful villain . Ned . Ned Moreland General , I  --  ( rises , goes c . ) Gen. G en .

Tom marry Miss Armitage ! I swear I 'll prevent that if I have to marry her myself . ( goes off l. to his apartments ) Ned . Ned Moreland ( solus , sits l . ) What a peppery old gentleman ! Yet at times he 's the best-hearted man in the world . Strange ideas he has sometimes  --  marry Mrs. Winters ? Well , her husband would go insane beyond power of recovery if I did ! As it is , he 's crazy enough , though , from what I 've heard , he has recovered . Been released from the asylum , and is now on his way here . That ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

Isabel Howard She says that after he sent me upstairs , there was another dreadful names  --  and drove poor Tom out of the house Ned . Ned Moreland He did all that , dear , but I 'm sure he does n't mean it ; he was never known to harm anyone in his whole life ; he 'll forget all about his fit of temper to-morrow . Isa .

Daisy Armitage Yes , a bearded man with red hair , how horrid !

I shall never forget how I felt after the attack of fever he had , when he insisted I was n't this wife  --  how awkward it would have been for me if he had kept on thinking so .
