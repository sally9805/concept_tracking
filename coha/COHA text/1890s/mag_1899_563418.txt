txt Th an article called " The Curse in Education , " published in the May number of this REVIEW , Mrs. Rebecca Harding Davis wrote : " Has the public school done its work ? Has education been always an unmixed blessing to America and Americans ? This question can not be answered so easily and positively as loyal sons of the Republic may suppo* . ' , On the contrary , a very positive answer to this question is selfevident . No agency devised for the mental and moral improvement of mankind-no system of education , ethical training , or religion-has always , or has ever , done the whole of its purposed work ; the results actually achieved by such an agency have never yet been blessings unmixed and unalloyed with evils ; and we can not expect that they will be while men remain men . We should be unreasonable if we applied an absolutely ideal test to our public school system . But , on the other hand , we need not pause to judge it by the lowest practical test . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments , and then discuss whether the public school has done America more good or harm . Indisputably , the blessings it has bestowed far outweigh the curses . If we try to fancy what the condition of our land as a whole would be if it had had no free schools , the imagination shrinks from the first outlines of the picture . And if any city or district be individually considered , no really valid exceptions to the general rule will be found . Mrs. Davis wrote of an Acadian settlement in Louisiana , as she had seen it fifteen years before  --  a " lonely corner " where , with " no railways , no school houses , no politics , and no newspapers , " the people , few of whom could even read and write , were singularly // good and happy ; and she deplored the position taken by a lecturer at the North , who urged that schoolmasters should be sent to this idyllic village , " to open the way for railways , business , and civilization . " If such a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a strict taboo , it might have continued moral and contented without any schooling . But it was not a normal community in our day and land . It was a " survival , " an anachronism ; and , as such , inevitably destined to change . In other ages , other lands , there have been true gentlefolk who could neither read nor write . Such persons are unthinkable among ourselves ; and so is the perpetuation of pastoral ignorance and innocence in any locality . Business and the railroad , politics and the newspaper , can not be kept from touching any corner that happens still to be lonely in the modern white man 's world ; and , little as we may like the kind of civilization they sometimes bring with them , it would hardly be improved by the elimination of the schoolmaster . Mrs. Davis 's real contention , however , was that our educational system does not work as well as it might and should . This may be acknowledged . Yet it is dangerous to dwell exclusively upon its defects without indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , to lay upon the broad back of the public school all the responsibility for conditions that spring from a variety of causes . And there is a growing tendency toward both these mistakes . Mrs. Davis thinks that the school house is a " fetish " in our eyes-that we believe wherever it stands " a life-giving ichor goes out of it , which will conquer not only ignorance but poverty and crime . " Perhaps all Americans once felt thus . But now , whatever the faults and the shortcomings of a coimnunity , whatever the follies and the sins of its young people , many persons lay the whole blame upon what they call our craze for " over-education . " Because of this craze , they tell us , the hill towns and even the valley farms of New England are abandoned to nature or the immigrant , while the sons and daughters of the soil flock to the towns . Because of it , good servants are hard to find even in our largest cities . Because of it , early marriages grow fewer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , our men are becoming insanely ambitious and our women morbidly discontented , the professions are over-crowded , the trades suffer for reemits , and public life is contaminated by the domination of the // unfit . In short , if our school system is still our fetish , we have relapsed into a barbarian way of treating it . We praise and thank it sometimes ; but often we beat and spurn it because the rain does not fall , the fish will not bite , or the hunter breaks his leg . Mrs. Davis is not by any means the first who has pronounced upon an American village such a verdict as she passes on the one that she calls X- . By the clearness of her description I recognize X- as a place in which I lived for six or seven summers as Mrs. Davis 's neighbor . But I do not think that its condition is due to the presence of " the three huge school houses and the free library , " or even to the fact that they are not as good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coasting trades which once nourished X- , and fostered activity , self-reliance , and intelligence in its inhabitants , are dead ; but they were not killed by over-education . Many similar villages exist along our coasts , and those that possess no academies or libraries do not breed a more active or a happier type of man or woman than grey , little , derelict X- . They also are survivals , anachronisms , although in a different sense from the Acadian settlement . They must change or they will perish of dry rot ; and , while the school should do more than it now does to help them to change advantageously , other influences must assist in the work . The reasons why any American community , large or small , dissatisfies the loyal lover of the Republic , or why any class of its inhabitants does not always think and act as sound sense and good morals would prescribe , are very complicated . It is dangerous to exaggerate the share of blame that should be laid upon the public schools , or upon the beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or the other of two opposite errors . We may come to despise our school system , and , therefore , to neglect its improvement if not its maintenance ; or we may be tempted to expect too much from it , and , in consequence , to confuse and weaken its proper work by laying upon it burdens that it ought not to bear . Mrs. Davis 's article is , I think , a sign that the first-named danger is a real one . The second is illustrated by the people who , in these latter days , still cry out that the public schools should teach some dogmatic form of religion , or at least that vague and indefinable thing called " undogmatic Christianity , " or , at the very least , some formalized code of " Christian morality . " To ask this // is to ignore one of the great principles upon which our State and Federal governments were based . If , as Mrs. Davis says , our grandfathers were more religious than we , nevertheless they were very careful to sever religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put under the control of the State , leaving to the individual the duty of caring for his own and his children 's souls in his home , and through such religious or ethical institutions as he might choose to support . The full liberty in religious belief and practice that the fathers of the Republic thought absolutely essential , can not be combined with any form of religious instruction controlled or authorized by the State . Again , there are many persons who declare that the public schools should teach the manual trades . If so , logic demands that they should also teach the professions and the arts , the highest forms of specialized knowledge and the simplest handicrafts-that they should assume the whole work of secular education . But even to think of this is to mistake the real reason why our free school exists and is *upported by general taxation . It exists primarily for the sake of the State , of society , of the public , not for the sake of the individual child as such . It is bound to teach him such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in. the Republic , but not , specifically and completely , such as may be desirable to prepare him for the conduct of his personal career . And even in fitting him for life in the broader sense , it demands the intelligent co-operation of the home and of professedly ethical institutions . If it does not get this , its own work will be hampered ; the home , now considered the foundation stone of society , will lose its value by abdicating its influence over the young , and thus losing its cohesion and stability ; and the churches will deserve to be abolished as cumberers of the ground . Of course , no system of education , although avowedly and necessarily based upon what Mrs. Davis calls " book learning , " is sensible which confines itself to the information drawn from the printed page ; and no kind of secular education is good which cultivates nothing except the mind . Yet there is a valid distinction between courses of training for the mind , for the body , and for the conscience , heart , and soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needful , unless-borrowing certain ideas from the ancient Spartan , and some from the modern socialist-we think that the State should have absolute control of every child , from a very early age // until he is started upon a self-supporting adult career . Unless we think thus , it behooves us to see that the State does not infringe , within its schools , upon the rights of the family and the church , or weaken the feeling of the child that he must in great part depend upon himself for practical success in life ; and , on the other hand , it behooves us to strengthen the school by seeing that other educational agencies do their own work well , and that the efforts of all are harmonized and correlated . I have acknowledged that our school system , even within its proper province , does not educate our children as well as it might and should . The pleasantest and , I think , the most instructive way to point out some of its deficiencies will be to indicate the directions in which it is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a whole-as the school system of the United States ; there are too many differences , in school law and school practice , between one State and another , and between the towns in each . So I shall speak chiefly of one portion of the City of New York-the Borough of Manhattan and the Bronx , which , long a laggard with regard to the improvement of its school system , is now trying to bring it abreast with the foremost in the land . These , I may pause to explain , are no longer , generally speaking , to be found in New England . There are good schools and school systems in New England ; but the Middle West is now our educational leader . One hopeful sign to be noted in New York is the improvement of the sanitary condition of the school house  --  the closer and more intelligent attention paid to cleanliness , lighting , heating , ventilation , plumbing , and the care of the children 's out-door clothing . Another such sign is the effort to accommodate every child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third is the effort to bring into them all the children who now neglect the opportunities they offer  --  to deal helpfully with truants , to prevent the withdrawal of pupils before they finish the legally prescribed term of attendance , and to induce them to remain for still longer periods . Here I may cite a few figures . The average age of graduation from the primary schools of Manhattan and the Bronx was recently computed to be 10 years and 8 months ; and , in April , 1899 , their registers showed the names of 131,366 children . In the grammar schools the average VOL. cLxix. - io. 512. 6 // age of graduation was found to be 14 years , 9* months , and their register showed 90,511 names . Buffalo is another city with a large foreign population that needs to be Americanized as well as instructed , and here the falling off in attendance long before the school course has been completed is even greater than in New York . In October , 1897 , 37,884 pupils were enrolled in the primary grades of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammar grades , and only 2,494 in the high schools . Again , in Newark , New Jersey , in October , 1898 , the registers of the public schools showed 6,382 children enrolled in their lowest primary grade , as against 965 in their highest grammar grade , ( from which the average age of graduation is 14 years , 8-* months ) , while the senior class of the high school contained 110 pupils , and the total enrollment in the classes of the normal school was 98 . And in the schools of Flushing , Long Island , a town of about 10 ,  - -  000 inhabitants ( now a part of the Greater New York ) , the primary departments recently contained 826 children , and the grammar departments 450 , while there were 160 pupils in the High School . These figures ought to soothe the breasts of the people who say that we are " over-educating the children of the poor , " and that State instruction should be merely of an elementary kind ; and they certainly show that , in our cities at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the evils so often laid to its account . But they are figures that excite regret and alarm in the minds of those who believe in a general need for true education , as distinguished from elementary instruction ; and also of those who realize that the public school of to-day must train its teachers of to-morrow . Neither in right nor in wisdom can the State assume that private enterprise will supply it with a teaching force sufficient in numbers and adequately prepared . I need hardly say that a great deal more than an elementary education must be given to the men and women who are to instruct our children even in the most elementary branches , and to help to train them during the most impressionable years of their lives . And if it be true , as Mrs. Davis says , that " New England is filled with women competent to teach , standing in rows waiting for a vacancy , " nothing of the sort is true in New York City . Here the demand just now is greater than the supply , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet it . // It is well indeed that high schools have recently been established in New York , standing midway between the grammar schools and the free colleges , lengthening the term of school life , and solidifying , while extending , the advantages it offers . At the other end of the line from these , we find in Manhattan recently established kindergartens which are being rapidly increased in numbers . For the little children of the very poor , whose home training is deficient and whose playrooms are the streets , they are priceless blessings . And they do much more than merely shelter these children in their earliest years . They stretch their hands into the home , as the schools for older children can not so easily do , and bring it into closer relationship with the school ; and they emphasize the truths that something more than book instruction must be given , if even this is to be successful , and that something more than the mind must be trained , if even this is to be properly developed . The fact that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school system , is partly due to the influence of the " kindergarten spirit " - of the educational ideas upon which the sub-primary department is based . " The whole boy should be put to school . " " Character building is the task of the school . " These are relatively novel precepts , yet they have already become hackneyed by much iteration . They mean that , while secular knowledge must remain the school 's chief aim , and " book learning " its chief tool , the body , and the conscience , heart , and soul must be considered as well as the mind , and that right conduct , personal and social , must be taught as well as words and figures , dates and facts . In short , they mean that what Mrs. Davis says ought to be done is at least beginning to be done . Our children are being taught to assimilate and to use their knowledge , as well as to acquire it . One of the agencies now employed toward this end is physical training-not the mechanical military drill that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by good educators as physically inadequate and sometimes hurtful , and as morally opposed to that true spirit of discipline which means teaching a child to govern himself  --  but gymnastics and " organized play . " There are gymnasiums and roof-playgrounds in the new school buildings of Manhattan , and the law directs that none shall hereafter be built without an adjacent ground-space for open-air exercise . // Another agency for moral and physical as well as mental development is manual training . " Trade teaching and art teaching , " cry some , " or , if not this , then evidently a waste of time . " Neither the one nor the other . Manual training is not trade teaching or art teaching , any more than instruction in reading and writing is the teaching of authorship . A deft hand , ready to do the mind 's bidding , is almost as essential to useful , happy living as an eye acquainted with the conventional signs for transmitting thought . But this is the least part of the gain . To train the hand means to train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular and nervous systems into working accord . Some kinds of manual training give the whole body useful exercise . All kinds rest the brain and relieve the body after purely intellectual work , while cultivating them in another fashion and developing the creative instinct . And they teach directness of purpose , concentration of effort , accuracy of observation , and also mental and moral precision and honesty . The teacher , and even the pupil himself , may think that a book lesson has been learned when it has not been , or that an idea has been mastered when it has been only half grasped or wholly misunderstood . But this can not happen with manual work . A tangible thing is done , and rightly done , or it lb not . A stitched seam is straight , a leaf is correctly drawn , a carpenter 's joint is true , or it is not . Neither deception nor selfdeception is possible in the workshop , and the spirit of accuracy , system , conscientiousness , self-reliance , and helpful co-operation that it develops is carried over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cultivate taste as well as skill ; and , although it does not teach trades , it celebrates the dignity of manual labor , and often develops individual likings and aptitudes for it . The same is the case with the lessons in " domestic science " given to girls . They are not taught to be " professed " cooks or dressmakers . But their fingers , eyes , and palates are trained ; the importance of cleanliness , neatness , order , and exactness is impressed upon them ; respect for household work and interest in it are awakened ; and these great benefits are augmented by such instruction in hygienic and alimentary laws as could hardly be made to seem practical and important without the help of the cookingstove . Again , it is now understood in our schools that the text-book can not do its work well without the help of other books , and that // 85 school life should foster a habit of self-instruction , or , at least , a habit of finding rest and recreation in good literature , which will profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending libraries are being established in the schools themselves , and they are being brought into close practical touch with the free libraries of the city . The influence of the study of nature , as a broadening and a softening moral force , is being more and more clearly seen , and also the fact that it can not be brought to bear upon our walled-in , cooped-up city children , unless they are enabled to see and to handle , and to watch in their processes of growth , all such natural objects as can possibly be brought into the school-room . And so it is with the divine influence of beauty , although as yet only in a rudimentary degree . The old school houses of Manhattan were frankly ugly , inside and out . The new ones are doing their best to be beautiful , and in many ways reaching this aim . As yet , the school authorities do not attempt to adorn them with pictures and casts . But unofficial friends of the school-notably the Art Committee of the Public Education Association-have begun this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on more vigorously if the people of New York could only understand the immense educational value of simple and inexpensive but good works of art , not merely in making the school attractive to children that live amid squalid surroundings , but in stimulating their interest in their lessons , and in refining , civilizing , and inspiring their poverty-stricken little souls . It is hard to fancy a child who never sees any pictures , or to guess how his teachers can instruct him in certain branches . Yet there are thousands and thousands of children in New York who see none at all , excepting newspaper cuts , theatre posters , shop advertisements , and the little prints in their school books . The study of physics , in which much more attention than formerly is now paid to questions of hygiene ; the study of history , now understood to be a nursing-ground for intelligent patriotism ; the study of civics , in regard to which , of course , the same is true , and even geography , as it deals with the men of other lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are agencies for moral as well as mental training . In his Report for 1897-1898 , the Superintendent of Education in Buffalo writes that it is now generally acknowledged that a public school should give the young // " some direct preparation for citizenship ; " and his suggestions to teachers are illuminative : " Do not be satisfied with merely giving instruction . Try to inculcate a high standard of public duty , the obligation of patriotism and civic pride , a sense of danger to the country arising from official corruption . Show the need of placing public interests above private gain . Insist on the principle that every office exists solely for the benefit of the people and never for an individual or party . . . . The instruction is to be conversational rather than formal . " The same hand writes , again , of the general exercises held daily in all our schools : " These exercises should have a clearly marked ethical tendency , and should consist of short talks on current topics , historical and biographical sketches , the reading of choice selections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises , simple celebrations of Important anniversaries , etc . The design of these exercises is to give children sound and clear notions regarding their duties to God , their country , their neighbors , and themselves . " Thus , the definite teaching of ethics is established in our schools , and in more ways than these quotations indicate , although no formalized moral code is , or ought to be , taught in them . The responsibility for ethical training must lie with the teacher . Textbooks can not do such work , for it must be specially fitted to the needs of the moment and of the individual child . Of course , in the giving of any lesson , individual capacities and temperaments should be considered ; and , as Mrs. Davis points out , the greatest difficulty in public education is that it is obliged to " cultivate human souls en masse . " But , while this fact is more keenly appreciated than it used to be , and the effort to meet it by a greater individualizing of instruction in all branches of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiarly prominent fact as regards the training of the pupil in right conduct and worthy ideals of conduct . The direct influence of a human personality is the only efficient inculcator of righteousness . For this reason , especially , it is well that the need for thoroughly qualified public school teachers is more generally recognized than it used to be , and that the meaning of the term is being broadened and deepened . There was a time when " a gift for teaching , " what was called " a natural knack with children , " added to the possession of good text books , was thought a sufficient endowment at least for a teacher of the elementary branches . Then it was perceived that a teacher ought to be taught how to teach , // and for a time the pendulum swung too far ; the desirability of certain innate qualities was forgotten . Now , at last , it is seen that , while a teacher must indeed be made in a very complete sense , while she must not only know books and how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and child nature , she ought , furthermore , to have certain personal characteristics that may be strengthened into a deep sense of the varied responsibilities of her calling , an intelligent , loving sympathy with childhood , and a profound recognition of the truth that right thinking and not mere book learning , that wisdom and not mere knowledge , is the end and aim of education . For " useful lives and honorable citizenship " our children must be trained , writes the Superintendent whose words I have already quoted . This is the ideal that the school teachers of our country now have set before them . May the home and the church more and more intelligently assist them in a work which the school can not accomplish single-handed ! The inevitable limitations of the class-room are now recognized by the school authorities ; and they are broadening their work in many ways which can not fail to react happily upon the class-room itself . For example , during the winter of 1898-99 the School Board of Manhattan and the Bronx conducted thirty-one evening schools and four evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of adults and of young people forced to work in the day time ; and their value to the immigrant is proved by the fact that 4,604 of the pupils who were admitted could not read , while 10,742 required special instruction in the English language . During 1898 the Board also provided for adults , in fortyone school assembly rooms and other halls , 1,595 free evening lectures upon a great variety of interesting and instructive subjocts , including the duties of citizenship , and they attracted a total attendance of more than half a million persons , the majority of whom were men of the working classes . During the summer months , the Board conducts vacation schools for its children , in which many useful and entertaining things are taught , but not book-learning of the conventional kind ; and it also opens the playgrounds of many of the schools , under intelligent supervision , for more purely recreative purposes . It means to extend its instructions in " organized play " to the little frequenters of the recreation piers , and , if the city authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it has granted to the Public Education Association the playgrounds and some of the class rooms in two school houses , to be used on winter evenings by children 's clubs . This last-named work , it is hoped , will spread very widely . It is a presage of the time when the public may be allowed a more general use of the costly buildings that it owns , during the hours when the schools are not in session . And it is one of the signs that , beyond professedly educational circles , a widespread movement to better , to aid , and to supplement our schools has begun . In Manhattan , this movement is not of more than five years ' growth , but it is already vigorous and influential . It shows in that activity of the free libraries to which I have already referred , in the co-operation with the schools of the " Settlements " ' that are cenfres of light and of education in the broader sense in many of cur poorer districts , and in the close attention that the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shows , also , in the establishment of such non-professional societies as the Public Education Association , the Kindergarten Association , the Outdoor Recreation League , and the City History Club . The first of these devotes itself wholly to studying the condition and furthering the welfare of the schools , and to keeping the press and the public awake with regard to them . The second started free kindergartens before our school authorities realized the need for them . The third induced these authorities to open the school playgrounds for summer use , and works diligently in many ways for the healthful amusement and physical development of the people . And , it may be added , the Children 's Aid Society , with the help of popular subscriptions , established the vacation schools of which the city has now assumed the charge . These are some of the patent signs that as a whole the people of New York have awakened to the immense importance of the public school , to the fact that the future of the city depends upon it , and to the allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and the deepest interest of the community are directed upon it . Similar signs may be read in a great many other Amencan cities and towns . And if many rural districts lag behind , they open a fertile field of effort for the summer visitor , who now so often complains of their intellectual and moral shortcomings . // ments that are being wrought in the curriculum of our public schools , and can merely note in passing the happy fact that its methods of discipline are being revolutionized , so that free , cheerful , and almost self-governing companies of children may replace those strictly ruled , physically repressed , and often mentally cowed bands which were formerly the average teacher 's ideal of a " welldrilled " class . But I must say a final word from the standpoint of one who , during the past five years , has had a personal acquaintance with the New York public school and , outside its walls , with those classes of the population that most deeply need its help . The more I have studied it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it has to cope and the way in which it is often isolated in its effort to cope with them , the more clearly I have realized the difference between the average child that it now turns out and the average pareiat of foreign or even of American birth , the longer I have reflected upon the picture our crowded and polyglot poorer quarters would present if it did not exist  --  the more I have been impressed , not by its defects but by its merits , not by its failures but by its successes , not by the deficiencies of its teachers but by their unselfish devotion and the educational intelligence they often display , even when their scholastic equipment is not of the best . Any reader who will take the same practical method of inquiring into the question will soon be brought , I think , to agree with me that " a life-giving ichor " does indeed go out of our public schools , even in their present imperfect estate . And , seeing how steadily and rationally they are being improved , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance , poverty , and crime , they will win victories greater than any that have yet been won or can yet be foreseen in the ceaseless battle that imperfect humanity must wage against these three terrible foes . Surely it is foolish to lose faith and courage because , in less than a century , the American free school has not done all that the home and the church , active ever since the birth of civilization , have failed to accomplish . But a cautious person may well shrink from predicting what it may do , even within the next hundred years , lest he be accused of airy optimism by those who have fallen into the mistake of blaming popular education for many of the social evils and shortcomings which , in fact and in tiuth , it is doing more than any other agency to uproot and to cure.
