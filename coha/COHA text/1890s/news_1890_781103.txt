txt The most sensational kind of a religious and political war prevails in Clearfield Town and County . On one side are arrayed the Catholics , and on the other the Protestants . The latter are mostly organized in the patriotic order of the Sons of America , and a British and Scottish - American association . Both are bitterly opposed to Catholics . They have been working together politically in the town of Houtzdale . Houtzdale had been strongly Catholic and Democratic , but at the last municipal election the Protestants through their work at the polls defeated all the Catholic Democrats and Republicans and elected a citizen 's ticket composed exclusively of Protestants . This greatly angered the Catholics . White Hixon , editor of the Houtzdale Observer , for attacking the Catholics in his paper , was threatened with death , and always went armed . He was attacked one night , but upon Displaying a revolver ho was allowed to go . Nixon entered suit against all his assailants , and they are now nuder-bonds awaiting trial . At a recent horse race a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savage , one of the Catholic leaders , and a prominent man , villifying the Protestants , because a Protestant constable was about to remove him from the track where he had no business . Savage and the other Catholics who were in the riot were arrested and held for court . It looks as if the presence of the militia will be necessary to prevent bloodshed when the case comes to trial . It is charged that at a recent funeral a Catholic priest instead of preach-ing a sermon directed a tirade against the Protestant relations of the deceased who were present , and knocked the hat of one off because it was put on before the wearer got clear outside of the church .
