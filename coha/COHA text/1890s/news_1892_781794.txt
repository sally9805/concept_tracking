txt The platform of the Republican Party , adopted at Minneapolis , contains the fol-lowing : " We believe that on all imports coming into competition with the produots of American labor there should be levied duties equal to the difference between wages abroad and at home . " That is to say , the duties should be equal to the difference between the cost of the labor used iu making a product here and the cost of the labor usedin manufacturing the similar and competing product in a forei gn country . The labor cost of a product is not easily ascertained . It happens , however , that the Republicans themselves have procured through the agency of Mr. CAItROLL D. WRIGHT , Commissioner of Labor , reports setting forth the tabor cost of certain protected products . One of these products is steel rails Let us see how much light his inquiry and reports throw upon the question as to the size of a duty that shall be " equal to the difference between wages abroad and at home " in the steel-rail industry . Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , eight on the Continent of Europe , and three in Great Britain . Concerning the total cost of rails in this country ho said : " The Department has been positively informed relative to the cost of making steel rails in several of the very largest establishments in the United States , and there is no shadow of doubt in the mind of the writer that In these establishments the actual cost of standard steel rails is , and has been for some time , within a few cents of $22 per ton at the works . " This report was made in February , 1891 , and the cost is lower now because the price of the raw material is lower . He found that the lowest cost of manufacturing steel rails in Great Britain was about $ ' 8 or a little less , " so that , " ho said , " the difference between the lowest cost of British steel rails of sixty pounds to the yard and the lowest cost of the same grade of rails in the United States is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total cost . It may be borne in mind that the manufacturer in this country is protected . by a duty of $13.44 per ton , plus the ocean freight charges . In computing the cost of the labor Mr. WRIGHT followed . the ore step by step through every process of manufacture up to the finished rail , adding the labor cost of producing the materials to the labor cost of each change . The result in the case of the American mill selected was that the entire labor cost of a ton of rails was found to be $11.597 . By the same process the labor cost of a ton of rails made at a representative mill in . Great Britain was shown to be $7.817 , and the cost of the labor used in producing a ton of rails at a representative mill on the Continent of Europe was fi5ed. at $8.104 . We quote his summary : " From these statements it will be seen that for the establishments given the direct labor cost of producing a ton of standard steel rails in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continent of Europe $8.104 , showing a difference against the United States of $8.780 in favor of Great Britain and of $3.493 in favor of the Continent of Europe . " We show these differences , as disclosed by the inquiries of the Harrison Administration , in connection with the duty imposed by the McKinley tariff : deleted table It will be seen that the duty is nearly four times " the difference between . wages abroad and at home , " and . that it even exceeds the entire labor cost in this country . A duty " equal to the difference between wages " would be less than $4 per ton , by the admission of Mr. HARRISON 'S own Commissioner of Labor . Tho imposition of a duty of $13.44 enables the manufacturers in this country to maintain their unlawful Trust combination , by means of - which the uniform ring price of $30 per ton has been exacted . throughout the last ' eighteen months in spite of a notable reduction of the cost of their raw material . And yet , any one who suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republican platform , and no more , is invariably denounced by our high-tariff friends as a free trader and an enemy of his country 's industries .
