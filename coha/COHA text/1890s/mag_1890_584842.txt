txt HE popularity of surfbathing as a sport may be said to be of fairly recent growth in this country . Mthough few perhaps realize the fact , it is nevertheless true that most of the beaches where now the surf curls over net-works of lifelines , and where the brown-faced bathing-master lounges , lazy yet watchful , before hundreds of gayly clad pleasureseekers , were solitudes but a few years since . The white-topped waves tumbled , one after another , uunoticed upon the gray shore , the sea-breeze played only with the rank grasses upon the dunes , while circling gull and tern screamed their confidential communications to each other without fear of being overheard by human eavesdroppers . Only on Saturdays , at the hour of full tide , did the scene change ; and then perhaps a farm-wagon or so rolled heavily down to where the ripples lapped the sand ; a stout rope was drawn from its coil under the seats and tied firmly around the hub and axle ; a dilapidated fish-house lent itself for a change of garments , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a flannel shirt and old trousers tied with ropes at waist and ankles , slipped his wrist through the hand-loop at the free end of the rope and dragged it out into the surf  --  a sort of human anchorbuoy-while women , children , and less sturdy manhood clung to its now tightening , now slackening length , and sputtered and shrieked over their Saturday bath . But , passing at a bound from farmwagon , hand-looped rope , and ex-whaler to the less picturesque , but more effectual , appliances of to-day , the following is by all odds the simplest and best . Two parallel ropes , firmly anchored , and so elevated from the shore as to lie along the surface of the water , are run out to two heavy log-buoys , also anchored , at a distance of seventy-five yards , more or less , according to the character of both beach and surf . Halfway from the shore to the buoys these ropes should be connected by a transverse line with cork-floats fastened at regular intervals  --  the distances being such that the cork-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the heaviest breakers comb . If placed closer in shore , it is likely to become a source of serious danger , for , diving beneath a heavy wave and coming up under , or perhaps being thrown with more or less force against , a taut rope or a rough cork-buoy , has been the occasion of many painful hurts , and serious injury can be very readily imagined . Regard being had to the above caution , this system of life-lines is really safer than much more elaborate contrivances . Women , children , and the inexperienced in general should keep within the rectangle formed by the shore , the long ropes , and the cork-line ; and they would , moreover , do wisely to stay near that rope lying upon the side from which the surf may " set . " Then , if swept off their feet , the chances are all in favor of their being carried within reach of some support which will keep them up until assistance can be had . It seems hardly necessary to say that any such complication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , would be a danger rather than a safeguard in any surf heavy enough to " throw " a bather . A word as to bathing costumes may be of some service here . A man 's suit should be of flannel , because that material is both warm and light ; it should be made in one piece , sleeveless , reaching just to the knee , belted in at the waist , and , above all , close-fitting . There are few , nowadays , who do not appreciate the privilege of playing with the Atlantic Ocean ; but perhaps there are fewer still who have ever taken the // trouble to study the character and humors of their playmate-for he is full of tricks , this same ocean , and his jests are sometimes sadly practical ; he is all life and good spirits  --  the jolliest of jolly company-when he is in the humor ; but he must be treated with tact , tact born of a knowledge of his ways and moods ; and , above all , his would-be friends must learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must leave him to rave or grumble alone until boisterous good-nature resumes its sway . Watch and note the character of the surf and the formation of the beach for a few days ; the knowledge gained may be useful . Do you see that line of breakers a quarter of a mile away ? There lies the bar , and to-day the surf is heavy enough to break upon it , though the depth there must be at least six feet . Sometimes it is shallower , and , if you are ambitious and-foolish , you can wade and swim out there and meet the waves first-hand . It is not worth while to run the risk , though ; the seas will usually form again long before they reach the shore , and , if you are sensible , you can enjoy them fully as much here as if you had put several hundred yards between yourself and help in the always possible contingency of accident . No , it is not remarkably rough now ; but last week ! you should have been here then . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see floating above the horizon , where some hidden steamer is ploughing her way through blue water ; and the great seas rolled and tumbled upon the bar and broke there , but they had no time to form themselves again . Plunging onward under their own impulse and beaten out of shape by fiercely thronging successors , they rushed in toward the shore , a seething turmoil of foam , sweeping the sand from one side and heaping it up on another-all white above and gray below from bar to beach . Next week there may be scarce a ripple ; you would not know there was an outer bar , and the wavelets , as they lap the sand , will seem so placid that you can not conceive how they could ever have lost their temper . In spite of all its changes , however , the surf has sometimes local characteristics as fixed as anything can be with which the fickle ocean has to do . For instance , on the Atlantic coast the storms are generally bred and nurtured in the east ; the milder weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that those who have spent much time upon the New Jersey beaches have probably noticed that during very heavy weather the waves , as a rule , roll straight upon the shore ; while when the surf is lighter it is apt to run diagonally , or , as they say , " sets " from the south . On the Long Island coast all this is reversed ; there , when the storm winds prevail , the " set " is strong from the east , and the foam and breakers race along the beach from Montauk toward the Metropolis ; while at other times the surf will usually run straight on . It is hardly necessary to say that a surf without " set " is far more agreeable and somewhat safer . A bather is not forced to fight constantly against the impulse that is drifting him down the beach and away from companions , ropes , and bathing-grounds . The strength and height of the waves depend mainly upon influences at work far out upon the ocean , but the beach , as shaped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The finest surf will be found underthe following conditions : First , let there be a storm well out at sea , sending the big rollers straight onto the beach , and then a sharp wind offshore for a few hours . The effect of this will be , in the first instance , to thin the waves , and he who is fortunate enough to make trial of them under such circumstances will find a high , clean-cut surf , each breaker of which combs over in even sequence , and yet without such weight or body of water as to seriously threaten his equilibrium . Should that same wind off-shore blow for a few hours longer , the tops of the waves will be cut off and the ocean become too calm to be interesting . I speak of a " fine surf , " but were each man asked what he understands by it or by the term " good bathing , " his definition would probably be largely governed by his skill and ability to take care of himself . For instance , what would be highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough for those compelled by weakness , timidity , or inexperience to stand near the shore and look on ; while what might be agreeable to them would be tame for him . The opinion of such as say , " Was n't it splendid to-day ! Why , I swam way out to the bar , " need not be considered . They do n't enjoy surf-bathing ; itis only the swimming that they care for , and they would doubtless be even better pleased at any point on Long Island Sound . But what I take to be , and what I mean by , " a good bathing-day , " is one on which a man who understands himself can take the surf as it comes , either alone or " with convoy , " and yet , when there is an ever-present excitement in the knowledge that a second 's carelessness may result in an overthrow of both his person and his pride . Turning now from the water to the beach itself we find its formation varies , from day to day and from year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forever smiting it . It may deepen gradually or abruptly , and the shoaling of an abrupt beach is usually the result of some days ' heavy sea " setting " from one direction or the other , which cuts away the sand above low water-mark and spreads it out over the bottom . But that characteristic which at the same time varies and affects us most is the position and depth of what is known as the " ditch , " that is , where , sometimes at a few feet , sometimes at several yards from the shore , will be found a sudden declivity caused by the continual pounding of the surf along one line , and consequently lying farther out in heavy weather , and conversely . As a source of danger this same " ditch " is often very materiaL Often a man ignorant of the surf , perhaps a poor swimmer or no swimmer at all , starts to wade out waist or breast deep . To his eyes there is no sign of peril ; - one step more , and lo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just where the waves are pounding him down and the conditions most potent to deprive him of his much-needed presence of mind . Nor is this all ; - he may not , of his own free will , take that last step which involves him in all this difficulty , for it is at the edge of the " ditch " where the " under-tow " is strongest ; nay , morethe very strength of the " under-tow " depends largely upon the depth of the ditch . Doubtless we have all heard a great deal about this " under-tow , " as though it were some mysterious force working from the recesses of a treacherous ocean to draw unwary bathers to their doom . As a matter of fact its presence is obviously natural , and the explanation of it more than simple . As each wave rolls in and breaks upon the beach , the volume of water which it carries does not remain there and sink into the sand ; it flows back again , and , as the succeeding wave breaks over it , the receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of water contained in each breaker , and , again , proportionate in a great measure to the depth of the ditch . Where this latter is an appreciable depression , it can be readily seen that the water of receding waves will flow into it with similar effect to that of water going over a fall , and that a person standing near is very likely to be drawn over with it , and thus , if the ditch is deep enough , carried out of his depth . This is all there is to the muchtalked-of " under-tow " and the numerous accidents laid to its account . It may be well to speak here of another phenomenon not infrequently observed . I do not recall ever seeing the name by which it is known in print , and , as the word is ignored by Webster , I shall invent my own spelling and write it " sea-poose . " This term is loosely used on different parts of the coast , but the true significance of it is briefly this : There will sometimes come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose its head and to act in a very capricious way . On such occasions it often happens that the beach is cut away at some one point , presumably where the sand happens to be softer and less capable of resisting the action of the water . There will then be found a little bay indenting the shore , perhaps ten feet , perhaps ten yards . The waves rolling into such a cove are deflected somewhat by its sides and " set " together at its head , so that two wings of a breaker , so to speak , meet and , running // straight out from the point of junction , form a sort of double " under-tow , " which will , if the conditions that cause it continue , cut out along its course a depression or trench of varying depth and length . It can be readily understood that such a trench tends to strengthen the current that causes it , and these two factors , acting and reacting upon each other , occasion what might be called an artificial " undertow " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some distance out , in a fashion that will cause him either to be glad he is , or to wish he were , within the rectangle of the lifelines . I have sometimes heard old surfmen speak of what they call a " false poose , " but I have never been able to find out just what was meant by the expression , much less its causes and character . I shall therefore leave the question for those who delight to delve into the mysteries of local nomenclature . And now , standing upon the dunes , our eyes have wandered over the expanse of ocean with a glance more critical and inquiring as it drew near the shore . The salt savor of the breeze is , at the same time , a tonic and an anodyne ; we are drowsy , but the sea yet draws us to itself with an irresistible impulse ; the waves are rolling straight in and breaking high and clean ; shall we plunge into their cool depths ; shall we combat their strength ; or ride them as they come galloping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green to the white , until at last they fall spent upon the gray sand of the beach ? Surely ! Who is there can stand by and resist such temptation ! But wait ! Surf-bathing is not a solitary sport . See ! the beach is thronged with gay toilets and bright sunshades , and the water has already given place to many . Watch that couple as they run gracefully down to the shore ; they dash confidently out ; now they have almost reached the line where the waves are breaking ; he takes her hands , and they stand prepared to " Jump the breakers  --  and then ! and then a big , foamy crest curls over them and falls with a roar ; and , as it rolls in , you think you see a foot reaching up pathetically out of its depth , and now a hand some yards away , until at last , from out the shallows of the spent wave two dazed and bedraggled shapes stagger to their feet and look , first for themselves , and then for each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilets , ani the gay sunshades nod their appreciation . There stand some men , just where the breakers comb , and , as each wave succeeds its precursor and rises into a crest , you may see the half-dozen brownarmed figures shooting over , like so many porpoises , and plunging headforemost under the advancing hill of water . Look ! there come some big ones - one , two , three of them ! The bathers see them too , and press out a few yards into deeper water ; and then the diving commences . It is sharp work this time ; the big ocean-coursers are running close upon each other 's heels , and the heads scarcely emerge after the first before the second is curling directly above ; now they have passed , and each breathless bather looks around to see how the rest have fared-three , four , five  --  but where is the sixth ? A roar of laughter floats shoreward as a demoralized form is seen to gather itself up , almost upon the beach ; that last breaker of the trio struck too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // tell you just how many somersaults he has turned since the ocean proceeded to take him in hand , but he is sure that they numbered somewhere among the twenties . Yes , it is brisk sport , and we must " go in . " But then , it does not look comfortable , to be thrown ; nor will it please our conceit to so minister to the good-natured mirth of that gay company . It is pleasanter to be among the laughersand so we shall be . To that end a few hints will perhaps be found useful , and even though what I shall say may , when said , seem to be obvious enough , yet it is amazing how few people will , of themselves , perceive the obvious and utilize their perceptions . You , my scornful friend , who think you know it all ; you will go to Southampton next summer , and  --  the spirit of prophecy being upon meyou will be thrown , ignominiously thrown , eight times inside of two weeks ; so , remember that much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least might as well be , as far as practice is concerned . And now , to return to the ocean and to didactics . We shall assume , in the first place , that you are able to swim , and further , that you are not minded to follow the inglorious , yet really dangerous , example of those who wait for a calm interval , and then , rushing through the line of breakers , spend their time swimming out beyond . Well , then , take your place just where the seas comb . This point will vary somewhat with the height of the waves , but you will stand , for the most part , in water about waist deep ( as shown in Fig. 1 ) . Should a particular breaker look to be heavier than the preceding , remember that it will strike further out and that you must push forward to meet it . Then , if you are where you should be , it will comb directly above your head . Wait until it reaches that point of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late your chances of being thrown are greatly increased , and , with the white crest just curving over you , dive under the green wall of water that rises up in front . Dive just as you would from a low shore , only not quite so much downward-say at an angle of twenty degrees off the horizontal ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) ; your object being to slip under the incoming volume of water , to get somewhat into the " under-tow , " and yet to run no risk of rnnning afoul of the bottom . The heavier the wave , the deeper will be the water in which you stand , and the deeper you can and should dive . If your antagonist be very big and strong , you will find it advisaFig. 3. rz* Fig. 2 . N , // SURF AND SUkF*BA THING . ble to strike out the instant you have plunged ; very much on the theory that , as a bicycle will stand when in motion and fall the instant it stops , so a man can , by swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better against the peculiar vibratory motion which one experiences when under a big wave and surrounded by conflicting currents . Swimming will also tend to bring you to the surface again under full control , and , provided you have acted with judgment , you will find yourself , when the wave has passed , standing on about the line from which you plunged . A thing good to remember but difficult to explain the cause of , is that extraordinarily heavy waves almost invariably travel by threes ; that is , very often , when you have been standing at one spot and taking perhaps a dozen breakers , you will of a sudden see , rolling in from the bar , a hill of water and foam much higher and heavier than those that have gone before . Then be sure that there are two more of similar magnitude close behind it and push forward as fast as you can . If it seems very heavy and you have time , you may try VOL . YIIL-40 The Saturday Bath in the Old Days . to get beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible , you must dive low , swim , come to the surface promptly , dash the water from your eyes , and be ready for numbers two and three ; and when all have passed , if you are still in good shape , you will find some long draughts of air very agreeable . Sometimes it will happen that you can not get far enough out in time to meet these big seas at the proper point , and then it is that your reputation as a surf-man willbe in danger , at least among those who judge by success alone . There is only one thing to do ; dive under the foam as it boils toward youdive deep and swim hard . The wave and the " under-tow " will be here commingled in a sort of whirlpool , and y on will need all your strength and skill to keep " head-on . " Suffer yourself to be twisted but a few inches from your course , and  --  but doubtless you understand . There is a rather amusing way of playing with the surf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without much force . Instead of diving as the breaker commences to comb , throw yourself over backward and allow your feet to be car-/ // ned up into its crest . Provided you have judged its strength accurately and given yourself just enough back somersault impetus , you will be turned completely over in the wave ( Figs. 4 and 5 ) , and strike with it and upon your feet ; only be careful in picking out your plaything , and do n't select one that will pound you into the sand , or perhaps refuse to regulate the number of somersaults according to your wishes or intentions . Now , it is more than possible that , being a good swimmer , and having first made personal trial of both beach and surf , you may desire to offer your escort to -- well , to your sister ; and right here let me note a few preliminary cautions . Never attempt to take a woman into the surf where there is any reason for an experienced surfman to anticipate a sea which , unaccompanied , you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ditch is more than breast deep ; or When the under-tow or " set " is especially strong ; or When there is any irregularity of the beach which might cause a " sca-poose " to form . You may also find it wise to observe the following : Never take a woman outside the life-lines , and never promise her , either cxpressly or by implication , that you will not let her hair get wet . Above all , impress it upon her that she must do exactly as you say , that a moment 's hesitation due to timidity or lack of confidence , or , worse than all , anything like panic or an attempt to break from you and escape by flight , is likely to precipitate a disaster which , unpleasant and humiliating when met alone , is trebly so in company . And now , having read your lecture on the duty of obedience , etc. , lead on . Of course , if the water deepens gradually and the surf is very light , you may go beyond the breakers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions needed . There are several good ways of holding a woman in the surf , but the best and safest in every emergency is that shown in Fig. 6 . You thus stand with your left and her right side toward the ocean , and as the wave rises before you , your companion should , at the word , spring from the sand while at the same moment you swing her around with all your force , and throw her backward into the advancing breaker ( Fig. 7 ) . You will observe that your own feet are always firmly planted on the bottom , the left foot about twelve inches advanced , and your body and shoulders thrown forward , so as to obtain the best brace against the shock of the water . The question of preserving your equilibrium is largely one of proper balancing , especially when , as is often the case , you are carried from your foothold and Fig. 5 . Fig. 4. // borne some yards toward the shore . Your companion 's weight and impetus , as well as the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of you , all tend to make your anchorage more secure , or in case of losing it , your balance the easier to maintain . The body of the wave will , of course , pass completely over you ( as shown in Fig. 8 ) . The instant it has so passed and your head emerges , clear your eyes , regain your position ( you will practically drop into it again ) , and if carried shoreward , press out to the proper point so as to be ready for the next . Should an exceptionally heavy sea roll in , endeavor to push forward to meet it as if you were alone , being very careful , however , not to get out of depth . Flight is almost always disastrous . If the sea strikes before you can reach it , there is nothing to do but bend your head and shoulders well forward , brace yourself as firmly as possible , and thus , presenting the least surface for the water to take hold of , and getting the full benefit of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent low and thrown herself forward ) horizontally under the broken wave ( Fig. 9 ) . If she has had much experience , it will be still better for you to dive together , side by side . Before dropping this branch of the subject I will call attention briefly to another way of carrying a woman through the surf . Let her stand directly in front of and facing you ( as shown in Fig. 10 ) . Standing thus , she springs and is pushed backward through the wave somewhat as in the former instance ( Fig. 11 ) . The disadvantages of this method are , first that you lose in impetus by pushing rather than swinging your companion ; second , that she can not herself see what is coming third , that neither is in as convenient a position to hurry forward to meet an exceptionally heavy wave ; and fourth , that you have not as good a hold in case a sea breaks before it reaches you , or any other emergency arises . In all that has been said , bear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingencies , is proper balancing , and nothing but experience seconding knowledge can teach you to measure forces and judge correctly to that end . So far the sea has been a good-natured though sometimes a rough playfellownever really irritable or vindictive ; but unfortunately this disposition can not be counted upon . That there are dangers attendant upon ocean-bathing , he who has been present when human life was being fought for can abundantly testify . To be sure , most of the " accidents* ' are results of carelessness or ignorance ; but then the same may be said of accidents everywhere , and a short summary of the dangers peculiar to the surf may be of use . Some of these have been already indicated , as , for instance , dangers arising from the " under-tow . " This by itself is not likely to trouble anyone except a very poor swimmer , and then only when the ditch is deep ; for the reason that the power of the " under-tow " is confined practically to within the line of breakers and can not carry a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-poose , " however , it is different . I have seen a current of this character running out for many yards beyond a man 's depth , and against which Fig. 6. // Fig. 7. a strong swimmer would find it almost impossible to make headway . Fortunately , such instances are rare , but he who may be thus entangled must remember ; the moment he realizes his predicament , that by attempting to fight K the current and swim directly toward the beach , he , as a general thing , only wastes his strength . He must strike out for a few yards along shore , and a slight effort so directed will soon take him out of the dangerous influence . Again , the " under-tow " may help to a diaaster in the following way : As a rule , there is no real danger in being thrown by a breaker , but there have been occasions when an inexperienced or exhausted bather has been struck in such a way , or thrown with such force , as to be more or less injured or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself , and while prostrate in the water , he has been drawn back by the " under-tow , " rolled under and pounded down by each succeeding breaker , and finally even drowned . The great majority , however , of drowning accidents on the sea - board - that is , of those which can be even indirectly attributed to the surf - take place under the following circumstances : Some strong swimmer comes to the beach , entirely ignorant of the strength and ways of the ocean ; he sneers at the warnings of surfmen , and , choosing a calm interval , dashes through the line of breakers and amuses himself by swimming out ; ropes and log-buoys are entirely beneath his notice . Finally he begins to feel tired ; the chop of the seas splashes up into his nose and eyes ; it is not so easy as swimming in still water , and he concludes to come in . Now , the chances are that he will do this without any serious difficulty , even though he does not quite understand how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 when on the inner slope and summit of each wave , until it fairly shoots him toward the shore ; and then to rest and hold his own while on the outer slope and in the trough . There is always , however , just a possibility , and the stronger the surf the more possible is it that the inexperienced swimmer can not come through the line of breakers when and where he wants to ; he must wait their pleasure , and , if he has measured his strength closely and the delay be long , it is easy to see how that , in trying to pass , he may be thrown down into the " nuder-tow " and lack sufficient strength to extricate himself . Next to caution and life - lines , surf dangers are best provided against by a long rope with a slip-noose at the end , either wound on a portable reel or coiled and placed at the lowest point of the beach . Then a rescuer , throwing the noose around his waist , can make his way to a drowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shore . In default of some such contrivance , the next best thing is for all the able-bodied to form a chain of hands ; for , let me say , there is nothing more difficult , even for a strong swimmer and expert surfman , than bringing a drowning person in through or out of a line of heavy breakers . I recall an incident which happened some years since at Bridgehampton , Long Island , and which illustrates the difficulty of which I speak . A young clergyman had arrived only the day beFig. // lore ; he was unable to swim a stroke ; and his first exploit was to wade out into the ocean , entirely ignorant of the fact that the ditch was that day both abrupt and deep  --  or perhaps even that there was such a thing as a ditch-and that a single step would take him from a depth of four feet and safety , into one of six and considerable danger . Whether he took the step , or the " under-tow " took it for him , is not material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dashed in , and , reaching the drowning man , were able to keep his head above water ; but , what with this and fighting the waves , they could not seem to make an inch shoreward . There were not many on the beach at the time , and only four or five men who could be of any use . A chain of hands was promptly formed , but it was not long enough to bring the inside man into water less than waist deep , and the " under-tow , " pouring into the big ditch , sucked with all its might . So they swung backward and forward , now gaining , now losing ground , and meanwhile the bathing-master and those nearest him , being out of depth , were fast becoming exhausted . All , so far , had instinctively tried to fight the waves , but it was evident that a change of tactics was necessary ; and , fortunately , at that moment a great ridge of water was seen sweeping in . Thought came quickly then , and the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the line ; then it struck , and , for a moment , there was a confused tangle of legs and arms and heads and bodies swirled around , over , under , and against each other . Those closer inshore were hurled upon the beach , but the chain held together long enough to drag the others into a place of safety . Though there were no casualties of any consequence , I am very certain that each link of that chain will not soon forget the experience and will appreciate the truth of my last statement . And now , let me try to temper all this by saying that the dangers of surf-bathing are , in reality , much less than those that beset still-water swimming , where one is usually out of his depth and with very little chance of escape in case of cramp or exhaustion . Only make friends with the ocean , learn its ways , study its moods a little , and humor it , while you keep careful watch against any sudden ebullition of passion . Those who stand aloof can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance which has been made in natural science during the last century has led to a great change in our conception as to the relations of mankind to the earth . Of old , men looked upon themselves as accidents upon this sphere . In the light of modern science , we regard our species as the product of terrestrial conditions . We conceive man as the summit and crown of the longcontinued progressive changes which have led his bodily structure up from the dust to its present elevated estate . In the progress of organic advance which has led through inconceivably numerous stages of existence from the primal base of life to the estate of man , the dependence of beings on the conditions which surrounded them has always been very close . The lowliest organism is influenced by the temperature in air or water , by the conditions of the soil or sea-bottom , or the circumstances which serve to bring it the needful food . With each advance of intellectual power the dependence on environment becomes more and more intimate , for with that intelligence the creature seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chases its prey , flees from pursuers , herds with its kind , and is thereby educated to a sympathetic life . When the human state is attained , when the progressive desires of man are aroused , the relations of life to the geography and other conditions of environment increase in a wonderfully rapid way . When the tool-making stage is won , the savage must become , in a certain way , a geologist . He learns perforce to seek for particular kinds of stone with which he may point his arrows and spears , to make the mortars and pestles with which to grind his corn or the clay of his pottery . The next stage , that of agriculture , yet further increases the measure of dependence on the character of the earth . As soon as the rude combats of the earlier man develop into the military art , the work of attack and defence leads to a close relation of the developing savage to the topographic conditions which he encounters . When commerce arises , the dependence of man on the shape of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these elements of civilization , the arts of the household , of war , and of trade , the chains which bind men to the earth about them is manifolded . It is impossible to depict in an adequate way the measure of dependence of our modern civilized man upon the world about him . All the functions of his body and mind depend curiously on objects from the ends of the earth . Thus our meals commonly mean many thousand miles of transit to bring the food together ; the clothing of our bodies brings the wool of Australia , the cotton of the Carolinas , the silk of Italy or China , the gold of California , the leather of Paraguay , the arts of hands and brains in a dozen different peoples together . Our daily thoughts take hold on the ends of the earth . The relation of our modern states upon the conditions of the earth is inconceivably greater than that of the ancient tribe . In the wonderful state of Britain the national life functions with reference to the topography of high Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until almost every storm and every drought reacts upon the national life . Ministers , and with them the purposes of the state , are changed by the chance of some battlefield at the antipodes . A drought in the plains of the upper Mississippi means dear bread in England , fewer marriages , and shorter lives ; in other words , it // produces an effect on the whole social status of the country . A disturbance such as our Civil War , which arrests the cotton export of the United States , starves Manchester and sets the rulers of Britain against the cause of freedom in America . It is , indeed , difficult to present an adequate picture of the physiographical reactions which civilized man experiences through the geographic condition of the earth 's surface , for such a picture would have to disclose the infinitely complicated machinery of our society . I must beg my readers to aid me by imagining their own position in relation to the earth 's features . There is , however one aspect of the increasing dependence of man on nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and so important that we should notice it at least in a passing way . The largest element of this growth is found in the gain in the sympathetical motives which have arisen from a larger understanding of the world and a closer application of the human mind to its phenomena . It is a curious feature in the culture of Greece that it never seems to have been sympathetically concerned with the people beyond the limits of the native state . The Greek thought of most things which we think about , but this matter , which now much occupies our mind , did not concern him . It appears to me that the modern sympathy of man with the world about him which manifests itself in the love of the unseen savage , in the love of the beautiful , in the love of scientific inquiry for the sake of knowledge alone , is the last product of those vast interactions which have come from the extension of the contacts of man with nature , first through commerce and afterward through less economic motives . This interaction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversities of the lands and seas , and the consequent almost infinite variety in the subjects for curious and profitable inquiry which the world affords . Although on each land mass the physiographic influences are of the utmost importance with reference to the development of man , we can only glance at VOL . VIIL-35 certain interesting features dependent on the structure of the lands of Europe and North America , giving most of our attention to the conditions of our own continent . North America is most interesting to us because it is the seat of our own life . Europe concerns us almost as much because it is the cradle of our people , the place of nurture where our race came by its motives and learned how to act its parts in the new theatre of the western world . The continent of Europe differs from the other great land masses in the fact that it is a singular aggregation of peninsulas , and islands , originating in separate centres of mountain growth , and of inclosed valleys walled about from the outer world by elevated summits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect ; North America has a few great dependencies in its larger islands and considerable promontories ; but Africa , South America , and Australia are singularly united lands . The highly divided state of Europe has greatly favored the development within its area of isolated fields , each fitted for the growth of a separate state , adapted even in this day for local life , although commerce in our time bindR lands together in a way which it did not of old . These separated areas were marvellously suited to be the cradles of peoples ; and if we look over the map of Europe we readily note the geographic insulations which that vastly varied land affords . Beginning with the eastern Mediterranean , we have the peninsula on which Constantinople stands , a region only partly protected from assault by its geographic peculiarities ; and yet it owes to its partial separation from the mainlands on either side a large measure of local historic development . Next we have Greece and its associated islands , which , a safe stronghold for centuries , permitted the nurture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west the Italian peninsula , where for three thousand years the protecting envelope of the sea and the walls of Alps and Apennines have enabled a score of states to attain a development ; where the Roman nation , ab // sorbing , with its singular power of taking in other life , a number of primitive centres of civilization , grew to power which made it dominant in the ancient world . Sicily , Sardinia , Corsica , have each profited by their isolation of ancient days , have bred diverse qualities in man , and contributed motives which have interacted in the earth 's history . Again , in *Spain we have a singular cradle of great people ; to its geographic position it owed the fact that it became the seat of the most cultivated Mohammedanism the world has ever known . To the Pyr*enees , the mountain wall of the north , we owe in good part the limitation of that Mussulman invasion and the pro tection of central Europe from its for*ward movement , until luxury and halffaith had sapped its energies . Going northward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growth of that fierce but strong people , the ancient Scandinavians , who transplanted there , held their ground , and grew until they were strong enough to conquer Britain and give it a large share of the quality which belongs to our own state . To a trifling geographic accident we owe the isolation of Great Britain from the European continent ; and all the marvellous history of the English folk , as we all know , hangs upon the existence of that slender strip of sea between the Devon coast and the kindred lowlands of northern France . The isolation of Great Britain depends upon such peculiar and interesting circumstances that we may turn aside a moment from the thread of our narrative to see how this strip of silver sea came to be a fortress ditch between the continent and the island . The British Channel is due , in the first place , to the peculiar strength of the tides in the North Atlantic . The energy of these tides is due to the fact that the North Atlantic is a somewhat wedge-shaped basin pointing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the continents are rudely triangular masses pointing south . The tidal wave heaps up in this great re-entrant , as it heaps up in the narrow re-entrant of the Bay of Fundy , Port Royal Sound , Boston Harbor , or any other wedge-shaped passage leading in to the land . Next we note the fact that in the British Channel the tides have a rise of about twenty-five feet , as they sweep through its open waters from the Atlantic toward the North Sea ; while in the neighboring bay of Bristol , or the Severn Channel , as it is sometimes called , where the re-entrant is closed at its head , the tides rise to about fifty feet in height . Going back to the last geological period , we are able by divers facts to ascertain that there was a broad isthmus connecting Great Britain with the French coast , perhaps extending seaward as far as the limits of Belgium ; there was a bay on the east and a bay on the west . In this state we may make sure that the tides running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , on the west , and the Belgian Bay on the east , were considerably higher than they are at present . Now , the cutting energy of the tide depends upon the swiftness of the streams of water which its movement brings about , and the swiftness of these streams is proportionate in a high degree to the altitude the tidal waters attain in their quick successive rise and fall . No sooner was the geographic condition we have described in existence than the tides began their work of driving their way through the rocks by cutting out and scouring off into the deeper sea the materials composing the shores . In a short time , in a geological sense , this work was accomplished . The Norman Bay broke through into the Belgian Bay , and the waters had a free run through the channel , which we may presume at first to have been narrow . Although the tides then , when the land was severed , lost a considerable part of their height , they were still , as they are at the present time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the coasts at a rate which , in a geological sense , is very rapid . East of Britain lie two peninsulas which have been the cradle of very important peoples-that of Sweden and Norway is the result of mountain development ; that of Denmark appears to be in the main the product of glacial erosion , differing in its non-mountainous origin from all the other peninsulas and islands of the European border . Thus on the periphery of Europe we // qwq the fashion in which the organic assemblages of animals and plants move when the topography and the climate of a continent are disturbed . This process of movement led to the vast contention which brought about the overthrow of the Roman power , and made an end of the dominancy which the Mediterranean states had previously maintained . It is now the opinion of those best versed in this complicated question , that the Aryan people , long supposed to have been cradled in central Asia , are really the children of Europe ; that they were developed in the Scandinavian peninsulas , a field which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for thousands of years . This view is more satisfactory to the naturalist than the older opinion , which placed the cradle of the Aryans in northern or central Asia . It seemed an anomaly that the most vigorous , and at the same time the most plastic , of the world peoples should have developed amid the limited opportunities afforded by high Asia , where the chance of education in arts and in commerce is very small compared to what it is in Scandinavia , or indeed in any of the European peninsulas . If on a priori considerations the naturalist were compelled to pick the natural seat in which our race obtained its qualities , there is no other site which would so satisfactorily meet his needs as the peninsulated district about the Baltic ; there , better than anywhere else , men may find a hardy , though not so strenuous climate as to diminish the vitality or send all the energies to immediate needs . Tifere the variation in the seasons , the variety of soil , the contacts with the sea , are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that great nursery of vigor we can well conceive the Aryan people , protected in their infancy by the isolation of their birthplace , going forth in their strength to dominate the world from eastern India to the Atlantic . Thence again , in the Danish Northmen days , went forth a second tide of strength . We look indeed with satisfaction , from the naturalist 's point of view , on the fact that in the peninsulas of Scandinavia and in the islands of the British archi pelago , we find the point of origin of the dominant people in the world , for there more perfectly than anywhere else is the environment adapted to making strong races . After a race has been formed and been bred to certain qualities within a limited field , after it has come to possess a certain body of characteristics which gives it its quality , the importance of the original cradle passes away . There is something very curious in the permanence of race conditions after they have been fixed for a thousand years or so in a people . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of country folk , they may endure under circumstances in which they could not have originated ; thus , even in our domesticated animals and plants , we find that varieties created under favorable conditions , obtaining their stamp in suitable conditions , may then flourish in many conditions of environment in which they could not by any chance have originated . The barnyard creatures of Europe , with their established qualities , may be taken to Australia and there retain their nature for many generations ; even where the form falls away from the parent stock , the decline is generally slow and may not for a great time become apparent . This fixity of race characteristics has . enabled the several national varieties of men to go forth from their nurseries , carrying the qualities bred in their earlier conditions through centuries of life in other climes . The Gothic blood of Italy and of Spain still keeps much of its parent quality ; the Aryan blood of India , though a world apart in its conditions from those which gave it character in its cradle , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the home people . Moor , Hun , and Turk , all the numerous folk we find in the present condition of the world so far from their cradle lands , are still to a great extent what their primitive nurture made them . On this rigidity which comes to mature races in the lower life , as well as in man , depends the vigor with which they do their appointed work . These considerations will be of the utmost importance to us in our study of the effect of physiographic conditions // found in North America upon the folk derived from other lands , which are to work out their history upon its surface . The Americas , Africa , and Australia have shown by their human products that they are unfitted to be the cradle places of great peoples . Vast as has been the development of human life upon them , these continents have never from their own blood built a race that has risen above barbarism . Northern Africa early became the seat of Asiatic and European folk , separated from the body of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mediterranean afforded fair opportunities for the independent development of peoples , the result of which is expressed in its history ; but the national motives of Egypt , of Carthage , and of Moorish civilization which grew up in northern Africa , are all exotic . These states all represent the development of peoples who were cradled elsewhere . So , too , the semi-civilized condition of Abyssinia is due to the implanting'there of peoples not of African origin . In Australia there has never been an elevation of the people above the grade of savagery . ILn the Americas , the only movement which elevated the folk above the lowest grades of barbarism is that which took place at certain points in the Cordilleran chain , where mountain districts afforded a measure of isolation and protection such as is necessary for the dawn of any culture whatsoever . All the rest of these continents , so far as we can interpret their human history , have been characterized by the endless disturbed wanderings of savages , tribe set against tribe , making life so precarious that culture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America will show the observer , especially if he will compare the conditions with those of Europe , how unfitted is this continent to be the cradle-place of peoples . North America is in the main a geographic unit . The detached masses which border it are , by the circumstances of climate or of surface , unfitted to give the isolation necessary for the nurture of people . This will be evident on a brief review of the continental geography . Beginning with the southern extremity of North America , we find in that region a limited measure of isolation by mountain barriers . Central America and Mexico are to a certain extent protected by such natural defences , but in this region the climate is not suited to the best conditions of man . Although our species came from tropical creaturesthe anthropoid apes - men need the stress of high latitudes , the moral and physical tonic effect of cold , to drive them into those interactions of activity which constitute civilization . Going up the eastward face of North America , we find in the Antilles an assemblage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have favored the growth of civilization . Next we come to Florida , a geographic unit of considerable importance . This area has , however , a subtropical climate , and a surface by no means favorable to primitive agriculture . It demands the resources of the modern farmer to win crops from the soiL Moreover , there are no barriers save those of swamps and forests to this field . Every part of the surface could be ranged over by nomads . From Florida to eastern Nova Scotia and Newfoundland there are no weU* isolated fields on the coast line of North America . Cape Breton and Newfoundland , the island of Anticosti and that of Prince Edwards , have something of the geographic unity which belongs to the cradle-lands of Europe and Asia ; but in the aboriginal days of North America these regions were too far north for agricultural industries . Maize , the principal agricultural plant with the Indians , would hardly develop there . The barbarous folk were therefore retained in the state of hunters or fishermen , conditions which do not permit peoples to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance in those lowly states of existence ; there is no basis for commerce , no foundation for the progress of the desires on which all high culture depends . The man is what he seeks , what he desires , and must obtain . All civilization is the outgrowth of striving* which go beyond momentary physical needs , and , therefore , until agriculture affords a firm foundation for sub-* sistence , until life is by the soil made // something more than a struggle for momentary support , the foundations of culture can not be obtained . North of Newfoundland and through all the part of the continent which faces the icebound seas , the conditions are too rigorous to permit the development of agriculture , and therefore the geographic environment could not secure the cradling of well-developed races . The same is true of the region of Alaska . Maize culture is impossible until we advance southward on the Pacific coast , to the region which is beyond the peninsulated district of eastern America . The coast is rather uniform in its physical and *iimatic character , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This latter district is in form not unlike that of the Scandinavian peninsula , but it is an arid country , affording no basis of agriculture , remaining to this day essentially au unknown desert . From lower California to the isthmus , the shore is again without isolated areas of land . The interior of North America is even more undivided than its shore - line . Along the eastern coast extends the great mountain system of the Appalachians , the highest point of which rises to about six thousand five hundred feet above the sea , but the structure of the ranges is such as to make no inclosures of welldefined mountain-walled basins . Every part of the Appalachians is open to the free movements of savage men ; the best protected valleys would offer no immunity to a nascent civilization in its struggle with more barbarous folk . We see something of the unfitness of this shore-line of our continent for the cradling of great races in the history of European settlements on this shore . Every colony which was planted in North America had to enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural strongholds , such as abound on the coast of Europe , and such as afforded the foundation of the Greek colonies all along the coast of the Mediterranean , or to the Northmen all the way from their own land around to the shores of Sicily . So the European colonists , until they came to gain strength by numbers , were , despite their superior arts and arms , their stronger morale and training in the art of statecraft and war , in jeopardy for generations after their coming to the massive continent . The valley of the Mississippi , the great central trough of the continent , is unbroken by barriers from the Arctic Circle to the Southern sea . The Rocky Mountains , by their greater height and certain peculiarities in their construction , afford a good many inclosed valleys which under more favorable circumstances might have become the seat of a vigorous life . Unfortunately this region is excessively arid . There can practically be no tillage within its limits except by devices of an engineering sort , by which water is led from scanty streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population can not readily attain to the numbers which are necessary for the development of culture . It seems to me that it is rather to the physical conditions of North America than to any primal incapacity on the part of its indigenous peoples to take on civilization , that we must attribute the failure of indigenous man within its limits to advance beyond the lowest grades of barbarism . The Indian shows us in many ways that he is an able person . We may judge any folk by their greater men , and there can be no doubt that the ablest of our American savages rank high in the intellectual scale . It is , it seems tome , to the ceaseless disturbances of nascent civilization that we owe the failure of this folk to attain to a higher grade . Each tribe which retained its primitive savage impulse of migration became , as did the Shawnees , a kind of Hun , to sweep away in their foragings the beginnings of the higher state to which other folk might have attained . As long as a race is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem endowed with any considerable mobility . When by the arts which constitute the next advance , and bring the people to the state of barbarism , they become dangerous to their neighbors , their motives are stronger , and they are commonly numerous enough to make war successfully . Not tied by systematic agriculture or by architecture to any particular piece of ground , they prey upon their better - provided neighbor // and so break up their incipient states . Little as we know of the tribal movements in America , we have yet learned enough concerning them to see how certain bands of barbarians swept to and fro , sometimes in the course of a century , making marches comparable to those of Goths and Huns of the old world , and bringing equal destruction in their path . The Goths and Huns were perhaps abler people than our American Indians in their best estate ; moreover , they devastated states which were so strong as to not be utterly destroyed by their movements ; the first effect of their coming was in good part to overwhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know , to subdue the savages by the arts of peace ; but if southern Europe had been struck by the northern inva-* sion a thousand years before the tide broke upon them , the Goths would have had to invent their own civilization in place of appropriating and being appropriated by the earlier culture . If the problem before our race on this continent were that of cradling civilizations , we should have no right to draw a bright picture as to the future of American life . Fortunately , however , the question is that of disseminating race characteristics bred elsewhere , of bringing those characteristics into interaction on a field favorable for their best development . For this purpose the surface of North America affords peculiar advantages . The nature and limitations of these conditions we shall now have to consider . L IN considering the physiographic conditions of any area , with reference to the development of organic life upon it , the life of man as well as of lower beings , we have to note not only the circumstances of the given field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also the relations of the area to the neighboring districts , which in the process of geographical change , brought about by the development of mountains and continents , may send contributions to its inhabitants . We must therefore now turn our attention to the relations of contact between the continent of North America and the other land masses of the world , particularly those of the northern hemisphere . A glance at the map shows us that North America is geographically related to the old world , both on the east and west . Geological history tells us that from time to time the measure of this relation of our country to the lands of Europe and Asia has varied greatly , the present condition being only one state of those connections . In the preceding geological ages , although we can not as yet construct the ancient geography with any accuracy , we can still discern that the relations of the continent , as regards the freedom of its organic intercourse with Europe and Asia and South America , have varied much . The American continents seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been better constituted for the nurture of plant than of animal life . A good measure of this difference may be had from the contribution which America has made to the animals and plants which are domesticated by man . It needs no argument to show that in order to meet the requirements of man 's uses , animals and plants must be highly specialized , having peculiarities of strength as in our horses and elephants , a tamable nature as in almost all our domesticated animals , highly organized fruits , seeds or fibres as in the most of our cultivatel plants ; in other words , it is in genera* from the highest members of each organic series that man selects the forma which he is to domesticate in his barnyard or his tilled fields . With this point in mind , it is interesting to note that North and South America and Australia , though they have about as many species of vertebrates as the old world , have contributed but one animal to the domestic uses of civilized man , namely , the wild turkey ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such service . On the other hand , the contribution of plants to domestication from the Americas has been most important . Indeed , we may say that the plants which the new world has afforded have been sufficient to make something like a revolution in the economic conditions of our civilization . The potato and Indian // corn have profoundly altered the agriculture of Europe . Tobacco has changed the habits of men throughout a large part of the world . The species of cmchona , whence comes quinine , have been of an invaluable advantage to human life , and a score of other American species , such as the tomato , have come to play a more or less important part in human economy . All these species of plants are highly elaborated forms , and the number of them which have been contributed to man 's needs from the new world shows the relatively high differentiation of plant life in the American continents . The geographic conditions which determine the relations of America to the centres of human development in the old world are determined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By both these sets of circumstances , North America is more clearly related to Asia than it is to Europe . Since the coming of man upon the earth the geographic relations of this continent have pretty certainly been more intimate with the Asiatic land mass than with that of Europe . It is possible that during the glacial period the region about Behring 's Strait was lowered beneath the sea , but the subsidence was probably of a temporary nature . We may reckon that the continents have generally , at least since the beginning of the tertiary period , been nearer together in the northern Pacific than in the northern Atlantic . The great depth of the ocean basin between the coasts of America and those of Europe points to the conclusion that the great lands in that part of the world have long been widely separated . Moreover , the ocean currents of the northern Pacific favor the movement of man as well as the migration of animals which may float on chance rafts from the region of China and Japan to western North America , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American shore ; the set of the atmospheric currents operates to the same end . It is a well-known fact that the sailing voyage , even to our modern ships , requires very much longer time from western Europe to eastern America than in the direct passage from this country . In the earlier states of the navigator 's art , before the invention of the keel , it was well-nigh impossible for the primitive craft to find their way across the northern Atlantic to the European coast , while the chance of currents in ocean and air tended to bring vessels from the eastern shores of Asia to the western coasts of North America ; hence , it came about that the first men planted on the American continent were probably Asiatic in their origin , and these peoples remained for many centuries unaffected by the higher races bred in the more favorable conditions of Europe . This point , however , is disputed by some recent writers , but the position still seems tenable . It is barely possible that some chance drifting of ships containing people blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a lodgement on the coast of South America , to which they were brought by the equatorial stream . The distance is , however , so great , and the time of the journey so long , that it is improbable that a ship scantily provisioned as were the vessels of old , should have borne living voyagers across this wide field of waters . The Peruvian traditions appear to point to the coming of their royal house from the East . It has been conjectured by fanciful interpreters of those myths , that this race was of European origin . It appears on inquiry that there is nothing which may be called evidence to support this opinion . It is easily seen that , in the case of the lower animals , chance wanderers to any land would have great difficulty in establishing themselves on the newfound shore . Difficulties arising from the lack of reconciliation with the environment , the unaccustomedness of the food , the unfitness of organization and habit to withstand the attacks of native enemies , would , in most cases , lead to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this principle holds in the case of human settlement as well as that of the lower animals . The first European colonies to be planted in North America , though reasonably well provided with the resources necessary for the colonist , had a hard battle to fight with their // new conditions . Disease and native enemies brought many of these settlements to destruction . Chance voyagers , in drifting ships , cast upon the shore without provision for their immediate needs , would have a yet more arduous battle before them . Therefore , though we may have had accidental immigration of European men to our American shores , we need not be surprised that none of these accidents led to the establishment of the higher races of the Old World on this continent . As long as North America was unoccupied by man , its settlement from Asia would have been relatively easy . As soon as it had been filled with the descendants of Asiatic peoples to the point where the population was as dense as savagery permits , any further settlement would have been difficult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europeans to make good their lodgement on the Atlantic shore . History makes us familiar with the fact that the colonies which came to the Atlantic coast from the Old World , except certain settlements in Pennsylvania and some of the early French establishments , found themselves in immediate hostile contact with the aborigines . The struggle for existence between the two kinds of men would in all cases have led to the extinction of the new-comers , were it not that their ranks were fed by continuous reinforcements from the Old World . Thus , as soon as the continent was peopled from Asia , it stood out against further settlements , whether they came by chance or by design . In this way we may account for the failure of Asiatic colonies representing the higher life of Japan and China to establish themselves on the Pacific coast . It is almost certain that America was peopled before those civilizations were developed , and so there were tribes of savages ready to oppose the occupation of the country by the higher life , which in time grew up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the effect of the geography of North America on its savage tribes . The effect of the physiographic conditions of North America upon the development of the aboriginal peoples is so obscure as not to warrant much more discussion than we have given to it . There are , however , certain points which repay inquiry . We have already noticed the fact that the massive geographic form of North America did not favor the creation of those divisions between people which are such a striking feature in Europe and Asia . The several tribes , developing evidently from the family relation , could only attain a limited measure of separate growth . If any of these ancient peoples could have found shelter such as a Swiss valley or a Scandinavian peninsula affords , the original differentiation dependent on the family tie would have readily extended into the larger bond of the state , but from the lack of geographic isolation , war , and various other accidents naturally arising in this massive and undivided continent , led quickly to a limitation in the measure of tribal development . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , where the people were in part protected by natural defences , the folk advanced to a somewhat higher grade of civilization than that which generally characterized our American savages ; but even in these regions the protection was incomplete and the folk were at all times liable to destructive incursions from neighboring less civilized tribes . It appears from certain fragments of evidence , that some of our American Indians , a few centuries before the coming of the whites to the shores of the continent , were in a rather higher state of advance than that in which they were found by the first Europeans . Thus in the Mississippi Valley the people were evidently more sedentary , some time about a thousand years ago , than they were when their conditions first became a matter of historic record . This is shown by the fact that the people had attained to a point where they constructed extensive earthworks both for the purpose of defence and to indulge themselves in the expression of certain religious ideas . The Ohio and the upper Mississippi valleys abound in the tumuli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more numerous than they were when our race first knew them ; they depended // more upon agriculture and less upon the chase . For a long time these aboriginal monuments were esteemed sufficient evidence to prove that the country had been inhabited by a peculiar race , to which the name of " Mound-Builders " was given . We now know that these works were constructed by the immediate ancestors of our American Indians , and that , indeed , in the more southern parts of the Mississippi Valley , as for instance in northern Mississippi , the people had not quite abandoned the mound-building habit when they came in contact with the whites . The cause of this decadence is interesting . The explanation seems to be as follows : In the state of savagery men depend altogether upon the products of the chase , or upon the untilled resources of the vegetation about them . As the population increases the game becomes less abundant and the folk are gradually driven to tillage . They become sedentary ; they exercise the forethought which agriculture requires , and so advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend in the main upon the resources which the soil affords . Each further increase in the population diminishes the relative value of the hunter 's art and tends to separate the people from the vagarious and ensavaging habits of their ancestors , who lived by the chace . In the higher state of development , such great constructions as Fort Ancient or the Picture Mounds of the upper Mississippi and the Ohio valleys become possible , and to this state the peoples of the Ohio and neighboring valleys appear to have arrived some centuries before the advent of Europeans . Then came a peculiar biological accident which shows us how dependent man is upon the other living tenants of the earth he inhabits . In the pre-European state of the country , probably down to some time after the year 1000 , the American bison or buffalo appears to have been absent from all the region east of the Mississippi . It is doubtful if the creature existed for any distance east of the Rocky Mountains . There had been an earlier and less plentiful species of bison in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years ago , perhaps before the coming of man to this continent . Our well-known species probably was developed in some region far to the west of the Mississippi , whence it gradually spread to the eastward . The MoundBuilders apparently did not know the creature . We determine this point by the fact that we do not find bison bones about the old kitchen fires , and we fail to find any picture of the beast in the abundant delineations of animals made by these ancient people . They figured all the other important forms of land animals , including birds , snakes , and also many of those from the far-off waters of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico ; but they have given us no representation of this , which would have been to them the king of beasts . We therefore justly conclude that it was unknown to them . When in his westward movement the buffalo came to the semi-civilized inhabitants of the Mississippi system of valleys , he brought a great plenty of animal food to the people , who had long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no other domesticated animals save the dog . Not yet firmly fixed in the agricultural art , these tribes appear , after the coming of the buffalo , to have lapsed into the pure savagery which hunting brings . To favor the pasturage of these wild herds , the Indians adopted the habit of burning the prairies . These fires spread to the forests on the east , killing the young trees which afforded the succession of wood , gradually extending the pasturage area of the wild herds until the larger portions of the western plains eastward to central Ohio and Kentucky , probably even into the Carolinas , and southward to the Tennessee River , had been stripped of their original forests , making way for the vast throngs of these creatures which ranged the country at the time when we first knew it . With the rehabilitation of the hunter 's habit , and with the nomadic conditions which this habit necessarily brings , came more frequent contests between tribes and the gradual decadence of the slight civilization which the people had acquired . // Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar physiographic condition to the central basin of the continent , is probably to be accounted for by the interference of man . It is an effect , though unintended , of the savage 's action in relation to an important wild beast . If the advent of European folk in the Mississippi Valley had been delayed for another five centuries , the prairie country would doubtless have been made very much more extensive . Thus in western Kentucky a territory of about 5,000 square miles in area had recently been brought to the state of open land by the burning of the forests . All around the margin of this area there were only old trees scarred by the successive fires , there being no young of their species to take the place as they fell . It is probable that with another five hundred years of such conditions the prairie region would have extended up to the base of our Allegbanies , and in time all the great Appalachian woods , at least as far as the plain land was concerned , would probably have vanished in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians long maintained agricultural habits in a measure not common with their northern kindred . Indeed , when the settlements of the Creeks and the aflied tribes about the Gulf were destroyed by the advancing tide of European life , the sedentary condition of the population which prevailed perhaps in a higher state of development at one time in the Ohio Valley , had not been destroyed by the invasion of the buffalo . In general , north of the great lakes and the St. Lawrence the climate is such as to make the development of people beyond the stage of savagery quite impossible , for the reason that agricultfire is not possible in that country . We therefore find in the considerable Indian and Esquimo population of the high north of our continent much less trace of advance than in the southern section . We may say , indeed , that the possibilities of culture are in a descending scale from the subtropical districts of Mexico to the northern fields of the continent ; the measure of advance depending on the ratio between the proportion of food-supply derived or de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note on this continent , a feature better shown in the old world , that the stronger and more militant people develop in tolerably northern stations between the tropic heat and circumpolar cold . The conquering tribes among the Indians were those which lived south of the great lakes and north of the Ohio River . In that district some agriculture was possible-indeed it was imperatively demanded in any considerable aggregations of people in order to meet the trials of the winter . The rigor of climate tends to breed vigorous , somewhat forethoughtful men ; such races as the Iroquois , or Six Nations , the Normans of America , appear to have acquired their soldierly qualities in these northern climates , as the conquering folk of Europe were bred in winter lands . In a general way it is true that the North American aborigines , through the lack of geographical isolation , never attained the state when the physiography of the region they inhabited would do the most to develop the original tribal groups into states . The natural divisions of the continent did not come to have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of European settlements . We shall therefore , without further consideration of the aboriginal peoples , give our attention to the history of European immigrants on this continent . The history of the earlier settlements of Europeans in North America is one of the most interesting chapters in the records of man . The discovery and the Europeanization of America depended in the first place upon the ancient commerce of Europe with the far East . This trade , which began in very ancient days , had attained to considerable importance before the growth of the Mohammedan religion . The development of this faith in the eighth century and the consequent combats between the Christians and the followers of Mohammed , made the intercourse of Europe with the Orient soon more difficult and costly than it had been in earlier times . The commercial men of Europe as well as the statesmen were anxious to find a new way // to the great , though somewhat fabulous , wealth of southern and western Asia . Then came the important scientific conclusion familiar to the ancients , but new to modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it naturally appeared the project of attaining to the Orient by sailing around by the west , so escaping the barrier which Mohammedanism interposed to the path of commerce . Neither of these conditions would have been sufficient to push the explorers across the Atlantic , but for the great advance in the art of navigation which the Normans had brought to southern Europe . The classic ships of the Mediterranean , or their imitations in other parts of Europe save Scandinavia , were probably all fiat-bottomed . They had to go with the wind . The Northmen had invented the keel , which alone makes navigation something better than waiting for the chances afforded by variable winds . Taking advantage of the trade-winds , even a Roman ship could have sailed to America , but it is doubtful if any vessel without a keel could have compassed the return voyage save by the rare opportunity of continued westerly winds , which blow only in the North Atlantic . Moreover , in Roman times , water was conveyed with difficulty . The vessels were the skins of animals , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small size . The invention of the cask , one of the most considerable elements in the establishment of the economic conditions on which civilization rests , came in relatively modern times . The cask as well as the keel was , it seems to me , a device of northern Europe , and the two together did more to make long distance navigation possible than any other inventions . After the middle ages there was a rapid increase of population in Europe , due to the consolidation of states and a consequent steadfaster condition of the conditions of life . With this increase in numbers the commercial spirit became stronger . The conflicts with Mohammedanism developed a measure of missionary ardor which , combined with the commercial motive , supplied the strong incentive which pushed European peoples on the ways of western discovery . It is not surprising that the first of these movements , save the accidental voyages of the Scandinavians to the northern coasts , came from the Spanish peoples . The reconquest of Spain to Christianity had served to develop the military motives of that people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic blood , holding something of the seafaring impulse of the Northmen ; furthermore , Spain is near the parallels of the trade-winds . As soon as a vessel is a little way from its shores , it feels that great western-setting breath which will carry a ship straight forward to the Antilles . If Columbus had sailed from the British Channel , the conditions of the " roaring forties " would probably have insured the failure of his adventurous voyage . The trade-winds determined , in a way that was most fortunate for our race , the fact that the Spaniards came to the tropical districts of America . These regions they possessed before the more northern peoples of Europe began to have an interest in the western empire . When the French and English entered into the scramble for the new lands of the west , Spain had already lain its strong hand upon about all the countries south of the straits of Florida and north of the Equator . The English and French were fended from the tropical parts of America by the preemption of those lands by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope , and even more effectively excluded from them by the currents of the air and sea . The Gulf Stream makes a strong opposition to the mariner seeking to find his way to the Gulf of Mexico by cruising down the coast of the continent . To the slow-sailing ships of the colonial days , vessels which under the most favorable conditions did not generally make more than five or six miles an hour , this stream was a considerable barrier to the southward movement along the shore of North America . The only easy way to the lands about the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico was one pretty thoroughly guarded by the Spaniards ; hence the French and English were practically limited to the country north of the Straits of Florida . Thus we see the fact that the tradewinds and their current , which led Columbus to America , helped to bar the // French and English from the tropical portions of that country . We must now note that the French , owing to their geographic position , shared with the Spanish in the missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of American discovery . The French at first and mainly sought America , not as a territory in which to plant their race , but as the Spaniards sought it , as a place of commercial dominance and of spiritual domain . It is sometimes the fashion of Protestants to contemn the spiritual element of the Latin colonists in America , and to consider that the missionary portion of the enterprise was hypocritical , and that the commercial and national supremacy was the only end sought . History as well as a fair respect for human motives opposes this interpretation . We must regard the missionary element of these enterprises as of great value in directing the westward movement of the Spanish and French empires . In England , owing to circumstances which we can not discuss , the Crusade motive was never as strong as on the continent , the divisions in the church already rife , had led to a loss of such proselyting spirit as may once have existed . In this period England , though much less peopled than at the present time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much regretted loss of her continental possessions had given the people a desire to secure new lands . The commercial and colonizing motives , unaffected by the spirit of religious proselytism , were also stronger than on the continent . The result was that the English colonies in the new world were planted with a very different motive from those of *rance and Spain . They consisted of people who came to stay , to breed upon the ground , and to found New Englands on the foreign shore . Though in part led by religious convictions , seeking a haven for peculiar creeds , they were on the whole commercially minded , true colonists in their intent as were the Greeks in their time , or their ruder imitators , the Northmen , in a later age . The conditions which determined the first seats of French and English settlements on the coast of North America may be termed accidental ; or , in other words , we can not perceive that physiographic conditions in any distinct way affected the location of the colonies . It came , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the mouth of the St. Lawrence , and thence they extended their settlements up that wonderful valley , the great eastern gateway of the continent . At the same time the region about the mouth of the Mississippi was held by the other Latin people , the Spaniards , through the fact that they possessed the gateways which led to the Caribbean and the strength to maintain that empire of waters against intruders . The English and their kindred folk , the neighboring Dutch , found their way to the shore and founded settlements from the Bay of Maine southward to and beyond Cape Hatteras . It is difficult , in the present state of our control over this continent , to conceive the importance which lies in the facts concerning the original sites of the French and English settlements on the American shore . We now traverse this land in every direction with perfect ease ; as for the mountain barriers of the Appalachians , with their great forests and unnavigable streams , they now demand but a ton or two of coal to carry in one railway train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our coast before the beginning of the *eighteenth century . In those old days the Appalachian system of mountains constituted a really impassable zone extending from Georgia to the far north , broken only at one point by a navigable water-way and the great valley it occupies , the St. Lawrence basin and river . It is true that the Hudson in its principal tributary , the Mohawk , in a fashion divides the Appalachian axis , but it opens no pathway into the Mississippi Valley . The Mohawk is unnavigable , and the region about its head-waters contained perhaps the densest part of the Indian population north of the Ohio , composed of very vigorous and combative tribes . Although the Appalachians have peaks of no great height , their ranges are singularly continuous , and the passes formed by the streams in the numerous wall-like ridges afforded in early days no natural ways whatever . From Maine // to Alabama the woods were unbroken and impassable . This great Appalachian forest was in primitive days an exceedingly dense tangle . At a few points the aborigines had worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to pack-animals , the original means of transportation brought by the Europeans , but for the use of men who journeyed on foot , and could thus climb steeps inaccessible to a burdened beast . A large part of the district from central Pennsylvania northward was bowlderstrewn , affording no footing for horses . Even in the present state of New England , where the superficial layer of glacial erratics has been to a great extent cleared away , it is easy to conceive how impassable the surface must have been in early times . It required a century of enterprising , unrecorded labor to open the paths across the stony and swampy fields of New England to the valley of the Hudson . The undergrowth of this forest country is far more dense than that which is commonly found in European lands . The shrubby plants , and the species of smilax or green briar and other creeping vines , make the most of our Appalachian forests very nearly impassable , even at the present day . Only once during the civil war , viz. , in the retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cumberland Gap to the Ohio , did any considerable body of troops make an extended march through our trackless forests , and this redoubtable enterprise was accomplished in a portion of the Alleghany district where the woods are far more open than they are in the more eastern part of the country . Although this march extended for only two hundred miles , and was partly over roads , it wore out the army . The Appalachian barrier of forest and mountain was to civilized men almost as impassable as the Alps . It had a width of about three hundred miles ; it was long before its geography was known , and therefore we need not be surprised that nearly a century and a half of growth had to take place in the English settlements before they fairly broke their way through it and obtained access to the Mississippi Valley ; and then another fifty years passed before the central settlements were closely united with the sea-port by ways which trade could traverse . It fell to the lot of the French to secure in the St. Lawrence River possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America . Although there are some difficulties of navigation in the St. Lawrence system of waters , as in its rapids and in Niagara Falls , that channel affords , for more than half the year , by far the most natural way into the heart of the continent . Along this path the French extended their settlements and their influence over the aborigines into the Mississippi Valley , before the English colonists or those of the Hollanders had penetrated beyond the lowlands of the Atlantic shore . At the beginning of the eighteenth century , the historian , in making a survey of the conditions existing in North America , would have most likely declared that the Latin folk had vastly the advantage over the English in their control over the continent . On the south the Spanish possessed all that portion of the continent which was blessed with what is commonly esteemed a fortunate climate . On the north and west the French , by their control of the St. Lawrence and Mississippi Valleys , over which they claimed and in a fashion exercised dominion up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold upon all the fairest fields of the country . The British and the Hollanders , on the other hand , occupied a narrow strip of shore lands which were only moderately fertile . Back of them lay an almost impassable barrier , separating them from the heart of the continent . On the north and west they were wrapped around by the French . On the south they were hemmed in by the Spanish possessions . A closer view would have shown the investigator that there were certain conditions affecting these diverse peoples which were destined in the end to give dominance to the English folk . In the first place , the British settlements of the Atlantic coast were tolerably ready of access at all times of the year to the old world . It was only about five weeks voyage from Great Britain to any part of the coast , while it was a six mouth 's journey from France to the outposts of // the French settlements along the upper great lakes or in the Mississippi Valley . Moreover , the northern way , that by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , while the Mississippi , even after its channel was well known , was a difficult path for ascending navigation . The French settlements in the valley of the St. Lawrence were ill placed for a successful agriculture . Their crops were scanty and won with much labor . As before remarked , the continental peoples never seriously pro- , posed to transfer a large body of their population to the new world , making there the homogeneous equivalent of the European state . Their scheme was more of a missionary nature ; they proposed to incorporate the native people into the state after the fashion of the Roman colonists . This idea of obtaining control over the native population appears to have had some small share in the plans of the earlier English settlers . The scheme was however quickly abandoned . The settlers soon came to the plan of exterminating rather than domesticating the savages . The results were that the Latin settlements became in general the seats of a mongrel race , neither savage nor civilized , while the English and Dutch settlements were developed as true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage arising from the hemming in of the British colonies in North America by the Appalachian boundary . In place of the detached settlements which characterized the Spanish , and more particularly the iFrench , colonies , the British colonial establishments were by their geographical conditions compelled to develop in a more connected way . It was possible in 1700 to ride from Portland , Me. , to southern Virginia , sleeping each night in some considerable village . If our ancestors on the continent had secured a ready access to the interior , it is likely that a hundred years would have gone by before the colonies became sufficiently dense in population to permit the interactive life which prepared the way for the American revolution . Although the Atlantic coast presents no very great diversity in its psychical conditions , its range in climate is suf ficient to afford a considerable variety in agricultural products , and the geographic divisions serve in a measure to intensify certain regional differences of character in such a measure that the inhabitants of the several British colonies on this coast became tolerably distinct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of the earlier settlements were composed of somewhat diverse peoples , each of the colonies coming to the possession of individual motives either through peculiarities of religious faith , peculiar social habits , or other original varieties in the parent stock . The long-continued absence of any political association between the separate colonies kept them in a good measure apart , and thus served to foster the development of diverse character in different sections ; so there came about a state of society in which the New Englander , the Hollander of New York , the Quakers of Pennsylvania , the Catholics of Maryland , and the churchmen of Virginia were somewhat different from each other . These characteristic differences between the several peoples of the Atlantic coast were due in part to physiographic circumstances of their environment . The development of the American colonies , their rapid growth in the century preceding the American revolution , depended in a large measure on a botanical accident , viz. , on the introduction of tobacco into the commerce of the world . No contribution from newly discovered lands has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new faith has ever travelled so fast and far among men as the habit of smoking . In scarce a century from the first introduction of the plant in Europe , its use had spread to nearly half the peoples of the old world . The eastern coast of America , from the Hudson southward to South Carolina , is peculiarly well suited for the growth of the tobacco plant , and the rapid extension of the British colonies in America , which brought their population at the time of the Revolution to a point where they numbered about one-sixth part of the English people , was largely due to the commerce which rested upon the use of this plant . It was a source of a vast income in the tobacco // growing states , and in a secondary way it served greatly to promote the growth of New England and New York . It is true it in good part laid the foundations of the American slave trade , on which the culture of cotton built a vast structure , but at the same time it served to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important way , for it provided the means for an extended trade with the old world , and thus gave a degree of wealth to the new . The effect of the Appalachian axis on the development of the English people might also be traced in the protection which it afforded against the more powerful bodies of the aborigines . The tribes which originally dwelt between the sea and the mountains were relatively weak ; although they held some intercourse with their western kinsmen , they were so far separated 1*rom them that at no time did the eastern peoples , save in the valley of the Mohawk , have to meet any considerable body of warriors who were bred in the inland parts of the continent . Hence the struggles of the earlier settlers on the Atlantic coast with the savages was a relatively unimportant matter ; though it more than once brought the feeble colonies into great jeopardy . But for the Appalachian barrier , the English , owing to their rude ways of contact with the savages , would necessarily have met the hostility of a vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have effected what the feebler King Philip vainly essayed . It may well be doubted whether the Puritans of New England or any other of the settlements , except perhaps the Quakers , could have held their own against the aboriginal folk of this country , but for the protection this barrier afforded . It is in good part to the commercial growth of the British colonies in America that we owe the speedy overthrow of the French empire , which at the beginning of the eighteenth century seemed like.y to control North America . The New England settlements developed rapidly and were pushed up toward the north , and from them as a base it was easy to capture the strongholds of the St. Lawrence Valley , and thus make the great scheme of France impossible . The settlement of the Mississippi Valley by the English people was first accomplished through Virginia and its western extension beyond the mountains in the then district of Kentucky . It is at this part of the Appalachian system that we find the most practicable path for a wagon road from the coast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great valley of Virginia , that known as the Shenandoah , thence to the broad open basin of the upper Tennessee , thence over the low gap in the Cumberland Mountain to the westernmost of the Alleghanies , it was easy to take pack animals , and with a very little labor to make a wagon road from the Virginia settlements to the most fertile portion of the Mississippi district . The process was easy because this country is south of the glacial belt , and thereby not encumbered with bowlders , and also because a succession of breaks in the mountains make a natural way , the sole moderately easy passage from the Virginia district to the centre of the continent . Thus it came about that the first settlement in the Mississippi Valley , the settlement which gave character to a large part of that basin , came from Virginia and took with it the institution of slavery into the Mississippi Valley , establishing the black line on the banks of the Ohio . If the conditions had been slightly different , if the way from the Hudson or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traverse as that from Virginia to the Ohio Valley , the fertile fields of Kentucky and Tennessee might well have been occupied by people from New England and New York ; in which case the boundaries of the slave-holding States would have been drawn much further south , if indeed the institution had ever obtained a firm foothold in the southern portion of the Mississippi Valley.
