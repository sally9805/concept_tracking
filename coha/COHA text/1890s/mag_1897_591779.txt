THE FUTURE OF RURAL NEW ENGLAND . THE township of Dickerman , in the interior of one of the New England States , has a large area , with a scattered population of about fifteen hundred souls . Farming is the only industry of the people . The roads , bad at all seasons , and in the spring almost impassable , are so encroached upon by untrimmed brush that wagons have much ado to pass one another . Such guide-boards as are not prone and crumbling are battered and illegible . The mail-boxes at the crossroads are as untrustworthy as worn-out pockets . The orchards are exceptionally picturesque , but they owe their picturesqueness to the unpruned , scraggly , hollow-trunked condition of the trees . The fields wear a disappointed , discouraged air , and the stone walls and rail fences which outline them - they can not by any stretch of the imagination be said to inclose them - sag at all possible angles , uncertain in their courses as drunken men without guides . Piles of magnificent logs , valuable even where lumber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cord-wood , long ready to be transported , stand in the forests . Many of the farmhouses have been tenantless for years . Many of the occupied houses are so gray , moss-grown , and dilapidated that they are only a trifle less ghastly than the tenantless ones . They are so weather-beaten as to retain only the faintest traces of the paint that once brightened them . Their windows have the traditional stuffed panes , and the blinds - when there are any - have broken slats . The chimneys , ragged of outline and almost mortarless , threaten to topple over in the first high wind . The outbuildings are flanked by fencerail buttresses , lest they fall over or break apart . The door-yards are overgrown with rank weeds and overrun with pigs and poultry ; the few flowers , which fidelity to country tradition has planted there , being forced to seek refuge behind screens of rusty wire netting or palisades of unsightly sticks . The barn-yards are littered , miry , and foul-smelling , and the stock within them - with the exception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the few houses that have not been allowed to fall into disrepair have a sullen , forbidding appearance . The blinds are closed or the curtains are drawn at all but the kitchen windows . Seen for the first time , they suggest a recent death and an approaching funeral . Every day , however , year in and year out , it is the same with them ; they are perpetually funereal . Spick-and-spanness they have , but without brightness , and thrift , but without hospitality . Dickerman is traversed by a railway , with a station at the " Corners , " as that section of the township is called which contains the post-office , the town-house , two stores , two churches , and a squalid hotel , and which therefore comes a little nearer than any other part to being the village proper . Here are also a deserted store , abandoned saw and grist mills , a long-disused academy , a neglected cemetery , and rather more than a due proportion of empty and dilapidated dwellings . The deserted store has never been deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and glass showcases , the rust-incrusted scales , the centre stove and the circle of armchairs about it , all remaining in their places , as any one may see who takes the pains to clean a spot for peering through one of the bedaubed windows . It is more than twenty years since the wheel of the village mill stopped because of the death of its owner , who left no children . The mill is a sad ruin now , almost roofless , two of its side-walls prone // on the ground , its machinery oxidizing and falling to pieces , and the piles of sawed and unsawed lumber decomposing around it . It is longer still - more than thirty years - since the academy closed its doors to pupils . The academy building was used for a variety of purposes afterwards - even as a dwelling - before the ultimate and complete desertion that is now its lot . Its sign has remained in place through all its vicissitudes , and , though badly weather-beaten , would still be legible to an expert decipherer of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the Old World , where an extreme wretchedness in the dwellings is at once partially explained by the richness and beauty of the churches . But not so in Dickerman . On the contrary , both the Dickerman churches are of a piece with their surroundings . The Congregational Church , more than a century old ( " Orthodox " is the name it still goes by ) , was a worthy structure in its day , and would be so yet had it been kept in good repair . Alas , it is only the ghost of its former pretentious self ! Its sills are badly rotted . Its spire and belfry have been shattered by lightning , and imperfectly restored . Its roof is leaky , the clapboards of its walls are warped and blistered , and its heavy bell , once sweet of tone , is cracked and dissonant . The Baptist Church , built only a few years ago , mainly at the expense of a church building society , is one of the shoddily constructed , many-gabled atrocities due to the malign influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint of many colors has mostly soaked into the surrounding soil . Its panes of stained glass , as they have been broken from time to time , have been replaced by ordinary window-glass , with piebald , uncanny results . The present town-house ( the original town-house was burned several years ago ) , the only public building in the place , comports well with the churches , being a square , squat , unpainted thing , with so striking a resemblance to a barn that it would surely be taken for one , were it not for its lack of barn doors , its isolated and honorable position in the centre of the village common , and its adornment by a bulletin-board thickly plastered with lists of voters , town-meeting warrants , and legal notices in large variety . In a word , a stranger entering Dickerman for the first time could not fail to be astounded by the marks of desolation and decay on every hand . To him , the most conspicuous evidence that it was or had been a populated town would be the closeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business enterprise , a freshly painted undertaker 's sign , bearing the brisk announcement that coffins , caskets , and burial-robes are always ready ; the one touch of beauty , a magnificent double row of aged elms leading up to the forsaken academy ; and the one patch of warm color visible , the flaming circus posters with which both the outside and the inside of the Orthodox Church sheds perennially bloom . When first I saw the crumbling crofters ' huts of the Scottish Highlands , I felt that I could never see anything sadder . I had not then seen the deserted farms of my own New England hills . When I visited them , I recognized instantly a sadder sight than the crofters ' huts ; decay in a new country being as much more appalling than decay in an old country as the loss of faculties in youth is more appalling than the loss of them in age . What Dickerman is in appearance , a desolate , destitute community , that it is in reality . To begin with homely and material conditions , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said regarding the food of its inhabitants . The Dickerman diet is the most unwholesome possible . Pork in one form or another is its staple , - " meat " and pork , " hearty food " and pork , are used as synonyms ; and pork is supplemented mainly with hot cream-of-tartar and saleratus // biscuit , doughnuts , and pies . The sanitary , not to mention the epicurean possibilities of the meats , vegetables , mushrooms , and fruits within easy reach , either are not known or are ignored . The results are just what might be expected . The men are listless , sullen , stolid . Chronic dyspepsia and other in .. ternal disorders are common . That their constitutions are not completely undermined is due largely to the power of resistance that life in the open air gives them . The women , who have not the advantage of outdoor living , who indeed are by necessity or choice quite as much confined within doors as their sisters of the cities , suffer frightfully . They take refuge ( as men would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the nostrums of quacks who appear at regular intervals in the village , only to make a bad state of health a worse one . Small wonder that as a class they are pale , haggard , prematurely old , shrill , ill-tempered , untidy , and inefficient in their housekeeping . To the physical and sensuous delights of the country - a little fishing and hunting on the part of the men excepted - one sex is as indifferent as the other . The social life is pinched and bare . The only organizations are the churches and a moribund lodge of Good Templars . Of neighborliness there is little , and that little consumes itself so entirely in the retailing of petty scandal that there is nothing left for beneficence . To the sights and sounds of nature - the spring flowers , the summer insects , the autumn foliage , the winter chiaroscuro , the chants of birds , brooks , and woodlands - the people are deaf and blind . The freshness of the morning and the glowing colors of the sunset stir no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools are held in poorly equipped buildings , taught by girls without training or enthusiasm , and attended by children devoid of ambition . One might almost say they are as bad as they could be . The Sunday-schools are even worse . Except the two Sunday-school libraries , which are little better than nothing , there is no circulating library in the whole township . Memoirs of martyr missionaries and antiquated books of devotion are among the heirlooms of many families ; they are held in profound respect , but are never read . Such other books as appear on the tables are those the owners have been wheedled into purchasing by clever book agents , - subscription books all : campaign Lives of candidates for the presidency , county histories , cookbooks , sermons of evangelists and emotional preachers , Home Treasuries of prose and poetry ; above all , books of etiquette . The denominational religious weeklies , the cheaper fashion aud housekeeping periodicals , the fifty-cent story papers ( whose real business is a traffic in notions by post ) , and the stanch old party organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the households . But the real , the typical reading of Dickerman , the reading of men and women , young and old , is the sensational newspaper of the worst kind , especially the Sunday edition , which is sold at every cross-roads in New England , even where the railway has not yet penetrated . One is not surprised to find a dearth of public spirit . The civic sense of Dick , erman manifests itself once a year only , at town-meeting , chiefly in reducing the regular and necessary appropriations to the lowest possible limit , in protesting against innovations on the ground of burdensome taxes , and in quarreling over trifles . In fact , were it not for the icars of each of the several sections of the township that it would get less than its share of the public moneys , and for the widespread desire to hold office , which finds profit in encouraging these petty sectional jealousies , there would hardly be any public appropriations whatever in Dickerman . Civic honesty , naturally enough , is at the same low ebb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // has been in vogue for years , and has not been as much lessened by the introduction of the secret ballot as in larger communities , where secrecy of any sort is more practicable . Only lately , the chairman of the board of selectmen was kept from foreclosing a mortgage solely by the threat of his mortgagee to make public the amounts that he and others had received from the official for their votes in the preceding election . Liquorselling under a state prohibitory law is condoned by the selectmen for pecuniary considerations , these being tacitly understood to be legitimate perquisites of the office of selectman . The two churches of Dickerman are not the dispensing centres of sweetness and light that we would fain believe all religious organizations to be . The Orth*dox Church , as immutable in its methods as in its doctrines , is cold , unaggressive , self-righteous , and contemptuous of everything religious or anti-religious that is not part and parcel of its tradition . The Baptist Church , equally conservative in matters of doctrine , is nevertheless committed to sensationalism of method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not manage to produce at least one genuine excitement . It indulges in fierce and frequent tirades against free-thinking , worldly amusements , and Sabbath-breaking , and , for purposes of edification , imports evangelists , Bible readers , leaders of praying bands , total abstinence apostles , refugee Armenians , anti-Catholic agitators , educated freedmen , and converted Jews . The churchgoers , while they are sadly lacking in the positive virtues of honesty , generosity , and brotherly love , are as a class fairly faithful to the code of a conventional negative morality that makes it incumbent upon them to be temperate and orderly , at least in public . The churches are thus a valuable restraining force . Furthermore , they discharge an important social function in bringing together , regularly , people who would otherwise not be brought together at all in an organized way . Barren , then , as the life of Dickerman is with its churches , it would be still more barren without them . The social immorality of rural New England is a subject that does not fall directly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good people who take it for granted that country life develops social purity probably do not know the true condition of country life anywhere ; certainly they do not know it in New England . If the whole truth were told about the people of Dickerman in this respect , it would be sad truth . An eminent American has recently been urging the protection of the morals of the city against the country . Novel as the argument seems , it is none the less a sound one . The foregoing description of life in Dickerman is not exaggerated . Its outward dilapidation and the emptiness of its inner life could not be exaggerated . But there are , of course , individuals who are intelligent , honest , large-hearted . And things have not always been at such a pass there . The very dilapidation , destitution , and decay are eloquent , as tombstones are eloquent , of a life that has been , of a bygone golden age . Sixty years ago Dickerman was one of the most flourishing farming communities in its State . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a roomy and hospitable road-house , whose tap-room flip , jollity , and repartee enjoyed an interstate reputation . Then , as now , except that the sawmill and gristmill were always buzzing , farming was its only industry . The farms were well tilled without the assistance of machinery , and thefarmbuildings were kept in good repair . The farmers were hard-working , thrifty , and alert ; the farmers ' wives were efficient out of doors and within doors , and as well able as the men to withstand a pork diet , if that was then the fashion . Sons and daughters alike were expected to do their share towards the family 's maintenance during the busy season , in recompense // for which they were allowed to devote themselves heartily to the winter school . This winter school was invariably taught by a man , usually a college student ; the work of the colleges then being arranged to make teaching in winter possible . The relation of the teacher to his pupils was a highly personal one ; hence the ready transmission of enthusiasm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of the township , but of a large rural district fromwhich it drewboarding-pupils . Even to this day a few of the older citizens who still hold to the Dickerman tradition will name to you the eminent judges , members of Congress , Senators , and clergymen to whom Dickerman Academy was an alma mater . A weekly lyceum was held in the academy building during the winters months , and a singing-school in the schoolhouse . Neighborhood social events were frequent , hearty , and wholesome . The church ( there was only one then ) was so conducted as to afford , indirectly , large opportunities for the interchange of courtesies , news , and ideas . It was generously supported , and so close was the union of its interests with those of the town that fidelity to the one meant practically fidelity to the other . Altogether it was a healthy , homogeneous life , a little slow , perhaps , but far from lethargic , and productive of much that was worth while , especially of the thing the best worth while of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in Dickerman ? First , there was the discovery of gold in California , with its promises of large fortunes to all who were enterprising enough to go across the plains . Some went from Dickerman ,  --  the most ardent and adventurous of those whose careers were not mapped out for them , a few even of those to whom a fair success in life was already assured . Those who were left behind had to be philosophers to remain serene under the fabulous stories that came to them , through the mails , from those who had gone among the first ; and not all stood this test . Later , the railway came to Dickerman , establishing quick connection with the manufacturing towns and cities , just then entering on a period of extraordinary activity , and with the New England metropolis . The reports of the high and steady wages to be earned in the shoeshops and in the cotton and woolen mills made the young people even more restless than the reports from the gold-fields had made them , - the shops and the mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as young men , went forth to try their fortunes . The civil war called a number away . Of these , some of course were killed in battle ; others , after their discharge , yielded to the enticements of the tcities , and never went back to the farms . Of those who returned to Dickerman to live , a part were physically disabled , or were demoralized by dissipated habits contracted during their camp life . Finally , the emigration which set in from New England to the Western prairies , and which brought the relatively small and barren home farms into an illdeserved contempt , took a large part of those who were left and were worth taking . By these successive losses of population the town was at last so far impoverished that no great attraction from without was necessary to keep up the drain , for the very deadness and dullness within exerted a strong expulsive force ; depletion itself being a sufficient reason for further depletion . There was once a saying current to the effect that as soon as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine . So it came to be at Dickerman , and has been ever since : as soon as a boy has become able to walk , he has walked away from Dickerman . And , pray , why not ? What inducemenl* could he have to remain ? Instead of leaving a good place to live in for one that might or might not be bet- // ter , as the first emigrants did , he was merely leaving a bad place to live in for a place that could not possibly be worse . The same influences that caused the depletion and the decay of Dickerman - the rush to the gold-fields , the civil war , the emigration to the prairies , the large cities , and the manufacturing towns , and the feeling of isolation and lack of opportunity resulting from this emigration - have been operative throughout all rural New England with more or less disastrous results . Another influence , just as generally operative , has been an exaggerated notion of the luxury and gentility of city life . To hail from Boston or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the typical rural mind , which groups city people together in a single social stratum , without question as to where they live or how they live , and assigns farmers , whatever their individual qualities , to a social stratum lower by many degrees . This absurd notion has not only driven country people away from the country , but has also demoralized those whom it has not driven away . Hence has come the pathetic desire of such as find themselves doomed to live elsewhere than in cities to imitate , as nearly as their imperfect knowledge permits , the manner of life of city folk . They endeavor to dress as city people dress , to furnish their rooms as city people do , even to readjust their houses to the city mode . They remodel a fine , sensible old homestead into something that is neither a farmhouse nor a town-house , but an ugly nondescript , with the disadvantages of both and the advantages of neither ; or they demolish a house honestly built to stand for generations to make way for a gingerbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of farm surroundings as bric-*-brac would be in a stable . They discard their heirlooms - handsome , heavy , antique furniture , and rare china-for upto-date gewgaws , with neither durability , usefulness , nor beauty to recommend them . The women waste no end of time and money , and fret and fuss their lives out into the bargain , in a vain and ludicrous attempt to keep pace , from season to season , with the changing fashions in dresses and hats . Furthermore , this grotesque exaltation of city conduct has bred a contempt not only for the healthy outdoor work that women formerly did , but also for menial labor of every sort even within doors . If these attempts to put away old country fashions were genuine reachings out towards a higher life , there would be no good reason for deploring them ; but they are so plainly mere affectations that they are thoroughly pernicious . The standards they are based upon are ready-made importations , not the natural and healthy outgrowth of rustic conditions . The result is glaring incongruity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never constructive . A farmer might as well try to plough in a dress suit as a farming community try to ape the manners of a metropolis . The undermining of character necessarily involved in such a proceeding is its worst consequence . Wasteful expenditure is an immediate result , for peddlers and sharp - dealing tradespeople know this rural weakness and take advantage of it . The country people , being hopelessly under the spell of the notion that they must have things exactly as city people have them , are easily beguiled by cleverly exaggerated advertisements and voluble chatter into believing that many unnecessary things are necessary , and that it costs nothing to buy on the accursed installment plan . They purchase pianos and organs on which they never learn to play ; reclining - chairs whose mechanism is so defective that they refuse to recline except at highly inopportune moments ; hanging - lamps , rarely lighted , which , when lighted , are unfit to read , to write , or to *ew by ; smart sets of parlor furniture , whose stuffing of Spanish moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; plush albums that will not hold color even in the dim light of the best room ; spectacles and eyeglasses that do the eyes positive harm ; ear-drums that give no aid to the deaf ; and folding-beds and bed-lounges whose only possible excuse for existence is the lack of space in a city fiat , - space , so dull is perversity , being the one thing above all others in which country people are privileged not to economize . It is surprising how much these foolish purchases cost . Only one who is familiar with living on a small margin can know how far the exchequer of the average country family is demoralized by them . A sixty-five-dollar cooking-stove that was not needed , whatever its merits , the organ that is never played , or the unlovely plush album may be the very thing that precludes the possibility of closing the year out of debt . When a young man , with only his hands or his untrained brain to depend upon for a living , deliberately refuses to accept an average farm from his father as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on it and work it , - a thing that is constantly occurring in New England , - the natural conclusion is that the young man sees no profit in farming ; and though in exceptional cases his refusal may have other than financial reasons , the conclusion is generally a sound one . The fact that farming as ordinarily carried on does not pay is a highly important factor in the present situation . Most New England farmers are up to their eyes in debt ; overburdened with real estate and chattel mortgages which they can never hope to pay ; constantly harassed by the insistence of a dozen other obligations which they can never hope to meet ; more than satisfied if they are able to keep up the interest on their mortgages , keep the town waiting for their taxes , and get extension of time on their notes . But it would be instructive to know whether the actual profits on capital and labor invested in New England farming are any smaller to-day than they were formerly , or whether it is the foolhardy attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them appear to be reduced . The farmers themselves believe the profits to be much smaller , but their belief is hardly conclusive , inasmuch as in the first place they are prejudiced observers , and in the second place , for what reason I know not , they are the most incorrigible grumblers in the world . The proverbial discontent of the laboring man is as nothing to theirs . Besides the government , which we all decry on occasion as a matter of habit , and which may therefore be left out of the account , the farmer has three favorite objects of abuse , - the railroads , the speculating capitalists , and the middlemen . That the speculating capitalists play with farm products as they would with cards is notorious . That railroads sometimes impose exorbitant freights and bribe legislatures , to their own advantage and the farmers ' confusion , is well known . That the middlemen get more than their proper share of the profit , though not entirely clear in view of the risks they run , is not unlikely . If we grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these men , we see only the more clearly his own inferiority . In truth , the failure of the average New England farmer to make a good living is probably due quite as much to his incapacity as to the extravagance of his imitations of city life , on the one hand , and the impositions of his economic masters , on the other hand . This incapacity is made up of unintelligence , shiftlessness , and dishonesty in about equal parts . It is a trite saying , and only partially true , but true enough to bear repeating , that if the average farmer did his work with the same intelligence that the average business man uses , he would succeed as well as the latter . The farmer , instead of ' studying markets systematically , makes wild hits at them . Because peas brought a good price a previous // season , owing to their scarcity , he plants ten times as many peas as usual ; forgetting that everybody else has planted peas for the same reason . If he lives near enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to become possessed with the desire to raise only one or two vegetables ; or he ignores the proper rotation of crops ; or he is constantly sacrificing permanent profit for ready cash , taking everything out of the land , and putting nothing into it . After leaving his wagons , tools , and machines exposed to all the elements , he is amazed and angry that he so often has to buy new ones , curses them for being poorly made , and inveighs boisterously against the dishonesty of the time . Such a farmer seems never to learn that clubs and families in cities are willing to pay a high price for thoroughly honest products ; for when he finds persons who might easily be made permanent buyers from him , he estranges them by inflicting upon them dishonest things . Doing little to make his produce attractive , he nevertheless devotes a great deal of ingenunity to arranging it dishonestly , - " deaconing it , " to use the significant country phrase . He " deacons " his fruit , his vegetables , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh eggs that have been packed all winter , and taking it as a sort of personal affront that the men who stamp and guarantee their eggs can command a fancy price all the year . Although the farmer is perhaps not more dishonest than other men , it is probable that he suffers more from his dishonesty than most others : partly because he deals so largely with perishable materials , in which fraud is easily and quickly detected ; and partly because he is less subtle in his deceits , and less apt in defending himself against the consequences of detection . One year when the best apples were hard to dispose of , a certain district Grange offered its members a chance to send apples to Liverpool . Some took advantage of the situation to get rid of their poor fruit . The Liverpool agents very naturally felt aggrieved , and the Liverpool market was closed to the farmers of that district for the rest of the season , during which many barrels of good fruit rotted . The prime cause of the impoverishment of the social life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impairment of vital force by the loss of great numbers of worthy people , but this cause alone does not entirely explain the decline . The large size of the townships and the long distances between dwellings have had much to do with making social coherence difficult . A single township may embrace four or five communities two or three miles apart , with no common rallying-point but the annual townmeeting . Not only do these detached sections get nothing socially from the township as a whole , but they are not , as a rule , populous or compact enough to have any appreciable social activity of their own . In this respect our farming communities are at a distinct disadvantage as compared with those of France and most of the other countries of the Old World . There the tillers of the soil live closely together , in almost crowded villages , from which they go forth to their work in the outlying fields . There is nothing in their situation to prevent their life from being as highly organized as if they were not tillers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I described the latter in The Atlantic Monthly for May ) two true if extreme types of contemporary New England rural life have been presented ; one showing progress at its best , the other showing decay at its worst . There are few Dickermans , there are still fewer Indian Ridges . Most New England farming towns range themselves between these two types in point of character ; they are not so dead as Dickerman , and not so energetic as Indian Ridge . That the country in general , however , has slipped back , no one who knows it can doubt . But // several influences which in a measure counteract the general tendency to decay must be mentioned . Village Improvement Societies , though varying greatly in their efficiency , have brought much benefit to many localities . The Grange , while doing little enough of the sort of service that was expected of it in the reform of economic conditions , is working social and intellectual miracles . The Home Culture Clubs and the Chautauqua Circles and Assemblies must be admitted to have given an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive of better schools in towns of scattered population , has been effected by the simple device of free transportation to and from a centrally located school . Public libraries have increased in number , and the Sunday-school libraries of some of the towns not yet provided with public libraries have been so far liberalized as to prove not unworthy substitutes . The beauty of the memorial library buildings and churches erected here and there by wealthy individuals , and the improvement that has taken place in the architecture of the railway stations , are doing something for the development of taste . I venture a few words , then , at the risk of blundering badly , as to the future . Farming communities which like Indian Ridge have held out successfully against the powerful disintegrating forces of the last half - century have thereby proved themselves possessed of so much inherent virility that their life may be depended upon to continue vigorous , whatever transformations it niay undergo . Then the trolley roads are rapidly covering Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Connecticut with a network that is slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a The least important , perhaps , and yet to some of us the saddest thing about the decay of New England country life has been the disappearance of the hospitable wayside tavern . Something similar , it is hoped , may be brought great part of the present rural area of these three States will ultimately be included in the suburbs of their numerous and widely scattered industrial centres and of their dozen or more larger cities . When this condition arrives , if it does arrive , rural life will have become suburban , and farming , aside from market-gardening , will have practically disappeared . The bicycle and good roads are exerting a minor but considerable influence in the same direction . ' Equally important is the fact that large areas in all sections of New England are in process of transformation from farms to sites of country-seats . Residents of the cities are coming more and more to make their real homes in the country . They are building their country houses with more comfort and more solidity , and are living in them a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season extends already from the first of May to the first of November , and is still lengthening . Improved railway and steamboat transportation , the multiplication of large fortunes , greater leisure , above all a growing appreciation of the sports and resources of country life , have contributed to this result . It looks very much as if our urban society were attaching itself primarily to the land , - living on the land , and leaving it for the city only in the festive season . Whether this tendency will produce again a landed aristocracy instead of an aristocracy of other forms of wealth , who can say ? One thing only is sure , - it would produce thereby a new New England . During the hunting and fishing seasons of the last few years , northern Maine , the wildest and most remote section of New England , has been visited by such numbers of sportsmen that the income to the residents has in by the bicycle . It is much to be feared , however , that the new bicycle road-house will be nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this region is not permanently reserved to sport ( as it ought to be ) , its magnificent lake , mountain , and river districts will be crowded with summer hotels , as soon as they become a little more accessible by rail . From the summer hotel to the summer cottage is but a step , and from the summer cottage to the solid country house is but another step . Considerable sections of Vermont , New Hampshire , and western Massachusetts , and of the New England coast from Eastport to the New York line , have already been transfigured by this remarkable return to the soil . Curious indeed it would be if rural New England , which has been largely depopulated and impoverished by a movement of country people to the city , should be repopulated and enriched , should have its economic and social equilibrium restored , by a counter-movement of city people to the country . Finally , there is some hope for the New England farms as farms , - for farms , although apparently destined to play a less important part than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as are neither adjacent to the cities and industrial centres nor specially attractive for residence , - and this hope seems to rest with our immigrants . They alone are willing and able to lead simple farm lives , such as the pioneers of the West or the original New England settlers lived . The native Americans are now too impatient , too extravagant , too proud , under the changed conditions , to be successful farmers . In many sections , this occupation and rehabilitation of the soil by foreigners has actually begun . Many of the abandoned farms which come into the market are bought by them at very low prices . Most of these newcomers prosper , just as the American settlers of a former period prospered when they held to the plain life of pioneers . If these immigrant farmers were crowding native Americans off the land , as immigrant laborers have from time to time crowded them out of the labor market , their advent would be ominous ; but since they step in to fill a vacuum , to do what others have failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have a hearty welcome . The old New England , the New England of the farms , seems destined to disappear , if indeed it has not disappeared already . The people who gave it its character have long been away from the farms , building up and enriching the West , the Northwest , the Southwest , the interior , and the large cities and manufacturing towns of the Atlantic coast States . The primitive , rugged , wholesome life of the fathers is gone forever . Nothing can bring it back . I have ventured to predict a new New England , composed of large cities and manufacturing towns of greatly expanded suburbs , districts of country - seats , and a remnant of farms worked by immigrant farmers . The prophecy seems fair enough in the light of the most conspicuous present conditions ; but so seemed the prophecy , before the day of railways , that New Orleans would be one of the great cities of the world . As the railways prevented the development of New Orleans and created Chicago , so such a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watercourses of electrical power , and its transmission for long distances , may of itself be sufficient to change the life and aspect of all New England within a very brief period . The typical New England community of to-day , however , is neither the decayed farming town nor the prosperous farming town , but the manufacturing town . Such a community will be the subject of the next and final chapter of these studies .
