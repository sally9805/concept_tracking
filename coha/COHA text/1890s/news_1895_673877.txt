txt James White and Conrad Creed of Morris Avenue , Fordham , and Frank Reid of King 's Bridge and High Bridge Roads , Fordharn , all about nineteen years old , started in a catboat at 2 o'clock yesterday morning from Seely 's float at Fordham Heights , Harlem River , for a two days ' cruise up the Hudson . Reid owned the boat and was at the tiller . They sailed northward along the Harlem , reaching Spuyten Duyvil about 3 A. M. As they were nearing the drawbridge of the branch of the New-York Central Rail , road across the mouth of Spuyten Duyvil Creek , the tide caught the boat and carried it against the draw , which was too low to allow the mast to pass . The stick struck the drawbridge and overturned the boat , which was a twenty-six , footer , All three of Its occupants were thrown into the water , but managed to seize the timbers of the piling next the draw . The river was lined withefishermen , who came up late Saturday night and fished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd to the bridge . Two men jumped into a skiff tied to the boathouse , just inside the trestle work , and went to their rescue . White and Creed got safely into the boat , but Reid , in climbing in , put all his weight on one of the gunwales , upsetting everybody , including the two fishermen , into the water . All but White were caught by the tide and swept , clinging to the boat , into the Hudson . White caught again to the piling , and was pulled up through the ties . Disheartened by the failure of the two fishermen , the crowd on the railroad traele. hesitated to send out another boat , though there were a dozen skiffs at hand and plenty to man them . The cries of the men in the water could be heard through the fog as they were carried rapidly out toward the middle of the Hudson by the swift current . Seeing nobody would attempt a rescue , the night engineer of the drawbridge ran up to the cottage of James Mahoney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and his son John . John Mahoney waited only to pull on a pair of trousers . and then rushed down and jumped into a boat . Guided by the cries of the people in the water , he pulled out into the Hudson till he came upon the overturned skiff , with one of the fishermen and young Creed hanging to it . The boy was badly frightened , and was rolling the boat over and over to keep above water . Mahoney got the boy into his skiff , and had the man , who was heavy , hold on behind , and rowed them in to shore . A colored man on a barge that was anchored about 300 feet from shore had in the meantime picked up the second fisherman . The man was nearly dead , and could not help himself . The colored man tugged at him to get him into his little boat , and . fearing he would be overturned , had tied a rope around the already unconscious man and towed him to shore , thinking he was dead . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trestle , and the crowd of fishermen carried him over to the engine house . After a long time he was resuscitated . The two that Mahoney had rescued were taken into the boathouse and warmed by the fire . Frank Reid was lost . He was clinging to the boat when it was seen drifting away from the bridge , but must have lost his hold and gone down . Reid was a good swimmer , and it was thought for a while that he might have got to shore somewhere below . Nothing was heard from him yesterday , however , and he was given up as drowned . The yacht and the fishermen 's boat were both lost , and must have gone down stream . Mahoney says that he saw a. boat 's light that was probably on the catboat floating down stream , and finally disappear . The rescue of the survivors was hindered by a thick fog that obscured everything . The night was also bitterly cold . The names of the fishermen . who first went to the rescue are unknown . They remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train to the city . The accident was reported at the Kings-bridge Police Station by White and Creed , who walked there In the early morning and then left for home .
