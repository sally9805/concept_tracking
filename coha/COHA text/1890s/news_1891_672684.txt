txt A three-set play called " Miss Manning , " written by Mr. Runnion , of Chicago , was acted in the Fourteenth Street Theatre last evening . Iv had not previously been aeon in New-York , and we infer that It will be very popular . In Act L a tale is told of a will made by a person Who must have been insane . By its terms , unless the heroine is soon married , she will lose her fortune . A greasy person with a red nose who imitates a sneeze quite naturally , and a number of other vulgar and useless fellows , including a clergyman who looks like a pickpocket , pay court to her . An old uncle with a high-pitched Western voice , who revels in the use of the real Chicago " R " when he speaks , bounces in and out of a set cottage L. 2 E.  --  the S00110 is a garden ? and talks a great deal ; a youth of the " bruiser " type who wears a baseball uniform , acts knocked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-comedy man makes his addresses to an anoidnt spinster , mistaking her for the heriess ; a young physician , thin king about marriage , asks every one he meets how much a " lady 's washing " ? moaning the washing of her clothes ? costa , and the heroine frolics ab out in a mature and joyless way , wearing a pink gown and a close-fitting sunbonnet a la Minnie Palmer . At the close of Act I. she an nonnces to ( Mines that she will marry a soiled tramp who has just come into view , and who , the sagacious audience knows , is really her cousin , whom she has long loved . Any person who wants to know the incidents of Acts II . and III . is hereby respectfully requested to visit Mr. R osenquest 's well-appointed theatre , which is accessible by the elevated railroad and half a dozen lines of surface ears . M1is Effie Elleler is the heroine . She is an actress of talent and experience and she has an attractive personality , but she is not a soubrette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has been induced to imitate Minnie Palmer . There 118 , after all , only one Minnie Palmer , and that is enough . We have no other objection to offer to the performance in which Miss Ellsler is now employed and in which she is assisted by a number of persons who are probably law-abiding and have a perfect right to make their livings the best way they can . Some old-fashioned , sedate folks who have in view the honorable fame of the late John Ellsler and the good artistic beginning of his daughter may go to see the play ; and they , in their silly , old-fogyish way , may be shocked by the combo application of quotations from the Bible ; but that is their affair . People must keep abreast with the times , and reverence is not a distinguishing trait of the contemporary multitude and the purveyors of amusement for it . As we have said , " Miss Manning " is likely to be popular . It is a much better play than " A Straight Tip , " though perhaps its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPERA HOUSE . There was a large and remarkably enthusiastic audience in the Grand Opera House last night when James W. Morrissey 's company presented Flotow 's pretty little opera " Martha . " It seems a pity that this agreeable work , which belongs to the realm of genuine opera comique , can not be given with the true spirit . Nineteen times out of twenty it is both poorly sung and poorly acted , and the other time it is ' sung and not acted at all . Occasionally it rejoices in the presence of a prima donna who , like Mine . Patti or Mme. Pauline L'Allemand , can give the audience all the vivacity anti attractiveness of Lady Henrietta without sacrificing her pretty melodies , but the Nancy usually follows such a Martha like a black shadow of gloom . It is a rare thing , indeed , to find a quartet which can bring out all the brightness and amiability of the lour leading characters and sing their musics too . In spite of the prevailing opinion to the contrary , " Martha " is nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , it will readily be understood that last night 's performance was far from being an ideal one . Allowances must be made , of course , for the circumstances under which Mr. Morrissey is giving grand opera at cheap prices ; but certainly the chorus ought to keep within half a measure of the orchestra . Among the principals the tenor and bass were the must worthy of praise . F. Michelena , the Lionel , has a tenor voice of very pleasant quality , but his phrasing is painfully disjointed and deprives his singing of all cantabile effect . W. H. Clark was a respectable Plunkett . Louise Natali as Martha did not look , act , or sing the part , and Bella Tomlins as Nancy was a picture of discomfort , though she sang her music correctly . Joseph Kilduff as Sir Tristan and J. W. Williams as the Mayor were anything but impressive . It is probable that the performance will improve before the week ends . For one reason Mr. Morrissey 's enterprise is to be commended .

" TROUBLE ENT THE BLACK REPUBLIC . ANOTHER REVOLUTION STARTED AMONG THE HAITIENS . Information received by cable at the Haitien consulate in this city yesterday confirms the Paris dispatch of Saturday which stated that another revolution had broken out in that turbulent republic . Hannibal ' Price , the Haltien Minister , when seen yesterday by a TIMES reporter , said that ha had received the following dispatch , dated at Port au Prince , May 29 . The message was in French , and , translated , read : " Attempt at revolution May 28 at Port au Prince failed . Itebels executed . Public order nut disturbed . Department of the West has been placed under martial law . " The Minister could give no other information than that contained in the cable and refused to advance any speculations as to who the leaders of the uprising were . Coming from officials of the party which is now in power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the attempt failed and that the rebels were executed should be taken with reservation . Admiral Gherardi , who is unquestionaey hotter posted on the adairs and prospects of the Black Republic than any other person hereabouts , was seen at tho Bt . George Rotel , in Brooklyn , last night . In reply to a question asking his opinion of the reported outbreak , the commander of the North Atlantic squadron said that a revolutiorewas merely a question of time , and was inevitable . The news that it had come did not surprise him in the least , and he was of the opinion that the withdrawal of his squadron bad accelerated it . The Admiral 's opinion of llyppolite is not a very high one , and Firwin , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , he considers the actual ruler of the country . The President is a native of the northern portion of the island , and the Admiral said that he believed that while that portion or the country would not enter the field against him , there was not one of his northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from power . " In fact . " said the Admiral , " Hippolyte has no following anywhere . The country has become exceedingly restive under his sway , and it was only kept quiet by the presence of my squadron . Monigat is the leader of the Liberal Party , and if there is any disturbance he is sure to have been the instigator of it . Legitirue I consider a back number and of no account . " It is known that San Domingo is unfriendly to Hippolyte , and is only waiting for a favorable opportunity to throw her sword in the scale against him . In that country , where a single disturbance takes in a day the familiar form of revolution , it is not likely that President Reureaux will have to wait long for his opportunity . In regard to the report that a French iron-clad had been ordered . to Port au Prince . the Admiral said that there was no war vessel Of that nationality in southern waters at the time of his departure .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
