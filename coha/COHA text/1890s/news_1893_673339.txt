txt Harry Miner , the founder of that branch of industry known as the " green goods " business , or , iu plainer words , the confidence game , died at Bensonhurst , L. L , yesterday afternoon , penniless . At the time of his death he was a police officer at a salary of $60 a month . Miner , during his career , spent several ' fortunes , all gained in his nefarious busi ; nese . He died without a friend at his bedside . Miner was born in this city about fortyseven years ago . He came from a very respectable family . His , father , who died about fifteen years ago , was connected with the Police Department , and for many years was Sergeant in different precincts . Young Miner , after leaving school , became acquainted with a gang of " thimble riggers " and worked as a " capper " at Norton 's Point on Coney Island . He was tall , broad shouldred , with a neat black mustache , and had a ready flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gullible public at the " shell game " and other petty devices to fool the poor countrymen , Miner started what was known as the confidence game along with " Tom " Davis , " Grand Central Pete , " " Larry " O'Brien , " The " Davis , " Barney " Maguire , and . other notables . Their mode of operating was to meet countrymen in the street , learn their names and addresses , and turn them over to some confederates who would either induce them to shake dice or play against some " brace " faro bank . Early in the seventies the base of their operations was along Lower Broadway , and they looked for victims in the Astor House , the St. Nicholas Hotel , and the New-York HoteL Complaints were made repeatedly to the police , and in time it grew so bad that the confidence men had to be very careful in accosting a stranger . Business in ? consequence was not very flourishing and their revenue grew smaller and.smaller . It was then that Miner hit upon a plan . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent them notices , telling them how they could make fortunes by buying money made from plates stolen from the Treasury Department at Washington , and inviting them to come to this city to inspect the goods . After the poor countryman came here , a big pile of new bank notes , all genuine , was displayed and offered for sale . If the victim decided to make a purchase , the money was put in a bag and handed to a confederate , known as the guide . whose duty it was to see that the customer was put safely on the train . On the way to the station the dupe and the guide would stop into a saloon to have a drink , and while there the bag would be changed  --  that is , provided there was not opportunity to make the change at the office or headquarters . Of course , when the silly countryman got home , he found the bag contained only bundles of green paper . This business grew to immense proportions , and every fakir in town gave it a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " squeals , " were being made every day , and the postal authorities took cognizance of them . Letters , in consequence , addressed to the headquarters of the green goods then were withheld and turned over to the Post Office Inspectors , who returned them to the sender with a , , warning to beware of the New-York sharks . Again Miner was equal to the occasion . In sending out his circular he warned his customers to send their answers by wire , and so as not to allow the operator in his town to got suspioious , advised him to take a train and ride a station of two before filing the telegram . This worked li ko a charm for a year or two . The countrymen were met at the station by a dapper young man , whose duty it was to guide him to the headquarters of the swindlers . Again an obstacle was placed in the way of the " green goods " men . Detectives were placed at the different ferries and railroad stations , and the guides caught accosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as vagrants . But Miner 's fertile brain was set to work , and he devised a scheme to fool the police . The guide was sent to a city about an hour or two 's ride from New-York to meet the countryman , It was his duty to question him closely , find out how much money he had in his possession , and use his discretion as to the advisability of taking him to this city to be fleeced . Victims from the South were advised to stop at certain hotels in ' Philadelphia , from the West in Poughkeepsie , and . from the East in Bridgeport . They were told how to register , and the glide , by simply glancing over the register , could tell whether his man had arrived , and if he had , all that was necessary was to go to the room , introduce himself , and gain the desired information . If he decided to take him to New-York. he sat apart from the victim on the train and cautioned him not to speak out , but simply follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to get any evidence . When the black bag was given to the guide he was instructed not to give it to the purchaser . but to chock it at the baggage office aud. give Mr. Countryman the check . Of late years Miner had grown very reckless . From a man of steady , sober habits he became careless , remained out late nights , drank an abundance of wine , gambled recklessly , and allowed his business to take care of itself . He frequented the Pennsylvania Clubhouse at Long Branch , Mitchell 's at Saratoga , " Dink " Davis 's the " Washington Game , " 818 Broadway , and . other wellknown gambling houses . He was what is known as a fast player , caring little or nothing for losses . Like all men in his business , gambling debts were paid promptly . Fickle fortune failed to smile on Miner , and his money melted away like snow before the sun . His friend , " Tom " Davis , had been shot by Holland the Texan . the green-goods trade was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was burning at both ends . Finally , it was whispered about town that " Miner was broke . " His jewelry disappeared gradually ; it was noticed . that he was wearing " store " clothes , and one by one his friends ' deserted him . For a time he , kept up . appearances by borrowing from old aoquamtances , but it finally leaked out that the " green goods " ... King was without capital , and . ' Handsome Harry , " who had been lionized at Saratoga , Newport , - and Cape May , found himsfel penniless and alone . To his credit , however , it must be said . that he " : did not lose courage . To an old friend ? Michael O'Brien , who keeps a restaurant . at Coney Island , he applied for WOIk , and wasmagage.din , the capacity of bartender . He worked there one season . This year he secured a place as police officer at Bensonhurst . While Miner was in the zenith of his fame the wife of a very prominent politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in all his travels . Finally she left her husband and three children to elope with the confidence man . The politician held a county office . He took to drink and night and day searched for Miner with the intention of shooting him . At last his mind became unbalanced and he - was placed in an asylum . After he was discharged the wife came back , asked forgiveness , and . to-day they are living together happily . Miner had a habit while in liquor of telling some of his exploits in swindling countrymen . One of his favorite stories was of an Ohio farmer who came here to buy supposed counterfeit money . Instead of putting the good money in the bag , bundles of green paper , with good bills on the top and . bottom , were substituted and given to the farmer . When he got home he returned . the bundles of green paper by express with a note saying : " The bills on the top and bottom are all 0 . K. You forgot to print the middle ones . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor fellow , " Miner used to say , " we skinned him and he could n't be convinced that we were frauds . " Frederick Lahn , a florist at 286 Grand Street , who is a brother-in-law of Miner , yesterday claimed the body . He will defray the expenses of the fnneral . Miner 's death was caused by catarrh of the stomach .
