MONTANA : THE TREASURE STATE . BY JULIAN RALPH . TWO anecdotes told in Montana as characteristic home-made jokes illustrate the spirit of its people . The first one is about ex-Governor Hauser . It is said that , like many another true Montanian , he begins to feel a new and strange regard for small change once he gets east of the Mississippi , a consideration unknown to any man in the Treasure State . It happened , therefore , that when on one occasion he handed two bitswhich is to say , a silver quarter  --  to a Chicago newsboy , and when the boy gave him a newspaper and moved away without making any change , the Montanian called out : " I say , stop ! Give me my // change . " At that the boy looked wonderingly at him . " Oh no , " he replied ; " you do n't want no change ; you 're a Montana man . " The other story is to the effect that a party of well - known Butte and Helena millionaires were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commercial traveller-  --  a stranger to all in the party-manifested a considerable interest in the game , as an outsider . The gentlemen were " chipping in " white chips to admit them to the betting on each hand of cards , and then they were stacking up red and blue chips in great profusion to attest their faith in what cards they held . The drummer found the game irresistible , and taking out a one-hundred-dollar bill , he flung it on the table and said : " Gentlemen , I would like to join you . There 's the money for some chips . " At that one of the millionaires looked over at the banker and said , " Sam , take the gentleman 's money , and give him a white chip . " These are characteristic Montana stories , and they reflect the spirit of the dominant handful of leaders in the State . If these men are not all too used to the making of big fortunes , they are at least bent upon making them , and very familiar with seeing them made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of affairs in California ; now it is peculiar to Montana . Think of it ! Montana , speaking very roughly , is so large a State and with so small a population that it may be said to contain one inhabitant for each square mile of its surface , and yet it has been the boast of those people that no similar band of human beings in the world has approached them in the amount of wealth per capita that they have produced . As long ago as 1889 Montana contained less than 150,000 souls , and produced $60,000,000-that is to say that , exclusive of what was consumed at home , the ore , cattle , horses , and sheep sent out of the State brought a sum of money equal to $400 for every man , woman , and child it supported . It is mainly a mining and a stock-raising State , and these industries have so amply rewarded those who are engaged in them that agricultural and manufacturing development have been unduly retarded . This can not long continue . So great a State can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dotted X*OL . Lxxxv. - No. 505-10 here and there with mining camps , and when we come to understand what rich farming lands the State contains , and of what vast extent are these parks and valleys , it takes no uncommonly prophetic eye to see the State in the near future checkered with the green and yellow of well-worked farms to a greater extent than it is now ribbed with mountains . The frequent and often easy making of great fortunes has had its natural consequence in causing the postponement of the cultivation of the soil . It has been left for Chinamen to make the valleys laugh with the bloom and verdure of small fruits and vegetables , and the fact that Chinamen were thus employed has tended to make such labor seem so much the less worthy of the white inhabitant . But now the white man has begun to take note of the wonderful results which have followed even this petty farming , and his eyes have been opened to the wide and varied capabilities of the soil , and to the fortunes that lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , are beginning work . They earned a million and a half from wheat last year , and nearly two millions of dollars from oats . But the conditions that have caused mining and stock-raising to monopolize the energy of the original people there have resulted in making Montana a very forward State , a very progressive and interesting fraction of the nation . It will not do for the reader to jump to the conclusion that because mining camps and cattle ranges have been the chief fields of industry , that the population is one of cowboys and shovel-men . On the contrary , Helena , the capital , is one of the most attractive cities in America , and is perhaps the wealthiest one of its size in the world . And scattered all over the State are other fine towns , in which will be found a very cultivated and cosmopolitan people , fond of and accustomed to travel , holding memberships in the clubs of New York and London , living splendidly at home , well informed , polite , fashionable , and intimately related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the financial centres of the country . It was not long ago in point of actual time that our children were taught to regard the region of the Missouri as peopled by redskins and enlivened by the presence of the buffalo . But it will seem to the // tourist of to-morrow that such a characterization of the country can not have been true in the time of men now alive , so utterly are all traces of the old condition obliterated . As far as such a traveller will be able to judge by what he sees , the Indian will appear to have gone with the buffalo . As a matter of fact , the savage is there still , but he is corralled on reservations as deer are in our parks . The tourist in Montana will find along his route a chain of thoroughly modern cities , appointed with fine and showy storehouses , the most modern means of street travel , excellent newspapers , luxuriously appointed clubs , good hotels , and all the conveniences of latter-day life . In Helena he will meet something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the Northwest-a circle made up of men who have retired upon their incomes , or who thrive by the shrewd use of capital obtained from industries that do not monopolize their attention . In this respect little Helena is more forward even than great Chicago . But over and through all of this progress and accomplishment there shines the mysterious and romantic light of a rude era that was so recent as to have involved even the middle-aged men of today . It was of the type of that of 49 in California . It was an era of new mining camps , of swarming tides of men thirsty for nuggets , of pistol - bristling sheriffs , of vigilantes , road-agents , Indian fights , stage-coaches , and all the motley characters that gave Bret Harte his inspiration . You may meet some of the men who helped to rid the State of outlaws by the holding of what they gayly spoke of as " necktie parties , " and the application of hemp . They are apt to lounge into the clubs on any night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who ever lived , or that quick-handed , " scientific " ex-constable who proudly asserts that in the worst days he arrested h undreds of desperadoes bare - handed , without pulling his gun more than once or twice in his whole constabulary career . They represent the days of the founding of Montana . And yet in the same city where I met such men I encountered others from London , New York , Sitka , San Francisco , and many other capitals ; for , as I have said , the new Montana is in close contact with all the world . Montana is the largest of the newly admitted States ; in fact , it is as large as Washington and North Dakota combined . It is one-sixth larger than the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . It is the third State in the sisterhood , ranking next after Texas and California . It contains 143,776 square miles , and is therefore the size of the States of New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Virginia , and West Virginia all rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half as wide . As it is approached from the east , it seems to be a continuation of the bunch-grass plains land which makes up all of North Dakota . But almost all at once upon entering Montana the monotony of the great plateau is relieved by its disturbance into hills , which grow more and more numerous , and take on greater and greater bulk and height , until , when onethird of the State has been passed , the earth is all distorted with mountains and mountain spurs . These are the forerunners of the Rockies , which , speaking roughly , make up tle final or western third of this grand and imperial new State . A gance at the map will call to the attention the apparently contradictory fact that the principal seats of population in the State are directly in the Rocky Mountain region . This is difficult for the majority of readers to account for . They think of the Rocky Mountains as great bastions of bare stone-and such , indeed , the main range is ; but the spurs and lesser or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the veritable Rockies themselves are innumerable valleys coated with the richest , most nutritious pasturage to be found anywhere in the world . In or beside such valleys are the cities of which I speak , built there to be close to the mines that are being worked in the mountains . Helena 's history shows how such conditions came ahout . In 1864 , after the discovery of placer gold in Alder Gulch had caused a stampede of fortune-seekers to Montana , the second scene of mining activity was Last Chance Gulch . That gulch is now the main street of Helena . The miners began washing the dirt at the foot of the gulch , and the saloon-keepers , gamblers , and traders built their places of business close to where the miners were at work . When the whole surface of the gold-bearing runways had been // passed through the pans , and $25,000,000 had been taken out in nuggets and dust , the mining ceased , but the town remained . It did not shrivel and languish like Virginia City , the town that had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the old Indian trails of the Northwest , and a natural centre of the region , it waxed big , and began a new lease of life as a trading , political , and money capital . Let me begin a detailed description of Montana by saying that its future as an agricultural State will be dependent upon the extent and number of irrigation ditches that shall be cut in it . The average rainfall upon the eastern end of the State is only about nine inches a year ; in the central part , still east of the mountains , it is nowhere more than fourteen inches , I believe . West of the mountains there is a very different country , one that is locally described as " green** that is to say , the verdure has its natural term of life , and the rainfall is greater there . But that is a small part of the State by comparison with the rest . Yet all over the State , on the great eastern plateau as well as in the valleys among the mountains , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at least three-fifths of it can be laid under the ditch . A glance at the map will show the reader the great lines of the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers , and the fine lines of their branches and feeders , which literally vein the chart . It is , of course , by means of the supply in these waterways that it is hoped the future farms of Montana will be founded and maintained . Governor Toole , in his last annual message , says that " there was a time when it seemed not improbable that the general government would take hold of this proposition , and under its supervision control and manage the water supply to the advantage of all . It is perfectly apparent , however , at this time ( January , 1891 ) that influences are co - operating which will eventuate in destroying whatever hope we may have had in that direction . Eastern communities , which have set this opposition in motion , appear to be mindful only of local interests , and not of the prosperity of the whole country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these arid lands would subject the settler in the Eastern and Middle States to undue competition , retarding relief from agricultaral depression .... The homes which we propose to make , " he continues , " are not for us alone , but for every citizen of the United States who has the courage to MAP OF MONTANA . // come and take one . If we are to receive any substantial or speedy benefits from our arid lands , I believe the State must first acquire a title to them , and then undertake by appropriate legislation to reclaim and dispose of them . The government should select , survey , and convey these lands to the State upon such conditions as would secure their occupatiQn and reclamation . " Independent of any such Federal action as is suggested by the Governor , individual enterprise has made itself greatly felt in the provision of irrigation canals , reservoirs , and ditches . If it were not that I fear being credited with a desire to criticise , I would say that the rush and mania for water rights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rich lands wherever they are newly opened in the far West , and the not altogether patriotic desire to build new cities in the State of Washington . In Montana irrigation schemes are expected to pay even better than mining ; hence the scramble . I ventured to speak of this to a man who was planning to control certain valleys , which he descrihed as being of the size of dukedoms , by " corralling " the waterways in them , hy which alone they could be made fit for farming . " Well , " he replied , " we who are on the ground are going to get whatever there is lying round . You do n't suppose we ate going to let a parcel of strangers preempt the water rights so that we must pay taxes to them ? No ; we prefer to let them pay the taxes to us . That was eminently logical , and thoroughly human as well . But it still seems to me that either the State or the general government should own and control the water rather than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they please that vast and general industry which will be the chief dependence of and source of wealth to the State . I am old-fashioned in this , since I but borrow the ideas of those central Asian kingdoms whose irrigating systems belonged to the governments , and yet I fancy this repugnance to a monopoly of water will prove a new and controlling fashion when the monopolists begin to fatten on their rents . As it is , water rights can be taken only by those individuals who mean to and do utilize them for the public . Such a person , or such persons , can file a claim for a water right at the district United States Land-office , but must improve such rights within a reasonable time . These rights are given in perpetuity to the owners their heirs , assigns , etc. , forever . They tap a stream of any part or all of its water if they want to , and run their ditch through what land they please , having the right to go through the land of a non-purchaser to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at so much per acre per year . The rentals vary between 50 cents and $1 50 an acre . Each farmer taps the ditch with lateral canals , gates being put in to divert the water into the side ditches . A farmer may also lay pipe from the ditch and carry water to his house and farm buildings , arranging an adequate and townlike system of water-works for domestic and stable uses ; thus , at what should be a trifling expense , the farmers on irrigated lands may ohtam this modern convenience . An important recent decision of the courts is that a man can not buy water and allow it to run to waste in order to deprive a neighbor of it . A company preempting a water right takes it on a mountain slope , tapping the stream high above the land to be irrigated . As a rule , the water is not brought to a reservoir . In most instances on the east slope of the Rockies this can not be done , but the ditches start above the basin land , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , but because in Montana the streams are apt to run in the hottoms of deep-water channels . It is a tempting business , because , since the rights are eternal , a company can afford to start even where the first outlay is large ; indeed , the more extensive the system and the larger the ditches , the better the profits . The country is certain to grow to meet such improvements , and to pay a handsome revenue as the years go on ; and in the mean time the ditches constantly cement themselves and diminish their waste . The result has been that when a call was issued for data concerning irrigation in Montana , preliminary to a convention for the study of the subject at the opening of this year , it was found that there were already somewhere near 3500 irrigating ditches , the property of 500 owners . Some of these schemes are gigantic . In some instances the project has been to secure not only the water , but the land // it is to irrigate , and the water lords expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to rents which their great - great - great - grandchildren may fatten upon . In other cases , only the water is got by the men or companies , and they are content to confine themselves to the taxes they will impose on the land as fast as it is taken up . The cattle-men of Montana decry these schemes , and beg the officials and editors of the State not to discuss irrigation and small farming , as , they say , settlers may be induced to come in and spoil the stock or grazing business ; yet I am told that one company of cattle-men has secured miles of land and the adjacent water rights along the Missouri against the inevitable day when- But the cattle business shall have another chapter . The largest irrigation scheme that is reported is that engineered by Zachary Taylor Burton , a notable figure in iViontana . It is in Choteau County , and taps the Teton River . The main ditch is forty miles long , fourteen feet wide at the bottom , and eighteen feet at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which now serve as reservoirs , and are fully restored to their ancient condition , not only beautifying a now bloomin g country , but having their surfaces blackened with flocks of wild swan , geese , ducks , gulls , and other fowl in the season when those birds reach that country . Drives are to be laid around the lakes , and their neighborhoods are likely either to become pleasure resorts or the seats of well-to-do communities . This scheme looks forward to putting 30,000 acres under the ditch . Thus far the cost of preparing the land for cultivation has been five dollars an acre , and the charge for maintenance of the ditches will be about fifty cents an acre a year . A very peculiar and interesting scheme is that of the Dearborn Company , in the valley of the same name . Here is a valley containing half a million acres , a sixth part of which may be cultivated . The rest is hilly , and will always be grazing land . The valley is between Great Falls and Helena , alongside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little watercourses - the Dry , Simms , Auchard , and Flat creeks-in themselves incompetent to water their little valleys . These are all to be utilized as ditches . By tapping the Dearborn River with a six-foot-deep canal , thirty-eight feet wide , and only four and a half miles long , this natural system of watercourses is connected with a supply of water fed by eternal springs and frequent mountain snowfalls . The scheme embraces a hundred miles of main waterways and hundreds of miles of laterals . The greater part of the land benefited is obtainable by homesteaders . I have spoken of the rush for water and land . Let me explain it with an illustration . One of the most lofty and ambitious grabbers in the State was not long ago observed to be engaging in a most mysterious business . He was taking women out into the wilderness a stage-load or two at a time . They were very reputable women - schoolteachers , type - writers , married women , and their friends . They were taken to a large and pleasantly situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ball and a dinner , and get a hundred dollars as a present . It all proved true . Excursion party after excursion party went out in this way , and when the ladies returned to the town that had thus been pillaged of its beauty , they reported that they had fared upon venison and wildfowl , with the very best of " fixings , " and that at the ball a number of stalwart and dashing cowboys had become their partners , tripping their light fantastic measures with an enthusiasm which made up for any lack of grace that may have been noticed . The reader may fancy what a lark it was to the women , and how very much enjoyment the more mischievous wedded ones among them got by pretending that they were maidens , heart-whole and free of fancy ! But while those women were in the thick of this pleasure , they each signed a formal claim to a homesteader 's rights in the lands thereabout . And as they " prove up " those claims in the fulness of time , each will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land will then be made over to the ingenious inventors and backers of the scheme , and the land will be theirs . " Thus , " in the language of a picturesque son of Montana , . a fellow can get a dukedom if he wants it . " This is an absolutely true account of the conquest of a valley in Montana , and the future historian of our country will find much else that is akin to it , and that will make an interesting chapter in his records . // Governor Toole , in his message for 1891 , abandons all hope of Federal supervision of this potentiality of wealth , and concludes his remarks with the statement that he assumes it to be the province of the Legislature to provide " against excessive and extortionate charges by individuals and companies engaged in the sale , rental , or distribution of water , and to prevent unjust discrimination in the disposal of the same to the public . " He thinks the right of the State to regulate this matter should be asserted and maintained . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintain the ditches , nor does he touch upon the next best alternative -- of insisting that the farmers who own the land shall inherit the water plants after a fixed term of years . But in considering Montana as it is , the main point is that there are thousands of ditches laid , and to-day a bird's-eye view of the State reveals valley after valley lying ready for the settler , like so many well-ordered parlors awaiting their guests . These parklike grassy bowls needed only the utilization of the water that is in or close to each one . There they lie , under sunny skies , carpeted with grass , bordered by rounding hills* rid of Indians , and all but empty of dangerous animals , waiting for the hodgepodge of new Americanism , to be made up of Swedes and Hollanders , Germans , Englishmen , . and whoever else may happen along . What the State particularly needs is men of the Teutonic races , whose blood will not be stirred by the El Dorado-like traditions of vast and sudden wealth made in mining . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands as by a cyclone at the first news that a new " lead " of gold or a new deposit of sapphires has been found in the mountains . Of such inflammable material , sent there in search of gold , and prone not to surrender the hope of finding more of it , has the State thus far been made up . The change is finder way ; the new people of a new and greater Pennsylvania are coming in , as we shall see . Five years from this , the politicians of Montana will be kowtowing to the farmer vote . The northeastern corner of Montana is all Dawson County  --  a tract as big as Maryland , Vermont , and Connecticut . It is all high rolling plains land , now in use for stock-raising . It is well watered by tributaries of the Missouri , and abounds with little valleys , which will yet be very profitably farmed . Custer County , which takes up the remainder of the eastern end of Montana , is the same sort of land , and is a stock-raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming element . It surprised the people of the State by the exhibit sent from therc to the State fair last August . Wheat , oats , tomatoes , cabbages , potatoes , pumpkins , and squashes were in the yield , which was wellnigh complete , and of a high quality and size . All the lands that are watered are taken up , and this is true of the greater part of the State . The bench lands form the bulk of what remains . It has been demonstrated that they are very productive if water can be got to them , and since the streams are tapped on the mountain slopes , it is certain that they will , to a large extent , be irrigated . Choteau County , in the north , and the next one west of Dawson , is a little empire in itself . It is slightly larger than Massachusetts , Connecticut , and New Hampshire . It is 100 miles wide and 225 miles long , and , to borrow a Western expression , the entire population of the Northwest could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Dawson County in charactera high rolling plateau given over to cattle , sheep , and the growing of the hardier grains . Rich " finds " of magnetic and hematite iron are reported from there . Park County is a very mountainous , crumpled-up , and rocky area , and is the northern extension and neighbor of the Yellowstone National Park . Sheep and cattle raising and mining are its principal industries , and , on account of the wonderful mining " finds " that have recently been made there , the little county is knocking at the doors of Congress for a favor . Cook City , down on the southern edge of the county , is the beginning of a wonderful mining camp-that is to say , it is wonderful in the amount of ore there that could be profitably worked if coke and coal and transportation facilities could be had at reasonable cost . But , apparently , the only practicable route to the camp is through a corner of the National Park , and the miners are asking Congress to allow the rails to be laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mines are principally in the hands of the discoverers , and since a prospector is usually the // poorest man in the world , they can not afford to spend much to make their needs known to the public . The prospector , the reader should understand , is the indefatigable Wandering Jew of the mountains , who prowls about amid every sort of danger , hammer in hand , and dining on hope more often than food , and who , after discovering a " lead , " gives , an interest in it to capital , and then is very fortunate if he is not frozen out . The metals that have been found in Park County are silver and lead . There is very little gold , but coal has long been very profitably mined at several points in the county . Gallatin County , next to the westward of Park , is a mountainous and mineral region also , but it contains the Gallatin Valley , which , to the agriculturist , is just now one of the most interesting districts in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the State -- at least the snow lies there longer than anywhere else . The result of the moisture , in conjunction with the character of the soil , is that the valley is one of the richest grain-producing regions in the State . For years barley has been raised there for the use of the brewers of Montana . When some samples of this Gallatin Valley barley reached NewYork , the brewers there refused to believe that any such barley was or could be grown anywhere in the world . They thought that what was shown to them was a lot of carefully selected samples . They deputized a committee to visit the valley , and found that the barley which had so astonished them was the common barley of the country . The grain is very clear , almost to the point of being translucent , and is in color a golden yellow . The brewers declare that no better grain for their use is grown in the world . They have organized a company , taken the water right , bought various tracts of land , amounting to 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley the great malting centre of the continent , if not of the world . They have put up malting-houses at two points , have established some twenty miles of irrigating ditches already , and by furnishing the seed and buying the yields are encouraging the farmers of the valley to grow barley . They cultivated 2500 bushels in 1890 , and raised sixty bushels to the acre . Last year they had 10,000 acres under cultivation . They expect in a few years to be selling barley to all the brewers of the country who value what the New-Yorkers think is the best grain obtainable . This is the nearest approach to what is called bonanza or big-scale farming in the State of Montana . All that central district of the State , including Meagher and Fergus counties , and more besides , has been slow in the development of its mining resources . Mines have been held for years since they were discovered , because it has been hard to make capitalists and railroad men see what was in the country . It is almost always the case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich finds is published every day , and capitalists hear the tales of prospectors with fatigued and half-closed ears . But now two routes have been surveyed into Meagher County by the Northern Pacific Company , and the Great Northern and Burlington and Missouri roads are expected to go in . All will head for Castle , the great mining camp of the country , where two smelteries are already turning out lead and silver , and freighting bullion 150 miles to the nearest railway . Thus we reach the county of which Great Falls is the seat of government and of many interesting industries and operations . This is Cascade County . It is here that the noted and majestic falls of the Missouri occur in a succession of splendid cascades . Here a company , controlled by wealthy men of New York , Helena , and Great Falls , have taken up something like twelve miles on either side of the river at these falls , and have thus possessed themselves of what is undoubtedly the finest and greatest waterpower in the West , comprising in all at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niagara . An auxiliary company owns a large town site there , and a very promising and considerable town has already grown up to handle the wheat and wool and beef of the region , and to be already the site of smelting-works , factories , and other establishments which have been attracted by the cheap and abundant water-power . In the shrewdness and reasonableness of the management of Great Falls lie much of the hope for its future . The town has never been " boomed . " It is planned with broad avenues and streets , and even now contains several blocks of really notable stone and brick buildings along its main // street . It has a fine opera-house , club , hotel , and strong banks . Its population is above 7000 . This Cascade County is a very new part of Montana . A small proportion of the land is all that is yet taken , but experiments with this have led the people there to believe that there is no richer land in the State . Thus far the settlers are chiefly Americans . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is seen that as civilization pushes into it , the cattle business is being hurt . The difficulty in obtaining cowboy assistance is noticeable wherever farms and well-governed towns spring up , and this difficulty is increasing in this region . The cowboy and civilization are neighbors , but not friends . But it is a good grass country , and the grass is vastly better than that in Dakota , which becomes frozen and loses its nutriment . Here the Chinook winds from the Pacific come in at all times in the winter , never failing to blow upon all except twenty or twenty-five days in each winter . They clear off the snow like magic . Twelve thousand cattle were shipped from Great Falls during 1891 . But the wool business exceeded that . From the same point last year nearly three millions of pounds of wool - more than were sent from any other point in the United States - were shipped from the backs of the sheep . Because of the rich soil and good grass , very little sand blo T5 about to load down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case everywhere within 150 to 200 miles of the east slope of the Rockies . Sheep in this country have none of the destructive diseases which assail them elsewhere . The sheep and wool industries are going to be enormous in Montana on that account , whether the herding be upon the ranges , as at present , or in small herds managed by farmers , and raised upon the benches and side-hills that will not be brought under the ditch . But in view of the future of the State , the experiments in agriculture are even more interesting than the harnessing of the cascades of the Missouri to the wheels of manufacture . The sugar - beet grows finely , in answer to the generally discussed project in most of these new States to render that form of sugar-making a leading industry when the lands are well settled . Fine , luscious strawberries grow right out on the plains wherever they have been planted , and one man on Belt Creek sold $170 worth of currants , raspberries , and strawberries from one acre of ground last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rains to bleach or " must ' * it when it is ripening . Wheat that is graded " No. 1 Northern " in Minneapolis grows thirty to fifty bushels to the acre . There is an orchard there already , producing fine apples ; and here we get the first news of the astonishing potatoes of Montana  --  " the terrapin of the State , " as they have been wittily called . There are no such potatoes in the world as are grown in Montana . They attain prodigious size , and often weigh three , four , or five pounds apiece . Eighteen such potatoes make a bushel . To the taste they are like a new vegetable . The larger ones are mealy , but the smaller ones are like sacks of meal ; when the skin is broken the meat falls out like flour . It must very soon become the pride of every steward in the first-grade hotels , restaurants , and clubs of the cities here-  --  and even in Europe  --  to prepare these most delicious vegetables for those who enjoy good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cultivated in all the valleys east of the Rocky Mountains , there will soon be no lack of them . To-day the only ones that have left the State have been the few bushels sent to gourmets in New York , Washington , and San Francisco . All this country east of the mountains must be irrigated to insure good crops . An early and general development of the farm lands is relied upon , because the great mining camps of the State will consume nearly all the products of the farms as fast as the farms increase in number . There is no danger that the mining camps will not grow and multiply to keep the demand strong . The miners are the best people in the world to farm for , because they produce money and they pay cash . The southern end of Lewis and Clarke County is a succession of fine valleys . Here is Helena , the capital of the State . Six miles away a cluster of gold mines is being reopened , after having produced millions . In this county the largest mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid dividends for many years . And here are the famous ruby and sapphire fields , on the bed-rock of former benches or bottoms of the Missouri . Strawberries of a // large and luscious variety will yield 10,000 baskets to the acre , and have sold in the past at a fixed rate of twenty cents a basket for home consumption . Apples , plu ins , crab-apples , grapes , currants , and all berries grow in wonderful abundance , and find an eager and high-priced market close at hand . Oats weigh forty and fifty pounds a bushel , as against thirty-two pounds in the East , and a yield of sixty bushels to the acre can be obtained . All wheat that is brought out here for seeding produces a soft grain . It has been sent to Minneapolis to be ground into flour for pastry and cracker bakers . The Cracker Trust is building a big bakery in Helena , to be near this product . It is not a bread-making grain . But a new population is needed to reap the wealth that is offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but they do not meet the home demand . It is a rich country , and will some day dry and can large crops of fruits and berries . The side-hills will graze small bands of cattle . If the bunchgrass sod is ploughed up , there follows a growth of blue-joint grass that is like timothy , and that is very high , heavy , and nutritious . The same result follows irrigation wherever it is permitted . Jefferson , Madison , Silver Bow , Beaver Head , and Deer Lodge counties , in the mountains , are all very nearly like what has just been described . Mining is the principal source of revenue , and wheat , oats , potatoes , and stock are the other products . West of the Rockies is quite a different country . It is all practically in Missoula County . The mountains are full of minerals ; the valleys will produce anything , apparently , that grows in the temperate zone - even corn . Irrigation is not so absolutely necessary , and is not necessary at all in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rains are heavier ; the winds from the Japan current blow there with frequency and strength , and are almost uninterrupted . Verdure remains green there all summer , and the abundance of timber , the many streams , and the verdant hills render the scenery more like what the Eastern man is accustomed to than that which he sees east of the Rockies in Montana . The southern part of Missoula County has been settled many years , largely by thrifty French Canadians , and it contains as fine farms as VOL . LXXXV. - No. 505-11 will be seen almost anywhere . Here are orchards , and small fruits grow in abundance for shipment to the Cocur d'Alene mining camps in Idaho . Here is a milling company that produced seventy-five millions of feet of lumber last year . In the north is a new country wrested from the Flathead reservation . The Flathead Valley is forty miles long and one-half as wide , possessing a deep soil and a clay subsoil . It is farmed without irrigation . Several tributary valleys of the same quality open out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetables , and fruit have been harvested there , but the farmers have heretofore been without a market , and have subsisted by raising horses and cattle , and driving them abroad for purchasers . The entrance of the Great Northern Railroad , now accomplished , will open up this rich territory , and will develop the timber resources as well as the deposits of coal , oil , and natural gas , which seem to be very extensive there . The mountains are practically unprospected , and have only just been mapped by Lieutenant Ahern , U.S.A. , who has philanthropically devoted his summers to that arduous and dangerous work . Indications of quartz are seen on every hand in the mountains . Taking the county as a whole , two years ago not a mining prospect was continuously worked , while now four mines are shipping and paying profits of $40,000 a month . *The " leads " in the county are continuations of those in the Cceur d'Alene country in Idaho . Coal as good as the Lethbridge product of Canada is found there in vast quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake , which has 318 square miles of surface , is cold and clear , and so deep that it has been sounded to a depth of 1000 feet . It is full of landlocked salmon and big trout , and harbors millions of ducks and geese in their season , while deer and winged game are plenty in the country around it . The Flathead Indians , south of the lake , have nice farms , and raise cattle besides . They are self-sustaining , and at least a dozen can be named who have accumulated between $20,000 and $50,000 . They are a fine , stalwart people . They are not in reality Flatheads ; they have no knowledge that the tribe ever followed the practice of compressing the heads of the children , as was done by the tribes at the mouth of the Columbia River . // It is in this county that Marcus Daly , the mining millionaire , has invested a million dollars in horses and land , and maintains a horse farm that ranks next to Senator Stanford 's Palo Alto farm in California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has 1000 acres of land , and is raising imported Percheron horses and Holstein cattle . Other farmers are in the same business . It is an enormous county , and is so well populated that its people cast 4000 votes at elections . With its ore , timber , horses , cattle , coal , petroleum , grain , and diversified small crops , it is unquestionably the finest county in the State . It would be the richest were it not for Silver Bow , with its one industry of mining . There is plenty of coal in Montana . It crops out in all the northern counties and in several of the southern ones . It is most profitably worked when the owner is interested in the railroad which carries it from the mines . In all probability , the best coal is found in the Sand Coulee fields , in Cascade County . The Rocky Fork mines , in Custer County , are part of a vast deposit Which has all been secured by Eastern capitalists . One hundred coke ovens near Livingston , in Park County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also in Park County are the Timber Line and Horr mines . The coal of the State is semi-bituminous . Only a mere speck *f what the State contains is being mined . We have seen that cattle-raising is a conspicuous industry-if industry it can be called  --  and is carried on in , I think , every county of the State . Large cattle herds are already things of the past in the western end of the State , and it is evident that farming and settlement will soon drive them out of Gallatin and Cascade counties . It is cause for jubilation that this is the case . It seems strange that cruelty should distinguish this branch of food-raising wherever it is seen and in whatever branch one studies it . From the bloody fields of Texas , where the ingenious fiends in the cattle business snip off the horns of the animals below the quick , to the stock - yards in Chicago , where men are found who will prod the beeves into pens , there to crush their skulls with hammers , it is everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and savagery . The reader would not suppose there was cruelty in the mere feeding of cattle on the plains , but let him go to Montana , and talk with the people there , and lie will shudder at what he hears . The cattle-owners , or cow-men , are in Wall Street and the south of France , or in Florida , in the winter , but their cattle are on the wintry fields , where every now and then , say once in four years , half of them , or eighty per cent. , or one in three ( as it happens ) starve to death because of their inability to get at the grass under the snow . A horse or a mule can dig down to the grass . Those animals have a joint in their legs which the horned cattle do not possess , and which enables those animals which possess it to " paw . " Sheep are taken to especial winter grounds and watched over . But the cow-men do business on the principle that the gains in good years far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the bad years come , the poor beasts die by the thousands-totter along until they fall down , the living always trying to reach the body of a dead one to fall upon , and then they freeze to death , a fate that never befalls a steer or cow when it can get food . Already , on some of the ranges , the " cow-men** ( cattle-owners ) are growing tired of relying upon Providence to superintend their business , and they are sending men to look after the herds once a mouth , and to pick out the calves and weaker cattle and drive them to where hay is stored . By spring-time one in every fifteen or twenty in large herds will have been cared for in this way . In far eastern Montana range-feeding in large herds will long continue , but in at least fivesevenths of the State , irrigation and the cultivation of the soil will soon end it . The hills and upper benches , all covered with self-curing bunch grass , will still remain , and will forever be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly attended and provided with corrals and hay , against the times when the beasts must be fed . The farmers will undoubtedly go into cattle-raising , and dairy-farming is certain to be a great item in the State 's resources , since the hills are beside every future farm , and the most provision that will be needed will be that of a little hay for stocking the inter corrals . Last year the cattle business in Montana was worth ten millions // of dollars to the owners of the herds . " Providence was on deck , " as the cowboys would say . But the sheep there brought twelve millions of pounds of wool on their backs in the same year . They are banded in herds of about 2000 head , and each band is in charge of one solitary , lonely , forsaken herder , who will surprise his employers if he remains a sane man any great length of time . In the summer these herders sleep in tents , and the ranch foremea start out with fresh provisions at infrequent intervals , and hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Winter the grazing is done in sheltered places especially chosen . On the winter grounds a corral is built , and thirty to forty tons of hay are stored there for emergencies when the snow lies thick on the ground . It is a prime country for sheep . They get heavy coats , and are subject to no epidemic diseases . The grass is rich and plenty , and the warm Pacific winds soon melt what snows occasionally cover the ground . The wool ranks next to that from Australia . The tendency of the sheep-herders to become insane is the most unpleasant accompaniment of the business , except the various forms of mutilation of the sheep for business reasons . The constant bleating of the sheep and the herder 's loneliness , spending weeks and months without any companionship except that of a dog and the herd , are the causes that are commonly accepted to account for the fact that so many herders go insane . Since I found insanity terribly common among the pioneers on the plains in Canada , where no sheep were raised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the calculation , and to call it loneliness  --  and yet , in my opinion , that is not the sole reason . The horse market has been very poor for some time , and mules are being raised for the market with better results . The substitution of electric for horse power on street railways has lessened the demand for horses , and so has the use of steam farming implements . There has been an over-supply of horses as well . But the Montana men find horses a good investment . It costs nothing to raise them , and all breeds seem to improve there . They get great lung development , and acquire no diseases . When they can not be sold for from $50 to $100 apiece , the owners keep them until they do fetch those prices . The great wealth of the State is in its mines . Butte , in Silver Bow County , is the greatest mining centre not only in Montana , but , with the possible and doubtful exception of one town in Australia , in all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and copper . The total dividends paid by all the mines in the United States which make public their affairs was $16,024,842 , and of that sum Montana 's mines paid one-quarter , or $4,059 ,  - -  700 . That amount was paid in 1891 , up to the end of November . Yet the richest mines are owned by private corporations which do not make known their profits . The Granite Mountain mine , in Deer Lodge County , yielding silver , lead , and some little gold , paid its owners , who are mainly in St. Louis , $1,300,000 in the same eleven months , and has sent to St. Louis about ten millions in dividends since it began to pay . Eight years ago the stock in that mine was held at 25 cents a share , and men played pool for it in Helena and Butte . Butte first attracted the miners in 1864 . They did nothing except wash dirt for five years , but they washed out eight millions of dollars . Then they found the quartz , and went down on it , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they went down further , they came upon the copper , and started a " boom " that shows no sign of diminution at this date . Butte has added to the world 's wealth $140,000,000 in gold , silver , copper , and lead . The largest producers are the Anaconda , Boston and Montana , Colorado and Montana , Butte and Boston , Parrott , Lexington , Alice , Butte Reduction Works , Moulton , and Blue Bird . Those companies operate forty mines , and all have their own works for the reduction of ores . They are all high-grade ores , but some are high-grade in copper and some in silver . The Anaconda people , for instance , get enough silver and gold to render their vast output of copper all profit . As their capacity in copper is the greatest in the world , and as it does not cost them a cent a ton , they control the copper market of the earth . The principal owners of this property are the estate of Senator Hearst , J. B. Haggin , and Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East as the foremost patron of the turf , came to Montana first on his feet , and worked at washing with a pan . That was less than twenty years ago , and now he is called " The White Czar " in // Montana . He is an influential and shrewd politician , the owner of the second largest horse - breeding farm in the world , the greatest employer of labor in Montana , maintains a metropolitan hotel in a little town in the mountains , disregarding the loss it incurs in order that he may have a place in which to entertain his friends , and finally he maintains a first-class newspaper in the same town or village of Anaconda-a newspaper as good as is published in any city of the second class . The town of Anaconda is where the company reduces its ores . The profits of the company are never made public . The camp next in importance after Butte is Castle , in Meagher County , sixty miles from a railroad . Barker and Neihart are camps in the same county . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Castle district is the Cumberland , which is known to be a heavy shipper of bullion , but is a close corporation . The mines in the district and in the county need railroads to open them up . Jefferson County is next to Silver Bow in richness , but though it has more paying mines than any other county in the State , the mining is all on a small scale . The Holder Mine , owned in England , is in this county . It paid $400,000 in 1891 . There are about thirty districts in Lewis and Clarke County , as against seventy in Jefferson . The richest of the thirty is Unionville , five miles from Helena . The ore is free milling gold . The Whitlatch Union Company has produced $20,000,000 there . As I have said elsewhere , Deer Lodge , Madison , Beaver Head , and Missoula counties are rich in mine " prospects , " but the need of railroads in all except Missoula County hinders work there . The future in mining is not yet in sight in Montana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed mining district in the State there are ten that are not developed , and that promise as well as any that are now being operated . Moreover , vast reaches of the mountain country have not even been explored . Of copper Montana produced 50,000 tons in 1890 ; of gold , $3,500 , 000 ; of silver , $19,350,000 . A few of the many stories that are told of miners ' luck will enable the reader to understand how and why the heads of whole communities may be turned in mining regions . Jim Whitlatch , the dis coverer of the Whitlatch-Union mine , near Helena , led a typical Western miner*s life . The mine in question is now owned in England , and has produced $20 , 000 ,  - -  000 in gold . After Jim Whitlatch had sold the property for $1,500,000 he went to New York " to make as much money as Vanderbilt . " He was a rare treat to Wall Street , which fattened on him , and in one year let him go with only the clothes on his back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and discovered a mine for which he got $250 ,  - -  000 . He went to Chicago to rival Mr. Potter Palmer in wealth , and returned just as he did from New York- " flatstrapped , " as he would have expressed it . He made still another fortune , and went to San Francisco , where he died a poor man . Another Lewis and Clarke County mine  --  the Drum Lummon-provides another such story . It was discovered by an Irish immigrant named Thomas Cruse . Although he owned it , he could not get a sack of flour on credit . He sold it to an English syndicate for $1,500,000 . But he remains one of the wealthy men of Helena . There is an ex-State Senator in Beaver Head County who owns a very rich mine , the ore yielding $700 to the ton net . He is a California " Forty-niner , " who came as a prospector to Montana , and since discovering his mine has lived upon it in a peculiar way . He has no faith in banks . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent what money he has , he takes out a wagon-load of ore , ships it to Omaha , sells it , and lives on the return until he needs another wagon-load . There is a queer story concerning the Spotted Horse Mine , in Fergus County . It was found by P. A. MeAdow , who sold it to Governor Hauser and A. M. Holder for $500,000 three year ago . They paid a large sum down in cash , and the other payments were to come out of the ground . The ore was in pockets , each of which was easily exhausted . Whatever was taken out went to MeAdow , who got about $100,000 . Then the purchasers abandoned it , on the advice of experts , and Mr. MeAdow took hold of it . He found the vein , over which rails had been laid for a mining car . He has taken out $500,000 , and it is still a good mine . One of these children of luck came to Helena with money , picked out a wife , who was then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town to the wedding . The amount of champagne that flowed at that wedding was fabulous , and it is said that the whole town reeled to bed that night . Butte is the principal seat of the mining work . It is what they call in Montana " a wide-open town , " and he who thinks he knows the United States because he can name the buildings which face the City Hall Park in New York would open his eyes and confess his astonishment were he to visit Butte . The old California mining spirit , the savor of the flush times of 49 , was transplanted to the Treasure State during the war of the rebellion , and it still leaves strong traces everywhere in Montana . The smallest coin in circulation there is the nickel , or fivecent piece , but the shilling or " bit " is the unit of calculation . Shoeblacks and barbers charge two bits for their work ; a drink at a bar costs a bit , and drinks go in pairs at two bits . Whoever wants a postage-stamp will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or will have the stamp given to him . Domestic servants are paid no less than $25 a month ; waiterboys in the hotels get $10 a week and their keep ; the lowest wages paid to labor are paid to street-sweepers , and they receive $2 50 a day . This is all an inheritance from California and the precedents set in Virginia City , Nevada , long ago . The little one-story and two-story square cottages that dot the suburbs of each city are of a type otherwise peculiar to the Pacific coast  --  a type that is seen at its best in San Francisco , San Jos6 , and Oakland . The disproportionate size of the vicious quarters in each Montana city , and the fashions in these quarters , are inheritances from the era of the California gold fever . The outcast women , who were originally the only women in each camp , have a ward or district to themselves , and there the variety theatre ( which is descended from the original Bella Union ) and the " hurdy-gurdy houses , " or dance halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have streets to themselves in Butte , Helena , Great Falls-and , for that matter , in Seattle also-just as they do in San Francisco . And , as is the case in California , each house in such a quarter is a one-room or two-room shanty , harboring one occupant . For the true women and the children of each city that end of town is taboo . Butte has more than 30,000 inhabitants , and 5000 of its men work in the mines to produce a mineral output which is within five millions of dollars of the value of the total yield of Colorado . The laborers who repair the streets get $3 50 a day , and the miners earn from $4 to $7 . When the shifts or gangs of men change at night - for the work never ceases - the main street of Butte is as crowded as Broadway at Fulton Street at noon . At two or three o'clock in the morning the city is still lively . There is no pretence about the town . It has few notable or expensive buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Butte are the only considerable towns I saw out West of which that could be said . It gives the reader a hint of the " beginnings " of Butte to be told that the site of the best brick and granite building on the main street was won by a man who happened to hold only two " Jacks " at the time he was " called . " There are sixteen licensed gambling hells in Butte , and the largest ones are almost side by side on the principal street . They are as busy as so many exchanges . They are large , bare rooms , with lay-outs for faro , craps , stud poker , and other games on tables at every few feet along the walls , each table faced by a knot of men , and backed by a " dealer " and " watcher . " The gambling hells keep open all the time except from Saturday midnight to Sunday midnight . In summer the doors stand open , and the gambling may be seen from the pavement . The liquor stores never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the concert halls . Montana has a saloon to every eighty inhabitants . It has more saloons than Alabama , Georgia , Kansas , and Indian Territory , Maine , Mississippi , South Carolina , West Virginia , Vermont , or the District of Columbia . " One thing I have noticed , " said a liquor-dealer of Butte , " is that if a man quits drinking here , he will be dead in a month . " This peculiarly businesslike observation veiled a reference to the sulphur fumes , which are the consequence of the presence of many smelteries . The city is at the bottom of a well , the walls of which are tall mountains . High up above the town , around one side of the well , are these smelteries , whose pipes emit smoke and sulphur . In addition to this , they were " heap-roasting " the ore in the open air when I was // there , and the sulphur weighted and jaundiced the atmosphere . The people rose in anger and stopped the nuisance . There are fine schools there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 souls , and is the largest west of the Mississippi . Butte is the only Montana town that maintains a club of university graduates . Its other club , the Silver Bow , is one of whose club-house appointments and membership any city might be proud . The people there maintain such elevating societies and chapters as those of the Epworth League , th' Women 's Christian Temperance Union , the King 's Daughters , and the Society of Christian Endeavor . There is a cricket club there , and a rod-and-gun club , and a strong Turnverein , or German athletic society . They have some notable displays in those stores which are the head depots of great trading companies that operate far and wide . Whatever is best in London , Paris , or New York can be duplicated in Butte , and it is said that when strawberries are a dollar a basket in New York , this strange city is one of the purchasers of them . Butte has six banks , with a capital of a million dollars , and a million of dollars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to make room for that which should be told of the cities of Montana generally . It is my opinion that Butte will grow steadily as long as the present mines pay and new ones continue to be developed . It will be a large city , judging from present appearances . Great Falls should , in the logic of its merits , become an important city . Miles City can not be threatened by any changes in its vicinage except such as will cause it to grow . Missoula will in all likelihood be the capital of a great and rich farming district , and perhaps of a mining section as well . The Great Northern Railway , now completing its highway through the northern counties , must develop at least one sizable town on either side of the Rockies , but the names of those towns are not in my ken . There are going to be many more inhabitants in the State than there are in Pennsylvania-possibly twice as many  --  and they will build cities . Though Helena is the capital , it must still fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet having been chosen . But it seems almost a foregone conclusion that Helena will re main as it is , for as Butte is the industrial centre , so Helena is the social and financial headquarters . It has most of the concomitants of a chief city-all , in fact , except a first-class theatre . It is commonly credited with being the wealthiest city of its size in the world , and it does boast more than a dozen citizens each worth more than a million of dollars . But it gains that reputation most creditably as the backer of the principal enterprises in the State . In its best residence quarters are many fine and costly houses , and the people in them know the luxuries and refinements of cultivation and wisely managed wealth . Helena has three daily newspapers , which receive the despatches of the chief news associations of the country . A very commendable spirit in Montana finds expression in a State historical society , whose already imposing collections are housed in one of the public buildings in Helena . President Stuart and Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs , and biographies of the pioneers , are performing a work which will swell in value faster than compound interest enhances the value *f money . All the principal religious bodies are well represented in Helena in church buildings and membership ; the schools and other public buildings are the subjects of popular pride ; the stores are fine and well stocked . The Montana Club , now building a palatial stone club-house , is very much more like an Eastern than a Western club in all that makes a club attractive . There are other clubsScotch , German , literary , musical , mercantile , and athletic ; there are military organizations and the lodges of half a dozen secret fraternities , and there is a State Fair Association which maintains a fine race - track . ' Helena has many manufactures , and eight banks , with a joint capital of two and one - third millions of dollars . Already three transcontinental railways meet there  --  the Northern Pacific , Union Pacific , and the Great Northern . Among its hotels , the Helena is a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadwater , in the suburbs , gives to Montana the finest hotel and watering-place in the Northwest . It is the property and venture of Colonel C. A. Broadwater , a pioneer and millionaire , and comprises a park , a hotel of the most modern and // elegant character , and the largest natatorium in the world  --  a bath 300 feet long and 100 feet wide , of natural hot water , medicated and curative , yet as clear as crystal , and without offence to taste or smell . The beautiful Moorish bath-house , with its daily concourse of health and pleasure seekers , its band of music and atmosphere of indolence , is the pleasantest holiday spot in the new States . But , in my opinion , still stronger attractions to Helena are its surroundings and its climate , its 300 bright , sunny , golden days in every year , its crisp , clear , healthful atmosphere , and its picturesque belt of soft , rolling mountain breasts encircling it . Speaking from the stand-point of physical human pleasure , none of the new States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There the air is always tonic , even magnetic . It rains on 65 days in the year , but the sun manages to shine more or less even on those days-which come in April , May , and June . The valleys are 4000 to 6000 feet above sea-level . Upon them the soft warm winds of the Pacific slope blow after they have emptied their moisture upon the mountain ranges of Washington . These winds temper the climate of Montana so that it seems not to belong in the cold belt of our most northerly States . It is nothing like so cold as the Dakotas ; indeed , there are only a few cold days at a time , mainly in January , with little skating or sleighing , and an assurance that the Chinook breezes are always close at hand . Montana is a sanitarium . No account can be given of the attractions of the State without putting the climate high in the list . It has a magic power to breed enthusiastic love in the hearts of all who live there , even if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inhabitants all went there to make money , and now they remain to praise the country . A spell , a mania , seizes all alike , and each vies with the other in overestimating the vast number of ox teams that would be required to pull him back whence he came . Close to Helena , on ledges which mark two former levels of the Missouri River , are the world-famous sapphire and ruby beds , 8000 acres of which , with 2000 other acres under water , have recently been acquired by an English company of noblemen , bankers , jewellers , and others for $2,000,000 , the mere value of the gold which it is thought will be taken from the dirt . That sapphires and rubies were there has been known for twenty years or more some miners having kept the finer specimens , and others having thrown them out of their pans into the river by the hundredweight as pebbles of no value . The truth , as I get it from experts , is that these stones are true rubies and sapphires , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that very nearly all of them are much lighter in color than the Asiatic gems of the same sort . In other words , pigeon 's - blood rubies and sapphire - blue sapphires are found there , but not often . And yet these stones of the lighter shades are of far greater brilliancy than the Asiatic gems that fashion has approved ; indeed , they are often like diamonds , and as their hardness is next to that of the diamond , their lustre must prove enduring . The gems are found on the bedrock under eight or ten feet of soil , along with crystals , nuggets of gold , gold-dust , garnets , and pebbles . The land was bought by two Michigan lumbermen , brothers , who now treasure a million in cash and a million in shares of the new English company-rewards for their foresight . One of the English experts who examined the gem fields announced it to be his opinion that the diamond must sooner or later be found in Montana . All the conditions warrant its existence there . What a State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asbestos , tin , iron , oil , gas , rubies , sapphires , and a possibility of . diamondsall locked up in her ribs and pockets ! I see a vision of Montana in the future , yet in the lifetime of the young men of to-day . I see half a dozen such mining centres as Butte , and they are all noble cities , set with grand buildings , boulevards , and parks . I see at least two great manufacturing towns besides . I see scores of great valleys , and other scores of little ones , all gay with the blossoms of fruits and grain , supporting a great army of prosperous farmers . I see tens of thousands of rills of water embroidering the green valleys , and I dream that the men who need that water to make the earth give up its other treasures are not obliged to pay more than the conduits cost , merely to enrich a set of water lords who seized the streams when no one was there to protest . I see the brown hills and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sheep in small herds . The woollen industry has become a great source of wealth , and Montana has robbed New England of some of her factories . I see in western Montana great saw-mills and mines that were not dreamt of in 1892 . I see car-loads of fruit and vegetables and barley malt rolling into the cities , and out to other States . I see no Indians except those who work or who serve in the army , and where there were reservations I see the soil laughing with verdure or tracked with cattle . I see statisticians calculating the value of the annual product of the State ; the figures are too stupendous for repetition here . Montana is fulfilling her destiny . She is one of the most populous and opulent members of our sisterhood of States .
