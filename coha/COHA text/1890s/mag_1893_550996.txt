By David B. Frankenlurger . ADISON , the capital of the state of Wisconsin , is situated about forty miles from the southern boundary of the state , and midway between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi river . The region round about is known as the Four Lake Country ; so named from four lakes that like great pearls have been strung on the Yahara river . The largest of these lakes , Fourth lake , known commonly by its Indian name of Mendota , is about six miles long from east to west , and four miles wide . The shore line is irregular ; it rises into bluffs and forest-covered hills , or slopes gradually away from the water 's edge into beautiful farms and meadows . About three-fourths of a mile from the eastern shore of Mendota lies Third lake . It is three miles long from north to south , and has an average width of one and a half miles . The Indian , with a true poetic sense , called the lake Monona , or Fairy lake ; and no one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at play , or seen it shimmering in the moonlight , ever thought it misnamed . On the strip of land between these two lakes , and westward along the southern shore of Mendota , is situated Wisconsin* s capital city . In 1829 , Jefferson Davis , with a file of soldiers , while on a march from the Portage of the Wisconsin and Fox rivers to the village of Chicago , halted at the point where Madison now stands . He claimed to be the first white man who ever looked upon the Four Lake Country . As early as 1835 this spot , while yet in the centre of a wilderness , was chosen as the proper site for the capital of the new territory . Its picturesque beauty has always been recognized . Horace Greeley said , " Madison has the most magnificent site of any inland town I ever saw . " Longfellow sang : " Four limpid lakes - four Naiades Or sylvan deities are these , In flowing robes of azure dressed ; Four lovely handmaids , that uphold Their shining mirrors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vest . By day the coursers of the sun Drink of these waters as they run Their swift diurnal rounds on high ; By night the constellations glow Far down the hollow deeps below , And glimmer in another sky . Fair lakes , serene and full of light ; Fair town , arrayed in robes of white , - Ilow visionary ye appear ! All like a floating landscape seems In cloudland or the land of dreams , Bathed in a golden atmosphere ! " What could Madison do but modestly " blush at the praise of her own loveliness " ? Unfortunately , she came to believe that " beauty unadorned is adorned the most , " forgetting that both cities and civilizations are governed by a different law . Only within the past two or three years has she really added anything to her original endowment of beauty . But now the spirit of improvement is abroad . With excellent gas and water , with electric light and electric railway have come macadamized streets , mile upon mile . The rage for good roads has so possessed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will before long be made hard and smooth far beyond the city limits . A beautiful pleasure drive some ten or twelve miles long has just been opened . It passes through the university grounds and westward close by the southern shore of Lake Mendota , and returns along a high ridge or line of hills parallel with the lake shore , and some two or three miles distaut , furnishing a series of views of lakes and forests and undulating farm-lands that can scarcely be surpassed . The city is built mainly on and about two hills . One of these , midway between lakes Monona and Mendota , is crowned // by the State Capitol , and the other , on the southern shore of Mendota , by the State University buildings . Some smaller hills render the site undulating , to put it mildly ; the cyclist insists that it is abominably hilly , but the true Madisonian thinks it just hilly enough to be picturesque . Here at this political and educational centre are some sixteen thousand people . As early as 1835 , at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating the " University of the Territory of Wisconsin . A board of visitors was appointed by the legislature , and the territorial delegate in the national Congress was instructed to ask of the general government , as an endowment for the said university , seventy-two sections of land . The request of the delegate was granted , and in 1838 the Secretary of the Treasury was instructed to set apart two full townships for the support of a university , and for no other use or purpose whatsoever . These lands might be selected in seventy-two parcels , each containing one section , and not in two full townships in a single parcel , as had been the rule in former appropriations to other territories or states for a similar purpose . Thus the territory might select for its university the choicest of the unappropriated lands . This was the beginning of the Wisconsin State University . But no buildings began to rise ; no faculty was yet chosen . The whole territory was one great wilderness ; and a higher institution of learning must have seemed to the hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visitors , or regents , as they were called later , had indeed no duties , but they enjoy the distinction of being the only governing board of the University that has not had more or less adverse criticism . The new grant of land was not placed under their control ; they had no moneys to expend ; and yet they performed a great service to education , they kept the idea of a university , a higher institution of learning managed and controlled by the state , before the people . In 1840 , commissioners were appointed by the territorial governor to locate a portion of these lands , not exceeding two-thirds , thus granted for the support of a university ; and by the time the territory became a state the entire 46,080 acres had been located . When the territory became a state , in 1848 , the new constitution provided that the grant of land made in 1838 should be the basis for the support of a State University . The lands were at once appraised ; and although the commissioners were sworn to appraise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands to immigrants and thus build up the material prosperity of the commonwealth was so great that the rights of the univ*rsity that was to be were ignored . The same crime had been committed before , and has been committed since in other territories and states . The few friends of the university protested , but to no purpose . The board of regents , created by the new constitution , called the attention of the legislature to this palpable violation of trust : and in 1850 it seemed that a reform was about to be made . The minimum price of the lands , appraised at $2.78 , was fixed at an acre . But the reform , even if attempted in good faith , was not pushed . The clamor of the new settlers for cheap lands to induce immigration prevailed , and the price was lowered , and then lowered again , until the prize was sufficiently alluring to draw the crowding immigrants into the wilderness . The words of the Congressional grant were " for the support of the University and for no other purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands except as trustee , and yet the policy of sacrificing the university lands to promote immigration continued , and became the settled policy of the state . Michigan University mourned because from a similar grant she realized a permanent fund of over half a million dollars , while the Wisconsin University received for her grant only $I5o , ooo . This sum was so manifestly inadequate for the endowment of a university , that in 1854 a second grant of 72 sections was obtained from the general government . But it was the same old story : the lands were carefully selected , but appraised and sold at ridiculously low prices ; and even in // 1862 , when Congress granted to the state by the Agricultural College Act , 240,000 acres of land , the same policy was for a time adhered to . But where was the University , while the state was thus squandering what would by reasonable care have made it wealthy and powerful ? On Jan. r6 , 1849 , the regents began the work of organization . For more than ten years the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no high schools , no academies , how could it have a real existence ? The regents , with great modesty , first organized a pre- . paratory school . This was opened , in i85o , by Professor Jno . XV . Sterling , in a building furnished free of rent by the citizens of Madison . Dr. John H. Lathrop was elected chancellor ,  --  chancellor of a university consisting of a preparatory department . This action , however , was not premature . The president of the University was , by the act of incorporation , ex-o fficio president of the board of regents , and his advice and counsel would be needed at every step in the organization . In the following year the department of Science , Literature and Arts was organized , with Professor Sterling and Chancellor Lathrop as the faculty . Another member was added in 1852 ; but it was not until 1856 that all the chairs in the six departments were provided for . In 1854 , two young men , a sort of first fruits of the institution , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it lacked students , funds , and friends . The board of regents , at their first meeting , besides this work of internal organization , bought fifty acres of land on the edge of the village for $* per acre ; and " College Hill , " as it had long been prophetically called , was declared to be the site of the University . In 1857 , with the permission of the legislature , the regents borrowed $25,000 from the university fund to construct the first college building . This act was without doubt doubly illegal : the grant of the general government was for the support of a university , not to construct buildings ; and the income only , not the principal , was to be used for such support . The foundations for a second building were soon after laid , but this building was not completed until * and then not by money appropriated by the state , but by a second loan of $15 , ooo from the university fund . Two years later another loan of more than $5o , ooo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same fund . No other buildings were constructed until 1870 . XVith nearly $roo , ooo thus taken directly out of the university fund , the already slender income was so reduced that apparatus and additional instruction had to be postponed . The life of the University from its birth until i 866 was one loi*g struggle , not pleasant to think upon . Not only were its lands squandered , and the burden of erecting necessary buildings unjustly and illegally thrown upon it , and its income thus impaired , but from the first the new institution made its way against a hostile public sentiment . The right of the state to provide for higher education was disputed ; the right even to provide for common school instruction was not everywhere conceded . The denominational college was the only type of higher institution with which the people were familiar ; and a purely secular university was accounted by many an impiety , and its success an impossibility . Indifference to the university we may ascribe to the engrossing cares of the material life in new communities , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons to the older eastern institutions with whose walls they were themselves familiar ; but the active opposition that could violate a solemn public trust , and even plot the life of the university , could spring only from surviving medheval conceptions of the relation of the Church and the State to education . It was charged constantly from i85o to i866 that the University did not meet the wants of the people , and that there was mismanagement of the funds by the regents . From the fact that the legislature authorized loans from the university fund for the erection of the buildings , the state came to think that it might do as it pleased with the University and its funds ; and at one time it had so far taken possession that the regents were compelled // to ask the legislature each year formally to appropriate the income of the university fund for the current expenses of the institution . From this usurpation the idea that the University was subsisting In a formal meeting of the regents it was proposed to suspend the institution for one year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While probably three-fourths of the stu PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN . qwq one of the normal schools of the state , but failed ; they tried to give a more practical education . Says Chancellor Lathrop in his report to the board : " In the administration of the department of Science , Literature and the Arts in the University , a more distinct bias should be given to its instructions in the directions of the several arts and avocations as they exist among men ; the practical should take rank of the theoretical in the forms as well as the substance of the University culture . " Not all of the criticism , however , was prejudiced or unjust . Undoubtedly there was a feeling among the people , blind and unreasoning though it was , that the University should minister to the material , practical life of the community ; the stereotyped college course was felt somehow to be inadequate , out of touch with the new learning in science . This feeling was the hint of an ever-broadening conception of education . But it was unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study already too broad for the resources of the University . The University did undoubtedly seem unsuccessful . However promising the graduates of any new institution may be , however good the instruction , the results will at first seem very disproportionate to the effort expended . The people then could not know that among those early graduates there were in embryo great lawyers , judges , senators and cabinet ministers . However impatient we are for the fruitage , it takes time to grow men . The impatient spirit of the people showed itself in frequent reorganizations of the University : like impatient children , they periodically uprooted the young plant to see why it did not grow faster . In 1858 the regents re-organized the course of study somewhat along the lines proposed by the enemies as well as by the friends of the University . When this re-organization was completed , Dr. Lathrop resigned the chancellorship , and was elected to the chair of Ethical and Political Science , but this he also resigned the following year . Dr. Henry Barnard of Hartford , Conn. , widely known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance filled the friends of the University with hope and confidence . But their anticipations were never to be realized , for Dr. Barnard 's health was not good , and he had added to the duties of chancellor those of agent for the normal school board , and it was in the latter capacity that he did his chief work in the state . To the limit of his strength he gave himself to the bettering of the common schools of the state , a work greatly University Hall . // needed to be sure , and directly in line with his previous tastes and experience , while the University saw little of him . After two years he resigned , and Prof. Sterling , the dean of the faculty , was for seven years the executive head of the institution . When the civil war broke out , the young men looked across from College Hill upon Camp Randall , a great drill ground for the new regiments , and they soon found their way into the ranks . Entire classes were in the field ; the annual attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commencement exercises were held . During the period of the war the question was not one of progress , but of keeping the breath of life in the institution . The most rigid economy was demanded . Yet in spite of their poverty the regents in 1863 established a normal department , and seventy-six young women tripped into the University . They were graciously allowed to hear lectures on a J ohs Bascom . EX-PREFIDENT OF THE UNIVER5ITV OF WISCONSIN . few subjects , such as botany , chemistry and English literature , but entrance into the regular work in languages , mathematics , philosophy , etc. , was still denied them . The wise conservatives , however , insisted that the department was a Tro jan horse , and the enemy was already within the gates . In i866 the legislature re-organized the University , re-created it , and established it on enduring foundations . The war had been an educator ; men 's ideas had broadened , and many a soldier hastened from the battle field to the college or university . We had come into touch each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recognition of the value of higher education . The great prosperity of Michigan University , established in 1841 , stimulated our state pride . The sentiment was slowly growing among the people that if the University had really come to stay , it must have an opportunity , and must have money . By the reorganization , the University was to consist of a college of Arts , a college of Letters , and such other colleges as might from time to time be added thereto . The scope of the two colleges established was very broad , and provision was made for almost indefinite expansion without change in the organic law . Now for men and money . The regents tendered the presi Professor William Francis Allen . // dency to Paul A. Chadbourne , formerly a professor in Williams College , and at this time president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College . Dr. Chadbourne visited the state twice , looked the ground over carefully , and then declined the position . The reason was simple . He was not a believer in co-education ; but in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its departments and colleges shall be open alike to male and female students . " The regents went to the next legislature and " The University shall he open to female as well as male students under such regulations as the board of regents may deem proper ; and all ablebodied male students of the University in whatever college shall receive instruction and discipline in military tactics , the requisite arms for which shall be furnished by the State . " The presidency was again offered to Dr. Chadbourne in June , 1867 . He accepted , and the real work of re-organization was begun . Of the old faculty , Prof. Sterling alone was permanently retained . New courses of study were provided , and the University was swung slowly around into its new direction . The long-looked-for day had dawned . Dr. Chadbourne was first of all an orderly man ; not great as a specialist , represented that the carrying out strictly of the provision in regard to co-education would be injurious to the university . The legislature thereupon amended the original section and provided that - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excellent scholarship along many the university fund in 1862 . The change lines .

In the whole act of reorganization , p e rhaps no other single provision was so important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of organizing it as a separate institution . At the time of the re-organization t h e annual income from the university fund was $11,894.20 . This was plainly insufficient for the support of the University , Science Hall . and the legislature in 1867 appropriated to the University annually for ten years the sum of $7 ,  - -  303.67 , being interest on a gross sum of $104,339.42 , that had been taken from hereafter , the University was to move steadily forward . In June , 1871 , Rev. John H. Twombly , Entrance . // of Boston , was chosen president , and held the office for three years . Upon his resignation in 1874 , the regents elected as his successor Dr. John Bascom , of Williams College . For thirteen years Dr. Bascom with great wisdom and ability directed the fortunes of the institution . There went out during those years , from the academic department , * graduates , each one of whom had been mentally and morally quickened by his instruction . He was the Mark Hopkins of the University . The student heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the processes of his thought , the orderly ongoing of a trained intellect , and knew thereafter the difference between thinking and merely seeming to think . He wars an inspirer of men ; instruction in its best sense reached its high tide in his class room . President Bascom was heartily in favor of co-education . The temporizing system adopted in 1867 bad continued with some modifications until his time . During the administration of President Chadbourne , the young men and the young women recited in the same subjects to the same instructors , but at different hours . The president would hear the six or eight young men of the senior class in philosophy , and the next hour would step into an adjoining room and hear about the same number of young women recite the same lesson . The system steadily broke down under the weight of its own absurdity ; and in 1874 the young men and women entered the classes together , - and all the manifold calamities that had been prophesied never came to pass . True , there were some who , persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to co-education , but their utterances were only echoes of the strife that had really ended , and they soon died away . The generosity of the State was shown by increasing from time to time the income of the University , and by liberal appropriations for buildings . The legislature in 1872 , after reciting the mismanagement of the lands of the University by the state in former years , decreed that annually thereafter there should be levied a tax of $ro ,  - -  000 as part of the University income , - a tardy acknowledgment , perhaps , but no less pleasing to the friends of the University . But even better things than this followed . In 1876 the legislature voted to replace the $Io , ooo tax by another tax of one tenth of a mill on a dollar on assessed valuation of the taxable property of the state . This , it was declared in the bill , was to be deemed a Washburn Observatory from University Hall . // full compensation for all deficiencies in the income from the disposition of the lands donated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University . In 1883 it was increased to one eighth of a mill on the dollar , and such increase vias to be used to maintain an Agricultural experiment station and a School of Pharmacy . The appropriations for buildings were not less liberal . The Science department of the University began to take form soon after the reorganization . In 1869 the professor of chemistry cleaned out the cellar of the old Main Hall , where the janitor had from the beginning stored his wood , and established the first laboratory of the University , and the students began to work with things instead of abstractions . The department went from this basement and the Main Hall into one of the old dormitories and when these quarters became too small , the legislature , in 1875 , showing the increasing good-will of the people , appropriated $8o , ooo for the building of Science Hall , and it was completed two years later . In 1878 there was appropriated $130-ooo for an Assembly Hall and Library building . It seemed that now the needed building for the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Science Hall , with its costly apparatus and valuable collections , was burned . The legislature ten days later voted $15o , ooo for a Science Hall , machine shops and boiler house , $20,000 for a new Chemical Laboratory , and $20,000 for heating apparatus . The regents immediately began the erection of these buildings . It was seen after a time that the buildings as planned would cost a much larger sum than the appropriation , and two years later the legislature , voted an additional sum of $125,000 to complete Science Hall on the scale laid out by the regents . The new hall is massive in its proportions , admirably planned , and fire-proof . At the time of its erection it was among the very best buildings in the world devoted wholly to science . Brick and mortar do not indeed make a university ; yet the growing shell shows in a measure the development of its inhabitant , and the new Science Hall that seemed in i888 large for our uses is even now getting somewhat crowded , and a new Engineering building is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bascom resigned . The WiIows // 20 During his administration the University grew in power , in new departments* in increased facilities . The kindly feeling that sprang up after the reconstruction continued ; the permanent income of the university was greatly increased ; and more than half a million dollars had been appropriated for new buildings . The Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin x*PRESIDE*T OF TH* UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN preparatory department was abolished , and the system of accredited high schools was inaugurated . Go- education was made the permanent policy of the institution ; the Agricultural Experiment Station was beginning to solve the problem of agricultural education . On the retirement of Dr. Bascol* , the regents elected as his successor Dr. Thonias Chrowder Chamberlin , of the United States Geological Survey . Fnrther broadening of the scope of the university ; more original research ; more post*graduate study ; the method and life of a university , and not those of a college ,  --  these fairly indicate the hopes and purposes of the new executive . Dr. Chamberlin was not expected to give instruction in the class*rOOm , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency for five years . In briefly 5ketching the period from *887 to 1893 , I shall aim not only to indicate the lines of recent progre5S* but to show in some measure the fruitage of seed long since planted* and thus in some degree place before the reader the IJniversity as it exists to- day . One of the greatest drawbacks in the early history of the *niver5ity was the lack of fitting schools- There were no funds to establish academies **ronghout the state , if it had been thought wise to do so . It was only as the university grew in popular // favor and took its rightful place in the educational system of the state , that the high schools took up successfully the function of feeders to the University . The system is now tairly established , and becomes every year more efficient . Any high school or academy wishing to be admitted to the list of accredited schools will be examined as to its courses of study and method of instruction by an agent of the University , usually one of the professors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the school is placed upon the list , and continues thereon from year to year while the results are satisfactory and while the management of the school remains unchanged . In 1892 there were one hundred schools on the accredited list . Of this number fourteen high schools prepare for all the courses , thirty-two for all the courses except the Ancient Classical . Of the remainder , a majority prepare for three or four courses each . There are ten seminaries and academies on the list . The professor of pedagogy in the University has special charge of these accredited schools . Under his wise management the connection of the University not only with the high schools but with all the lower schools of the state is becoming more close ; and with the grading of the country schools , now rapidly going on , the way to the University for every boy and girl in the state is made easy . The College of Law graduated its first class in 1869 . It has had a prosperous career , a steady growth in numbers and in efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the faculty . The methods of instruction embrace the best of the most approved systems . There are lectures and quizzes , text-book study and practice in stating and explaining legal principles , the drafting of legal papers , and the trial and argument of cases in moot courts , all supervised by experienced instructors , a system that insures the maximum of benefit to be derived from a school of law . Madison offers superior advantages for such a school . Here are located the Municipal Court , the Circuit Court , the State Supreme Court , and the United States District Court . The library of the school is of good size and well selected ; while the State Law Library is the largest and most complete in the West . The regular course is two years ; a three years ' course is offered , which is practically the two years course with an added year in political and social science . College graduates who take of these elective branches the equivalent of a full year 's work may at the end of the three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degree of Bachelor of Law . The college has had its quarters in the capitol building . Of late years it has been cramped for room , especially during the session of the legislature , but the new building on College Hill , costing $75,000 , now nearly completed , will make a home for the department , whose elegance and . completeness will atone somewhat for the discomforts of the past . Striving to serve the material life of the state as well as the intellectual , the department of Engineering has been greatly strengthened and established as the College of Mechanics and Engineering . It . offers courses in railway , structural , mechanical , electrical and metallurgical engineering . The whole number of students in attendance is 173 . These courses aiming in the four years to give both a general and professional training are among the hardest courses in the University , and . yet among the most popular . The School of Pharmacy was established in 1884 , and at once took a high rank . The curriculum of the University may seem to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a department was organized on paper , and perhaps fortunately for the University never progressed beyond that point . The field is now occupied by the medical schools of Chicago . The superior conditions furnished by large cities have kept the regents from entering upon a work where the University would of necessity be at a disadvantage . In its preparatory medical course it now makes substantial contribution to the general medical training . In these later years there seems to be a growing need for a high kind of investigating work in pathological science , . work that neither the busy physician nor // the medical instructor can adequately do , work that can only be done by special talent in a great laboratory perfectly equipped . Such a laboratory lies fairly within the scope of the University ; it has a precedent in the great agricultural laboratories of the institution . The development of the Agricultural College has been most interesting . It was fortunate for the University and for the cause of agricultural education that the land grant of 1862 was used not to establish an Agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate with the University a School of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts . A separate institution would have meant a duplication of buildings and instructing forces , all of which was saved to the University and the state . This disposition of the Agricultural College grant was determined upon definitely in i866 , nearly five years after the grant was made by the general government . The legislature by the same act that made the Agricultural College a part of the University empowered Dane County to issue bonds to the amount of $40,000 to purchase an Experimental Farm . In pursuance of this authority the county purchased a tract of land containing nearly i*5 acres adjoining the old university grounds , and improved it for the use of the department of agriculture . The system of agricultural education in the University has three aims : first , to develop agricultural science through investigation and experiment ; second , to give instruction in agriculture at the University ; third , to disseminate agricultural knowledge , the reault of such investigation , among the farmers , by means of institutes and publications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station at the University . The station was organized by the legislature in 1883 , and the state now contributes $5 , ooo annually to its support . It also receives from the general government $r5 , ooo annually , by an act of 1887 , for the encouragement of experiments in agriculture . The station force consists of the director and four professors , two assistants , and perhaps half a dozen other employees . The greatest work yet done at the station is the invention of the Babcock milk test , by Dr. Babcock , the chief chemist . For a hundred years chemists had sought a simple and cheap method of determining fat in milk ; the demand for such a test was heard at every meeting of dairymen . The Babcock test meets this need . It is so simple that a fifteen-year-old boy can make the tests as accurately as a skilled chemist , and twenty times as rapidly as the chemist can by the gravimetric process . Thousands of these tests are in use in this country and in Europe , and milk is paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains . If it is asked what is such a test worth in dollars and cents to the farmers and dairymen of this country , it is probably less than the truth to say that it is worth to the dairy interests of Wisconsin alone more in dollars and cents than the University has ever cost the state . At the station such scientific matters as the following are now being investigated : animal nutrition ; effects of different foods and different combinations upon the animal body and in the production of milk ; all questions connected with the dairy ; the movements of the water in the soil ; how much water is required by growing crops and how best to serve it to them ; experience with fruit trees from Siberia and from northern China , and the hardiest home varieties . In the matter of instruction the long course and the short course indicate the differentiation in agricultural workers . The long course means scientific investigators in agriculture ; the short course means the intelligent , practical farmer or dairyman . Students are daily at work in manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or grafting in the horticultural rooms . These short courses are very popular . The dairying course in particular has been obliged to turn applicants away from lack of room . Among the students in this course are instructors of several years practice in other agricultural colleges . The new dairy building , " Hiram Smith Hall , " costing $40,000 , is the most completely equipped building for its purpose in the world . // The third aim is to disseminate agricultural knowledge , to bring the great mass of farmers into vital connection with this experimental and investigative work at the station by means of Farmers Institutes . It is practical and potential , completing a system that marks a plain advance in agricultural education . These institutes are under the control of the Agricultural College , which sends to each a conductor with from two to four assistants . About one hundred institutes are held every winter , each lasting from two to three days . The attendance ranges from 250 to 1,500 ; the aggregate attendance for 1891 was over 30,000 . Farmers often come thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the professors from the station , and other specialists in the state , or from other states , are there to suggest methods and to answer questions that a great body of farmers are quick to ask . For six years this pioneer university extension work has been in operation . For this work the legislature makes an annual appropriation of *I 2,000 . The great significance of these institutes is only now being generally recognized . Says Charles Dudley Warner in Harper 's Aifagazine : " As these farmers ' institutes are conducted , I do not know any influence comparable with them in waking up the farmers to think , to inquire into and improve methods , and to see in what real prosperity consists . With prosperity as a rule , the farmer and his family are conservative , lawkeeping , church-going , good citizens . The little appropriation of $12,000 has already returned to the state *a thousand fold in general intelligence . " The success of the College of Agriculture must be largely attributed to the wise direction of Prof. Win . A. Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The school of Economics , Political Science and History was created in 1892 . Dr. Richard T. Ely , of Johns Hopkins University , was elected director and professor of political economy . " The purpose of the school is to afford superior means for advanced study and research in the economic , political , social and historical sciences . The subjects are treated largely from the investigative and scientific point of view . It is the especial aim to promote a more liberal study of the branches that are basal to the practice of law , to journalism , the ministry , and other professioi*s directly concerned with human relations . It is adapted to those who wish to supplement their legal , theological or other professional studies with courses in general social science . Such courses7 being strictly non-partisan , furnish a liberal and comprehensive equipment for those who wish to enter upon public life , the law , the ministry or business pursuits , or to become teachers of history and the political and economic sciences in schools and colleges . It is the especial endeavor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good citizenship . The school embraces both undergraduate and graduate courses , but its leading endeavors centre in the latter . " Nowhere in this country , perhaps , could more favorable conditions have been found for the establiThment and assured growth of such a school . The subject of history held a leading place in the University for many years , under the direction of that accomplished scholar and teacher , the late Professor William F. Allen . His methods and spirit are in a large measure retained in the department . Economic and political science command the popular attention ; and nowhere could these subjects be more broadly and intelligently considered than in a state university in the great Mississippi Valley . The capital of the state , where the political and social life are focussed , is the proper home for such a school . The Commissioner of Labor , the Commissioner of Statistics , the Board of Control of all the penal and charitable institutions of the state have their offices here . The vicinity of great cities like Milwaukee and Chicago gives opportunity for practical study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collections of the State Historical Society are invaluable to such a school . Its 15 3 ,  - -  000 books and pamphlets , its abundant manuscript material for the study of western history , and its very complete files of newspapers and periodicals , extending over a century and a half , furnish advantages for the study of American history certainly not equalled west of the Alleghany mountains . When one sees this vast accumulation of material , it seems indeed , as a distinguished investigator recently said , that " The field of western history has as yet been hardly scratched ; the lines of investigation are so many in number , and all so inviting , that one is puzzled which line to follow . " // This combination of advantages made it well-nigh inevitable that at some time there would be established here a great school of history and economics . The establishment of this school is perhaps the crowning achievement of President Chamberlin 's administration . The times were ripe for the creation of such a school . The wisdom of the regents has been justified by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it enters in a much fuller degree than the most sanguine hoped for upon its prime function , the training of graduate students . Nearly thirty college graduates from all parts of the Union were waiting to enter when the doors of the school first swung open in the fall of 1892 . Mucb of its success must be credited to its distinguished director , Dr. Ely . His wide reputation , as well as the popular interest in the subjects taught and the favorable conditions for such study in the University , has drawn graduate students from far distant parts of the Union . The faculty of the school numbers in all twelve men , two in History , two in Civil Polity , and three in Political Economy and General Sociology , besides two fellows who give instruction , and three special lecturers . University extension is no new idea to the University . For nearly a decade it has been doing practical extension work , mainly however in industrial and professional lines . In i885 the Farmers ' Institutes , of which we have already spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results of the investigations made at the Experiment Station ; these centres have now increased to one hundred . The Teachers ' Institute lectureship , too , is a means of university extension . It provides for forty lectures by the professor of pedagogy before as many different institutes throughout the state . The summer school for teachers , held at the University during four weeks of the summer vacation for the past six years , further carries out the extension i ( lea . The school has been given a permanent official organization , and the legislature has made an annual appropriation for its support . The attendance at the session of 1892 was about two hundred . There were in all about thirty courses offered , and the instructors were , with one exception , members ot the university faculty . The new School of Economics , Political Science and History has , as one of its organic parts , a club with extension features . It is a kind of permanent centre from which to spread the results of recent investigations , and at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories and the man of practical affairs , noted specialists from home and from abroad , all who are trying to solve the great problems that confront our times , or striving for the elevation of our civic life . The purely cultural work in university extension was begun by the university in 1891 . One hundred and seven requests for courses of lectures were received , more than double the number the professors were able to give without serious interference with their work in the University . The average attendance on the lectures was one hundred and seventy , xvhile the aggregate attendance was eight thousand five hundred . It was soon seen that this extra-collegiate department must have a faculty of its own ,  --  special extension lecturers . That this department is to have a great future no one doubts . How best to meet the demands that will be made upon the University is the question . The movement is directly in line with the fundamental idea and purpose of the University , namely , to serve the people . While this extension of university effort has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University during these past five years a tendency toward concentration in under-graduate study . For several years the studies of the junior and the senior years were almost wholly elective . The results were not in all regards satisfactory ; effort was sometimes dissipated by a multiplicity of subjects , and thoroughness sacrificed for a smattering of many things . This has led to the adoption of the group system , not in place og but along with , the course system . With the beginning of the college year of 1892 this dual system went into operation . The central idea of the group system is that the student should learn a // great deal of one thing and a little of many things . Its object , as stated by the University , is to give continuity , concentration and thoroughness to the leading lines of study , and at the same time to afford a wide ( though of necessity only general ) familiarity with the broad field of knowledge . The work of the four years is divided into two parts , the first consisting of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second part , which consists of : ( i ) a leading line of study running through two years , constituting the major study of the student ; ( 2 ) a series of assigned studies supplementary to it , selected by the professor in charge of the leading line ; and ( * ) a series of elective studies sufficient to make up a full course . The basal group of studies will occupy the freshman and sophomore years , and may in some instances extend into the junior year . The work of the second part , the university group , will occupy the junior and senior years . These courses will be supplemented by synoptical lectures , the purpose of which is to present the outlines of the leading branches taught in the University in such a way as to convey the maximum of important information in the minimum of time , so that the students may become familiar with the salient features of subjects they are unable to take up as regular studies . The aim is to broaden the students ' information and interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been happily called " University Extension within the University . " Under the course system the University offers six courses of study leading to the bachelor 's degree : the Ancient Classical to the degree of Bachelor of Arts ; the Modern Classical , the English , and the Civic-Historical Courses to the Bachelor of Letters ; the General Science and Pre-Medical Courses to Bachelor of Science . The name of each course fairly indicates its central studies . Whether the group system and the course system will live amicably together is yet to be seen . The method of instruction in the two systems is practically the same . The laboratory and the seminary have become , where practicable , recognized factors both in post-graduate and in under-graduate study . The feeling is steadily growing in the faculty that these courses , being made equivalent in time and efforts , should have but a single degree ; and before long the Bachelor of Arts degree will probably be given to all who have completed any one of the six courses . No sketch of the University , however brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies . To do the work they require is like taking an additional course . Not including the clubs and societies in the professional schools , there are in the academic department six societies , four supported by the young men and two by the young women . Essays and orations receive only slight attention ; the burden of the work is in debate . The oldest society dates from 1850 ; its chief rival was organized three years later . Between these two has been waged a friendly but most determined conflict . Their annual contest , " The Joint Debate , " has been perhaps , next to Commencement , the most important event of the university year . No labor or expense is spared in preparation . When , a few years ago , the question of " Prohibition or High License " was debated , one of the debaters traveled widely through the state of Maine , interviewing leading men , studying the workings of the system ; while another was in Iowa , and a third in Nebraska , where the operation of high license was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bi-metalism and silver coinage have been discussed at the time when each was rising in popular interest . In 1893 the question for debate is on the desirability of municipal ownership and operation of water , lighting and street transit plants , as compared with private ownership and operation . Although the battle is no longer confined to the two old-time contestants , the interest seems never to flag , and although the institution has grown from a feeble college to a great university , and the faculty occasionally frown for fear that too much time and effort is being put into the Joint Debate , still the enthusiasm is as spontaneous and genuine as it was forty years ago . The young women , too , // have their public debates , although in their societies greater prominence is given to general literary work . The general library of the University contains about 26,000 volumes , while the technical libraries in law , agriculture and astronomy aggregate about 8 , ooo volumes additional . To these collections may be added , since the students have free access to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Library of over 23 , ooo , and the invaluable State Historical Society Library of 153,000 volumes , aggregating over 225,000 volumes . None of these collections , however , is in a building that is even supposed to be fireproof . Some day the University may be called upon to mourn a serious loss . Money can replace all that is most valuable in the City Library and the State Law Library , but what is most valuable in the collections of the University and of the State Historical Society , once gone , is gone forever . The state should cherish these collections as the apple of its eye ; and it is hoped that , before long , upon the grounds of the University , the state will build for them a convenient and secure home . The bequests to the University have not been many in number nor great in amount . The feeling has prevailed that this is the State University , and that the great state of Wisco*nsiu is able to take care of it . The most considerable gift was that of Hon. Cadwallader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed and completely equipped the Astronomical Observatory that bears his name . In more recent years the practice of establishing fellowships and scholarships has suggested a line of future beneficence . It will be seen before long that concentration is the law in educational institutions as it is in commercial and industrial institutions that it is practical wisdom to fully utilize what is organized and established , and that a gift is wisely made when its blessings flow increasingly to the greatest number . When this is seen , th' vast accumulations of wealth in private hands , that the state and society have made possible , will be started on their way to bless the whole people by the upbuilding of new or the broadening and strengthening of oki departments in the People 's University* The state has not been unmindful of the growing needs of the University in these past five years . More buildings became necessary . The old gymnasium was burned in 1890 : it had never been well equipped , nor equal to the needs of the students . The law school was cramped into narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dairy interest made additional facilities imperative for the agricultural department . The legislature in 1890 made an appropriation " for the construction , equipment and maintenance of an armory and drill room for the military department of the University , a building for the College of Law , a building for practical instructions in dairying , and such modification or extensions of existing buildings as the growth of the University may require . " The appropriation was not made in a gross sum , but in the form of an annual tax of one-tenth of a mill for each dollar of the assessed valuation of the taxable . property of the state for the term of six years , aggregating about $350,000 . The dairy building , costing $40,000 , named " Hiram Smith Hall , " after the late Hon. Hiram Smith , a veteran dairyman and regent of the University , was completed and occupied in the winter of 1891-92 . The law building , costing $75,000 , is nox approaching completion ; while the gym nasium and armory , costing $i 25,000 , will be completed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of the lake . It is 200 feet long , 100 feet wide , and two stories high . The building is ample for its double purpose ; the first floor will be thoroughly equipped as a drill ball , the remainder as a general gymnasium . Athletics have received a fair amount of attention in the University . Until within a couple of years the contests have mainly been with the smaller colleges of the state . These contests have not called out the best work of the students , because such work was not needed . Recently there has been formed a league including only the larger institutions of the West , - the Universities of Chicago , Michigan , Minnesota , Wisconsin , and the Northwestern University . // With the prospect of an evenly matched battle , greater preparation will be made . The physical development of the student has been greatly aided in the past by the military drill which is required of all male students daily the first two years in the University* With the formation of the new league , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper interest in athletics generally . To these facilities for physical training may be added the new boat-house , costing $5,000 , and capable of accommodating eighty boats , which has been erected the present season , by the students , in close proximity to the gymnasium , so that at last the splendid advantages that Lake Mendota has so long offered are to be utilized . The income of the University has been further increased through the generosity of the federal government . Ip 1887 Congress appropriated the sum of $i* , ooo per annum to each of the several states and territories for the support of agricultural experiment stations . Again in 1890 there was appropriated by Congress for the more complete endowment and maintenance of colleges for the benefit of **griculture and the mechanic arts the sum of $i* , ooo for the year ending June 30 , 1890 , and an annual increase of the amount of such appropriation thereafter for ten years by an additional sum of $i , ooo over the preceding year , and thereafter $25,000 per annum , to each of the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the head professor of geology in the University of Chicago . The regents offered the presidency to Dr. Charles Kendall Adams , late president of Cornell University . He accepted and entered upon the duties with the opening of the college year of 1892-93 . The great ability of Dr. Adams , and his wide experience in university management , give assurance that there will be no halt in the progress of the institution , but rather that it will attain a deeper life and broader influence . There will be , in the next fifty years , in this upper Mississippi Valley , three or four world-renowned universities . The contestants are even now forming in line for the race . It is the time for the open hand and the farseeing eye . In this sketch I have grouped the events since the reorganization in i866 mainly about the executive of the University . The progress , however , has not been due to the presidents alone . The faculty of the University has been in a marked degree able and loyal to the University , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . There have been specially trusted counsellors like Sterling , Carpenter , Allen and Irving . Variety of opinion there has been , heated discussion often ; but when the vote has been taken and the direction determined , all have moved along with one mind and purpose . To the board of regents also , in the dark days as well as in the bright ones , a portion of the honor is due . The whole number of graduates at the reorganization in i866 , after sixteen years ' existence of the University , was *8 . In 1892 the number of graduates from the academical department alone was i 200 , while the total number of graduates , including those in law and pharmacy , was 2077 . Of this number , 282 were young women . The value of the University grounds and buildings L $1,200,000 . The total income of the University for 1892 was , in round numbers , $275,000 . Of this annual income about $20,000 comes from incidental fees and tuition . In the literary department , tuition to residents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small charge for incidental expenses . To nonresident students tuition is $6 a term . The matriculation fee in the law college is $ioo . The faculty of the University consists of 46 professors , 6 assistant professors , 20 instructors and * extension lecturers . The body of students for 1892-93 consists of *o graduate students and above i 250 under-graduates . The entering class of 93 will number more than 200 . What is the history in brief ? A preparatory school in i85o ; the first graduating class in 1854 ; from the organization of the University until i866 a struggle for its very existence against a hostile public sentiment , that mismanaged its // funds and even plotted against its life ; after r866 an ever-increasing popular friendliness and liberality . Year by year the University has broadened its scope and extended its influence ; has adopted co-education ; and now aims at nothing less than to carry the highest scholarship and the latest discoveries in art and science into every neighborhood in the state . From the stereotyped college for the intellectual training of young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the whole people . Once despised and rejected , it has come to crown the educational system of the state . Unhampered by tradition or precedent , it well illustrates the free growth of the modern University idea .
