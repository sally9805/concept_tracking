txt Mr. CHARLES S. FAIRCHILD delivered an admirable address to the Brooklyn Democratic Club on Monday , in which he gave his views as to the future of the Democratic Party . In substance they amounted to this : that the Democratic Party had . a brilliant future before it if it had the virtue to deserve it . That is a - very curt resume of the able and forcible address of Mr. FAIRCHILD , but we believe it is not an anfair one . It is plain that the distinguished speaker has a high ideal of what his party ought to do and can do , and that he sees a good many difficulties in the way of doing it . In the first place , he believes that the Democracy is essentially the party of justice . We agree with him in that . so far as the spirit of parties is to be tested by the chief issue presented in recent national elections , viz. , the tariff question . The revolt against the protectionists on that question has been very largely a moral revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in a protective tariff that inspired successful opposition to it , as its gross unfairness , the favors and privileges it conferred on the few at the expense of the many . This aspect of protection was made more impressive by the extreme demoralization to which it gave rise in the dominant party . and the opposition was more active and effective because it had a distinct embodiment of existing evil to fight . So far , Democracy and justice go together . Perhaps Mr. FAIRCHILD is firmer than we should be in the feeling that they are inseparable , but that is not a matter of pressing importance . E , In the next place , Mr. FAIRCHILD believes that sound money is one of the cardinal elements of true Democracy . It certainly ought to be . It is so with Democrats of the Cleveland type . As Mr. FAIRCHILD would define sound money it is peculiarly Democratic . It is a money with which the Government has nothing to do , which is not produced , provided , issued by the Government , and , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take or to pay except in fulfillment of contract freely made . This is indeed sound . money and ought to be Democratic money . But it is not the money believed in by all Democrats . It is a question whether it is believed in by even the majority of Democrats , or of Republicans either . The people of the United States have been used for so long a time to " Money " the real sources of the value of which they do not at all understand that the great body of them really have no belief about it , nothing but a more or less intense and unreasoning feeling . Nevertheless , Mr. FAIRCHILD does well to press home on every possible occasion the truth as to what good money is , and as to what the Government may or may not do with it or about it . That helps bring the mass of Democrats to an understanding of the true doctrine . It braces intelligent men among them for the struggle that will yet have to come , when it may fall to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight more bitter and more momentous than the tariff fight . It is in this direction that Mr. FAIRCHILD , if he does not doubt the future of his party , sees that it needs strengthening . But the most significant portion of Mr. FAIRCHILD 'S address was directed to a matter as to which there should be no question at all in the Democratic Party  --  the simple right of an honest vote in the party organization . It is needless to say that Mr. FAIRCHILD believes in this with all his heart . So does every other honorable man in the party . But Mr. FAIRCHILD 18 convinced , and so are we , that this prime right , the basis of all fair party action , the indispensable condition to party usefulness and to the permanence and progress of the party , can only be maintained by constant vigilance , and by unremitted exertion by those who prize it at its real value . Why is this so ? Why is the right that it ought to be possible always to take for granted exposed to such danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful condition of things is " spoils . " It is the distribution of public offices and public employments as patronage that more than all other things gives a motive for the perversion of the party machinery . It is not the sole cause , because men would fight , and with the weapons of corruption , for mere honors and power and the gratification of ambition . But these men could readily be overcome and . subdued if they could not make common cause with the spoilsmen . The " workers , " the " heelers , " the " henchmen , " who rob Democrats of their rights in the primary meetings and conventions of the party  --  who , for instance , made possible the snap convention of February , 1892 , and made necessary the efforts that secured the anti-snap convention of May  --  were mercenaries to a man , paid directly or indirectly out of the Public Treasury . The spoils system , then , is the most powerful and dangerous foe of true Democracy . It is to the destruction of that that true Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of but fleeting advantage .
