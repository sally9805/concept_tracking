txt Our Washington dispatches state that there is very little prospect of any amendment to the Senate rules to protect the rights of the majority at this session . The only possible explanation of a failure so to amend the rules is that the majority do not wish to protect their rights . There is certainly no need of any farther demonstration than was made during the two months ' blockade on the silver question that the rights of the majority are at the mercy of the minority . That demonstration was complete for both Democrats and Republicans , and for the country as well . If now the majority of the Senators should insist on a change in the rules that would prevent a recurrence of that shameful experience public opinion would sustain them absolutely . What has become of the zeal of Senator MT T LAWRENCE is still at work . We mean the tireless political shepherd of Ohio . He has issued a kind of proclamation in which all - wool growers are urged to pass resolutions , issue addresses , and circulate petitions , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance , there to meet the Wilson bill when it comes over from the House with wool on its free list . These resolutions , addresses , and petitions are to ask for duties on wool high enough to enable the American wool growers to " supply all wools of every kind needed for consumption in the United States , " including , of course , the cheap and coarse carpet wool , of which we imported 132,000,000 pounds last year . As the American Protective Tariff League , of - which LAWRENCE is an officer , has published its opinion that a duty of " from 500 to 1,000 per cent . ' would be required to cause the production of these wools : . ere , the petition should ask for the imposition of one of these rates . Perhaps LA wnExct : would be willing to split the difference and be satisfied with 750 per cent . The Repablicans have an abundance of good material from which to make up the staff of the Assembly at Albany . We have already mentioned one or two aspirants for the Clerkship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAINES D. Ctrxxismnam are urging that he be selected for the post . Mr. CUNNINGHAM is a conscientious , intelligent , and capable Albany correspondent , experienced in Assembly matters and familiar with all the ins and outs of legislation . His character and equipment entitle him to any recognition his party can bestow . The Rev. T. DE WI= TALMAGE is an acute sufferer from the metaphorical habit . When he slips recklessly into a comparison of President KEENEY of the Commercial Bank of Brooklyn with Joux BUNYAN and ST . PAUL , and infers that the indictment and arrest of the former no more affect his reputation than the imprisonment of the latter did theirs , he does an ill service both to Mr. KEENEY and to the Christian religion . Mr. KEENEY is not exactly on the same plane with ST . Pant , or even with the author of " The Pilgrim 's Progress , " and neither of the latter was compelled to ask a suspension of judgment as to his share of responsibility for a wrecked bank . What Mr. KEENEY is formally accused of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the condition of his bank . The moral gravamen of that charge is that Mr. KEENEY 'S statement deceived innocent persons to their harm . That is a very grave charge indeed . No one ever brought a like charge against ST . PAUL or against Bunyan , and it is a species of sacrilege to group the three cases together . Dr. TALMAGE should retire to strict seclusion until this matter is finally settled . Another package of dynamite , intended to be exploded so as to destroy a public building , was yesterday discovered in Paris . This is the natural sequence of the anomalous condition of the law . If the dynamite had exploded and killed somebody , the author of the explosion would have been satisfied . Now that the explosion has failed , he has only to evade the police long enough to cross the frontier in order to be quite safe . Yet the offense that he has committed is not more an offense against France than against all mankind . What is needed is a. law making the unlawful possession of dynamite in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least an offense extraditable upon the demand of any country that has a civilized system of jusrisprudeuce , a condition that would exclude only Russia . When it is understood that no civilized country affords an asylum for Anarchists , Anarchism will cease to be .
