Here you can see all sorts of life . How much better it is to live here , than in your stupid village in the backwoods , with no society but that of Bumpkins and old women ; to be sure , you have some pretty girls there  --  your cousin Jane , for instance ; but what are your country girls , compared to our dashing New York belles ? I declare , during the two months I have passed with you there , I have grown almost as verdant as yourself . George . George Parsells Well , Harry , you must admit that your visit to our village has somewhat improved your health .

Shows watch . I would n't part with it if I could help it , but I 've been turned out of my boarding-house , and had nothing to eat these two days . Would n't you like to buy it ? George . George Parsells I do n't know as I can afford it ; besides I have a very good silver one , that answers my purpose . Shows it . Jake . Jake I will sell it to you cheap , sir . As I am in want of money to take me home . I would n't mind trading with you for a little to boot .

You 've been the dupe of a scoundrel ! George . George Parsells Do you really mean to say I have been deceived in this watch ? Harry . Harry Gordon I do ! Why , my dear George , I thought you too cunning for the watch-stuffers . George . George Parsells I tell you , Harry , the poor fellow who sold it to me was from the country , and almost starving . Harry . Harry Gordon Nonsense ! this is the old stereotyped tale ! But console yourself  --  you are not the first greenhorn that has been taken in by that manuvre . There 's about as much gold in that watch as you can put in your eye ! George . George Parsells Let 's after the rascal , and have him arrested ! Harry .

Well , I could have sworn it did . Opens and shows George . You see , it 's full of papers , besides a number of bank-bills . You see , as I ca n't read , you 'd better take it , and keep it till a reward is offered , which , I dare say , will be something handsome  --  fifty dollars at the least ! then we 'll go halves . You can always find me at 300 Robinson Street . George . George Parsells Aside . Egad ! Here 's a speculation . Aloud . Very well , my friend , I will take it . Offers to take it . Mike .

George Parsells Do n't laugh , Harry . See , here are a number of bank bills  --  Globe Bank , and Hoboken Banking &; Grazing Company . Harry .

Mrs. Morton My dear girls , ' t is time we were at home ; it 's past five o'clock , and dinner will be waiting for us . Jane . Jane Dear me , aunt , how the time passes ! I declare , I was never so delighted in my life ! such a never-ending display of silks , jewelry , and shawls as this Broadway boasts of ! ' t is enough to turn my brain ! Mary . Mary If the windows of the stores put you in such ecstacies , what will a visit to the interior accomplish ? Mary . Mary Oh , dear ! do n't mention it !  --  I should go wild ! I know I should ! Mrs. M. Mrs. Morton Reprovingly . Jane ! Jane . Jane Excuse me , aunt ; but everything I see is so much superior to our village , that I do n't know whether New York belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your village , how nicely you contrived to give your cousin George the slip , and arrive here a day before him . Jane . Jane Yes , George , poor fellow , was so delighted with the prospect of his visit to New York  --  which induced me to write word I would visit you ; how surprised he will be to find me here before him ! Mrs. M. Mrs. Morton No doubt he will meet you at our house , where , of course , he 'll call , together with his friend , Harry Gordon . Jane . Jane Confused . Harry Gordon ? Mary . Mary Why , Jane , what ails you ? Is there anything so terrible in he name of Harry Gordon ? Jane . Jane No ; why do you ask ? Mary . Mary No matter . By the way you mentioned his name I suspect there is some truth in the little bit of scandal afloat . Jane . Jane Scandal ! Mary . Mary Harmless , I assure you . ' T is said a certain gentleman paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion of his visit , for the double purpose of seeing his relations and recruiting his health . Mrs. M. Mrs. Morton And you think he lost no time in recruiting his heart ? Jane runs off , R. H Come , girls . Mary . Mary Ma ! I hope you intend to take Jane with us to our bowling saloon ? Mrs. M. Mrs. Morton Of course I do ; while she is in the city I intend to show her every place of amusement . Bless the girl ! there she is , staring into that shop window , as usual . They exit R. H.

Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an hour to spare , and will be happy to serve you . George . George Parsells Your calling , my friend , is rather a new one . Pray , do you find many customers ? Jake . Jake Oh , yes ; I sometimes have a job that lasts three or four days . I 'm a city pilot ; my line of business has n't been long established , and , I 'm sorry to say , it 's been sadly cut into by outsiders . George . George Parsells By what ? Jake . Jake By outsiders  --  fellers who live upon other people 's ideas . You see , I and two or three others struck upon this idea , to offer our services to gentlemen unacquainted with the city to show them the Elephant , and have so far been well patronized . We have earned a good name for honesty , and I hope you will recommend me to your friends . George . George Parsells What are your terms ? Jake . Jake One dollar an hour , payable in advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to pay before we say any more ? Jake . Jake One dollar an hour for services , and you are to pay the entrance fees for any place we may visit . George . George Parsells Very good . Gives a bill . Now , what open space is that with the large building in the center ? Jake . Jake That 's the Park . The admission is fifty cents a piece . George . George Parsells Indeed ! Do all these people pay that ! They seem to walk in and out free . Jake . Jake That 's because they 're regular subscribers . George . George Parsells Oh ! Gives money . There 's a dollar ; that will pay for us two ; take it ; you know more about it than I do . Jake . Jake I 'll give it to the gate-keeper myself , and as you 'll want to visit the Battery soon after we get through the Park , suppose you give me another dollar ?  --  then you wo n't be troubled when we get there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten dollar bill  --  suppose you give me the change ? Gives bill . Jake . Jake I 'll run to the corner and get it changed , if you 'll stop here a minute . George . George Parsells Certainly . Exit Jake laughing aside , R. 1 E. That seems an honest fellow enough ; he will be of great service to me while Harry is absent . Looks off . Egad ! here comes Harry ; he has returned sooner than I expected . Re-enter Harry . L 1 E. Harry . Harry Gordon Well , here I am , George ; I 've finished my business for the day ; now , suppose we take a turn through the city . But how came you to leave the sitting-room at the Astor before my return ? George . George Parsells I met a gentleman , who informed me that his business was to show up the Elephant to country people , or in other words , take them about town to see the sights . Harry . Harry Gordon Well ? George . George Parsells I engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , paid for two tickets for the park , and he has just gone to get a ten dollar bill changed , to take out for two Battery tickets . Harry . Harry Gordon Ha ! ha ! ha ! you innocent lamb ! I shall certainly have to put you under lock and key while I am absent . You 'll never see him or your money again ; and as for the Park and Battery , they are public grounds , and open to all ! George . George Parsells Do you mean to say these people now walking in and out , are not subscribers ? Harry . Harry Gordon Subscribers ! pooh ! they pay enough taxes , if that 's what you mean . Ha ! ha ! ha ! George . George Parsells Do n't laugh , Harry . It seems to me there has n't been a countryman in New York in ten years , by the way the sharpers set upon me . Harry . Harry Gordon They do seem to have a design upon your pockets ; but I will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you  --  but who is this coming ? Harry . Harry Gordon Why , as I live , it 's one of the b'hoys  --  an old schoolfellow of mine ! he seems to be talking confidentially to himself . Step aside for a minute . Retire up . Enter Mose , R. 1 E. Mose . Mose Smoking ; he spits . I 've made up my mind not to run wid der machine any more . There 's that Corneel Anderson do n't give de boys a chance . Jest ' cause he 's Chief Ingineer he thinks he ken do as he likes . Now last night when de fire was down in Front Street , we was a takin ' 40 's water ; I had hold ov de butt , and seed she was gittin ' too much fur us ; and I said I to Bill Sykes : " Sykesy , take de butt .

" Seys I , " What !  --  I wo n't get off de hose ! " And he did hit me over de gourd ! Harry advances , and taps him on the shoulder . I say , lookye here !  --  what yer mean by that ? Harry . Harry Gordon Why , Mose , do n't you remember me ? Mose . Mose No sir-ree , I do n't . Harry . Harry Gordon What ! do n't remember Harry Gordon , that used to go to Evans ' school with you , in Bayard Street ? Mose . Mose Taking his hand . Well , I do n't know anybody else ! How are you ? how have you been for the last ten years ? Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I find you in this part of the town ? I heard that you held Broadway in such contempt , that you could'n be persuaded even to cross it . Mose . Mose I 've got over dat now . The fact is , I 'm agoin ' to give up runnin ' to fires . I ar n't been used well , so I 'm goin ' to locate somewhere in this quarter , if I can find a good boardin ' - house . Harry . Harry Gordon I 'm glad of that , for we can then renew an old acquaintance . You used to fight all my battles for me at school , and we were firm friends ! But allow me to introduce you to my friend , George Parsells , from the country . Mose . Mose Shakes hands . How are you , old hoss ? George . George Parsells Proud of your acquaintance . Harry .

Harry Gordon Sometime since I visited some lady friends of mine , and by hook or crook I obtained tickets of admission to a ladies ' bowling saloon . Now , if we can go there and disguise ourselves in the uniform they wear , while playing , I think I can warrant some fun . What say you ? Mose . Mose I say I 'm there , hoss . I can play pretty if I 'm a mind to ! George . George Parsells But where to find these dresses ? Harry . Harry Gordon A five dollar bill to the wardrobe-keeper will procure them , I think . Omnes .
