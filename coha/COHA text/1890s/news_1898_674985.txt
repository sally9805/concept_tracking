txt A recent issue of the Paris Temps has a very well-Informed and well-considered leading article on the dangers of the United States . According to our French critic our chief danger is not so much that of " imperialism " as of the consequences of imperialism in raising up an organized army of assailants of the United States Treasury . It must be owned that this is a real danger . We are all the while talking about the burden upon Europe of the tremendous armaments the Continental powers ' maintain . And yet it is a fact that the pensions paid by the United States on account of a war which ended a full generation ago are almost exactly as great as the whole cost of maintaining the German Army . Last year $140,845,772 were paid in pensions by the United States , while the budget of the German Army for this year is $141,175,350 . The Russian budget alone exceeds this , and exceeds it by $7,000,000 . The French is $25,000,000 less . The relation of this awful drain upon the Treasury to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The associations of veterans , such as the Grand Army of the Republic , have become all-powerful societies for mutual political aid . They have put in the balance the weight of their numbers and of their discipline . They have imposed upon party conventions and upon the voters themselves candidates taken from their ranks . If Mr. ALGER has been put at the head of the War Department , if he remains there in spite of the scandals , in spite of the storm let loose against him , which the whitewashing reports of all the commissions of investigation will not succeed in quieting , it is by reason of this all-powerful protection . " Of course , everybody knows that the only practical purpose of the Grand Army of the Republic is to , obtain pensions for its members , and that it opposes any proposal to investigate claims so as to reject those which are fraudulent . Col. WARING publicly described it , some years ago , as " a lot of pension bummers , " and all its official proceedings tend to bear out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of the Grand Army , and to the confidence of that body that he in his turn will support all claims for pensions , genuine or fraudulent . ' An amazing instance of this was ' furnished at the last annual meeting ; a few weeks ago . At that time the public indignation was hot against the mismanagement of the War Department , but the Grand Army , without any pretense of having made an investigation , passed an impudent resolution that there had been no ' mismanagement . In the support of ALGER . by the pensioners Nand : claimants , especially the fraudulent pensioners and claimants , we ' may perhaps discern the ' reason why the President has refrained from putting . him out of the place in which his ' incompetency has been so conspicuous . The failure of the President to take action is , on the surface , so incomprehensible that a great many people have been driven to the conclusion . that he was bound to ALGER by some pecuniary bargain . That was a natural supposition . But it isrVery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we assume that the President is sincerely afraid of what may be called the " pension vote " which is arrayed in support of the Secretary . who has been the burden and ' blight of his Administration . This assumption relieves the President to some extent , but It does not do Much credit to his political shrewdness . If he unloaded ALGER he would rid his Administration of the greatest burden it has to carry . If he did not unload him , ha would incur the hostility of the " pension bummers . " But how would that hostility be displayed ? By voting the Democratic ticket ?
