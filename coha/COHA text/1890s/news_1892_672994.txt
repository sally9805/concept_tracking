txt " It is an election dodge , " said Mr. Henry Beatty , manager of the Canadian Pacitio Railway steamships on Lakes Huron and Superior , speaking of the retaliatory bill passed by Congress . " It will injure directly many United States interests far more than ours . For that reason I do not believe that the toll will amount to anything . Of course if they charge $2 a ton and $5 a passenger going through the ? Soo ? Canal , we will have to tie up our vessels . " ' ? Have you heard yet what the tariff will be I " " No , not here . They may have heard in Mon-treaL " Have you made any change in rates in anticipation of the imposition of this toll 1 " " No , we have had a number of merchants in asking that question , but we will make no change until the tariff is announced . We will carry out whatever contracts we may make in the meantime . As I said , 1 do n't believe the toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the business , and in the absence of their competition the rates would rise and seriously hurt the reciprocal trade of the Northwestern and the New-England States . I do n't think these States will permit it " If the toll is imposed , it will drive Canadian vessels out of the business . American vessels can not carry freight between Canadian ports on account of the coasting regulations . The traffic would have to go over the Canadian Paeine Railroad The toll , therefore , would injure Canadian vessel owners without benefiting Americans . I do n't think any civilized Government would do such a thing . " " if the Canadian Soo Canal were ready , the difficulty would be avoided t " " Yes , but atthe present state of progress I do n't believe it will be finished in live years . I saw it stated somewhere that the Government might assist the vessel owners by paying the extra toll . I do n't know whether that is a fact or not , but they ought to do something .
