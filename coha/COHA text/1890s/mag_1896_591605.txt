THE GERMAN AND THE GERMAN-AMERICAN . I. IT is a more or less popular belief in Germany , among the well-to-do classes , that only those Germans come to our country who are incompetent to succeed at home . These classes have a happy faculty of thinking , or rather of making themselves think , that the Fatherland is in the best condition possible , and those who do not agree with them , and leave it , they consider , if not exactly Taugenichtse , at any rate inconsiderate grumblers . In German novels it is always the ne'er-do-well and villain who emigrate to " Amerika , " and the impression they leave on the reader is that we are a nation of vagabonds and criminals . In actual life , if a man has done anything dishonorable , it is said that the only thing for him to do is to put two pistols to his head , or smuggle himself into some ship bound for our shores . A little while ago a very eminent instance of this way of looking at disgrace came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conservative party got himself into very serious trouble , and when the facts were made public it was discovered that , long before his arrest , at least one of his party friends had advised him to commit suicide or run away to the United States . In other words , death and exile to this country mean pretty much the same tbing to the well-situated German ; and in the press and in daily conversation so much is made of those who choose the latter alternative that , among people who pay no attention to what goes on in the world of the peasant and the workingman , it has become customary to look upon America as the dumpingground of Europe 's refuse population . It is useless to deny that some of our German immigrants belong to this class of people , perhaps more than we know anything about ; but the great majority of them - and they constitute the largest single foreign element we have - are not ne'er-do-wells , and they have not come to us because they were failures through their own fault at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the steamer Lahn , and crossed from Bremerhaven to New York with about seven hundred fellow steerage passengers . Excepting a few Russians and Poles they were all Germans , and they came from various parts of the empire . We were more than eight days at sea , and I had a very fair opportunity to get acquainted with them . About a third of these people were without any specific occupation or trade , and called themselves Arbeiter , simple workmen . A few had their families with them , but the majority were strong young fellows between twenty and thirty years of age . They were leaving Germany because they believed there was a better outlook for them on this side of the water . When I asked them how much better they expected to do here than at home , they said they were looking forward to a dollar and a dollar and a half a day if they worked as common laborers , and to something like fifteen dollars and eighteen dollars a month if they went on farms , which not a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these wages they could save and eventually become independent , which had been impossible in the Fatherland . There they had worked for wages ranging from eighty pfennigs to a mark and three pfennigs a day , and only a few had been able to save much more than a hundred marks ( twenty-five dollars ) to begin life with in the New World . More than a hundred were peasants and their families . They all had relatives and friends in this country , and // were coming to them . Each family had money enough and to spare to pay all railway expenses as well as to buy the necessary farm tools . They had left Germany because where they had farmed , mainly in the provinces of east and west Prussia , it did not pay so well as they thought it should , and they hoped to secure better farms , which their children might inherit . They were sorry that they had felt forced to leave das liebe Vaterland , but they were sure that it was the best thing both for them and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skilled laborers , such as bakers , butchers , brewers , tailors , carpenters , bookbinders , drivers , miners , locksmiths , barbers , and the like . They also were leaving Germany to better their financial condition . This was probably the main reason , but some of them were obviously too liberal minded for home institutions , and I fancy that this had something to do with their emigration . Indeed , several were loud mouthed with rebellion , calling Germany a Polizeistaat , and showing plainly that they were looking forward to America as a place where the police could not regulate everything they did . The most of them caine from large towns ; and since it is in these towns that Social Democracy is strongest , I take it that some of them had already come under its influence . I do not report this as anything to their disgrace , - for a great many so-called Social Democrats are no more Socialists , in the strict sense of the word , than the Liberals are , - but merely to show that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the Fatherland . The rest of my fellow passengers were small tradespeople , servants , and a few young fellows who were runaways from the army and adventurers making their first trip into the world at large . Except the last they were all desirable immigrants , and were planning to cast in their lot for better or worse with the people they found here . The tradespeople intended to set up shop in German communities , and the servants , mainly women and girls , were going " to work out " wherever the opportunity presented itself . The deserters and adventurers numbered only about twenty , and they had just enough money to land and live for a few days , until something turned up . The former hoped that they could get into our army , but they were determined " not to let any one bluff them ; " the latter intended to look about a bit , and then go somewhere else . All they wanted was to get out into die Ferne , and as long as it attracted them they expected to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me lately that our country was filling up so rapidly there would soon be no inducement for a man to come over simply to benefit his material welfare ; but I feel sure that so long as Germany labors under the burdens , military and monarchical , that it does to-day , the United States can but be attractive to the poor man , and he is likely to keep on coming to us so long as we will receive him . It is often asked , Why do we not get more educated Germans ? There is a learned proletariat in Germany as well as a proletariat of common people , and one wonders at times why more of its members do not emigrate . A number of reasons account for this , and probably the main one is the greater attachment of the educated man to home institutions , but I think the risk involved in such a change keeps a great many away . There is an immense bureaucracy in the Fatherland , and if a man can once get into it he is pretty sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . I know , for instance , a school-teacher who is working in a most forlorn community in Germany for $250 a year . Some time ago he was offered by a German community in Ohio $750 a year and six months ' notice before dismissal , if he would come over ; but he did not dare to accept , because // there was no chance of a pension . If he remained at home , he was sure , lie said , of an annuity after he had served a certain number of years , and he preferred this certainty to the uncertainty in Ohio , although the latter might have brought him in a short time all that he would ever receive from his pension . The same thing is true in all professions in any way connected with the government . Every mau looks forward to a pension , and if in the mean time he can save a little money his old age is likely to be more or less comfortable . The common workingman lacks this incentive to stay at home . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure , the chance to insure himself , - indeed , he is compelled to do so ; but the pension he receives is too paltry to keep him from emigrating , and that for old age is paid only after he has passed his seventieth year . IT . To appreciate what the Germans do for our life , and we for them , it is necessary first to take note of the characteristics which are comumon to them in their own country . The minute they set foot on the steamer , bound for our shores , and realize that they are cut loose from all home restraints and customs , some of these characteristics are modified , and to secure a trustworthy standard of comparison one must know what they were before this change set in . Perhaps , to an Americaim , the most striking feature in the character of the Germans at home is their respect for law and authority . For a naturally liberal-minded people , - and their history certainly proves them to be this , - they bow down before government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other country governed by constitutional principles , and they grant the police a power over them which to the Anglo-Saxon would be slavery . There is hardly anything that a man can do in Germany which does not bring him in contact with the Poli*ei , and from birth to death his life is practically under their supervision and direction . This has been the custom so long that to-day it comes as easy to the Germans , while still at home , to conform to police surveillance as it does to us to fight shy of it , and only the direst provocation can array them against the powers that be . In the little revolution which took place in Berlin in 1893 , for instance , when some unemployed workmen and boys went parading through the town crying for bread , their first thought was not , as it would have been with us , to take the bread where it could be found . No ; they must first go to their Kaiser and tell him their woes , and so off they started for his palace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " 0 Kaiser , we are starving ! Give us bread . " There is something pitiful in thus crouching down before a oneman power , and it does not appeal to people on this side of the water ; but I venture to say that Germany is what it is to-day , probably the least politically corrupt country in all Europe , very much because of this veneration for government and its representatives . This is what keeps the army together , the bureaucracy clean and pure , and the people governable . Patience and perseverance are the next prominent characteristics . Germans stick to a thing that they have begun , if it is in the least practicable , until it is done , and the necessary waiting for results seems merely to confirm their resolution . The story of the philologian , who regretted on his death-bed that he had not devoted his life to the dative case , applies to the entire race . In this particular they are very different from the Irish . I have in mind an Irishman , who , after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly made up his mind that he would be a lawyer . His education had been very // meagre , and I asked him whether he thought he was fitted for such a profession . " Oh , I guess so , " he said ; " my friends tell me that I ye got a sarcastic tongue , and I suppose that s the main thing . " He went West , and the next thing I knew he was practicing law . For a German to take up law merely because he has a sharp tongue is almost unthinkable . He does not always use good judgment in choosing a calling , nor does he often have the chance to choose it for himself , his parents managing all that in his earliest years ; but when the choice is made , he sits down and grinds until he has mastered at least a specialty in his profession . It is the same among the common people . Every artisan must go through a long and tiresome apprenticeship before he can set up for himself , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a Quartier of his own in the cafe . I remember once telling a waiter how , with us , poor lads often earn their way through college by waiting on table at summer resorts . He was dumfounded . " Why , I should think they would break everything they got hold of , " he said . " I should , I know . " The Germans are also an industrious people . They work at something , men , women , and children , the whole day long ; and although it is often mere puttering , they have the satisfaction of knowing that they are not idle . Even in fairly well-to-do families , if the daughter can not marry , she goes out as governess , ladies ' companion , Kindergdrtnerinn , or the like ; and the day laborer simply will not marry at all unless he can rely on his wife to bring her share of money into the family exchequer . Of the laborer it is often said that he lacks intelligence to direct his industry , and much has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those above him ; but the gulf is not so much one of intelligence as of artificial class arrangement . He is wanting , it is true , in much of the general knowledge which comes so easily to the American workingman , and he is by no means so quick and acute as the latter , but his class is certainly an intelligent one . Indeed , I believe that the German is one of the very best educated workingmen that we receive from Europe , and I have still to meet one unable to read and write . There are , I know , some illiterates in Germany , but they are steadily becoming fewer , and must ultimately disappear ; for German law requires that every boy and girl shall attend school from the sixth to the fourteenth year , and the officials see to it that this law is rigorously enforced . The Germans are , furthermore , an honest people . They tell , to be sure , the same conventional little lies that are told in every European country , but at heart they mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this after nearly ten years ' intimate experience with them in their own country . During the late unpleasantness between our country and Germany in regard to certain insurance companies , a great deal was written in the German press about the comparative honesty of German and American business men , and a German-American , who claimed to know both very well , said publicly that the simple word of the former was worth as much in every-day life as was a written contract of the latter ; but this is an exaggeration . It is true that , officially , a man 's word does not go so far as it does with us , but this is because the Germans have become accustomed to have everything put down in black and white . The government sets them this example , and it is the fashion to require a lawyer 's affidavit in the most trivial matters . If one rents a house , for instance , a most laborious contract is drawn up , and the lessee must promise not even to introduce a dog into the house without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictness prevails in all other dealings . The contract settled , however , German law punishes very se // verely any deviation from it , and the foreigner is as thoroughly protected as the native . Finally , the Germans are a healthy people . The men are well built and strong , and the women vigorous and energetic . Taking them as a race , I think they are better fitted for life , physically , than we are , and they seldom have to rely so much on nervous power to do their work . They are not pugilists , it is true , and they abhor our summary way of settling serious quarrels , but they are great athletes , and we are indebted to them for many of our gymnastic theories and applications . As students they endure more than we can . It is the fashion to laugh at the German student , and the Fliegende Blatter has made his bad points notorious ; but when it comes to sitting down and grinding , as it does even to him , he has more staying power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because his will or intentions are any better , but because he has a physique that permits him almost incredible concentration of mind . Thus much for the good qualities of the Germans . If I have read them aright , the most striking are , respect for law and order , intelligence , thoroughness , perseverance , industry , honesty , and general good health . Theoretically , the German immigrants whom we get ought to have these characteristics , and in so far as they are intelligently retained here they help to make our life better . With these , however , they bring others which are not so desirable , and I must note them too . The first characteristic , and it is the worst of all , is their view of women and the treatment they apply to them . It is said that a great many years ago , probably in the proverbial " golden age , " * German women enjoyed all the respect and privileges that any woman could possibly demand , and there are a number of passages in German literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist to-day . As I write these words , the women throughout the Fatherland are petitioning the Reichstag , just now busied with the revisiomi of the civil laws , to grant them privileges which American women have long enjoyed as a matter of course , but which in Germany are looked upon as dangerous innovations . The trouble is that Germany is so much a military state , and so dependent upon the maintenance of the martial spirit , that man has come to be the all-important factor in its affairs . He goes to war , and , if necessary , gives up his life for the country , and consequently , so the argument runs , must remain supreme in home and state . The woman exists merely to bear his children and keep his home in order . To think of her as the equal half in the human unit , as she is likely to become with us , is beyond his ability , and he sneers at our country as the place where men are " under the slippers " of their wives . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon their wives as beasts of burden , which they are entitled to work and punish at discretion ; and it is not so very long ago that German law actually prescribed what punishment a man should inflict on his wife for certain offenses . An entire chapter might be written on the consequences of this low valuation of woman , but suffice it to say here that in the higher classes it makes her but little better than the dull wife that Ibsen 's Nora represents before her revolt , and in the lower classes but little better than a woman of the street . An illegitimate child in the so-called proletariat of Germany is regarded in as commonplace a manner as a legitimate one . It is probably also the military spirit which makes the Germans such a rough people . Taking them as a whole , there is no nation in western Europe with s ' little grace and gentleness , and so much clamor and boisterousness . The aristocracy has , to be sure , a certaii*i veneer and finish , and all the world knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses the hand of his whilom hostess ; but das Volk - the people - are to-day what they have ever been , " shouters in battle . " I can write from a full experience on this point , for I have worked and tramped with the German workingman on his own heath , and he takes the palm for unnecessary and blatant noise . At heart he is a good fellow and capable of sentiments which his outward manners belie , but he talks so loud and handles one so roughly that until one knows him well it is almost impossible to have to do with him . The Germans are also somewhat inclined to be petty and small . They are so crowded together , and so afraid that some one will trample on their rights , that it is fairly impossible for them to overlook little things . Even to - day , with their empire united , they snap and bite at one another nearly as badly as in the days of their disintegration ; and it is no hazardous prophecy to say that unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is in business and social life that one sees the most of this failing . When one asks them why they press small points so closely , they look indignant , and say , " Would you have me give up my rights ? " It ill becomes the Germans to start a movement against the Jews , as some of them are now trying to do . There is no Gentile who possesses a greater talent for dealing with the Jews as one of them than the German . Finally , the German is a GemUthsmensch ; he lives pretty much for and by his feelings . This is both a good trait and a bad one , and the German people show both sides . When it comes to a matter of justice , the German generally acts according to his feelings rather than his sense of practicality , whereas the Anglo-Saxon is more inclined to let cool judgment settle things . This is one of the main differences between these two nationalities , - the German is im pulsive , and the Anglo-Saxon practical . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to govern his prejudices . He has a great many of these , and once formed they become an integral part of his feelings . fo let one go is like parting with one of his senses . These are the main characteristics of the Germans which , in my opinion , do not make for good in the people of our country , and in so far as they are brought over and perpetuated they have a baneful influence upon our life . Both the good traits and the bad , however , undergo a change in our civilization . It would be interesting to consider this change with a view to age and place of settlement , for these are two very important factors ; but the most that I will do here is to indicate roughly some of the more noticeable general variations in character . III . Perhaps the most striking change of all , and one that may be observed in its beginnings , while the immigrants are still huddled together in the steerage of the ships that brought them here , is the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are no legally recognized class distinctions in our country , that all men are equal before the law ; and for the educated among them this change means freedom , for the laborer release *nd escape . In Germany they were subjects ; here they hope to become citizens . Fortunately for us , for it is not easy to manage people so suddenly transplanted from a monarchical to a republican country , they retain for a long time some of the submissiveness which was common to them in the Fatherland . They themselves express this trait by a more euphemistic term , - Gutmi*thigkeit , goodnaturedness , - but it does not meet the case . They are by training a submissive people , and the first generation of // them in a new country can not overcome this characteristic . They try to conform to our laws , and I have failed to find among them , as a class , the vulgarly leveling democracy that is so prominent among the Irish . Although the Germans accept with eagerness our dictum that one man is as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of our immigrants , believe in an aristocracy of feeling ; and it is this which saves them from the impertinence and self - assumption of so many who make their home with us . I have yet to meet the German-American who , because he is a free citizen , believes that no one is above him , in any sense of the word . He does not , to be sure , retain the slavish respect for Herrsehaften that he had in his own land , and when he votes he is glad , if possible , to carry his point ; but position well earned and government liberally executed impress him as much as they did in the Fatherland . Indeed , I should say that they impress him more , for he appreciates them from an entirely different point of view . At home he was compelled to bow down to them ; with us he is free to reason and compromise . As a result , I think he is more of a man in our country than he was at home ; he acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently more independent . There are many Germans in Germany who say that their countrymen here have degenerated politically , that they have become wild and disrespectful ; but I can not agree with them . It is true that they do not kneel before Kaiser and Kaiserinn , as they did in the Fatherland , and that a great many of them would like to see these decorative figures abolished ; but this is a natural consequence of contact with our institutions . Paternal governments are not desired on this side of the water , and I can see no degeneration of our German citizens in their acceptance of the general opinion . German women are also more independent in this country than they were at home . The man is not the almighty creature to them that he was formerly , and they think and act more on their own initiative . Indeed , I have seen them call their husbands to order in a way that in Teutonic homes would be considered treason . They also take a great deal more interest in public questions . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of activity , but they appreciate as they did not before the value of keeping track of things which influence it both directly and indirectly . Physically , however , - and now I am thinking particularly of the second generation , - they are not what they were in the Fatherland . A great many of them are much handsomer , and their intelligence is often keener , but they are not so well built and vigorous . In Mr. Havelock Ellis 's book on Man and Woman there is a good illustration of the change that comes over them . He gives a picture of a German peasant woman alongside that of an American , and the difference observable approaches what I would call attention to in the case of GermanAmerican women born and brought up in this country . As a class they continue more energetic than American women and can do more work , but compared with their counterparts in Germany they seem to me to have degenerated physically . The same , in a way , can be said of the men of the second generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained in the German army , and frequently find it necessary to rely on mere nervous energy to accomplish their work . I ought to say , however , that , as a rule , they accomplish more in a given time than men do in Germany ; they are quicker and less clumsy . Their better financial condition , furthermore , makes them less inclined to petty and small devices . This applies to men , women , and children . They are still close at times , and the Pennsylvania Dutch are notorious for this charac // teristic ; but as a race they press small points less vigorously than they did a generation or two ago . The ease with which they earn money here probably makes them also less industrious . I have not found them as keen , in America , to use every minute as they were at home , yet our greatest temptation , I think , is to rest too little . The Germans eventually ought to have a good influence on our life in this respect . There is much incentive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they did in the older country . Temporary failure to young men of German parentage in the United States does not mean at all what it means to the same class in Germany , where , during certain examination seasons , there is a regular epidemic of suicides simply because of failure to pass . Climate doubtless has something to do with this , but the main cause is fear that a single failure means everlasting fa4ilure . Not many Germans commit suicide in this country merely because they are plucked in a school contest . They acquire too quickly the Yankee 's easy-going nature , and often to their harm . They are not so thorough and painstaking as formerly , and there is often a slonchiness in their manner which is deterioration not to be excused on the ground of Yankee simplicity . It is probably the reaction against the stiff and stereotyped deportment which was demanded of them in their own land . With all their roughness in Germany , they nevertheless must observe certain set rules of etiquette which in this country are not of first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a part of us that they often overdo our freedom and joviality of manner . In Germany , for example , it is the custom among all classes for men to take off their hats to one another in the street ; here this is not generally the case ; and I am sorry to say that even before our German immigrants have landed they are taught manners which no country ought to allow , least of all on the part of its officials . Morally our Germans are a distinct improvement on those in Germany . Perhaps they are not more honest , but they are just as honest , and they are decidedly more virtuous . I have already said that the position of the women is higher , but the men are likewise purer and more respectful of sex relations . The Germans are still inferior to the Irish in this particular , and the native Americans also , I believe , but they have improved on their past to a remarkable degree . In large cities , like New York and Chicago , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the laxness that is characteristic of them at home ; but in the country and in all places where local influences rule they are more respectful of women and marriage than they were before they came to us . This point ought to be emphasized , for one frequently hears the remark that Germans degenerate in every way on this side of the water . Perhaps they do physically , but morally and intellectually they gain more than they lose . One notices this advance most among those who come here as children and in those who are born here . A German boy born and brought up in this country has more general ability than his prototype in the Fatherland ; and although he may not learn as much as the latter , he knows better how to Inanipulate and turn to profit the knowledge that he does acquire . He is also more ingenious , - equal to a trying situation . In Germany the boy is always at a loss what to do when his given rules and maxims fail to meet a particular case , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this respect the German-American boy acquires superior ability to his cousins at home , and he is consequently quicker , sharper , and more versatile . The striking thing , however , in German children born in this country is the ease and almost eagerness with which they // throw off their nationality . Except possibly the Irish , there is no other race which so quickly becomes American and anti-European . In a way the Pennsylvania Dutch are an exception to this rule , but their case is unique . Outside of Pennsylvania and in all communities where American influences predominate , the second generation of Germans give up their nationality ; and in a great many instances it is impossible , try as the parents will , to have them learn their mother tongue . Indeed , there are large towns where they are ashamed , provided they have learned it , to speak German in public . It is the latest German immigrants who make np our so - called " German quarters " and wards , and it is they also whom we hear speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain that their countrymen thus go back on their nationality , " and claim that Germans on other soil become mere fertilizers of other races ; but America gives them a better chance than this . The Pennsylvania Dutch afford pitiful evidence of what they all might have become bad they refused to adapt themselves to local institutions and customs , and it is to their credit that they have made the best of the situation in which they find themselves . There is little likelihood that this situation will change ; the Anglo - Saxon is supreme in America . Now and then one reads that the Germans are trying to introduce their language into schools , and it is taught even now , in certain German communities , almost on a par with English ; but this effort can never lastingly influence our civilization . The time for the Germans to carry the day has passed forever , and while politicians may talk about " the German vote " or any other foreign vote , the native Americans can and will vote it down whenever they combine interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit and loss of the Germans in our civilization , we find the balance leans largely to substantial gains : they have greatly benefited their material welfare ; they are freer and better fitted to stand alone , unpropped by paternal government ; they are more practically intelligent , able , and available ; *aiid they have a development before them which in Germany could never be realized . As to their losses , they have been compelled to give up their nationality ; they have lost sight of a certain refinement , which , say what we will against the Old World Germans , is characteristic of them ; they pay less attention to manners and etiquette than they formerly did ; and finally , they tend to value life and its winnings by a standard which , if not entirely financial , is certainly not so influenced by the ideal spirit as is noticeable in Germany . As our country settles down more and more to a serious way of living , they will change with it , I believe , making its best qualities theirs , and reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and the losses sustained have not been all on one side . We are indebted to them for good , and we have suffered from them harm , and these points deserve careful note and comment . Iv- . Our first and greatest debt to the Germans is for their help in developing our country . It is said of the common German laborer that the minute he lands he is worth to the country fully one thousand dollars . Multiply this figure by the hundreds of thousands who have come over , and it is easy to see how valuable this class alone has been to us . There are trades , such as those of the lithographer , photographer , gardener , locksmith , tailor , carpenter , and baker , in which the Germans in this country comprise fifty per cent of all who are engaged in them . As a people the Germans work more slowly than we do , and in certain branches // where quickness is necessary they are not equal to the demand , but they have contributed a steadying element to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plodding men and women as their fathers were before them , and emigration has not revolutionized them . They have a settled expectation of lines of labor , and this tempers ambition and checks the haste to be rich which does so much to spoil not only our foreigners , but our own people . The German peasants have also helped to make our farm life more sociable . Where they are gathered together , if only by twos and threes , there is a Gemilthlickkeit in their life which other nationalities , except perhaps the Scandinavians , fail to bring with them . Right here we come upon debatable ground . This special feature of German-American social life - its Gemilthliehkeit , an utterly untranslatable word-has become responsible , in the opinion of many , for the " beer garden " and the " Continental Sunday . " It is a question too large to discuss here , whether these institutions are the unmixed evils that our Puritan forefathers would have thought them . But thus much , I think , is true : they have the demerit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprovided for in our system ; consequently , the beer garden in America is not in any degree the respectable place that it is in Germany , nor is the freer American Sunday of late modern times an honorable counterpart of the universal holiday of Germany , - the day when , after church , clergymen , from Luther down to the present day , and church men and women , give themselves equally with the humbler classes to the pleasures and delights of social intercourse and mutual entertainment . In so far as the Germans have transplanted among us institutions that become themselves degenerate by the transplanting , they have done us harm ; but we must remember that the period of transition is ever a difficult , and often a dangerous one . Even had they never come among us , we must inevitably have entered upon such a period in our own life ; and though their views and customs may have complicated some of its problems , they may also help us to solve them . This brings me to consider the points where I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said that we are indebted to them for developing the resources of our country , and we most assuredly are , but they have not always held fast to higher ideals than those of mere business . They lack the mixture of industry and esprit which , say what one will , is more or less characteristic of the native Americans , and are inclined to value life purely in dollars and cents . We ourselves , as a young and struggling nation , are not free from this same pernicious tendency , and it has not helped us to incorporate millions of foreigners , who , after all is said , have come here mainly and specifically to better their finances . Even in his own land , at home in its spirit and institutions , the German is pessimistic toward everything that does not show signs of material profit and worth , and the dearth of material good , as he considers it , sends him to us . It is , consequently , very natural that , with improved prospects , he should give him . self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his particular pursuit of gains .
