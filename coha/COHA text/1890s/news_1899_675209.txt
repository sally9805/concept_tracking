It was found that no more policemen could be secured at the Eldridge Street Station . BLOW AIMED AT MR . DUNLAP . Mr. Dunlap returned to Orchard Street again and took up a stand near Rivington Street .

When it was found possible to start the wagon the policemen told Mr. Dunlap he had better give up and return to the mission . The crowd had become unmanageable , they said , and his life was in danger . " I will not give up until God does , " was Mr. Dunlap 's answer . " This is the work of Mayor Van Wyck . " " We can not save you if this mob becomes any more infuriated , " said Potterman . " You must stop .

Five officers who were sent to the mission drove the crowd away , and the meeting than went on undisturbed . Mr. Dunlap announced at the close of the service that he would discontinue his meetings until he had better police protection . He declared he would consult a lawyer to see what could be done toward forcing Mayor Van Wyck to give him a chance to preach on the cast side .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
