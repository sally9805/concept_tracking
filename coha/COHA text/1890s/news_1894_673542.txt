txt Thomas Stevens , the bicyclist , is on his Way to America . A letter was recently received from him by J. T. Douthitt of the American Tapestry Company , 2S6 Fifth Avenue , which explains why he went East , and gives promise of some interesting news about the Mahatmas when he returns . The letter bears the date , Matheran , India , April 4 , 1894 . In It Mr. Stevens says : Unless you have interested yourself in the Mahatmas , you will find it difficult to realize that they had anything to do with my trip to India . The fact is , I long ago determined that the Mahatmas were but the latest development of a mystery that has been puzzling the people of all ages and of all countries from time immemorial . In all ages there has been a belief In miracles , in " occult phenomena , " and the like . Most of us believe , on faith , in the miracles of the Bible , and good Catholics believe in the miracles of innumerable saints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in the mysterious occult phenomena of Spiritualistic seances , the movement without contact of tables and chairs , the levitation of human beings . &c.; The vast majority of practical people refuse to believe in any of these things , and laugh at them as humbug . It seemed to me about time that somebody should take this matter up and decide the question in a manner that should be convincing to sensible people , one way or the other . After much research and inquiry in London decided that India was the fountain head of the whole mystery . Ever since the first European traveler found his way to India centuries ago we have been hearing of Yogis , Fakirs , and Mahatmas who are able to do certain things apparently in defiance of the laws of nature , as men know them  --  in short , to work miracles . We know now that these Indian magicians were making use of steam in their " miracles " and preserving it as a tremendous secret of nature thousands of years ago . when our ancestors were savages in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new discoveries have long been known to them . That the Yogis still work miracles and do many things as Inexplicable to us as the miracles of the Bible I had no doubt after my researches in England . And , though assured that It would be a hopeless task for a Ferenghl to try and get hold of a wonder-working Yogi and secure any tangible evidence to carry away . I decided that it would be worth trying for , anyhow . I believe that I am not without a certain talent for original and venturesome exploits , and the successes of the past have had the effect of putting me on my mottle In cases where others would not think It worth white to try . You will be pleased to hear that I have met with considerable success . 1 have succeeded in corralling a miracle-working Yogi , and can assure you that I have seen things as remarkable and as difficult to understand as many of the miracles of the Bible . I have made an important discovery that seems to throw a flood of light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles . I am almost bursting with the importance of my discovery . Mr. Stevens will arrive in New-York about May 15.
