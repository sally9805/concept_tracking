A BIT OF INSTRUCTION Was first produced by Mr. Henry Woodruff , at a special performance at Brattee Hall , Cambridge , on February 25 , 1898 . On this occasion , Mr. Woodruff appeared as " Despard " ; and Mr. Harry Gay as " Newbury . " The play was given by Mr. Woodruff , at the Lyceum Theatre , New York , on April 22 , 1898 . Mr. Woodruff then played " Newbury , " and Mr. Robert Edeson was the " Despard . " The play was used by Mr. Woodruff professionally for an extended vaudeville tour , in the autumn of 1898 . The time is the present . The scene is the bachelor apartment of Jack Despard . The time is half-past twelve , of a mid-winter night . Main text The scene is the bachelor sitting-room , of Jack Despard 's lodgings . It is comfortably , even luxuriously furnished , in the manner of a bachelor 's " den . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fireplace , R. , with a bright fire :  --  low bookcases , well filled : lounging-chairs :  --  a table strewn with magazines , etc . The walls are hung with water-color sketches , pipe racks , etc . As the curtain rises , Newbury is discovered , asleep in a large arm-chair , before the fire . The chair is partly concealed from any one entering , by a screen . After a second 's pause , Jack enters . He comes in , somewhat wearily . He wears a handsome , fur-lined coat . He does not see Newbury : his attention being concentrated on the fact that , in addition to the lamp , three gas-jets are in full flame . Jack . Jack Despard Well , upon my soul ! My landlady will land me in the insolvency court , if I do n't get a raise of salary , presently . Does the woman think I 'm running a torchlight parade ? ( Newbury has awaked at the first sound of Jack 's voice , and is sitting sleepily up . Jack sees him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon , Mr.  --  Newbury , is it ? New . Mertoun Newbury Yes ; Newbury  --  Mertoun Newbury , you know . Jack . Jack Despard With a hyphen ? New . Mertoun Newbury I beg your pardon ? ( During this scene , Jack is taking off his topcoat , warming his hands , changing his coat for a smoking-jacket , etc . ) Jack . Jack Despard When there is n't a hyphen , one name goes , you know . When there is , the two names are compulsory . New . Mertoun Newbury ( Stiffly . ) Mertoun is my Christian name . There is no hyphen . Jack . Jack Despard Thanks . ( There is an awkward pause . ) New . Mertoun Newbury You remember seeing me at the Club ? We 've met there several times , you know  --  the St. Dives Club . Jack . Jack Despard Have we ? O , I dare say , I did n't remember your face , for a moment , but one sees such a kaleidoscope of faces , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New . Mert oun Newbury ( Rather explosively . ) Late to-night , are n't you ? Jack . Jack Despard Yes ; rather . Why ? New . Mertoun Newbury O , I 've been waiting an hour or so , I fancy . That 's how I dropped off  --  the room was so warm . Jack . Jack Despard If I had known of your visit  --  New . Mertoun Newbury O , that 's all right . I did n't know myself that I was coming . Just decided to , on the jump , you know . Jack . Jack Despard Yes ? New . Mertoun Newbury Yes . Thought I 'd find you in about half-past eleven , perhaps . Jack . Jack Despard So you would , if the business-manager had n't brought around an infernal pile of photographs for me to sign , for the souvenir matinee . Strange what asses some business managers are . New . Mertoun Newbury Autographed photographs , eh ? Great idea , that . Pull in matinee-girls by the hundred , I dare say . Jack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beg your pardon , but I 'm rather done up . It is late , as you say  --  and matinee day . New . Mertoun Newbury I always supposed you play-actor chaps must rather revel in matinee days . Jack . Jack Despard Do you know any fellows who like working double time ? If you do , I 'll bet a tenner they 're not in our line of work . New . Mertoun Newbury Well , but are n't the matinees the really interesting days ? Fancy playing to an audience of adorers . Jack . Jack Despard If they 're adorers , they conceal it skillfully . I 'd about as soon start out with Nansen , in search of a chill , as play to a matinee audience . New . Mertoun Newbury The matinee maids must keep their warmth for their letters , then , eh ? Jack . Jack Despard Bosh ! When the papers get out of sea-serpent specials they write up matinee letters . They 're a myth , mostly ; though now and then  --  New . Mertoun Newbury ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack . Jack Despard Well , now and then a fellow gets a letter that he 'd like to enclose to a girl 's mother , with a manual on " The Duties of Parents . " New . Mertoun Newbury Bless you ! Most of the mothers have letters of their own . The duties of parents are obsolete , except in manuals . Jack . Jack Despard That view of it had n't struck me . I do n't do the society act enough to keep my morals up to date . New . Mertoun Newbury And the girls in your business ,  --  I wager they 're always getting letters you 'd like to send to the chaps ' fathers ? Jack . Jack Despard N-no . I think I should prefer to talk that sort of letters over with the chaps themselves . ( He takes a riding-whip from the table , as if absent-mindedly , and nervously plays with it . ) New . Mertoun Newbury ( Indicating whip . ) With  --  accessories ? Jack . Jack Despard As you say  --  with accessories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chore , sometimes , you know ? Rafts of the fellows who write ' em are working in the Gym . right along . Jack . Jack Despard Yes . I 've put on the gloves with them there , now and then . New . Mertoun Newbury There ? Jack . Jack Despard Of course . I learned my A B C 's at Harvard , once on a time . New . Mertoun Newbury Harvard ? Why , I did n't know  --  Jack . Jack Despard No . I 've managed to conceal the fact from our press-agent , up to date . Yes , I 've put on the gloves in the old Gym . more times than a few . Great sport ! I say , would n't you like to try a bout , now ? New . Mertoun Newbury Now ? Good Lord ! No . What for ? Jack . Jack Despard O , nothing . I  --  I just thought you might feel like it . I felt like it . You do n't mind my changing my shoes ? ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been doing a society part to-day ; and I never did find tight boots compatible with repose of mind . New . Mertoun Newbury O , that 's all right , Despard . By the way ,  --  that reminds me to ask you something . We had a bet on , down at the Club to-night . Jack . Jack Despard ( With polite boredom . ) Yes ? New . Mertoun Newbury Yes . We were betting about your real name . Do you mind telling me what your real name is ? Jack . Jack Despard ( His exasperation is evidently growing tense . He opens his card-case , and hands Newbury his card . ) My card . New . Mertoun Newbury ( Reads . ) John Randolph Despard . O , but I did n't mean your stage name , you know . Jack . Jack Despard Neither did I. My name 's on that card . Is it necessary , to settle your Club bet , that I send to Virginia for my birth-certificate ? New . Mertoun Newbury Great Scott ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Despard My people rode with Light-Horse Harry . Did you think all actors were raised from bulbs , in window-glasses ? New . Mertoun Newbury Well , it 's no wonder the matinee girls  --  Jack . Jack Despard O , da  --  bless the matinee girls . I say , Newbury , you did n't come here at this ungodly hour to talk about matinee girls , did you ? New . Mertoun Newbury Well , yes  --  perhaps  --  in a way . You see , the fellows at the Club were saying that  --  that it would be a good joke to see one of the real  --  what one of those matinee letters really was like , do n't you know . Jack . Jack Despard ( Rising . ) And they thought I might give them the chance of finding out ? I say , what paper are you reporting for , Newbury ? New . Mertoun Newbury I ? Reporting ? Jack . Jack Despard If you 're not doing the sneak reporter act , what the devil are you doing ? ( They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mert oun Newbury Do you mind telling me what you mean by treating me as if I were an intrusive ass ? Jack . Jack Despard Do you mind telling me how else it would be appropriate for me to treat you ? New . Mertoun Newbury Will you explain yourself ? Jack . Jack Despard How else would you treat a man who , on the strength of a Club introduction , wheels himself , uninvited , into your rooms , at midnight ,  --  asks you whether your name is not an alias ,  --  suggests that you ca n't make your hands keep your head ,  --  winds up by inviting you to turn over to a parcel of Club loungers the confidence a silly girl or two have put in your decency ? New . Mertoun Newbury Why ,  --  I thought  --  being an actor ,  --  Bohemia , you know , and all that  --  Jack . Jack Despard You thought because actors sometimes have to sell their talents in a damned poor market , that we put up our private honor for sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you may find it a costly one . New . Mertoun Newbury ( After a short pause he peels off his right-hand glove , and offers his hand . ) Shake ? Jack . ( Amazed . ) Eh ? New . Mertoun Newbury Shake  --  wo n't you ? You have such a jolly , convincing way of putting things , I thought I 'd like to shake hands with you , do n't you know . O , I 'm an ass , all right , Despard , and I 'm a near-sighted ass ; but when I do see a gentleman , I know the breed . I beg your pardon , Despard . Shake  --  will you ? ( They shake hands , heartily . ) Jack . Jack Despard Have a cigar ? New . Mertoun Newbury Thanks . ( They light cigars . ) Jack . Jack Despard Sit down , wo n't you ? ( They sit . ) Jack . Jack Despard ( Reaching across table . ) I say  --  Shake again , wo n't you ? You see , Newbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact . New . Mertoun Newbury O , that 's all right . From your own standpoint , it was uncommonly kind of you not to pitch me down stairs . I say , one of the things I came in for , you know , was this : I want you to give me a bit of instruction . Jack . Jack Despard Instruction is n't much in my line ; but fire ahead . New . Mertoun Newbury I want to know if you 'll teach me to act , you know . Jack . Jack Despard To act ? O , well , a little thing like that , you know ! ( Looks at watch . ) Quarter to one . Do you think you could give me till half-past four ? With a college education as a foundation , you know , you really ought , ... ... New . Mertoun Newbury Do n't chaff . I 'm in a beastly hole . You see , my cousin Ethel Marlborough  --  well , she really is n't my cousin , you know , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you could skip the Creation , old fellow , and come to the Deluge  --  New . Mertoun Newbury O , well , all right . You see , my cousin Ethel is getting up a fair . Jack . Jack Despard I sympathize with her relations . New . Mertoun Newbury And she 's determined to have one night of theatricals ; and , hang it , you know , I 've got to act . Jack . Jack Despard I transfer my sympathy to your relations . New . Mertoun Newbury Yes ; I 've got to act , because there 's only one Ferdinand costume , and I 'm the only fellow it will fit . Jack . Jack Despard " Ferdinand ? " Great Shakespeare ! You do n't mean that you are going to tackle " The Tempest " ? New . Mertoun Newbury O , but we are , then . You see , Ethel has written a play , and we were going to give that ; but she thought we did n't have time to do it justice , and we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , perhaps he could bear it better . He 's been dead a long time . New . Mertoun Newbury We 're just going to do a scene or two , you know . Ethel has been wild to have a go at Miranda , ever since she saw Ada Rehan do her , you know . Jack . Jack Despard Yes  --  naturally . And you 're Ferdinand ? New . Mertoun Newbury Yes . Damned hard luck , is n't it ? Jack . Jack Despard O , I do n't know . As I said , the author has been dead a long time . New . Mertoun Newbury O , hang it ! I say , do n't chaff . I mean bad luck for me . But I ca n't quit . The costume is such a dizzy fit ; and then , you know , Ethel 's to do Miranda ; and there are speeches that  --  well , you know , the family would n't like any one not a relation , .... Jack . Jack Despard Such as a cousin by marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . She came into the family when she was in pinafores . And now , you see , I 'm in for it ; and I do n't want to look a bigger fool than I can help . Jack . Jack Despard You naturally wouldn't.  --  No . New . Mertoun Newbury And I thought you might be able to give me a leg up , in the log-rolling scene . Jack . Jack Despard Log-rolling scene is good  --  sounds political . New . Mertoun Newbury Hang it . Do n't chaff . Will you , or wo n't you ? Jack . Jack Despard O , I will  --  I will . If there is anything on earth I find soothing and refreshing , it is teaching an amateur . Want to start in now ? New . Mertoun Newbury Might as well , eh ? Jack . Jack Despard Come  --  business , business . ( Pushes centre-table back , leaving clear space . ) Where 's Shakespeare ? ( Rummages among books on shelf . ) New . Mertoun Newbury Yes ; you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best Wellesley slant , and I 've made out about one word in ten .

( Hands him Indian Club :  --  business of getting it poised on his shoulder . ) Come , now , Ferdinand , your lines  --  your lines . New . Mertoun Newbury " There be some spots are painful  --  " ( He rubs shoulder . ) Jack . Jack Despard Good Lord ! What ? Say that again . New . Mertoun Newbury " There be some spots are painful  --  " That means his shoulder , does n't it , where he 's carrying logs ? I supposed so ; that 's why I rubbed it . Jack . Jack Despard The line happens to be , " There are some sports are painful  --  " New . Mertoun Newbury " Sports "  --  " Spots " ? Hang Ethel 's writing ! I 've learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in the whole confounded speech I understood . I thought the beggar had lamed himself , piling up logs , do n't you know ? Hang it , Despard ! He says he 's lame . Does n't he say he 's piling up logs " upon a sore injunction " ? Jack . Jack Despard ( In ecstasies of laughter . ) O , read it that way  --  read it that way . A new reading is a precious thing , you know ; and it 's not much queerer than some of the new Juliets . New . Mertoun Newbury I say  --  Let 's skip that speech , anyhow . What I really want to coach up on is that rigmarole he has to reel off to Miranda . They 've run it all together for me , you know , because they say that if Miranda once stopped me I 'd never get up steam again . Ethel wo n't have me in it at any price ; she says I make love like a cigar-store Indian . Jack . Jack Despard Apparently she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O , my father . I 've broke your head  --  " Jack . Jack Despard Hold up ! In the name of Stratford , what 's the matter with your text ? New . Mertoun Newbury ( Aggrievedly showing MS . ) Confound it , man , see for yourself . " O , my father , I 've broke your head to  --  " Jack . Jack Despard Man alive , that 's the cue  --  that 's Miranda 's speech . New . Mertoun Newbury Well , why in Heligoland do n't she say " cue " ? And , besides , Miranda did n't break her father 's head , did she ? Jack . Jack Despard Not according to Shakespeare . She says she " broke her father 's best "  --  her father 's " best "  --  behest  --  command , you know . New . Mertoun Newbury I wish she 'd talk English , then . I do n't care what it is , as long as I do n't have to break it . ( Reads speech with queer effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Admired Miranda  --  Indeed the top of admiration worth  --  What 's dearest in the worldfull many a lady I have I have eyed with best regard and many a time . The harmony of their tongues .  --  Hath into bondage Brought my too  --  too  --  " something-or-other " ears for several virtues . " ( Out of breath . ) Whew ! How does the thing go on ? I say , Despard , what gestures go with that kind of speech  --  eh ? Jack . Jack Despard On my soul , Newbury , I do n't know . New . Mertoun Newbury Well , no matter ; we can pick them out afterward . Let 's see  --  O  --  " I have liked several women ? Never ! with so full soul But some defect in her did quarrel ; But , O you !

Why , the chap was n't a real chap , you know . Jack . Jack Despard Man , he was realer than you or I ; and he 'll last a blamed sight longer . Put yourself in the fellow 's place , ca n't you ? That 's what you 've got to do  --  not stand up there like a graven image , reeling off lines out of a book . Ca n't you see them there ,  --  him and the girl ? It 's morning , you know ,  --  the sea 's out there  --  ( New . turns bewilderedly to see where. )  --  the sea , all shining in the sun ;  --  and she 's standing there ,  --  just a girl , you know  --  just a girl  --  with a girl 's eyes ;  --  just a slip of a thing , all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the white stuff falling back from her soft , pure little throat , and her yellow hair all blowing about in the seawind , ... New . Mertoun Newbury ( In a daze . ) I say , will she look like that ? Jack . Jack Despard She did look like that ,  --  she will look like that  --  thank God and Shakespeare  --  as long as youth is youth . And you stand there , worshiping her , and aching for her ;  --  and one minute you want to crush her  --  here  --  ( With a motion of straining a woman to his breast. )  --  and the next , you want to grovel there at her little feet , and cry your heart out ; and her big eyes are pitying you ,  --  and something else  --  and she herself does n't know what else  --  and it 's going to be yours to teach her  --  yours , and no other man 's on God 's earth  --  and your heart just tears itself to your lips  --  and you say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  worth What 's dearest in the world .  --  Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard ; and many a time The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear : for several virtues Have I liked several women : never any With so full soul , but some defect on her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owned , And put it to the foil : but you ,  --  O you ,  --  So perfect and so peerless , art created Of every creature 's best .  --  Hear my soul speak . The very instant that I saw you did my heart Fly to your service :  --  there  --  " New . Mertoun Newbury O , for God 's sake  --  stop it , ca n't you ? Jack . Jack Despard ( In his turn bewildered . ) Stop what ? New . Mertoun Newbury I ca n't stand it ! O , I see now ,  --  I understand it  --  she could n't help it . Poor little Ethel  --  she could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad .

Jack Despard ( In cold anger and amazement . ) Do you mind telling me , Newbury , what you are talking about ? New . Mertoun Newbury Talking about ?  --  I 'm talking about my cousin Ethel . Jack . Jack Despard Your cousin Ethel ? New . Mertoun Newbury My cousin Ethel  --  the poor little girl who 's been looking at you ,  --  and you know it  --  who 's been looking at you for weeks , with just such eyes as  --  as you said  --  my cousin Ethel  --  the girl who wrote you that letter that I  --  Jack .

Why , do you mean to say  --  Jack . Jack Despard I mean to say , my dear fellow , that I suppose at a hundred or so matinees a year there are a hundred or so such girls ; and I never saw one of them . New . Mertoun Newbury But you said you never had heard of her ; and she signed her full name to that letter she sent you ; she told Kit so . Jack . Jack Despard What letter ? New . Mertoun Newbury She told my sister Kit about it . Kit told me . She 's no sneak , Kit ; she 's an awfully good sort ; but she 's older than Ethel ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent that letter .
