txt IN former times , when the waging of battle , offensive or defensive , seemed to be the principal , or , at least , the most important occupation of men , the soldier was naturally the most honored among them . History is largely made up of the exploits of soldiers ; not only because the successful soldier has been regarded as the highest and noblest type of man , but chiefly because upon the arbitrament of war largely depended mental , moral , and social development . In these days the changes going on in the condition of man depend much more upon machinery and machinists ; even our wars being now largely contests of machines against machines , as anyone may see who visits a modern naval vessel , for instance , and notes the fact that it is literally a monster fighting machine of the most complex character-the turning of a small crank , the movement of a lever , or the touching of a button , causing this machine to perform its appointed tasks . Turning from war to more peaceful pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally prominent position , it being now the fact , not so generally recognized as it should be , perhaps , that our magnificent and world-feeding crops of corn and wheat , are largely machine products so far as mans s agency in their production is concerned ; nearly everything necessary to their production , from the preparation of the ground to the seeding , cultivating , harvesting , transporting , and final preparation for food being done by machinery ; much of it driven by steam-engines , and a very large proportion of it entirely automatic in its action . There are sufficient reasons , probably , why the machinist will never be so highly regarded , relatively , as the soldier has been , even though his work A Foreman Explaining a Detail to a Workman . THE MACHINIST . By Fred J. Miller . // becomes far more important ; but it is quite certain that his importance and usefulness are being better understood as the world 's work and our modern civilization depend more and more upon him . And this ought to be especially true in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other land , and where the first thought , upon the introduction of any new industry or any new and desirable article , is not , Can we find men , women , and children to do the work at a profit-permitting cost , but , Can our machinists build for us machines for doing the work ? Hand-rolled cigarettes were smoked by Spaniards and Cubans for many years before the custom began to prevail in this country ; but when the demand arose for them here , machines for making them were almost immediately devised , and in a Waterbury machine shop about one hundred and fifty of such machines have been built ; most of them capable of making two hundred and ten cigarettes per minute , though others make but sixty - perhaps because they are employed upon a " strictly hand - made " brand ; the machine , however , closely imitates hand work , and thus , I suppose , satisfies the youths who imagine that the portrait of the maker is enclosed in every package . This is not mentioned as an especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being one of the latest , and perhaps also one of the most difficult , problems solved by him in his neverceasing effort to do by machinery what others have been apparenty satisfied to do by hand . No matter what we may wish to accomplish within the limits fixed by nature 's laws , the machinist stands ready to lend his mighty aid . To the humblest and to the noblest service of man , his work is alike applicable . A product of the machinist 's art pares apples for a farmer 's wife , another propels a mighty ship around the world , while still another , placed at the top of Mount Hamilton and used to control the motions of a lens , strengthens and extends our vision more than thirtythousand-fold into the mysteries of space . But it is to be observed that while all these are machines for the construction of which the machinist is alike , primarily , to be credited , there is this difference between them , that while such machines as the marine engine or the Lick telescope , requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are constructed by the machinist himself , the apple-parer and other machines made in very large numbers , are not made directly by the machinist , who only constructs the first or the first few machines of the desired pattern , which , in shop parlance , are called the model machines ; he then further constructs the special tools , appliances , and machinery by which the model machine can be duplicated in infinite numbers ; after which his work in such manufacturing operations is that of supervision , inspection , renewal , and repairs of tools and special machinery ; such men , though pri In Line at the Tool-room. // manly machinists , being known in the factories as " tool-makers , " while the men who do the direct work upon the machines are , for the most part , those who have learned to do only one , or , at most , a few operations , many of which , when combined , produce the completed machine , be it an apple-parer , a reaper , a rifle , a sewing-machine , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system being that a watch is no longer the product of a watchmaker , but of the machinist , who designs and constructs the special machinery for producing watches , and directs its operation . As will be readily surmised , the very highest grade of skill is required for such work as this , the chief requirements for its accomplishment , besides this skill , being patience and that degree of conscientiousness which will not allow a man to permit a piece of work to leave his hands until he can o further improve it . For it is to be remembered that , notwithstanding all we hear of the vast superiority of machine over hand work , this machinery must itself possess as great , if not greater , accuracy and refinement than the product manufactured by it . No machine can , in this respect , be superior to its maker ; it can only produce sufficiently accurate and good work at a lower cost than if made by him . The first sewing-machine of a kind , built by skilled machinists or tool-makers , is at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by machinery , and the same men can duplicate it more exactly than can any machinery ; but machines built thus would cost far more than people could afford to pay for them ; and that is all there is to the talk of the substitution of the " certainty and accuracy of machinery for the uncertainty and inaccuracy of hand-work . " But y o u r genuine skilled machinist would not care to work at manufacturing sewing - machines for the market , even if people could afford to pay for sewing-machines thus produced , for he abhors work that is drudgery , and that involves repetition of the same operation o v e r and over again . lJnskilled men can be trained to do such work well enough , while he prefers to work at something not manufactured in large numbers , something which calls for the exercise of his judgment , skill , and ingenuity at every step of its progress ; the making of a complicated and novel machine presenting new problems to be solved in its construction ; work , in short , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that machines can never be A Workman 's Device for a Hot Luncheon-Heating Coffee on Red-hot Steel . // // endowed with , and the lack of which prevents them , for instance , from being able to produce so apparently simple a matter as a perfectly plane surface the best they can do being an approximation to this which , when necessary , is brought to perfection by the highly skilled hand labor of the machinist , applying the principle by virtue of which no three surfaces can each fit both the others accurately , unless all are perfect planes . Machines , however , usually improve on such hand-work , as is done in large quantities by comparatively unskilled be imagined as an occupation for sentient beings , more laborious , monotonous , and uninteresting . The machinist has recently developed and is now perfecting a machine which cancels more than ten stamps to the man 's one , and does it so that the stamp showing the time and place of mailing can actually be read ; thus accomplishing the purpose for which the work is done ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional or very rare attainment . In a strict sense , a machinist is one who is skilled in the art of building Casting . qwq pointed work . If he be also capable of making the drawing , he is so much the better machinist ; and , in fact , a very large proportion of the best machinists are in these days also draughtsmen-not the sort of draughtsmen whose work the general public is familiar with , but makers of drawings composed of conventional arrangements of lines , which to the initiated tell everything , but to the uninitiated mean nothing whatever ; such a drawing-an excellent one , of a steam-boiler-having been actually interpreted by a young lady as a plan of a freight-yard , showing the location of the tracks and switches . The larger cities have , for a long time , offered to young and ambitious machinists , and machinists ' apprentices desiring to learn drawing and mathematics , superior advantages in their night schools and special evening classes ; but this is an advantage which is fast disappearing by the establishment of similar institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by machinists ' apprentices and young machinists more than by any other trades , for the reason that the importance of a knowledge of such things is more plainly seen in that trade than in any other , with one or two possible exceptions . With the knowledge of drawing goes also the importance of some knowledge of mathematics , and the machinist who would attain the highest success must , whether a developed mathematician or not , be possessed of a mathematical mind ; for machinery is the embodiment of mathematics , every movement of every machine being a demonstration of mathematical laws . It is not meant to say that the machinist must necessarily understand or even be aware of the existence of all of these , or that he must be acquainted with differential and integral calculus ; but he must at least have the mathematical faculty to enable hirim to readily grasp and understand the principles and method of operation of an intricate machine , even before the machine is constructed ; and merely by an inspection of the combination of geometrical figures known as a mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gauging Fine Work . // developed from boys who conceive in early life more or less of a passion for machinery . They are the boys who are always sure to be present , to their own imminent peril , where pile-drivers , excavators , dredges , and other heavy and powerful machines are being used . They envy the locomotive engineer ; imagine him a hero , and necessarily an altogether superior being , unhampered by the ordinary weaknesses of poor humanity ; an opinion which is somewhat modified when , in after-years , the boy , now grown , has learned to construct locomotives ; when former wonders and mysteries of the machine have become every-day and familiar companions , and he sees bow great a proportion of the necessary repairs upon locomotives are occasioned by the very human limitations and fallibility of the men who manage them . The machinist 's work , unlike that of the carpenter , the mason , and others , is not done where its doing can be much seen by the public , and for this reason , as much perhaps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but little understood or appreciated by the great body of the people . They comprehend the processes of wood turning and planing , because they see them done and perceive their utility . It is not so easy for them to understand that iron , steel , and other metals must be worked by similar or analogous processes , while cold , in order to remove the unavoidable imperfections of the forgings and castings , and fit them to become parts of intricate yet smooth-working mechanisms . But machinists in doing this work must use tools adapted to the more refractory materials ; and instead of their lathe tools , for instance , being wooden - handled chisels held easily in the hand of the operator , as in wood-turning , they must be heavy and strong bars of the best and hardest steel , supported entirely by the machine itself , yet in such manner as to permit adjustment and control by the workman , and , in the heavier machines , capable of withstanding a strain of tons . The speed , too , must be much slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cutting speed per minute being seldom exceeded . What these machines lack in speed , however , they make up in strength and pow*r , their movements being so regular , so quiet , so apparently deliberate , yet irresistible , as to be very impressive to one who beholds them for the first time . And they probably have their influence upon the men who guide and control them ; for it is noticeable that the men who manage such machinery are , as a rule , quiet , contemplative , methodical , systematic , and almost entirely free from every trace of nervousness or impulsiveness . The operation of the law of natural selection and survival of the fittest may have something to do with this , however , for there is probably no place where a man who has not absolute control of his nerves is more completely out of place than in a machine shop , where the movements of men , to be effective , must be , in a sense , rhythmic with those of machines , moving with the regularity and precision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor hesitation when meeting tons of resistance . The machinist 's work is rarely laborious , and much of it the opposite ; many of the tools he uses having been developed by members of the craft into machines which are mainly or quite automatic in action , and are in fact called " machine tools** to distinguish them from the simpler tools used in the hand . Though the selfacting. features of these tools have for their main object greater steadiness and smoothness of operation than would be possible without them , they have resulted in other benefits ; not the least of these being the relief afforded from tedious and tiresome tasks which would , by inducing fatigue , in a measure unfit the workman for those delicate manipulations which are necessary in measuring and gauging fine work , and in which a steady nerve and a uniformly sensitive touch are vitally important . This will be the more readily understood when it is considered that many , and perhaps most , of the measurements made in machine shops are those known as " contact measurements , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to the desired size and then the sense of touch depended upon to // ( Showing electric cranes. ) // qwq // qwq him the machine is a real work of art , though one which only he fully understands and appreciates . To such an extent is this feeling of devotion to his art for its own sake sometimes developed , that the machinist has been known to despise the production of what in paintings are mere " pot boilers ; " and a famous machinist , in response to a friendly inquiry as to how matters were progressing in his shop , said : " Well , for some time past we have been so busy that we have accomplished nothing worth speaking of ; we have been just building engines and making money , and I am tired of it ; " a complaint utterly unintelligible to the purely commercial mind , but delightfully expressive to him who has much genuine appreciation of the peculiar charms of mechanical science . Machinery constantly teaches and impresses the fact that there is a cause for every effect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly comprehend underlying principles . The machinist who should attempt to correct or perfect the operation of a complicated machine by mere guess work alone , might easily try a thousand adjustments or modifications without hitting upon the right one . He knows this , and when in doubt as to what to do , thinks about it until he feels reasonably certain that he knows what to do . The mechanical mind is naturally , or by training and necessity , a reasoning mind . The machinist has a most clear and comprehensive grasp of the truth that " there is no effect without a cause ; " it is a necessary part of his work to reason from one to the other , the fact that much valuable property , many precious lives , and , what is often a still more potent stimulus , his reputation as a mechanic , may depend upon his correct reasoning , teaching him caution and to be sure of his ground . The wonder of the lay mind is often excited by a published interview with a locomotive engineer , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during which they refuse to respond to ordinary methods of management , and must be humored in various ' ways ; sometimes even going so far in their VOL .

Newspaper reporters , and even the less skilled and more imaginative locomotive engineers , may believe this , or the equally nonsensical theory that two locomotives built in every respect precisely alike may not behave alike , and that while one may be a good machine , satisfactory . in every respect , the other may never work properly . But no machinist ever believes such stories , for it is of the essence of his vocation that identical combinations of identical pieces of metal , will , with the same management , uniformly produce identical results , and when they apparently do not , that there is a good and sufficient cause for it - a cause which it often becomes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns the machinist is almost unknown and , indeed , usually entirely so , except through such specimens of his handiwork as may occasionally be brought into them . The millwright builds and repairs the gristmill , which is driven by a water-wheel , and the small boy with wheels and cranks in his head must satisfy himself with such providential periods of worship at this shrine as the exigencies of school holidays , the family wood-pile , and the good-natured tolerance or temporary relaxation of vigilance on the part of the miller will permit . He watches the miller , envies him , and wonders how he can be interested in such commonplace affairs as the texture and quality of flour or meal , or in the latest gossip from Brown 's Corners brought to the door by loquacious farmers ; when it is his glorious privilege to spend his entire time , if he chooses , in contemplation of the wondrous beauties of revolving wheels A memorable occasion is that when the stream , which , by its fortuitous descent from a higher to a lower level , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last begins to show the effect of forest cutting and of ground drainage and fails , giving way to a steamengine // which comes from the city to take its place . The miller then sinks into inglorious eclipse , while the machinist who comes from the city machine shop to set up and start the mysr* - * 4 . , * * * Postage Stamp Cancelled by Hand terious engine , becomes the hero of the town . One such transformation that fortunately took place during the long summer vacation , made a lasting impression upon the mind of one small boy , who , deeply interested , hung upon every word of the wonder-working creator of machinery and fairly worshipped him , until at the last , when , steam being turned on , it was found that , by some miscalculation of the gearing , the mill turned backward , and the ludicrous element in the scene and in the faces of the men who had expected it to turn f orward , appealed . * so strongly to LuJUL2/Z ' the risibilities of Z 3 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am bound to say discreetly , r e - tire to where he could laugh without danger of being detected . In the excitement which followed , the machinist , changing the eccentric to reverse the direction of motion of the engine , jammed his finger slightly , and , happening to look around , discovered the ghost of a suppressed smile upon the face of the small boy , who was immediately banished from the presence in sorrow and disgrace ; a banishment which , however , was but temporary , and did not prevent his seeing the subsequent starting of the wheels in the good old way in which the waterwheel had been wont to drive them-a thing which the village wiseacres had been quietly assuring each other the new - fangled engine could never be made to do . Afterward , when the small town has grown somewhat , and the use of the steam-engine has increased , a machine shop is added to its industries , and the natives then begin to understand something of the nature of the difference between castings and forgings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain some idea of what is nicant by truly cylindrical and plane surfaces ; how they are produced in machine construction , and why they are necessary ; though usually such things have not the meaning in the country repair shop that they have in places where the finest machinery is constructed , and where the closest possible approach to mathematical exactness is often not too great a degree of refinement . To the country shop comes the farmer with his reaper , that is ahnost invariably shamefully abused , and given no attention whatever until it utterly refuses to work ; this usually occurring in the midst of harvest , when the over- The New Way by Machinery . ripe grain demands that the machine shall resume its clattering march as soon as possible ; and the bill for repairs is probably never quite understood by the farmer , who can not see why there should be so much difference between the value of such work and that done in building fences , or in breaking coltswhich , to his mind , require a far higher grade of skill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - machine engine , who doffs his suit of bed-ticking overalls and lays in a Hupply of country grocery cigars // for the trip to town , to " see if that there machinist can tell what 's the matter with this ingyne . " But when he gets there the chances are he knows a great deal more about the trouble with the engine , and how to fix it , than the combined wisdom and experience of all the machinists in the universe could tell him ; and while this particular machinist goes over the machine with a view to discovering its ailments , he is entertained by a discourse on the design , construction , repair , and management of engines , which , for exhaustiveness , self - complacency , and utter hopeless ignorance , has no parallel except in similar discourses delivered at the doors of other country machine shops by similarly equipped engineers . Such an engineer will complacently and innocently explain how much he has improved the action of the engine by the insertion of a block of wood between the cross-head pin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " all in blissful ignorance of the fact that , by this boast he shows that he is unable to detect the wearing away and actual loss of the rod-brass , an important part of the engine  --  a part the loss of which would , in fact , wreck almost any engine in which economy of steam-consumption , and about everything else , had not been sacrificed to obtain the one quality of being able to keep in motion under the most adverse conditions of abuse and neglect Another one will complain of the piston - rod heating , under the mistaken impression that this is not the proper thing for piston - rods to do . These men are not worse than others who possess that amount of knowledge which , since the days of Pope , has been recognized as a dangerous thing .

The machinist who works for daily wages lives much as other wageworkers do ; regards as scarcely attainable luxuries things which many others - not wage-workers -- look upon as the common necessaries of life ; but nearly always possesses an ambition born of the fact that his employment is one which demands a high order of intelligence in those who follow it with any degree of success , and holds out ample inducement in the way of honors , social position , and competence to those who attain its highest places . It is a vocation which no one need forsake for a wider field in which to exercise superior mental ability . Like all true sciences , the science of machinery is one which seems to broaden the horizon as one rises in it , and no man ever yet could truthfully say that he knew more than a small part of what there is to be known about machinery . No vocation , perhaps , better repays study in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus to investigation and study . The demand for technical books and journals is an active one among machinists , and their own contributions to that literature are highly creditable to them , showing plainly the evidence of study and logical thought . This natur // ally results from such facts as that there are machine tools , regularly used by machinists , that have , accompanying each , a book dealing with the deeper problems involved in their operation ; a book which necessarily contains a considerable amount of applied mathematics and has very complete tables of tangents , sines , etc. , for convenience in solving the problems presented in connection with the work . This characteristic of his employment is reflected in the man , and its influence is seen in every domestic and social relation . There are numerous communities - usually noted for their production of the finest machinery , or its products-in which the machinist occupies much the same relative social position as that of teachers and professors in a college or university town . In the ordinary factory village the machinist is very weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even to a thousand , employees , most of whom are engaged directly upon the factories ' products . Here his work usually is supervisory and largely inventive in character . It is his business to see that everyone of the thousand or more intricate and often delicate machines used is kept in proper condition for doing perfect work , and he must so thoroughly understand all these machines and their working , as to be able largely to anticipate defective action and apply the appropriate remedy ; which , oftentimes , may be likened to the most heroic surgical operationsremedies which are often designed not merely to restore the machine to its normal condition of efficiency , but to improve it much beyond the standard of its original builder . The machinist 's studio , as he sometimes facetiously styles the workshop set apart for his use , either within the main factory building or near it , is really a hospital for disabled machines , where they are usually to be found in all stages of many ailments , varying from constitutional defects , or general debility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of important members , the result of acci ( lent or abuse . Here come the complaints and calls for assistance from every department where machines are used . Something goes wrong with an important machine , and it refuses to do its work ; its work is of the greatest importance , and something must be done at once , or the entire factory may be obliged to shut down . Our machincry hospital then receives one of its emergency calls , and the doctor when he arrives must be able to decide at a glance not only what the matter is , but the cure , and how long it will take to bring it about . Sometimes this is the work of but a few moments , while under other circumstances , days anda more unpleasant feature - nights , perhaps , of hard work , physical and mental , are required before the machine can be again put into service . Men in such positions have large responsibilities of life as well as property , and must possess qualities that distinguish them somewhat , and that also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility and trust . There are opportunities for such men to go into business for themselves by setting up machine shops in factory towns , where they may get the work of such factories as , by reason of their comparative smallness , or , for some other cause , do not find it advantageous to maintain machine shops of their own . It is not , however , so easy for the machinist to get started in business for himself as is the case with some other artisans , because the equipment of a shop is necessarily expensive , and when this equipment is in his possession , it can not be made to pay unless it be kept quite regularly employed ; which means that a shop prepared to do almost any kind of work presented , must have enough work to keep several men employed about all the time ; machine tools and power plant , both of which are necessities , imposing , when idle , a very serious burden in the form of what are known as " fixed charges , " i.e. , charges against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any event , regardless of the amount of work done , and which consist of such items as interest on investment , rent , insurance , maintenance , etc. - In the railroad town the machinist performs much the same office with re // spect to locomotive and train service ; a great deal depending upon his knowing what to do , and how and when to do it . Here the character of his duties usually requires that he be in readiness to be called upon at any time . In the round house there is always employed the regular " night gang , " which includes a number of machinists whose duties consist of making such slight repairs as may readily be made during a few hours of darkness , made visible by a brace of kerosene-burning torches , remarkable much more for their smoking than for their illuminating powers . But the other men employed in the round-house and in the " back shops " by day , may be called out in emergencies from bed , from church , or even from a visit to their sweethearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go on forever , and locomotives must be ever ready to pull them . If a rod - brass heats during a run , or if anything else about the engine goes wrong , the engineer very properly sacrifices every other consideration to making his time , and leaves the defects to be permanently remedied at the end of the run by the machinists . Usually the defects are real enough , but it is a regular article of faith with the machinist to charge that many of the complaints entered against engines by their runners are founded upon imaginary defects , and many of the jobs of repairing are accordingly equally imaginary ; experience showing that the imaginary repairs often completely cure the imaginary defects  --  a simple case of adapting the remedy to the disease-something which all true machinists make a specialty of . Another effect of the circumstance that the machinist is not so much in evidence as other men , is seen in his connection with railroad work . We see the locomotive engineer , for instance , and understand something of the important duties he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception of the importance of the work of the machinist in making and keeping in repair the locomotive and its appurtenances . To the travelling public it is as important that the engineer should have an engine ready to respond to his guidance as that the engineer himself should be ready to perform his duty ; but the highly skilled and exacting work of the machinist , executed perhaps at night , and often under the most disadvantageous and discouraging conditions , yet necessary to be performed in order that the resplendent machine may be able to take out its early morning express , is little thought of , because unseen . The captain of an ocean steamer is directly associated with the passengers , and impresses them with his importance . In their eyes the safety of the ship with all it contains , and her safe and speedy arrival in port , depend primarily and almost solely upon him . The fact is thaf in these days of floating machines the speed and safety of a sea - voyage depend equally , if not more , upon a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among her complement of officers , and who , under the title of engineers , are responsible for things in the engine- and boiler-rooms . Sometimes , but not often , the passengers are brought to a vivid realization of this truth . A few months since two hemispheres awaited in deepest anxiety tidings from one of the largest and most important trans-Atlantic steamships , days overdue , and with many valuable lives on board . In this case Chief Engineer Tomlinson with his assistants , by their watchfulness , not only detected the fracture of the shaft through its effect upon the running of the engine before it had become totally destructive , but working night and day with insufficient room , materials , and appliances , succeeded , by virtue of skill and ingenuity of a high order , combined with absolute devotion to duty , in repairing the shaft and running the engines until port was reached - winning victory in a contest with the elements where many hundreds of human lives were the prize to be won or lost . It was not the captain who , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , invoking Heaven 's choicest blessings upon their deliverer , but it was the machinist , who , bearing the title of Chief Engineer , had done simply what the duties and // responsibilities of his position called upon him to do . And the facts are as this machinist has stated them ; he did nothing more than his duty , nor better than almost any competent machinist and engineer would have done under like circumstances . Snch machinists as he , who first gain their experience in building engines for steamships , are employed to run them afterward , for the very reason that it is known that serious and disabling accidents may be avoided by their skilled watchfulness , or that when the well-nigh inevitable emergency arises , a competent , a masterful man may be there to meet it . How little the skill required for such service and the weight of responsibility borne are sometimes appreciated is shown by the experience of another engineer , this time of a modern freight steamer , whose shaft broke in such a manner as to make its repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where twelve days of unremitting labor by the machinists were required before the vessel could proceed . In this case no passengers were aboard to generously award credit where credit was due , and little or no notice was taken of the feat even by the owners and underwriters who were saved many thousands of dollars by it . In another case , where an especially fast trip was made because the engineer stood by his engines almost constantly , day and night , nearly wearing himself ont in the effort of seeing to it that every possible revolution was gotten out of them , while the captain valiantly wore his beautiful uniform and did about as usual , the " commander of the vessels ' was rewarded by $50 a month increase of pay , while the engineer , to whom the fast trip was almost entirely if not solely due , was presented with a new hat . Mining being so largely done by machinery , there is , of course , necessity for the machinist 's services wherever regular and systematic mining operations are carried on ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California , Nevada , and Colorado gold and silver mines , as well as those farther East from which the more prosaic but also more useful coal , iron , and copper are taken . His experience in a Western mining country is , of course , different from that in any other locality , and different also from that of any other men who have to do with mining ; blending , as it does , the rongh-and-tumble life of the frontier with the practice of an art not wholly indigenous , but transplanted from entirely different conditions . To hold his own among the miners , the machinist must not only know his own business , but a good deal of mining besides , and must especially be resourceful , selfreliant , and quick in deciding upon a line of action im an emergency . Most of the work of machinery in connection with mining is in hoisting ore from the mine , freeing the mine of noxious gases , or in pumping from it the water which would otherwise more or less quickly flood it and stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface lets down the supplies and tools , and serves also as a means of bringing up and letting down the men when a change of " shifts occurs . The operation of a mine and the lives of those who work in it therefore depend largely upon the machinery and its efficient working . For these the machinist must be in a large measure , if not solely , responsible , and many are the occasions when much valuable property and numbers of lives depend upon his correct action , with perhaps but an instant to decide what that action shall be . Most mines rapidly fill with water when pumping stops , and it is sometimes necessary to so place the plant of pumping machinery that if it fails to work but for a short time , not only the mine but the machinery itself becomes submerged and useless . In such a case pumping must never cease for any considerable period of time , day or night ; and when anything occurs to stop it , the urgency of the call received by the machinist may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to remove the difficulty before the plant disappears under the rising flood and a supplementary plant , at a cost of many thousands of dollars , becomes necessary to lower the water-level to a point which will enable the original plant to be re // paired and again put into service . Such a pumping plant must , like the work-refusing convict who is placed in a tank in which the water steadily rises , pump or be overwhelmed . On a certain bitterly cold day , a pump on one of the lower levels of a Colorado mine refused to work , and the machinist called to diagnose and treat its malady found , after going several hundred feet down the ladder to the shaft , almost in contact with hot steam pipes and in an atmosphere much like that of a Russian bath , that the fastrising water had already nearly submerged the pump , and there was no time to lose . Standing in water up to his waist , he was forced to adopt the blind man 's method of gaining information , and by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty . Having found it , the remedy , which involved still greater difficulties and several temporary suspensions of respiration , was effected just as the rising water reached the level of his chin ; and the pump , being started to work , soon brought itself to view . Then followed a weary climb to the top , burdened with saturated clothes which there had , been no time to remove , and a walk of half a mile at the surface , during which the saturated clothing was frozen hard and stiff . Twenty thousand dollars ' worth of machinery was saved by this , besides much valuable time during which the mine would have been entirely unproductive . There is legal warrant for comparing the services of a machinist with those of a physician or surgeon-at least when the machinist is employed in a mining country-as is shown by the fact that such a machinist , being called for jury duty , pleaded the exemption of a physician , and , in answer to the judges s incredulity , stated that he was a doctor of pumps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless in that country and at that time regarded as scarcely if at all inferior in importance to human life . The excuse was accepted , and the medical title duly though informally conferred . Compensation for this work , though liberal , as became its importance , was based 1es8 upon that importance perhaps than upon the fact that the machinist as well as others had the opportunity , now mostly gone , to file claims , and by mining on his own account make money upon nature 's terms-terms which here , as elsewhere , are far more liberal than those which must be made with human intermediaries . In case of difficulty in collecting wages or fees , the machinist in a new mining country was usually not lacking in resources , and knew just where to strike at a vital point . One of them who wanted his overdue wages and had failed to secure them by such gentle arts of persuasion as he was master of , unscrewed and took away the safety-valve  --  a procedure which placed an effectual injunction upon further proceedings until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workman is only that needed to do over and over again certain operations which differ little or not at all from one week 's or year 's end to another ; and , though some operations connected with machine building are of this character , the real machinist 's work is of a nature that requires the constant exercise of inventive faculties , and it is quite frequently the fact that the methods adopted and the devices used in building a machine involve more real invention than the machine itself , even though that , when completed , may be looked upon as quite wonderful . Such invention is taken much as a matter of course in machine shops , and there are plenty of men employed in them who possess , and in the course of their every-day work constantly employ , inventive faculties of a high order , yet who never figure as inventors , because their inventions are used mostly for temporary and special purposes , and are seldom or never patented . Other kinds of inventions of theirs are those made while working as machinists for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than to conceive an idea that a machine is wanted for a certain purpose , and then to leave to the machinist all such apparently trifling matters as the selection and combination of mechanical elements needed to perform the required functions . The general public would // in fact be much surprised were I to name some of the very well-known and very successful machines now on the market , the patentees of which are not their real inventors , but have simply employed machinists in their own or others ' shops , who , working as machinists , have done the real inventing , often indeed being under the necessity for so far recognizing the peculiarities of human nature as to make their suggestions in such a roundabout way as to lead the " inventor " to actually suppose himself to be the originator of it all . Indeed , in such work as is done in developing inventions , study of and insight into human nature are by no means the least important of the requirements . An inventor who proposes to go far astray in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently led within the realms of approved practice , or he will refuse to go there , and attribute the consequent failure of his machine to the machinist 's incompetence . For one of the crosses machinists have to bear is the knowledge that many sincere , but mechanically blinded , men , really believe that the only obstacle to the success of their utterly wild and impracticable schemes , lies in the fact that the machinist can not construct the machine with sufficient accuracy . Even the redoubtable Keeley has as a last , or , at least , the latest , resort , fallen back upon this time-worn excuse for failure , and announced that the complete success of his long-looked-for machine which is to develop prodigious amounts of energy from nothing , through the medium of sympathetic vibrations , is delayed only until the machinist can construct for him a perfect machine ; something which no machinist with any clear idea of what perfection really means ever pretended to be able to do , or to have the faintest hope of accomplishing . Not all mechanical visionaries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are forever prevented from showing the world its indebtedness to them by the hard - heartedness of machinists , who demand pay in advance , or as the work progresses ; experience having shown that this is the only safe way , and , also , that to spend time in convincing such a man of the error of his way , while it may be beautifully charitable , is too expensive ; aside from the fact that the chances of doing it in any other way than by the construction of an experimental machine are very remote . So , when a wild-eyed and longhaired individual comes into the shop and , after enjoining and receiving solemn assurances of profound secrecy , unfolds his plan for enabling farmers to carry on harvesting operations at night by means of an immense mirror supported at a sufficient distance from the earth 's surface to receive a portion of the sunlight , which would otherwise wander aimlessly off into space , and reflect it down into the night-shrouded harvest fields , there is usually no attempt at instruction in practical astronomy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desired model , or a careful investigation to determine the amount of coin of the realm at.command of him who , in a new sense , proposes " to hold , as t were , the mirror up to nature . " In like manner , when the man who insists that he has solved the problem of perpetual motion wants , first of all , a specially strong and powerful brake constructed to arrest the otherwise irresistible motion of his proposed machine , there is no attempt to convince him that the greater problem of producing the motion had better be attacked first ; not only because this would probably be a useless and thankless task , but because the brake may turn out to be useful for some purpose , if not for its intended one . For it is to be noted in passing that , while the chances of a machine being useful for what it is intended for are generally much better than for its being useful for some entirely different purpose , there are exceptions to the rule . A case in point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to invent an improved churn , and who , after working at it for some time , was asked by a friend how the new churn was coming om The inventor 's reply was : " She ai n't worth a cent for a churn , but she 's the best water-wheel you ever saw . Though this may have been overstating // An Inventor Explaining a Device to a Sceptical Machinist . VOL . XIV. - 83 ENGRAVED BY c . I. BUTLER . // the case somewhat , the fact remains that " she " was a good water - wheel , and the business of manufacturing it as such was afterward successfully carried on for many years . In the machine business , as in other lines of trade , it is important that travelling representatives employed in the commercial department of the business should thoroughly understand the articles in which they deal , and their use this fact having led to the eniployment of many machinists as travelling representatives of machinery builders , and of those who make articles used in machine building or manufacturing . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proved better adapted to commercial affairs than to mechanics ; but they usually know sufficient of the latter to avoid making such blunders as would be inevitable with those lacking in practical shop experience , and many of them are well-posted men , who , by looking through a shop , can perceive whether or not the machines or articles sold by them are adapted for use there , and , if so , then under what conditions and with what modifications , if any , to suit special requirements . Such a man becomes , so to speak , a travelling missionary of mechanical enlightenment . He is more than a travelling salesnmn ; he is , besides this , an expert , and , in many cases , a mechanical engineer , whose visits to a shop are suggestive and beneficial , whether sales are made or not . Such a travelling man is seldom looked upon as a bore , but , on the contrary , is welcomed by the relatively limited number of men with whom it is his mission to establish or maintain business relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from any other travellers , because , to begin with , they must be different men , reared in a different school ; and their business depends little or not at all upon whims , fashion , personal relations , the ability to tell the latest story in the best manner , or , in short , upon any of the arts of the ordinary drummer . In order to succeed , they must know exactly the limitations , as well as the capacities and adaptations , of the machines they sell . They must also know those of other similar machines built by other establishments . Because they deal mainly with men who are also experts , if for no other reason , they indulge in little extravagance of statement , every claim made being subject to mathematical or similarly exact test and proof . No specious argument or eloquent discourse will explain away the failure of a machine to fulfil the contract or promises made for it ; nor have any effect whatever upon the matter-of-fact specialist who has bought , or who may propose to buy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim made for or against a machine is usually capable of absolute and exact demonstration , and there is no other way to success for the machinist traveller than by thoroughly knowing his own and his competitors ' machines , skilfully selecting the ground on which his own has the advantage , and then confining himself to absolute accuracy of statement . It is doubtful if any other science has made such rapid strides within the last century , and has produced such profound and far-reaching results affecting our manner of life , as has the science of machine construction . One needs only to make some little study of the state of the art in the days when my grandfather made woodenframed machinery for use in Rhode Island print-works , comparing it with the wonderfully ingenious and efficient machinery of to-day ; noting how few things are done without the aid of machimiery , and how many are entirely de- , pendent upon it ; to be convinced that Archimedes ' dream is almost realized , and that the world is movedi , not by a lever alone , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lever , amid called Machines.
