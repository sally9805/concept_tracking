txt Last July Mr. ELIJAH R. KENNEDY of Brooklyn made a journey to the Northwest , and immediately after his return he sent to the Tribune a letter which our hightariff neighbor published under the title , " What a Wide-Awake Republican Observed in the West . " Mr. KENNEDY said that he had had " excellent opportunities for conversing with representative Republicans . " Before ho left his home he had been assured that the McKinley bill " was immensely popular in the agricultural States , and would confirm our hold on those States . " But on Aug. ( 3 , after his return , his opinion was as follows : " Well , I have talked with the best judges of the political situation in Wisconsin , men also peculiarly well informed on affairs in the other Northwestern States , and I deem It a duty to declare that the final enactment of the Mainley bill , in anything like the shape in which it now stands , will lose us the next Congress , and will render it next to impossible for the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successor to President HAIIRISON . " This " wide-awake Republican " did not complain then , nearly three months before the election , that the Republicans did not " understand " the bilL He saw that they understood it very well . Our high-tariff neighbor would not permit itself to be enlightened by this esteemed and " wideawake " correspondent . Perhaps it has not forgotten that Mr. KENNEDY also reported that the people of the West did not take much interest in the Force bill , and would not be disgusted if it should be dropped .
