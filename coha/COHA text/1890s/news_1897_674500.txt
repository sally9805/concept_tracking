txt The Kentucky Court of Appeals has just decided that the death of a man as a result of a mosquito bite is an accident ' al death , within the meaning of an accident insurance policy , and that the representatives of the deceased are entitled to recover accordingly . The decision seems so obvious that it is hard to see upon what ground the company should have resisted the claim . In the legal sense an accident Is defined to be " an unusual or unexpected event ; the effect of an unknown cause or the unknown effect of a known cause . " If the definition had been framed to cover the case of death from a mosquito bite , it could not have fitted it more completely . There could not be a more " unusual or unexpected event " than such a death ; nor could there be a more " unknown effect of a known cause . " It is no doubt true that the underwriters in drawing up their policy did not contemplate mosquito bites as among the possibly fatal accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the risk himself imagine that he went in peril of his life from mosquitoes . No man in his senses would think of taking out an accident insurance against death by mosquito bites , even if he were going shooting in the Jersey marshes in July . But obviously the contingency of death from a mosquito bite was no more excluded from the policy than it was included in it . The omission was in each case for the same reason , that it did not occur to either party to the contract . If the risk had asked the underwriters whether they would insure him against fatal consequences from mosquito bites , the underwriters would no doubt have thought him a fool , but they would not have hesitated to give him the assurance . A subsidiary part of the legal definition of an accident is " that which happens without direct human agency , or without concurrence of the will of the person by whose base act it has been caused . " Thus a man who is killed by another who fires recklessly into a crowd may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the man who fires the shot may be guilty of murder . Express malice upon the part of a mosquito is sometimes presumed by his victims , but of course It does not really exist . The insect is merely getting his living , without consideration of the emotions of his meal . The puzzling point about the case is not that the Court of Appeals has decided that death from a mosquito bite was accidental , but that the lawyer of the company should have been able to persuade the court below that it was not accidental . The proper habitat of a lawyer capable of that feat is Philadelphia , as the habitat of a mosquito capable of homicide , or even of mayhem , should be New Jersey , and it is surprising to find so athletic a specimen either of the subtle jurist or the maneating mosquito in the State of Kentucky . It is true that the abundance of distilleries might account for a good deal of legal eloquence , judicial obfuscation , and insect venom .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
