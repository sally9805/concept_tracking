txt Yesterday the Autonomist secretaries , with Gen. Blanco presiding , held an extraordinary council , of which the proceedings have not been made public . Ex Diario says the Council may determine to send a representative to Washington in connection with the Spanish Legation there , who will be able to show the Federal Government the true feeling with regard to autonomy in Cuba , and also to advise President of the true state of affairs in the island . This is said to depend upon the consent of the Madrid Government , and , according to El Diario , if the consent is obtained , Senor Manuel Rafael Angelo will be named as such representative . He is now in Washington representing the Colonial Government in the matter of the commercial treaty . El Dianio also says that the secretaries considered the issuance of a manifesto to all Cubans , calling upon them to assist loyally in the establishment of the present regime , a scheme of Government to be perfected and amplified according to the necessities of the island . The manifesto would point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans of the Separatists , but would be absorbed by foreigners and that real liberty is possibly only by supporting and carrying out the resent regime . The manifesto would conclude by urging upon Cubans calmness and prudence amid the present discussions between the United States and Spain . La Union Constitutional , in a violent editorial to-day denouncing the acts and motives of the United States , says : " The United States have even neglected the customary legal or diplomatic varnish in making their proposals . It is inconsistent to demand that reconeentr'ation shall cease and at the same moment to offer to feed the reconcentrados . The United States only give a handful of beans , which the poor stomachs of the reconcentrados can not digest , while Spain is doing all that is possible to relieve distress , and without blowing a horn over it . American relief work only increases vagrancy , or serves to cover the designs of spies . Cubans do not know what the United States demand in exchange for this alleged relief ; but they do know that nothing will be granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The same paper wishes to know how it happened that Capt . Sigsbee lost all his uniforms if he was on board the Maine when she exploded . It says Capt . Sigsbee made calls at the palace and attended the funeral of the Maine victims constantly in the same suit , with a coat like a smoking jacket . The object of this article , and its singular argument , is chiefly to show that there was no proper discipline on the Maine . El Diario de la Marina has a patriotic editorial on the same lines as those that have appeared in previous issues . It says : Cuba is free now and will never be under the domination of the Yankees . The United States is not ready for war . It is seeking an alliance with England and Japan . Its Generals are shrieking for recruits for an illusionary army . It has not artillery for its coast defenses or powder for its men-of-war . In the midst of the hubbub President is uncertain what card to play , wishing for peace but doing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asking independence for a people well-satisfied with the Government now existing .
