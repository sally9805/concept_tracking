txt We observe with interest that Mr. MACK , who is presumably a naturalist and who certainly used to be one of the grievously libeled Mr. LITTLE 's colleagues on the Board of Education , has been quarreling , in the City Club , with the description forged by Dr. BUTLER , and uttered by the Messrs . HOLT , as inaccurate , Mr. MACK insists with vehemence that they ought to have called him a dodo , in which case they would have been upon impregnable ground . They make subtle distinctions , or , in the vernacular , they cut it fine in the City Club , We do not ourselves see much difference between the two terms of opprobrium , since both the mastodon and the dodo are extinct , except that Mr. MACK 'S inculcates the truth , which nobody versed in the recent locutions will deny , that Mr. LITTLE is a bird . To Mr , LITTLE , however , it seems to be equal whether he be publicly branded as a mastodon or a dodo . He has admitted to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by calling him a dodo . Mr. LITTLE 'S ignorance bodes ill for Mr. MACK 'S peace . For Mr. LITTLE has already proclaimed that the sting of " mastodon " to his mind lay in the fact that he did not understand it , and he added , " I do not propose to be called names which I do not understand . " That was the grievance of the flshwoman who was stigmatized by DANIEL O'CONNELL as an isosceles triangle . But she could do nothing but burst into tears . She was not a friend of the public prosecutor of Dublin , or the public prosecutor was not an Asa Bird Gardiner . Mr. LITTLE is not so remediless . When he is called something which he does not understand he goes to the District Attorney and gets the unintelligible defamer indicted , as it were , " on spec , " in case the description turns out to be libelous . Of course nothing could be better calculated to increase the public respect for the administration of justice . But how about the public respect for Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the very sewing circles are resounding with discussions whether he is a mastodon or a dodo , when he fondly trusts he is neither , and yet can not be sure that he is not both does he not himself think he was a trifle precipitate in using his pull with the District Attorney , and setting the machinery of the criminal law in motion , instead of referring the incompatible descriptions of him to some learned friend to look up in the dictionary ? How many of his fellow-citizens does he suppose would have known that he had been called a mastodon if he had let the sleeping " Educational Review " lie , compared wit/. the number who know it now , and who are looking up books of reference and haunting the Museum of Natural History ? Without doubt these searchers will find that the description is all wrong , and that the true comparison would be a surviving and much more persistent type . But what comfort will that , be to Mr. LITTLE , even though he should procure pictures of a restored mastodon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his looking glass that he had not , except perhaps a little something in the expression , any real resemblance to either ?
