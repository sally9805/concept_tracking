CHAPMAN FIGHTING ROUGHS . The Tenderloin Police Captain Interferes to Protect Women and Loses His Umbrella 's Head . Police Captain Chapman o : the Tenderloin Precinct reported laSt night a brief but inspiring combat with roughs said to be of gigantic size and abnormal fierceness , and the detective force of the city now has the ' discovery of two heads to devote its talent and energies to , one being Guldensuppe'sand the other belonging to Capt . Chapman 's ' umbrella . The Captain reached the West Thirtieth Street Station just before midnight last night wearing citizens ' clothes new in style and impressive in fit , but carrying an umbrella which looked distinctly tough and battered . He explained that he had been acting as the , protector of presumable female innocence . As he was on his way to the station he heard an altercation between two women and a group of men at the southwest corner of Thirty-first Street and Sixth Avenue terminated by a grossly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened to the rescue and ordered the men to disperse . The theory in the Tenderloin is that they must have been some of the new policemen or other strangers in the city , because they asked who he was . When he said he was a Police Captain they . told him to go to a place where the abiding heat is supposed not to be mixed with any humidity . Capt . Chapman gasped , looked around to be sure that it was really New York and the Tenderloin Precinct in which he was unknown and defied , and then began to utilize his umbrella as a weapon of war . His account of the proceedings immediately subsequent is not clear . Whether he broke the head of the umbrella upon a person or persons , or whether the head was twisted off and carried away , does not distinctly appear , The gang dispersed and the umbrella emerged decapitated and otherwise dilapidated . On arriving at the station , Capt . Chapman sent a detective around to look fdr the missing section . He did not intend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the precinct if he could prevent it . At last accounts the mass was yet seeking the head , ' and there was a general fear that it had been captured and carried off as a trophy .
