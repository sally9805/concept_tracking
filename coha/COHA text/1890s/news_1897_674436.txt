txt - We observe with interest that our esteemed freak contemporaries are contending with each other for the contributions of Mr. BRYAN . The World published his survey of the state of the Nation at the same time with that of his successful competitor . This was undoubtedly " good newspaper , " and we have already made some comments upon Mr. BRYAN 'S views . But now The Journal , like Jill in the poem , " comes tumbling after " with its defeated candidate 's review of the financial part of the message , and promises further contributions from the same pen . The most important aspect of these contributions is their relation to the comfort of the late candidate . Mr. BRYAN is , in private life , a worthy man , with a family to support , and there can be no reasonable objection to his taking all the money our esteemed freak contemporaries may choose to pay him , although , when he compares the present value of his literary efforts with what they used to command when he sold them to an Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of continual astonishment . In this case The Journal may seem to have taken The World 's " leavings , " and doubtless The World skimmed the cream of Mr. BRYAN as a sensation . But upon the whole , honors , If we may call them so , seem to be fairly even . For does not The Journal rejoice in the exclusive contributions of CORBETT and FITZSIMMONS ? It is all very fine for The World to elicit half a page , more or less , of pugilistic wisdom from JOHN L. SULLIVAN , and print it with two pictures . The fact remains that the first living authorities on the coming fight write for The Journal , and that it is in The Journal that can be found the daily and exclusive prediction of each that he will lick the other .
