txt Mr. THOMAS G. SErEartatAx , in his speech in Brooklyn on Wednesday evening , put very forcibly the argument which we have several times presented , that a large vote for PALMER and BUCKNER will have a much more salutary effect at the coming election than a sweeping majority for and HOBART . An overwhelming vote against BRYAN and SEWALL is the most important thing , but it will be far better not to have it massed in one party . leaving the other disorganized and batte " ed to pieces , but still clinging to its delusions . Republicans will vote for MCKINLEY , and that will make his election sure if sound-money Democrats vote . for PALMER . As Mr. SHEARMAN says , we do not want one party alone in favor of sound money hereafter , but both parties . There is danger that rom other causes than the currency issue there may be a reaction in the next four years , swinging popular support away from the party in power . There is always a tendency in that direction , for causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future campaigns , as in this , is likely to be the Central States to the west of New-York and Pennsylvania , where sentiment on the money question is not so securely settled as it is in this part of the country , and where political agitation is more intense . To put a quietus not merely upon the silver de1 lusion , but upon all the pernicious elements that made the seething combination that controlled the Chicago Convention , it must be demonstrated that the Democratic Party , as well as the Republican Party , still holds to safe ground . A large vote for PALMER and BuctocEn. would be Much more significant and reassuring for the future than an overwhelming vote for MCKINLEY and HOBART . and it would be just as certain to mean the crushing defeat of BRYAN and SEWALL , who will get very few Republican votes anywhere outside the " silver States . " It would give the National Democratic Party the needed strength and support for taking possession of the party organization and directing its future course . As we have often said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it would check the tendency to go to extremes , which always provoke a violent reaction . If BRYAN could be defeated by a distinctively Democratic vote given to a Democratic ticket , and MCKINLEY could be elected by the Republican vote alone , it would lid-ve a sobering effect upon the party in power and an inspiring effect upon the con'ervative and patriotic portion of the party in opposition , thus restoring a healthy equilibrium in our politics . This argument should appeal especially to Democrats who are concerned for the principles of their party and for its future destiny . Their true position is defined by Mr. A. B. FARQUHA.R of York , Penn. , in a letter from which we print a passage elsewhere . BRYAN is not the candidate of their party , for the platform adopted at Chicago does not embody the principles of their party , and the candidate does not advocate those principles . If elected , he would not represent the policy of the party , but would bring disgrace upon it by involving the country in calamity . A genuine Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated should receive the votes of all Democrats who revolt at Bryanism.
