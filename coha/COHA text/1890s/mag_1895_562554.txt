txt WHETHER we like it or not , the question of giving the ballot to women is a question to be faced . From the last Legislature of the State of New York favorable action was secured on the proposal to submit to popular vote the omission of the word " male " from the qualification of voters in the Constitution . This is of course only tentative and preliminary . Another Legislature must pass the law before it can be submitted to the people . But it behooves men and women who are opposed to it to be awake to the duty of hindering its further progress . And it is quite worth while to note how this first step was secured . The story of the action of the Constitutional Convention upon this subject is familiar . The proposal , backed by monster petitions , was brought to the Convention at a very early day . With praiseworthy and untiring perseverance , its advocates fairly swarmed in the Capitol . Hearing after hearing was given , and the button-holes of members were absolutely worn out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it was referred was a large , able , and intelligent committee . Hours , both of day and night , were given to the public arguments , including a single hearing ( the only one asked for ) of the representatives on the other side . And after due and thorough delibVOL . CLXI. - NO. 466. 17 Copyrl6ht , 1890 , by LLOYD BRYoE . AU rights i*eserved. // eration , an adverse report was made by the committee , which was , after full debate , accepted by a large majority vote . It is certainly not too much to say that such a decision , reached after such deliberations , in such a body , has and ought to have the greatest weight . The opposite result last winter was reached in a very different way . The movement upon the Legislature was cleverly planned , and quietly executed by personal influence and appeal , with no hearing whatever in the Assembly , and with only one hearing in the Senate , held after the whole matter was known to be a foregone conclusion ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the passage of the bill sure . This is a well-known method among politicians , which hardly rises to the level of high-minded statesmanship . If it indicates the kind of political manipulation likely to be adopted , in caucuses and at the polls , in popular assemblies and legislative halls , by what is commonly called the " new " woman or the " coming " woman , it will certainly induce most thinking people to feel that " the old is better , " and to be thankful that yet awhile , at any rate , the new woman has not come . I think I am hardly betraying any confidence in repeating the argument of a famous suffragist leader , tried upon Mr. Choate before his election as President of the Constitutional Convention . " I hear you are to be President of the Constitutional Convention , " she said . " Possibly , " " If you are , you will have the appointment of committees ? " " Undoubtedly . " " If you do , I want you to appoint on the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to be in favor of it . " " But , " he said , " supposing I find in the Convention a large majority opposed to it , could I make up a committee with a majority of its members in favor ? " " No " she said : " I suppose you could not , but that is what we want . " And all through the management of this campaign the appeal has been made , backed often by no other argument than " we want it , " to the gallantry of a man towards a woman . It seems important , in view of the renewed effort in Albany this coming winter , to appeal to the sober-minded thought of men and women ; to omit rhetoric , oratory , abuse , misrepresentation , and ask for a serious consideration of a subject , certaInly fraught with grave and serious consequences ; for anything that touches the ballot touches the foundations of government . // Among the difficulties which beset the whole question now are the indifference and listlessness , or the frivolity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many a man says : " Oh ! let the experiment be tried ; it can not succeed ; it will do no harm to pay women the courtesy of this complimentary vote , and then defeat it at the polls . " But this is an experiment too much like playing with fire to be safe . Once granted , it can never be recalled . And the risk of random voting on matters of such importance is too great to be run . Many a woman opposed to the measure feels that the whole thought of signing petitions , and having her name printed , and appealing to the Legislature , is so distasteful to her , that she would prefer to take the chance of probable failure . Meanwhile , the advocates pile up petitions , and multiply unmeaning names . Many a man trifles with his responsibility , under the silly idea that it is ungallant to say " No " to a woman . And many a woman laughs at the whole matter as a joke , mixed up with bicycles and bloomers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the principle involved . Let us look fairly and squarely at the facts . There is one class of women to be eliminated from the discussion , because they fly into a " frenzy " which is not " fine , " mistake abuse for argument , and are only vulgarly violent , with sharp tongues or sharper pens saturated with bitterness and venom . They are , if there were only such as these , their own best answerers , furnishing sufficient reason against the movement . There is another class which includes members of both sexes , with whom one can not deal without sacrificing self-respect or reverence , who revile all that one holds in holiest veneration , Holy Scripture , holy Matrimony , St. Paul , even our dear Lord Himself . How reverent and religious women can cast their lot in with a cause which has this drift in it is inconceivable ; and yet some of them do so . One has neither need nor desire to make reply to such as these . They may be safely left , when the sediment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietness of the settled surface , to their own condemnation . But the cause has among its adherents and advocates a very different class of women and men , to whose sober second thought it is worth while to appeal , and against whose specious but sincere reasonings others need to be warned and guarded . It is // because of these , and of their reasonings , that this paper is written . It is not intended to argue the underlying l ) rinciples of the case , which have been argued abundantly already , but only to assert them . 1 . Suffrage is not a right of anybody . It is a privilege granted by the constitution to such persons as the framers of the constitution and the founders of the government deem best . 2 . The old political proverb , " No taxation without representation , " is utterly inapplicable to this question . It grew out of the tyrannical action of a government " across the sea , " in which no one of all the people on whom the tax was levied had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of the government . We may be said to have in this country a great deal of representation without taxation , because , in thousands of instances , voters , and indeed the very men who impose the tax , own no property at all . But women who are taxed are represented by their relatives , by their potent influence , arid by men 's sense of justice , amounting even to chivalry , which the woman suffragists are doing all they can to destroy , but which has secured to them far more protection , far more independent control of their property , than men have reserved to themselves . The complement and object of taxation is not the right to vote , but the protection of property . And women 's property is better protected than men's. 3 . Equality does not mean identity of duties , rights , privileges , occupations . The sex differences are proof enough of this . The paths in which men and women are set to walk are parallel , but not the same . And the equilibrium of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , unless this is recognized . As St. Paul put it forcibly long ago " If the whole body were hearing , where were the *melling ? " Over-stocked professions , men and women crowding each other in and out of occupation , neglected duties , responsibilities divided until they are destroyed , must be the result if this nunatural idea be enforced . 4 . The theory of increased wages for women , to be secured by giving votes to women-workers , is equally preposterous . Wages , like work , are regulated by the unfailing law of supply and demand . Work can not be created , and wages can not be forced up . If there are too many workers there will be less employment and lower pay . // These are some of the fundamental and axiomatic truths of the argument . It is important , too , to guard against the specious method of mixing up things that have no relation to each other . A man or a woman who opposes the forcing of the ballot upon women is classed with the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we may differ , but which lie upon the lower plane of *sthetics . The unattractiveness of an ugly dress or an ungraceful movement may repel a man 's feelings and lessen the charm of a woman , but there it ends . Women may ride bicycles and wear bloomers without violating any political principle , provided they neither ride on the one , nor walk in the other , to the polls . It is still more important to draw another distinction . The slavery of American women exists only in the warped imaginations and heated rhetoric of a few people , who have screamed themselves hoarse upon platforms or written themselves into a rage in newspapers . There is no freer human being on earth to-day , thank God , than the American woman . She has freedom of person , of property , and of profession , absolute and entire . She has all liberty that is not license . Let a woman tell the facts . I quote from one of Mrs. Schnyler Van Rensselaer 's admirable papers in the INew York World : " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able to enjoy their own property , whether inherited or acquired , without control or interference from any man . A married woman may carry on a trade , business , or profession and keep her earnings for herself alone . She may sue and be sued and make contracts as freely and Independently as an unmarried woman or a man . She may sell or transfer her real as well as her personal property just as she chooses . And she is not liable for her husband 's debts or obliged to contribute to his support . Meanwhile , a husband is obliged to support his wife and children . He is liable for the price of all necessaries ' purchased by her , and for money borrowed by her for their purchase ; and necessaries ' are liberally construed as commensurate with her husband 's means , her wonted living as his spouse , and her station in the community . ' " A man who obtains a divorce can not ask for alimony ; a woman who obtains one is entitled to it , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in business can not be arrested in an action for a debt fraudulently contracted , as a man may be . Every woman enjoys certain exemptions from the sale of her property under execution , but only a man who has and provides for a household or family is exempt in the same way . A woman is entitled to one-third of her husband 's real estate at his death , and can not be deprived of it by will ; and no real estate can be sold by him durhis lifetime unless she signs c*ff this dower right . A husband 's right to a // portion of his wife 's property begins only after the birth of a living child , and even then she need not have his consent to sell it during her lifetime , and may deprive him of it altogether by will . " While one " forbears threatenings , " it is worth while to wonder whether this would go on if the relations of the sexes to each other were changed . Courtesies that are compelled by law would soon become onerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until they were laid aside . A man jostled at the polls and in the primary meetings would be less inclined to step aside or stand up elsewhere to give a woman place . The almost uniform method of confusing questions , resorted to so constantly in the attacks of the woman snifragists , must be protested against to the end . Giving a woman the ballot has nothing whatever to do with her higher education , with her choice of occupations , with the part she may take in the discussion of public questions , or with her share in the administration of public interests . Along the lines of their distinctive ability , and in the ways of their natural adaptation , no sane man questions the wisdom and the duty of the highest education for women , of the freest following out of their vocations , of the importance of their intelligent knowledge , and the value of their expressed opinions in great moral and social public questions , and of their capacity in certain offices of responsibility , duty and trust . So far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now for the appeal to serious men and women , for the serious consideration of this most serious question . The appeal is rightly made , first , in behalf of the women of America who are earnestly opposed to the imposition upon them of a burden which , from their point of view , not only is not a duty , but is an evil ; not only not a right , but actually a wrong . It is very easy , by the process that is sometimes called " counting noses , " to say that this is a matter of minorities , and that majorities must rule . But , like many other arguments in favor of this cause , the statement is based upon the " take-things-for-granted " plan . Given a large body of earnest agitators ( some of them paid agents who live by the agitation ) , and everybody knows that numberless signatures may be obtained to a petition for almost anything-names of indifferent , unintelligent , brow-beaten and button-holed people , who sign rather than argue , and assent in the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusing . Such signatures mean nothing , although they swell the number into a more than millenary petition , and make it more or less miles long . Not for a moment disputing the fact that some of the names stand for intelligence and intention , for conviction and conscience , that they represent education , social position , tax-paying interest , I claim , from my own large and long experience , that , in any commnnity with which I am acquainted , the most serious , intelligent , cultivated women , with the largest money interest in the government , and the most quiet , thoughtful , earnest women , are , conscientiously and on clear convictions , opposed to woman suffrage . I insist that it is a wrong to force such women to the alternative of going to the polls , against their instincts and their convictions , or of allowing the nnthinking majority of votes to be enlarged by the ballots of women carried away by a theory , or influenced by a desire for power . What the result would be is matter of conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not impossible , to bring the great mass of really intelligent and responsible women to vote , against their ingrained habits , their instincts , their inclinations , and their judgments . And it is important to stop and consider what that means . The old proverb applies here of the horse dragged to the water , which can not be made to drink . Legislation may be secured that will say to every woman : " You shall have the privilege of voting " ; but , after all , it means only " may , " and you can not put the verb into the imperative and say : " You shall vote . " There are two factors of grave danger in the political issues and elections of America . First of all , the religious question , which , guard it as we will , crops up from time to time , in appropriations to charities or schools or religions organizations , or in fanatical fury against some form of religious order and belief . There have been two noted instances , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arraying of Protestants against Roman Catholics . In one case , the violent stirring up of Protestant women about a school question produced an angry contest , in which the Protestants carried the day ; while in the other , after a careful canvass , quietly made among Protestant women , the summons of a single Roman priest mustered a force of female voters , always liable to be controlled by clerical direction , which carried the day for Rome . And the dregs and debris // of the contest were bitter and wretched to a degree . It is to the infinite honor of women that they are more quickly interested , more keenly concerned , and more deeply influenced in their religions feelings and convictions than men . But it adds to the wrong and horror of allowing religion to be dragged into politics , if , on one side or the other , a great body of voters could be wielded by any religions or ecclesiastical influence to decide the question and carry the day . The other factor , known and read of all men , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale to the highest bidder . The possession of the ballot has not purified the male voter from the heinous sin of a sold vote . Why should it purify the woman ? It is a well-known fact that , in all our large cities , there is a great body of women who sell themselves , soul and body . It is idle to stop and say that men are responsible for this horror . I have no desire to screen men . I believe the man who sins against purity is before God a sinner equally with the woman . But the fact stands that a woman who will sell her purity , her honor , her reputation , herself , will sell anything . And in the city of New York , with its fifty thousand fallen women , there is this enormous and awful possibility of a vote that might turn the tide of any election , purchasable by the highest bidder , who would naturally use his disreputable bargain for disreputable and dangerous ends . By some strange confusion of infantile innocence , unimaginable ignorance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called attention to this danger have been accused of insulting their wives and mothers , or of implying that Mrs. Cady Stanton or Miss Anthony would sell her vote . But this sort of answer is only the action of the cuttle-fish which hides its method of escape , or the dust of the fleeing animal which blinds the eyes of its pursuer . The hideous fact of the number of degraded and venal women remains . The awful fact of venal voters among men remains ; and of the equally criminal class of political go-betweens , who spend the money of candidates and corporations in these most illegitimate " election expenses . " And the possibility and probability of the increase of a corrupted ballot giving , in a close election , the balance of power , secured by a purchase of the votes of women lost to all sense of shame , follows as an immediate and inevitable danger . It is constantly urged that women voters would be more conscientious // and careful than men are , would be always on the side of reform , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social movements . But , in the first place , this is purely prophetic , without the inspiration of prophecy . It is mere guess-work . To reach a real conclusion through an imaginary premiss is illogical to the last degree . There are , perhaps in smaller proportion , bad women as well as bad men , intemperate women , ignorant women . In the comparisons usually made by the advocates of woman 's snifiage , it is always the virtuous and intelligent woman who is contrasted with the ignorant and unprincipled man . The fact is , that to multiply suffrage means to multiply every kind of vote by two , and while it would mean an increase of votes cast on principle and for principle , it would also mean an increase of unprincipled votes against the best interests of society . It is greatly to be doubted whether politics , either in its methods or in its results , would be purified in this way . The giving of the ballot to men has not improved either the morals or the responsibility of men . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voting , after all , is to a large degree i*y parties and for individuals , and there is no such violence of partizanship in the world as the violence of female partizanship . No one who has heard a good " Primrose League lady " in England abuse Mr. Gladstone will question this . And the condition of feeling in the South during and since the war is a painful evidence of it . It was the women of the South who fanned the flame of secession , who forced the continuance of the hopeless strife , and who to-day , where there is any spirit of out-and-out sectionalism , are the unrelenting , unforgetting , unforgiving Southerners . This relation of the Southern women to the war is a serious note of warning , in another direction , about " the woman in politics . " There can be no doubt that women in the South knew more , thought more , felt more , talked more about politics than the women of the North . And what was the result and effect of their intelligent interest ? Slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maintained in the time of peace , and sectionalism run mad when the opportunity for the war came ! There are two other considerations which can not be omitted in the study of this subject , the family relation , and the relation between men and women in the world . To-day , in the household , the man is the voter . Suppose the wife becomes a voter // too . She will either reproduce her husband 's political views , and there would be in one house two Democratic voters , and in another two Republican voters , where there had been one . And this is no gain towards a decision of questions . It is only a multiplying of ballots , producing no change of results . Or else the wife would take the opposite side from her husband 's , and , instantly , with all the heat and violence of party differences and political disagreements , a bone of contention is introduced into the home ; a new cause of dissension and alienation is added to the already strained relations in many families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall the cook leave her kitchen to cast a vote , which shall counterbalance the vote of the mistress , or shall the employer undertake to control the politics of the " kitchen cabinet " ? And all this , not merely on the voting day , or in the deposit of the ballot , but the weeks before and after the election are to be spent in the heat of discussion , or in the smart of defeat . The American home is not too sacred and secure to-day to make it safe to undermine it with the explosive materials of politics and partisanship . And meanwhile , as things are now , the intelligent woman , interested in some great measure of reform , has in her hand , not the ability to rival , offset , or double her husband 's vote , but the power of her persuasion , her affection , her ingenuity , to influence it . It would be incredible , if it were not shown to be true , that any large number of thinking and intelligent beings , knowing , feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the risk of losing it , by substituting a thing far lower and feebler in its stead . And with the experience of what she has gained for her sex , with the evidence of what voting men have brought about for her under the influence of non-voting women , , and through solicitude for their interests , the rashness of this proposed experiment defies description . It is perfectly idle to imagine that the relation between men and women in the outside world can remain the same when their attitude to each other is so entirely changed . With women mingling in the rough strifes and contests of political life , and assuming positions and duties hitherto unknown to them , there will inevitably come the quenching of that chivalrous feeling of men towards women , born of the protection hitherto expected by women and afforded by men , which is the inspiring cause of so // large a part of the amenities of life and the politeness of manners . And yet , just because woman is physically weak , and man physically strong , there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well look with grave anxiety at what is really a revolz&amp;tion of the natural order , utterly unable to conjecture what the results may be when women shall have become , not only votre8se8 , but legislatresses , mayore8ses , and alderwomen . It is the favorite habit of women arguing this cause to deal with it as though woman 's suffrage were an evolution . But it can not fairly be considered as , in any way , a progress along the line of that steady advance in the power and position of women , which has been wrought out by Christian civilization . It would not be progress , it would be retrogression . And it is not the least after the manner of growth and improvement in the character , the education , or the opportunities of women . It is a new departure ; an entire digression ; a violent change , and the appeal of this article is in a way " from Philip drunk to Philip sober . " Certain women have said so loudly , and so often , that they are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " classed with criminals , " " deprived of natural rights , " " down-trodden and oppressed , " that they have really come to believe it and to make some sensible people believe it . I trust that wiser counsels may in the end prevail . Meanwhile , inasmuch as the active agitators for this radical revolution in the very fundamental elements of government , have resorted to every known means to secure their ends , I can not but feel , that , however the other women may shrink from the publicity , it is their bounden duty by influence , by argument , by petition , to " fight fire with fire " ; to see to it that , in the approaching elections for the Senate and Assembly of the State of New York , men shall be chosen who will defend them from this wrong ; and when the elections are completed , to let it be known and felt in Albany that what some women claim as a political right , they consider a personal grievance and a public harm.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
