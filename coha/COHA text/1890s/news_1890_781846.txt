txt In refusing the second application of Mayor GRANT fur a . re-enumeration of the inhabitants of this city , Secretary NOBLE makes a curiously-labored and strangelymuddled reply , which confirms the impression first produced that there is no disposition at Washington to give the matter a fair eiannuation and to ascertain what merit there may be in the complaint that the census is imperfect . There was no occasion whatever for all this controversy . It would have been a simple matter to entertain the application and look into the evidence offered in support of it in order to ascertain whether enificient ground was shown for a reeumueratiou . That would be the natural course for officials who were only anxious - that the public service with which they were charged should be faithfully performed . The course that has been pursued st Washington is explainable only on the ground that an imperfect census of this city - vas intended and desired , and that there is a determination not to correct it . It iscertain that no permanent party advantage is to be gained by such tactics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be convincing evidence on that point . The pains which Secretary Nonni ? . has taken to obtain a clear understanding of this case is illustrated in the way he muddles up the municipal schedules of the five wards offered in evidence , speaking of them once as 5 out of 947 enumeration districts and again as 5 wards out of 947 districts . This is similar to the clearness of head displayed in the sharp letter to Gov . HILL , in which Mr. NOBLE attributed inaccuracies in the census , the existence of which he denied , to a speech made by the Governor which was in point of fact delivered two weeks after the enumeration was made .
