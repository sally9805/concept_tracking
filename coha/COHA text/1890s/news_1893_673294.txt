txt Walter N. Thayer , Warden of Clinton Prison at Dannemora , came to Albany late this afternoon and related to Gov . Flower the desperate scheme of a number of long-term convicts in his prison to gain their freedom , which involved the cold-blooded murder of several of the prison guards . One of the prisoners who was asked to join in the attempt refused , and it was through him that the authorities became aware of the plot . The Governor , when ho heard the facts , immediately pardoned the prisoner who had the courage to prevent the slaughter . As the Clinton Prison convicts filled through the corridor at noon yesterday in lock-step , on their way past Principal Keeper to obtain their rations for dinner , one of them slipped into the hand of the principal keeper a piece of brown wrapping paper two feet long by a foot wide , on both sides of which was written the following communication in lead pencil ; Hr. : Six : I hardly know how to begin to pencil what I wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worrying over it . Now , Sir , there is a scheme gotten up here among several convicts to escape from here to-night ( Sunday , the 16th , ) and the manner In which it is plotted is something that I can not keep secret on account of the cold , premeditated murd er that is planned to effect their escape . I was asked to go Into the scheme , but refused to have anything to do with it .. These men then told me if the officials got wind of it they would hold me responsible , and that there was some half dozen more men in it that I knew nothing about , hut that they knew that I was asked into it . and they took an oath if it failed they would put me out of the way . So yon see , Sir , that I 'm taking big chances to save these keepers ' lives , so I ash you as a man to make sure and not expose me in any danger . Now . Sir , this is to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Mr. Long and the other night guard comes on . There are two doors out already for these men to come out after Mr. Long or the other guard makes the nrst round . These men win come out when the guard is on the top gallery , elose their cell doors , and then get into the alleyway . One of them will have a big bar of iron and the other will have a large knife . After these guards make their drat round one of them always makes a second round on the flagging about half an hour afterward . That is the time fixed for those prisoners to not . When this guard comes in front of the alley they intend to spring upon him , drag him into the alley , and murder him . They will take his gun , then sneak down upon the other guard at the office and do him , taking his gun also . They then intend opening up five or six cells . letting the men out . flow they intend getting out of the hall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the names of those other men either . Now , Sir , I 'm no Informer , and never injured another prisoner in my life . If all the men in this prison contemplated camping , and I was positive of receiving a pardon by telling on them , I would not do so ? no , not if I was serving a life sentence ; but where a cold-blooded murder Is planned I will atop it if It 's in my power to do it every time . Now . Sir , I am doing a good deed toward these keepers , and I hope you will do nothing  --  that will compithate or endanger me In any way . You are a fly man , and know enough not to mention my name to any one but the Warden , and not come to see me or send for me . If you wish to speak to me you can send a letter to me just as though It came through the mail . I have to be careful , although I am no coward , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It Is them I am thinking of . and not of myself . The numbers of those convicts ' cells are : 69 , fourth company , and 80 , second company . One man 's name is Wright and the other 's name is Reece . The rivet next to the tongue of the door that the lever rests upon is backed out from the inside of the door , and that bar is cut so that the tongue of the door can be pushed but , and the door then is opened . They have the rivet plugged up with soap and painted , so that It would take close inspection to detect it . The cut bar is hid by the string of the curtain hanging on the door . Both these men 's doors are fixed in the same manner . Now , Sir . this is all I know about this affair . I know nothing about the other men who are to be let outer who they are . Ir I did I would feel safer , for then I would know who I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Sir , be sure and make no mistake by coming to ace me or sending for me . I have done right by you , so I hope you will do the same toward me . I remain , yours respectfully . Here is signed the prisoner 's name , with his cell number and company . P. S. ? If you do not find the knife and iron bar in these cella , look for them in the cells next to them . Now that you have read the above , take things cool , and spring this affair as though you knew it some time . The best way would be to have a general frisk like Fourth of July . Warden Thayer told the Governor that after the prisoners had finished with dinner the two named in the above communication were removed from their coils , and an examination showed the truth of the information . The locks of the two cell doors had been , tampered with as described . Hidden in the bedtick in Reace 's cell was found a long , sharp knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowbar about two and a half feet long , drills , saws , files , and a cold chisel . On account of their association with Reace and Wright , the Warden caused an examination to be made of the cells of two Other prisoners named Joyce and Russell , both long-term men serving twenty years . In Joyce 's can were found several pieces of iron , hidden from view with a covering of hash . The Warden thinks that these pieces of iron were , in connection with stockings , to be used as slungshots . Both Joyce and Russell admitted that they were in the plot . Joyce , who worked in the State shop with the prisoner who divulged the conspiracy , said . to the Warden after the discovery : " Do n't put that man back in the shop with mo . I know the  --  ? who gave the snap away . " Russell said that , while he was a party to the scheme , lie did not know that murder Was contemplated . No confessions were necessary from these two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof . As stated , when Gov . Flower heard the story , he immediately pardoned the prisoner who wrote the communication to the principal keeper . Warden Thayer thinks that Hence obtained his knife in the State workshop . A new building is in course of erection on the prison grounds . Wright . who is working on the building , must have obtained the crowbar there and smuggled it into his cell . A " frisk , " which is referred to in the prisoner 's communication , is a general examination of all the cells , one having been made on July 4 . Both Gov . Flower and Warden Thayer refuse to divulge , for the present at least , the name of the prisoner who probably saved the lives of several guards . They thought it might bring trouble upon him , if not from the convicts whom he exposed , possibly from some of their friends outside of the prison . Another reason is found in the Governor 's belief that a convict can get along bettor after his release in his endeavor to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not heralded throughout the State at the time be obtains his liberty . The Warden did not go near the prisoner after receiving his communication , and said to-night that the latter probably does not know the result of his warning . The man was received at the prison in August , 1892 , and had four years to serve for grand larceny committed in New-York City . Warden Thayer left for Dannemora at midnight with the pardon in his pocket . All the prisoners concerned in the attempted escape were transferred to Clinton Prison from Sing Sing last Fall .
