txt " Well , good-bye , old man . I wish you luck , " said James J. Dowd of this city , about daybreak this morning , as he leaned over the rail of the Poughkeepsie Bridge , 212 feet above high-water mark , and shook hands with Patrick King Callahan , the bridge jumper , A second latter Callahan went whizzing down through space , and in three seconds struck the water , with a shock that sent . the spray flying high in the air . He was picked up at once by men in a boat in waiting , and was stripped to the skin . He raised himself to his feet , and was cheered by spectators in boats and on shore , which tribute he acknowledged by standing up and raising his arms above his head , to show that he was in good shape . As a matter of fact , however , he was very seriously Injured , and he died tonight as a result of his reckless jump . Thus was the feat performed which since the completion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have been done , and was generally considered impossible . Callahan jumped from the spot where " Steve " Brodie claimed to have made his leap about five years ago . Nobody saw Brodie , but at least twenty-five people saw Callahan , and will make affidavit to the genuineness of his performance . Several well-known newspaper men watched him from the time he walked out on the bridge until he made the jump , and held their watches on him . They crossed the river in a dense fog at 5:30 , which lifted on the west side , where the jump was made , about 6 o'clock , and gave them an unobstructed view . The exact time the jump was made was 6:52 A. M. The point was 150 feet west of the most westerly river pier , near the end of the big cantilever arm which shoots out from the steel tower , one of the course marks in the triangular boat race last Summer . Callahan jumped from the north side of the bridge . He and his trainer , D. P. Sullivan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Shore Railroad , at 6:08 o'clock this morning . In the Party were George Bleekman , George Hawkins , the old third baseman of the New Yorks ; George McCormack , William Lloyd , John Eckhardt , and William J. Aikman , all of New-York . Callahan and his party prepared for business the moment they stepped from the train . Callahan was so eager that he could not wait for the day to open , and prepared himself in a barn in the rear . He strapped about his body a life preserver made of cork , and fastened inflated bladders under his arms . He kept his clothing on , except his coat , which he threw over his shoulders . He had on a blue flannel shirt , ordinary underclothing , and a derby hat . The party took a rough path through the hills adjoining the West Shore terminus of the bridge , and climbed on it where the Ironwork comes close to the ground . They walked out to the watch tower . With Callahan were William Lloyd and George McCormack of New-York and James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouped themselves about the bridge jumper to hide his equipments , and marched boldly past the guards . One of the party , as they met the guards , said : " All right , old man : we 're a gang of painters been out on a lark . Show you our passes to-morrow . " The watchman made a show to stop the men , but they hurried along , and he shouted after them that they would have to show their passes , even if they were painters . But his words were wasted . It was now 6:45 o'clock . There was a heavy fog on the east bank , streamers of which reached out and curled about the ironwork on the west side ; but , strange enough , at no time did it hide the western end of the bridge from the view of the eager watchers below . When " King " Callahan clambered over the bridge railing and looked about for a place to jump from he found a lot of telegraph wires in his way . He thrust his legs through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands one of the sleepers that sustain the board walk along the edge of the bridge . With the shout , " Here goes the King , ' " he swung his body out from the bridge and let loose . At first his body fell straight as a plummet line ; then his back and shoulders twisted backward slightly , and in this position he struck the water . ? As the spray parted , Callahan 's body was seen to bob up and down two or three times , and each time he gave a hollow groan . The impetus with which he struck was frightful . The sound from die impact was heard plainly on shore , 500 feet away , and much resembled the boom of a bass drum. ? One of the bladders broke from his arm and shot up in the air . It was an anxious interval while Callahan 's friends in one of the rowboats pulled him in and stretched him out on the bottom . " Are you alive , ' King ' ? " came from one of bis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , " was the response . Liquor was poured down his throat and his clothing was cut from him , and he was thoroughly rubbed to prevent a collapse . Callahan was very pale and shivering , but he raised himself to his feet , and it was first thought that he was all right . Then it was noticed that he was bleeding from an ugly laceration near the groin . Despite this he walked along the railroad track about fifty yards , toward Dean 's Hotel , when be showed signs of weakness , and his friends picked him up and carried him the other half of the distance . He was laid on the barroom floor and rubbed again vigorously , and bathed with alcohol and given liberal doses of brandy , which revived him . All the while he was bleeding freely . Callahan did not want a doctor called , but , after ha was put to bed , Dr. Merill and Dr. Sheedy of this city and a Highland doctor were summoned , and they have been at work on him all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in which three stitches - were taken lacerated the perinaeum. and his pulse could hardly be felt . Late this evening his pulse was stronger and he felt better . Father Bruder of this city called and administered the extreme unction . Callahan said he would get ? well and jump from the bridge again next week , but he died at 11:25 o'clock to-night . The Jump from the Brciciitlyn Bridge . Callahan jumped from the Brooklyn Bridge July 23 , 1895 . He was a bartender then , and , when taken to tie Hudson Street Hospital , gave his address as 434 Third Avenue . The distance to the water from the place where Callahan dropped is about 125 feet . From another section of the span the bridge jumper could have had a. clear fall of 135 feet . When taken to the hospital , it was found that Callahan had been internally injured . He said that the jump had been made to win a. wager of $1,700.                   @ @
