txt THE following simple narrative of events and incidents connected with the assassination of President Lincoln is intended to be confined to the knowledge and personal experience of the writer . As he has never , at home or abroad , encountered any opinion suggesting extenuation of the terrible crime , comment thereon is unnecessary , and will find no place i11 these reminiscences . On the evening of the 14th of April , 1865 , a few minutes after 10 o'clock , I was in company with a friend walking on Pennsylvania Avenue , when a man running down 10th Street approached us , wildly exclaiming : " My God , the President is killed at Ford 's Theatre ! " Calling to my friend to follow me II ran to the theatre , two blocks away , perceiving as I neared it increasing evidences of the wildest excitement , which reached its climax in the auditorium . How it was that I worked my way through the shouting crowd that filled the house , and found myself o*'er the footlights and on the stage , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I addressed a rational word was a detective , now one of the oldest in the city . I asked him who had done the shooting . When he mentioned the name of Wilkes Booth I scouted the idea ; but others insisted that Booth had been recognized in the man who had leaped from the President 's box and rushed across the stage . Excited crowds during the war were nothing new to me , but I had never witnessed such a scene as was now presented - The seats , aisles , galleries , and stage were filled with shouting , frenzied men and women , many running aimlessly over one another ; a chaos of disorder beyond control , had any visible authority attempted its exercise . The spot upon which the eyes of all would t*urn was the fatal upper stage box , // opposite to which I now stood . Access to it was guarded , but presently a man in the uniform of an army surgeon was assisted ' by numerous arms and shoulders to climb into the box to join the medical men already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the shot was fired , had left the stage and gone to the assistance of Mrs. Lincoln , and I soon caught a glimpse of that unhappy lady who had apparently arisen from her husband 's side . She stood in view for a moment , when throwing up her arms , with a mournful cry , she disappeared from sight of the stage . I now made my way towards the box exit to await the descent of Miss Keene , hoping to learn from her the President 's condition . I met her at the foot of the staircase leading from the box , and alone . Making a motion to arrest her progress , I begged her to tell me if Mr. Lincoln was still alive . " God only knows ! " she gasped , stopping for a moment 's rest . The memory of that apparition will never leave me . Attired , as I had so often seen her , in the costume of her part in " Our American Cousin , " her hair and dress were in disorder , and not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands , and even her cheeks where her fingers had strayed , were bedaubed with the sorry stains ! But lately the central figure in the scene of comedy , she now appeared the incarnation of tragedy . Preparations were now being made to remove the President to the neighboring house where he breathed his last about seven o'clock the next morning , and the theatre was soon cleared and left in possession of the troops which had arrived . By this time , the fact of the murderous attack on Mr. Seward had become generally known , and the rumors grew as to similar attacks on the lives of other high officials . The streets were filled with people , and the hotels were centres of surging crowds . Beyond the chief actor , the President 's assassin , whose identity was still a mooted question , there was none to whom suspicion as yet pointed . All trace of Booth was lost and the direction of his flight a mystery . Had the then unknown and unconceived telephone been in existence , could the headlong ride of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? With Alexandria , the " Long " and " Chain " bridges , Tennallytown , Brightwood , Beuning , and Anacostia-all in vocal communication , what changes in the drama might not its swift agency have // wrought ! Although the military telegraph was being worked to its full capacity , the galloping Booth and Herold had outstripped its operation , and with slackened speed had leisurely crossed the Navy Yard bridge , only delayed by a few commonplace questions by the unsuspecting sentries . They were now free from immediate pursuit , and were riding through a country with which Herold was thoroughly familiar . The story has oft been told of their twelve days ' journey , broken by rests of hiding , their crossing the Potomac , and their discovery and capture in Caroline County , Virginia . During that eventful night , urgent was the need of the " Old Capitol Prison " for its strong garrison . On that very afternoon , as the maddened crowds well knew , a hundred or more Confederate officers had arrived in the city as prisoners of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dilapidated old crib on Capitol Hill . Fierce threats of burning the building and slaughtering the prisoners were freely made ; but the city was under arms , and the Provost Marshal on the alert . Indeed , some of the resident population suspected of secession or Southern sympathies were far from safe . In one yelling crowd that started from Willard 's Hotel up Fourteenth Street towards the Ebbitt House , I managed to edge my way in with the leaders , and to dissuade them , I scarce remember how , from violence against the residence of a well-known physician . I did not consider it necessary on that night to confide to any one the fact that I was an acquaintance of Booth ; but I often thought before the morning of two army friends of mine whose reflections could scarcely have been comfortable . They were loyal and devoted Union soldiers , but chance alone had saved them from a serious and embarrassing predicament in connection with the assassin . Booth had several months previously made their acquaintance , and knowing that among their duties as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits by day and night to the chain of fortifications surrounding the city , he had proposed to accompany one or both of them when their turns should arrive . He was a fine horseman , and it had seemed but natural that the solitary rides of their civilian friend might be pleasantly diversified by this new experience . But changes in their detail and other circumstances had , happily for them , interfered with their // appointments with Booth , and rescued them from the company of so compromising a volunteer aid . I may mention here that the companion who was with me when we first heard of the assassination , and who was an intimate friend of some high officials , was arrested on the street the next day owing to a fancied resemblance to Booth . It was through these officers that I had made the acquaintance of Booth . Being domiciled at the National Hotel , he had during the winter invited them to attend a dance or " hop " to be given there , and to extend the invitation to any friend . They asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their friend the actor . I duly attended the function , and on entering the ball-room ( the large dining hail ) was met by one of my military friends , who conducted me through a glass door to a private nook where Booth was entertaining his friends with champagne . The host received me most cordially , and I was soon hobnobbing with the popular actor . His handsome presence and engaging manner at once captivated me , and during the hour I remained I had several chats with him , the beginning of a pleasant association of many weeks . During this period he seemed to have been occasionally absent from town , but we frequently met and strolled on the Avenue , usually dropping into Hancock 's . The old man , " Uncle Andrew , " was then in the prime of his genial old age , and his mulatto assistant , " Dick , " was justly celebrated for his ministrations to the convivial frequenters of this unique old curiosity shop . Booth and I occasionally drifted into subjects theatrical , and I , but two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davenport , Setchell , McCullough , Lawrence Barrett , the Mestayers , Westerns , and Fanny Clarke at my tongue 's end . I had known all of the men , most of them as stock actors . All of them were then becoming famous , none of them , alas ! now living . Booth never spoke to me of the war or of national affairs with more than a passing word , and while it was plain to be seen that he was Southern in bis feelings , I did not class him as a Secessionist . It was almost as difficult afterwards to realize , as then to dream , that the mind and heart clothed in such engaging presence was harboring a treasonable and murderous conspiracy ; or that the hand lifting the friendly glass was to direct the fatal shot that awoke two hemispheres in horror ! And strange , too , were these chance meetings in the quaint little museum which his impending // fate was soon to furnish with the other sensational objects upon which we may gaze to-day . But returning to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gathering of notable persons in the old " Metropolitan Club , " then situate on the corner now occupied by Wormley 's Hotel . Upon the Club register , now in possession of its social namesake , was entered , in a few impressive lines , a brief account of the night 's tragic happenings . As the club-house was on the same block as the Seward ( now the Blame ) residence , I tarried there until satisfied that Mr. Seward was in no imminent danger , and then went home to sleep as best I might . Before breakfast the next morning the expected intelligence of the President 's death had spread throughout the city , although in many households it was the first intimation of the night 's tragedy . Early in the forenoon my own was one of the hundreds of houses already draped in the emblems of mourning . Before noon I was at the Navy Yard , where my brother , a captain of marines , had , during the night , in obedience to orders from the Navy Department , occupied with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Saugus , " lying out in the stream . They had been designated for service as a prison for the reception and safekeeping of such prisoners as might be sent on board . Entering one of her boats , I was soon on the deck of the " Montauk , " and in conversation with the captain , who recounted to me his experiences of the preceding night . Among others who had been sent on board were Atzerodt , who had been arrested for intent to kill Vice-President Johnson , and Spangler , the stage carpenter , for assisting Booth to escape from the building . The captain told me that Atzerodt had sent for him and made a partial confession , to the effect that he had entered into a conspiracy with Booth and others to abduct the President and other prominent officers of the government , but when lie found that plan abandoned , and the plot changed to one of murder , he had faltered . But such was his fear of Booth , personally , *that lie had not dared risk the detection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurking around the " Kirkwood House , " where Mr. Johnson lived . This confession was of no avail . It was not admitted on the trial , and he met his deserved fate as a conspirator and accessory in treason and assassination . On revisiting the INavy Yard on the next day , I found that // Payne was a prisoner , having been captured at Mrs. Surratt 's house in the city , and identified as the assailant of Mr. Seward . It will be remembered by those familiar with the events of the trial , that Payne 's counsel , Colonel Doster , made no formal argument for the defence , but read and submitted to the Court a most eloquent plea for mercy , containing the story of his client 's parentage , and short though eventful career . It appeared that his true name was Powell . He had entered the Confederate service from his native State of Florida , served in the army of Virginia , and , in the early part of 1861 , after seeing Booth at the theatre in Richmond , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had subsequently been captured , had escaped , and found his way to Kiltimore , where in the winter of 1864-5 he had again encountered Booth . Three years had passed with their experience of adventure and bloodshed . He was now poor and needy , hopeless for his cause and embittered in his devotion to it ; and he but little required the eloquence of his former idol to become his slave , and to find in him a leader in any enterprise , however desperate . He was older in character at twenty years of age than the boyish and silly ilerold , several years his senior , or than the degraded Atzerodt , whose maturer years had brought no experiences more heroic than those gained in river blockade-running and stable lounging . Of the truth of the so-called Payne 's statements regarding his name and origin , I had abundant evidence to satisfy me within two months after his execution . There is at present residing in Washington a well-known and successful lawyer , a native and Confederate soldier of Florida , who in the early autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first visit to the North . During one of our strolls al ) Out the city , and without disclosing my object , I took him into Gardner 's gallery on Seventh Street , where were to be seen photographs of the conspirators . We examined them all casually , and I then called his attention to that of Payne , asking if he perceived in it a likeness to any one . He gave it a closer scrutiny , and then said it " looked like a youngster named Powell . " He said that the boy was the son of a minister in Florida . He had not belonged to Powell 's company , and had not known him well ; but making allowance for the changes that five years might have wrought in his face and form , he felt confident in the recognition of // the individual he had known . These and other items I gleaned from my friend , who had never read Colonel Doster 's plea , with which , on comparison , I found his statements to coincide . But another question touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and its solution had been most decisively settled . There was an attempt made , and by some persons vehemently persisted in , to make it appear that the so called Payne was actually the son of Captain Sydney Smith Lee , late of the United States Navy , the brother of Robert E. Lee , and therefore a nephew of the Confederate leader , and a brother of General Fitzhugh Lee . To explain how such an idea might have been temporarily entertained , I will mention a startling conversation I had with my brother on the morning after Payne had been brought on board . The Captain took me aside and told me that he had a half suspicion that the man called Payne might be his old friend , Dan Lee , his schoolmate at Dr. Arnold 's Rugby Academy , near J3altimore , and of whom I had often heard him speak . He thns explained his apprehension . He had followed the guard to the cell provided for the prisoner 's reception , and which had been extemporized in a coal bunker . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's extraordinary strength and desperate nature , he had caused the cell to be prepared , and proceeded to superintend the disposition of the prisoner to prevent self injury . The man was seated , and his head somewhat bowed , so that his position did not allow the dim light of the ship 's lantern to disclose more than a partial view of his features . No conversation passed between them , the officer 's duty only having in view such precautions for the prisoner 's safe keeping as were necessary and not inconsistent with humanity . He left the door of the cell haunted by this shadow of recognition , but spoke to no one until he saw me in the morning . The prisoners were now brought on deck to be photographed , and the opportunity was presented for the settlement of this unwelcome doubt . During the sitting I was rejoiced to see an expression of relief appear upon the Captain 's countenance , and when he rejoined me he fervently said : " Thank God , there 's nothing in it . Dan Lee never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dark eyes and fine teeth , while this one 's eyes are blue and his teeth very bad . " Yet ignoring these essential // points of difference , there were several persons present at the trial , who doggedly clung to this sensational belief . I first met Dan Lee several years afterward. and he then laughingly spoke of my brother 's account of the affair . On the 28th of April , on my way to the Navy Yard , I learned that Booth and Herold had been captured , and that the latter , with Booth 's body , had been brought up the river , and were on board the " Monitor . " At the gate I found that no one at this time was allowed to visit the ships . The officer of the day , an old friend , invited me into his quarters , and explained that this restriction had come from the Navy Department , because of the numbers of people that the good nature of the Commandant of the Yard had permitted to overcrowd the vessels . He thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board ; so , sending for a corporal , he instructed him to " take this man on board the " Saugus , " and deliver him to the captain in command . " I can not say that there was aught exchanged between the officer and man beyond these words , but within ten minutes I was " delivered , " and received by the captain , somewhat to his surprise . I soon found myself mingling with the groups of official people on board , with some of whom I was acquainted . One of them was General Eckert , an Assistant Secretary of War , who asked rue if I wished to see Booth 's body , and pointed to a gathering of people on the after deck . I was soon gazing at the remains , which needed no long inspection to enable me to recognize them . The handsome countenance was unmarred by the agony of his lingering death , which I was soon to hear described . There were missing the moustache and the curling lock upon his forehead , which during the flight had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his broken leg had been set , and its foot was now covered by an old shoe , replacing the riding boot which it was found necessary to cut off . The body was resting upon a rough carpenter 's bench , where it had lain since early morning , and it was now awaiting , before a kind of military coroner 's jury , an official identification , in which I little thought I was soon to bear a part . But presently the scene shifted forward , for ilerold was brought on deck to be photographed . As I stood near the hatchway , I had my first look at him as he slowly ascended and moved forward with the sentries . He was not only handcuffed , but to // his leg irons were attached , a chain , and a 32-pound shot , the latter being carried by the sentry in the rear . As they approached the turret the gangway narrowed , and their footsteps along the iron deck were but a few feet from the water . The idea instantly seized me that at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last and only opportunity of escape from the gallows . A sudden dash to the right , and his impetus would have dragged the shot , if not the sentry , after him over the unrailed side of the " Monitor " ; and in two minutes thereafter his parting breath would have bubbled to the surface from where he lay anchored , three fathoms below , on the muddy bottom of the river . But had the thought occurred to him , it was not to be ; and he remained among the living a few weeks longer , to complete the doomed quartette upon the scaffold . I then returned to Booth 's body , accompanied by General Eckert , when conversation ensued regarding my knowledge of the man and my recognition of the remains . Having been on board for over an hour , I was about to take my leave , when General Eckert informed me that a military commission was about to convene , and the presiding officer desired me to remain as a witness . Shortly afterwards I was summoned to the cabin where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I recall General bIt , the Judge Advocate General of the Army , Judge Bingham , of Ohio , and the well-known Col. Lafayette C. Baker . My examination was short , the questions relating to the length of my personal acquaintance with Booth , and to the positiveness of my recognition of his body , and after my dismissal from the stand I was allowed to remain in court . The examination of the next witness was more interesting in detail , being that of Daw&amp;on , a clerk in the National Hotel , who it appeared had known Booth for some years . When asked whether the man had possessed any physical peculiarity by which he could recognize the remains , he replied in the affirmative . He had often seen on Booth 's right hand , at the junction of the thumb and forefinger , the initials , " J. W. B. " in india ink . This mark had sometimes come under his notice when the actor was writing his name on the hotel register , and he had more than once made the remark : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pretty white hand in such a way . " Another witness presently appeared in the person of Dr. J. // Frederick May . It having been ascertained that Booth had been his patient , the IDoctor was sent for , and brought directly from his residence to the cabin of the ship , without seeing the remains on deck . He answered the questions as to his relations with Booth , by saying that , after the actor had become his patient , a mutual liking had ensued , and that he had occasionally attended the theatre with tickets sent by him . As a means of identification he mentioned a tumor on the neck about which he had been consulted . Booth had come to him with an angry swelling on the left side of his neck , which he had found to be a tumor , and removed with the knife . After dressing it , he advised the patient to be very careful in his movements ; that the place would heal by " first intention , " and have a small seam-like scar that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disfigurement . Some days afterward he had returned , and said that all had gone well np to the time of an unforeseen accident . In Baltimore he had been playing some part with Charlotte Cushman , where some stage business in the scene required her grasp upon his shoulder . But the vehemence of action , for which this celebrated actress was proverbial , had caused her to miss her aim , and she struck him on the neck with such violence as to reopen the wonnd , then not quite healed . Further treatment and redressing was resorted to , and the wound had finally healed by " granulation , " the scar being enlarged , and resembling that caused by vaccination . This exact condition was apparent when the body was examined in the presence of members of the Commission , thus setting at rest the question of identity . Then followed the testimony of the officer who had commanded the pursuing party ; and most intensely interesting was this narrative from the lips of one of the chief actors in that tragic retribution . During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autopsy , the ghastly results of which met my sight when I ascended . It was the first " post mortem " I had ever seen , and the only one of which a personal acquaintance has been the subject . And what a shocking change was before me , to find life , health , manly beauty , and brave attire replaced by death , mutilated bone and viscera , and travel- worn blood-stained rags ! Even then I could fancy the relic hunter plying his vocation , and im* // bruing his ready handkerchief in the clotted blood , that he might preserve , exhibit , and mayhap peddle his gruesome trophy ! I have lately seen in print an account of the preservation and partition of the blood-stained dress of Laura Keene , of which I have made previous mention of seeing in the theatre . So many stories were shortly after this time published concerning the final disposition of Booth 's remains , that I must state , in conclusion , what I saw and knew about it . Some acconnts treated the subject as a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the body was carried down the river and bay by night , and thence out to sea , where it was sunk forever out of the sight and knowledge of men . Nine years afterward I met in Enrope an Englishman , who declared and offered to wager that Booth was then alive and in India . He " knew all about it , " of course ; but he eventually decided not to lose the considerable number of pounds sterling he had offered to risk when I engaged to produce an authenticated extract of the proceedings of the Commission . The facts , with which I was well acquainted , are these : After the adjournment of the Commission , the remains were , in my sight , sewn up in a navy blanket and passed over the side of the vessel into a small boat , manned by two persons , one of whom was rowing , and who , had been detailed by Colonel Baker , with instructions which they kept to themselves . The boat proceeded down the Anacostia and disappeared around the point in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barracks . In these grounds was the old Penitentiary , within the walls of which the conspirators were subsequently confined , tried , and four of them executed . The officers on duty at the Arsenal were well known to me , two of them being my relatives . A short time subsequently one of these told me of the receipt by him of the body , and its interment in a cellar under the Penitentiary building on the day I saw the last of it . Several years afterward , as is now well known , the Government turned it over to the family , and it is now resting in their cemetery plot in Baltimore.
