I shall , therefore , attempt neither eulogy nor apology , nor shall I feel called upon to undertake to criticise the actions or the failures of the living or the dead , save where such criticism may prove to be an essential part of the narrative . From the brows of other soldiers , no one of us could ever wish to pluck the wreaths so dearly won , so honorably worn ; yet , since the laurel grows wild on every hill-side in this favored land , we may without trespass be permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred places where beneath the cypresses and the magnolias of the lowlands of Louisiana , or under the green turf among the mountains of Virginia , reposes all that was mortal of so many thousands of our brave and beloved comrades . THE NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS . CHAPTER I. NEW ORLEANS . The opening of the Mississippi and the capture of New Orleans formed important parts of the first comprehensive plan of campaign , conceived and proposed by Lieutenant-General Scott soon after the outbreak of the war . When McClellan was called to Washington to command the Army of the Potomac , one of his earliest communications to the President set forth in general terms his plans for the suppression of the Rebellion . Of these plans , also , the capture of New Orleans formed an integral and important part . Both Scott and McClellan contemplated a movement down the river by a strong column . However nothing had been done by either toward carrying out this project , when , in September , 1861 , the Navy Department took up the idea of an attack on New Orleans from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana , New Orleans was not only the first city in wealth , population , and importance in the seceded States , but the sixth in all the Union . With a population of nearly 170,000 souls , she carried on an export trade larger than that of any other port in the country , and enjoyed a commerce in magnitude and profit second only to that of New York . The year just ended had witnessed the production of the largest crop of cotton ever grown in America , fully two fifths of which passed through the presses and paid toll to the factors of New Orleans . The receipts of cotton at this port for the year 1860-1861 were but little less than 2,000,000 bales , valued at nearly $100,000,000 . Of sugar , mainly the production of the State of Louisiana , the receipts considerably exceeded 250,000 tons , valued at more than $25,000,000 ; the total receipts of products of all kinds amounted to nearly $200,000,000 . The exports were valued at nearly $110,000,000 ; the imports at nearly $23,000,000 . It is doubtful if any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once so large and so uniform to all persons interested as the cotton and sugar of Louisiana . If cotton were not exactly king , as it was in those days the fashion to assert , there could be no doubt that cotton was a banker , and a generous banker for New Orleans . The factors of Carondelet Street grew rich upon the great profits that the planters of the " coast , " as the shores of the river are called , paid them , almost without feeling it , while the planters came , nearly every winter , to New Orleans to pass the season and to spend , in a round of pleasure , at least a portion of the net proceeds of the account sales . In the transport of these products nearly two thousand sailing ships and steamers were engaged , and in the town itself or its suburb of Algiers , on the opposite bank , were to be found all the appliances and facilities necessary for the conduct of so extensive a commerce . These , especially the work-shops and factories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levee , were destined to prove of the greatest military value , at first to the Confederacy , and later to the forces of the Union . For food and fuel , however , New Orleans was largely dependent upon the North and West . Finally , beside her importance as the guardian of the gates of the Mississippi , New Orleans had a direct military value as the basis of any operations destined for the control or defence of the Mississippi River . About the middle of November the plan took definite shape , and on the 23d of December Farragut received preparatory orders to take command of the West Gulf Squadron and the naval portion of the expedition destined for the reduction of New Orleans . Farragut received his final orders on the 20th of January , 1862 , and immediately afterward hoisted his flag on the sloop-of-war Hartford . The land portion of the expedition was placed under the command of Major-General Benjamin F. Butler . On the 10th and 12th of September , 1861 , Butler had been authorized by the War Department to raise , organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England States , such troops as he might judge fit for the purpose , to make an expedition along the eastern shore of Maryland and Virginia to Cape Charles ; but early in November , before Butler 's forces were quite ready , these objects were accomplished by a brigade under Lockwood , sent from Baltimore by Dix . On the 23d of November the advance of Butler 's expedition sailed from Portland , Maine , for Ship Island , in the steamer Constitution , and on the 2d of December , in reporting the sailing , Butler submitted to the War Department his plan for invading the coast of Texas and the ultimate capture of New Orleans . On the 24th of January , 1862 , McClellan , then commanding all the armies of the United States , was called on by the Secretary of War to report whether the expedition proposed by General Butler should be prosecuted , abandoned , or modified , and in what manner . McClellan at once urged that the expedition be suspended . In his opinion , " not less than 30,000 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insure success against New Orleans in a blow to be struck from the Gulf . " This suggestion did not meet the approval of the government , now fully determined on the enterprise . Brigadier-General J. G. Barnard , the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac , an engineer also of more than common ability , energy , and experience , was now called into consultation . On the 28th of January , 1862 , he submitted to the Navy Department a memorandum describing fully the defences of Forts Jackson and St. Philip and outlining a plan for a combined attempt on these works by the army and navy . The military force required for the purpose he estimated at 20,000 men . Meanwhile the work of transferring Butler 's forces by sea to Ship Island had been going on with vigor . He had raised thirteen regiments of infantry , ten batteries of light artillery , and three troops of cavalry , numbering in all about 13,600 men . To these were now added from the garrison of Baltimore three regiments , the 21st Indiana , 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery , thus increasing his force to 14,400 infantry , 275 cavalry , and 580 artillerists ; in all , 15,255 officers and men . On the 23d of February , 1862 , Butler received his final orders : " The object of your expedition , " said McClellan , " is one of vital importance  --  the capture of New Orleans . The route selected is up the Mississippi River , and the first obstacle to be encountered ( perhaps the only one ) is in the resistance offered by Forts St. Philip and Jackson . It is expected that the navy can reduce these works . Should the navy fail to reduce the works , you will land your forces and siege-train , and endeavor to breach the works , silence their guns , and carry them by assault . " The next resistance will be near the English bend , where there are some earthen batteries . Here it may be necessary for you to land your troops to co-operate with the naval attack , although it is more than probable that the navy , unassisted , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of New Orleans necessarily falls . " After obtaining possession of New Orleans , the instructions went on to say , Butler was to reduce all the works guarding the approaches , to join with the navy in occupying Baton Rouge , and then to endeavor to open communication with the northern column by the Mississippi , always bearing in mind the necessity of occupying Jackson , as soon as this could safely be done . Mobile was to follow , then Pensacola and Galveston . By the time New Orleans should have fallen the government would probably reinforce his army sufficiently to accomplish all these objects . On the same day a new military department was created called the Department of the Gulf , and Butler was assigned to the command . Its limits were to comprise all the coast of the Gulf of Mexico west of Pensacola harbor , and so much of the Gulf States as might be occupied by Butler 's forces . Since the middle of October he had commanded the expeditionary forces , under the name of the Department of New England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he formally assumed the command of the Department of the Gulf , announcing Major George C. Strong as Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff , Lieutenant Godfrey Weitzel as Chief Engineer , and Surgeon Thomas Hewson Bache as Medical Director . To these were afterward added Colonel John Wilson Shaffer as Chief Quartermaster , Colonel John W. Turner as Chief Commissary , and Captain George A. Kensel as Acting Assistant Inspector-General and Chief of Artillery . By the end of March all the troops destined for the expedition had landed at Ship Island , with the exception of the 13th Connecticut , 15th Maine , 7th and 8th Vermont regiments , 1st Vermont and 2d Massachusetts batteries . Within the next fortnight all these troops joined the force except the 2d Massachusetts battery , which being detained more than seven weeks at Fortress Monroe , and being nearly five weeks at sea , did not reach New Orleans until the 21st of May . Meanwhile , of the six Maine batteries , all except the 1st had been diverted to other fields of service . While awaiting at Ship Island the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt on the river forts , Butler proceeded to organize his command and to discipline and drill the troops composing it . Many of these were entirely without instruction in any of the details of service . On the 22d of March , he divided his forces into three brigades of five or six regiments each , attaching to each brigade one or more batteries of artillery and a troop of cavalry . These brigades were commanded by Brigadier-Generals John W. Phelps and Thomas Williams , and Colonel George F. Shepley of the 12th Maine . When finally assembled the whole force reported about 13,500 officers and men for duty , and from that moment its strength was destined to undergo a steady diminution by the natural attrition of service , augmented , in this case , by climatic influences . The fleet under Farragut consisted of seventeen vessels , mounting 154 guns . Four were screw-sloops , one a side-wheel steamer , three screw corvettes , and nine screw gunboats . Each of the gunboats carried one 11-inch smooth-bore gun , and one 30-pounder rifle ; but neither of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in the operations awaiting the fleet , it is within bounds to say that not more than one gun in four could be brought to bear at any given moment . With this fleet were twenty mortar-boats , under Porter , each carrying one 13-inch mortar , and six gunboats , assigned for the service of the mortar-boats and armed like the gunboats of the river fleet . Farragut , with the Hartford , had reached Ship Island on the 20th of February ; the rest of the vessels assigned to his fleet soon followed . Then entering the delta , from that time he conducted the blockade of the river from the head of the passes . The Confederacy was now being so closely pressed in every quarter as to make it impossible , with the forces at its command , to defend effectively and at the same moment every point menaced by the troops and fleets of the Union . Thus the force that might otherwise have been employed in defending New Orleans was , under the pressure of the emergency , so heavily drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisting the southward advance of the combined armies of the Union under Halleck , as to leave New Orleans , and indeed all Louisiana , at the mercy of any enemy that should succeed in passing the river forts . At this time the entire land-force , under Major-General Mansfield Lovell , hardly exceeded 5,000 men . Of these , 1,100 occupied Forts Jackson and St. Philip , under the command of General Duncan ; 1,200 held the Chalmette line , under General Martin L. Smith , and about 3,000 , chiefly new levies , badly armed , were in New Orleans . Besides this small land-force , the floating defences consisted of four improvised vessels of the Confederate navy , two belonging to the State of Louisiana , and six others of what was called the Montgomery fleet . These were boats specially constructed for the defence of the river , but most of them had been sent up the river to Memphis to hold off Foote and Davis . The twelve vessels carried in all thirty-eight guns . Each of the boats of the river-fleet defence had its bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was also the case with the two sea-going steamers belonging to the State . Of this flotilla the most powerful was the iron-clad Louisiana , whose armor was found strong enough to turn an 11-inch shell at short range , and , as her armament consisted of two 7-inch rifles , three 9-inch shell guns , four 18-inch shell guns , and seven 6-inch rifles , she might have proved a formidable foe had her engines been equal to their work . At the Plaquemine Bend , twenty miles above the head of the passes and ninety below New Orleans , the engineers of the United States had constructed two permanent fortifications , designed to defend the entrance of the river against the foreign enemies of the Union . These formidable works had now to be passed or taken before New Orleans could be occupied . Fort St. Philip , on the left or north bank , was a work of brick and earth , flanked on either hand by a water battery . In the main work were mounted , in barbette , four 8-inch columbiads and one 24-pounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower one one 8-inch columbiad , one 7-inch rifle , six 42-pounders , nine 32-pounders , and four 24-pounders . Besides these , there were seven mortars , one of 13-inch calibre , five of 10-inch , and one of 8-inch . Forty-two of the guns could be brought to bear upon the fleet ascending the river . Fort Jackson , on the south or left bank of the river , was a casemated pentagon of brick , mounting in the casemates fourteen 24-pounder guns , and ten 24-pounder howitzers , and in barbette in the upper tier two 10-inch columbiads , three 8-inch columbiads , one 7-inch rifle , six 42-pounders , fifteen 32-pounders , and eleven 24-pounders , in all sixty-two guns . The water battery below the main work was armed with one 10-inch columbiad , two 8-inch columbiads , and two rifled 32-pounders . Fifty of these pieces were available against the fleet , but of the whole armament of one hundred and nine guns , fifty-six were old 24-pounder smooth-bores . The passage of the forts had been obstructed by a raft or chain anchored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence remained to be encountered until English Turn was reached , where earthworks had been thrown up on both banks . Here at Chalmette , on the left bank , it was that , in 1815 , Jackson , with his handful of raw levies , so signally defeated Wellington 's veterans of the Peninsula , under the leadership of the fearless Pakenham . Fort St. Philip stands about 700 yards higher up the river than Fort Jackson ; the river at this point is about 800 yards wide , and the distance between the nearest salients of the main works is about 1,000 yards . A vessel attempting to run the gauntlet of the batteries would be under fire while passing over a distance of three and a half miles . The river was now high , and the banks , everywhere below the river level , and only protected from inundation by the levees , were overflowed . There was no standing room for an investing army ; the lower guns were under water , and in the very forts the platforms were awash . When the fleet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phelps and Williams on transports , and , going to the head of the passes , held his troops in readiness to co-operate with the navy . On the 16th of April the fleet took up its position . The mortar-boats , or " bombers , " as they began to be called , were anchored between 3,000 and 4,000 yards below Fort Jackson , upon which the attack was mainly to be directed . From the view of those in the fort , the boats that lay under the right bank were covered by trees . Those on the opposite side of the river were screened , after a fashion , by covering their hulls with reeds and willows , cut for the purpose . On the 18th of April the bombardment began . It soon became evident that success was not to be attained in this way , and Farragut determined upon passing the forts with his fleet . Should he fail in reducing them by this movement , Butler was to land in the rear of Fort St. Philip , near Quarantine , and carry the works by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forts , and waited for the hour . Shepley occupied Ship Island with the rest of the force . Early in March the raft , formed of great cypress trees , forty feet long and fifty inches through , laid lengthwise in the river about three feet apart , anchored by heavy chains and strengthened by massive cross-timbers , had been partly carried away by the flood . To make good the damage , a number of large schooners had then been anchored in the gap . On the morning of the 21st of April this formidable obstruction was cleverly and in a most gallant manner broken through by the fleet . On the night of the 23d of April , Farragut moved to the attack . His fleet , organized in three divisions of eight , three , and six vessels respectively , was formed in line ahead . The first division was led by Captain Bailey , in the Cayuga , followed by the Pensacola , Mississippi , Oneida , Varuna , Katahdin , Kineo , and Wissahickon ; the second division followed , composed of Farragut 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn , and the Richmond ; while the third division , forming the rear of the column , was led by Captain Bell , in the Sciota , followed by the Iroquois , Kennebec , Pinola , Itasca , and Winona . At half-past two o'clock on the morning of the 24th of April the whole fleet was under way ; a quarter of an hour later the batteries of Forts Jackson and St. Philip opened simultaneously upon the Cayuga . It was some time before the navy could reply , but soon every gun was in action . Beset by perils on every hand , the fleet pressed steadily up the river . The Confederate boats were destroyed , the fire-rafts were overcome , the gunners of the forts were driven from their guns , and when the sun rose Farragut was above the forts with the whole of his fleet , except the Itasca , Winona , and Kennebec , which put back disabled , and the Varuna , sunk by the Confederate gunboats . The next afternoon , having made short work of Chalmette , Farragut anchored off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The casualties were 37 killed and 147 wounded , in all 184 . The Confederate loss was 50 , 11 killed and 39 wounded . The Louisiana , McCrea , and Defiance , sole survivors of the Confederate fleet , escaping comparatively unhurt , took refuge under the walls of Fort St. Philip . Leaving Phelps , with the 30th Massachusetts and 12th Connecticut and Manning 's 4th Massachusetts battery , at the head of the passes , in order to be prepared to occupy the works immediately on their surrender , Butler hastened with the rest of his force to Sable Island in the rear of Fort St. Philip . When the transports came to anchor on the morning of the 26th , the Confederate flags on Forts St. Philip and Jackson were plainly visible to the men on board , while these , in their turn , were seen from the forts . Here the troops received the news of Farragut 's arrival at New Orleans . On the morning of the 28th they saw the Confederate ram Louisiana blown up while floating past the forts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paine with two companies of the 4th Wisconsin and a detachment of the 21st Indiana , to work their way through a small canal to Quarantine , six miles above Fort St. Philip , for the purpose of seizing the narrow strip by which the garrison must escape , if at all . This was only accomplished by a long and tiresome transport in boats , and finally by wading . However , at half-past two on the afternoon of the 28th April , the Confederate flags over Forts Jackson and St. Philip were observed to disappear ; the national ensign floated in their stead ; and soon it became known that Duncan had surrendered to Porter . Porter immediately took possession and held it until Phelps came up the river to relieve him . Then Major Whittemore , of the 30th Massachusetts , with about two hundred men of his regiment , landed and took command at Fort St. Philip , while Manning occupied Fort Jackson . Almost simultaneously the frigate Mississippi came down the river , bringing Jones with the news that his regiment was at Quarantine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealing the last avenue of escape ; for at this time the levee formed the only pathway . On the 29th Phelps put Deming in command of Fort Jackson , intending to leave his regiment , the 12th Connecticut , in garrison there , and to place Dudley , with the 30th Massachusetts , at Fort St. Philip ; but before this arrangement could be carried out , orders came from Butler , designating the 26th Massachusetts as the garrison of the two forts , with Jones in command . Phelps , with his force , was directed to New Orleans . On the 1st of May Butler landed at New Orleans and took military possession of the city . Simultaneously , at five o'clock in the afternoon , the 31st Massachusetts with a section of Everett 's 6th Massachusetts battery , and six companies of the 4th Wisconsin , under Paine , disembarked and marched up the broad levee to the familiar airs that announced the joint coming of " Yankee Doodle " and of " Picayune Butler . " The outlying defences on both banks of the river and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . Forts Pike and Wood , on Lake Pontchartrain , were garrisoned by detachments from the 7th Vermont and 8th New Hampshire regiments . The 21st Indiana landed at Algiers , and marching to Brashear , eighty miles distant on Berwick Bay , took possession of the New Orleans and Opelousas railway . New Orleans itself was occupied by the 30th and 31st Massachusetts , the 4th Wisconsin and 6th Michigan , 9th and 12th Connecticut , 4th and 6th Massachusetts batteries , 2d Vermont battery , and Troops A and B of the Massachusetts cavalry . At Farragut 's approach Lovell , seeing that further resistance was useless , abandoned New Orleans to its fate and withdrew to Camp Moore , distant seventy-eight miles , on the line of the Jackson railway . CHAPTER II . THE FIRST ATTEMPT ON VICKSBURG . With the capture of New Orleans the first and vital object of the expedition had been accomplished . The occupation of Baton Rouge by a combined land and naval force was the next point indicated in McClellan 's orders to Butler . Then he was to endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi . McClellan was no longer General-in-chief ; but this part of his plan represented the settled views of the government . On the 2d of May , therefore , Farragut sent Craven with the Brooklyn and six other vessels of the fleet up the river . On the 8th , as early as the river transports could be secured , Butler sent Williams with the 4th Wisconsin and the 6th Michigan regiments , and two sections of Everett 's 6th Massachusetts battery , to follow and accompany the fleet . The next day Williams landed his force at Bonnet Carre , on the east bank of the river , about thirty-five miles above the town . After wading about five miles through a swamp , where the water and mud were about three feet deep , the troops halted at night at Frenier , a station of the Jackson railway , situated on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain , about ten miles above Kenner . A detachment of the 4th Wisconsin , under Major Boardman , was sent to Pass Manchac . The Confederates made a slight but ineffective resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bridges at Pass Manchac and Frenier being then destroyed , on the following morning , the 10th , the troops marched back the weary ten miles along the uneven trestle-work of the railway from Frenier to Kenner and there took transport . After their long confinement on shipboard , with scant rations , without exercise or even freedom of movement , the excessive heat of the day caused the troops to suffer severely . The embarkation completed , the transports , under convoy of the navy , set out for Baton Rouge . There on the morning of the 12th of May the troops landed , the capitol was occupied by the 4th Wisconsin , and the national colors were hoisted over the building . The troops then re-embarked for Vicksburg . Natchez surrendered on the 12th of May to Commander S. Phillips Lee , of the Oneida , the advance of Farragut 's fleet . On the 18th of May the Oneida and her consorts arrived off Vicksburg , and the same day Williams and Lee summoned " the authorities " to surrender the town and " its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To this Brigadier-General Martin L. Smith , commander of the defences , promptly replied : " Having been ordered here to hold these defences , my intention is to do so as long as it is in my power . " On the 19th the transports stopped for wood at Warrenton , about ten miles below Vicksburg , and here a detachment of the 4th Wisconsin , sent to guard the working party , became involved in a skirmish with the Confederates , in which Sergeant-Major N. H. Chittenden and Private C. E. Perry , of A Company , suffered the first wounds received in battle by the troops of the United States in the Department of the Gulf . The Confederates were easily repulsed , with small loss . Almost at the instant when Farragut was decided to run the gauntlet of the forts , Beauregard had begun to fortify Vicksburg . Up to this time he had trusted the defence of the river above New Orleans to Fort Pillow , Helena , and Memphis . When Smith took command at Vicksburg on the 12th of May , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three of the ten batteries laid out for the defence of the position had been nearly completed and a fourth had been begun . These batteries were intended for forty-eight guns from field rifles to 10-inch columbiads . The garrison was to be 3,000 strong , but at this time the only troops present were parts of two Louisiana regiments . When the fleet arrived , on the 18th , six of the ten batteries had been completed , and two days later twenty-three heavy guns were in place and the defenders numbered more than 2,600 . The guns of the navy could not be elevated sufficiently for their projectiles to reach the Confederate batteries on the bluff , and the entire land-force , under Williams , was less than 1,100 effectives . Even had it been possible by a sudden attack to surprise and overcome the garrison and seize the bluffs , the whole available force of the Department of the Gulf would have been insufficient to hold the position for a week , as things then stood . The truth is that the northern column with which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to co-operate had ceased to exist ; Jackson meant Beauregard 's rear ; and , as for any co-operation between Halleck and Williams , Beauregard stood solidly between them . On the 17th of April , the day before Porter 's mortars first opened upon Forts Jackson and St. Philip , the whole land force of this northern column , under Pope , at that moment preparing for the attack on Fort Pillow , had been withdrawn by imperative orders from Halleck , and , on the very evening before the attack on Fort Pillow was to have been made , had gone to swell the great army assembled under Halleck at Corinth ; but as yet neither Butler nor Farragut knew anything of all this . Save by the tedious roundabout of Washington , New York , the Atlantic , and the Gulf , there was at this time no regular or trustworthy means of communication between the forces descending the Mississippi and those that had just achieved the conquest of New Orleans and were now ascending the river to co-operate with the northern column . Thus it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls of the custom-house , meeting the eyes of Paine 's men after they had made a way into the building with their axes , gave to Butler the first intelligence of the desperate battle of the 6th and 7th of April , on which the fate of the whole Union campaign in the West had been staked , if not imperilled , and which in its result was destined to change materially the whole course of operations in the Gulf Department . That word was Shiloh . By the 26th of May the Oneida had been joined by the rest of the fleet , under the personal command of the restless and energetic flag-officer . On the afternoon of this day the fleet opened fire . The Confederates replied sparingly , as much to economize their ammunition and to keep the men fresh , as to avoid giving the Union commanders information regarding the range and effect of their fire . The river was now falling . The Hartford in coming up had already grounded hard , and so remained helpless for fifty hours , and had only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were running very low . On the 25th of May , after a thorough reconnoissance , Farragut and Williams decided to give up the attempt on Vicksburg as evidently impracticable . Farragut left Palmer with the Iroquois and six gunboats to blockade the river and to amuse the garrison at Vicksburg by an occasional bombardment in order to prevent Smith from sending reinforcements to Corinth . While Williams was descending the river on the 26th , the transports were fired into by the Confederate battery on the bluff at Grand Gulf , sixty miles below Vicksburg . About sixty rounds were fired in all , many of which passed completely through the transport Laurel Hill , bearing the 4th Wisconsin , part of the 6th Michigan , and the 6th Massachusetts battery . One private of the 6th Michigan was killed and Captain Chauncey J. Bassett , of the same regiment , wounded . The Ceres , bearing the remainder of the 6th Michigan and the 6th Massachusetts battery , was following the Laurel Hill and was similarly treated . After a stern chase of about twenty miles , the convoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelled the town and caused the withdrawal of the battery . During the evening Williams sent four companies of the 4th Wisconsin , under Major Boardman , to overtake the enemy 's battery and break up the camp , about one mile and a half in the rear of the town . Boardman came upon the Confederates as they were retiring , and shots were exchanged . The casualties were few , but Lieutenant George DeKay , a gallant and attractive young officer , serving as aide-de-camp to General Williams , received a mortal wound . On the 29th the troops under Williams once more landed and took post at Baton Rouge . During their absence of seventeen days , the Confederates had improved the opportunity to remove much valuable property that had been found stored in the arsenal on the occasion of the first landing of the Union forces . On his return to New Orleans Farragut received pressing orders from the Navy Department to take Vicksburg . He therefore returned with his fleet , reinforced by a detachment of the mortar flotilla , and Butler once more despatched Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Williams left Baton Rouge on the morning of the 20th of June with a force composed of the 30th Massachusetts , 9th Connecticut , 7th Vermont , and 4th Wisconsin regiments , Nims 's 2d Massachusetts battery and two sections of Everett 's 6th Massachusetts battery . This time a garrison was left to hold Baton Rouge , consisting of the 21st Indiana and 6th Michigan regiments , the remaining section of Everett 's battery and Magee 's Troop C of the Massachusetts cavalry battalion . On the 22d of June the transports arrived off Ellis 's Cliffs , twelve miles below Natchez , where Williams found three gunboats waiting to convoy him past the high ground . Here he landed a detachment consisting of the 30th Massachusetts regiment and two guns of Nims 's battery to turn the supposed position of two field-pieces said to have been planted by the Confederates on the bluffs , while a second force , composed of the 4th Wisconsin , 9th Connecticut , the other two sections of Nims 's battery , and the four guns of Everett 's , marched directly forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all that the troops found . On the 24th , anticipating more serious resistance from the guns said to be in position on the bluffs at Grand Gulf , Williams entered Bayou Pierre with his whole force in the early morning , intending to strike the crossing , about seventeen miles up the stream , of the railway from Port Gibson to Grand Gulf , and thence to move directly on the rear of the town . Half-way up the bayou the boats were stopped by obstructions and had to back down again . Toward noon the troops landed and marched on Grand Gulf in two detachments , one under Paine , consisting of the 4th Wisconsin and 9th Connecticut regiments and a section of Nims 's battery ; the other , under Dudley , embracing the remainder of the force . Paine had a short skirmish with the enemy near Grand Gulf , and captured eight prisoners , but their camp , a small one , was found abandoned . The same evening the troops re-embarked , and on the 25th arrived before Vicksburg . The orders from Butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take or burn Vicksburg at all hazards . Here , too , we catch the first glimpse of the famous canal upon which so much labor was to be expended during the next year with so little result . " You will send up a regiment or two at once , " Butler said , " and cut off the neck of land beyond Vicksburg by means of a trench , making a gap about four feet deep and five feet wide . " To accomplish this purpose Williams had with him four regiments and ten guns , making an effective force in all less than three thousand , rapidly diminished by hard work , close quarters , meagre rations , and a bad climate nearly at its worst . On the 24th of June the Monarch , commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred W. Ellet , arrived in the reach above Vicksburg . This was one of the nondescript fleet of rams , planned , built , equipped , and manned , under the orders of the War Department , by Ellet 's elder brother , Colonel Charles Ellet , Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mississippi fleet . Ellet promptly sent a party of four volunteers , led by his young nephew , Medical Cadet Charles R. Ellet , to communicate with Farragut across the narrow neck of land opposite Vicksburg . This was the first direct communication between the northern and southern columns . By it Farragut learned of the abandonment of Fort Pillow by the Confederates on the 4th of June , and the capture of Memphis on the 6th , after a hard naval fight , in which nearly the whole Confederate fleet was taken or destroyed . There Charles Ellet was mortally wounded . When the Monarch party went back to their vessel , they bore with them a letter from Farragut , the contents of which being promptly made known by Ellet to Davis , brought that officer , with his fleet , at once to Vicksburg . On the following day , June 25th , a detachment of the 4th Wisconsin , sent up the river overland by Colonel Paine , succeeded in establishing a second communication with the Monarch , believing it to be the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flagship Hartford , the sloops-of-war Brooklyn and Richmond , the corvettes Iroquois and Oneida , and six gunboats . Porter had joined with the Octorara , Miami , six other steamers , and seventeen of the mortar schooners . The orders of the government were peremptory that the Mississippi should be cleared . The Confederates held the river by a single thread . The fall of Memphis and the ruin of the famous river-defence fleet left between St. Louis and the Gulf but a solitary obstruction . This was Vicksburg . Vicksburg stand at an abrupt turn , where within ten miles the winding river doubles upon itself , forming on the low ground opposite a long finger of land , barely three quarters of a mile wide . Opposite the extreme end of this peninsula , known as De Soto , the bluff reaches the highest point attained along the whole course of the river , the crest standing about 250 feet above the mean stage of water . Sloping slowly toward the river , the bluff follows it with a diminished altitude for two miles . Here stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand inhabitants . Below the town the bluffs draw away from the river until , about four miles beyond the bend , their height diminishes to about 150 feet . For the defence of this line , as has been already seen , a formidable series of batteries had been constructed , extending from the bluff at the mouth of Chickasaw Bayou on the north to Warrenton on the south . These batteries now mounted twenty-six heavy guns , served by gunners comparatively well trained and instructed , and supported against an attack by land by about 6,000 infantry under Lovell . Almost simultaneously with the arrival of Farragut and Williams , came Breckinridge with his division , augmenting the effective force of the defenders to not less than 10,000 . On the 30th of May Beauregard evacuated Corinth and drew back to Tupelo ; Halleck did not follow ; and so 35,000 Confederates were now set free to strengthen Vicksburg . Thus defended and supported Vicksburg was obviously impregnable to any attack by the combined forces of Farragut and Williams . On the 28th of June , Van Dorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some preliminary bombarding and reconnoitring Farragut , who was well informed as to the condition of the defences , determined upon repeating before Vicksburg his exploit below New Orleans . Accordingly , on the 28th of July , in the darkness of the early morning , under cover of the fire of Porter 's mortar flotilla , Farragut got under way with his fleet to pass the batteries of Vicksburg . The fleet was formed in two columns , with wide intervals , the starboard column led by the Hartford , the port column by the Iroquois . The battle was opened by the mortars at four o'clock , the enemy replying instantly . By six o'clock the Hartford and six of her consorts had successfully run the gauntlet , and lay safely anchored above the bend , while the rest of the fleet , through some confusion of events or misapprehension of orders , had resumed its former position below the bend . The losses of the navy in this engagement were fifteen killed and thirty wounded , including many scalded by the effect of a single shot that pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nims 's and Everett 's batteries having been landed , were placed in position behind the levee at Barney 's Point , and replied effectively to the fire of the heavy guns on the high bluff , at a range of about fourteen hundred yards . This slight service was the only form of active co-operation by the army that the circumstances admitted ; yet all the troops stood to arms , ready to do any thing that might be required . On the 1st of July Davis joined Farragut with four gunboats and six mortar-boats of the Mississippi fleet . On the 9th Farragut received orders from the Navy Department , dated on the 5th , and forwarded by way of Cairo , to send Porter with the Octorara and twelve mortar-boats at once to Hampton Roads . Porter steamed down the river on the 10th . This was obviously one of the first-fruits of the campaign of the Peninsula just ended by the withdrawal of the Army of the Potomac to the James . Indeed , at this crisis , all occasions seemed to be informing against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the Confederate armies together served to draw the Union armies apart . Just as we have seen Pope called away from Fort Pillow on the eve of an attack that must have resulted in its capture , and taken in haste to swell the slow march of Halleck 's army before Corinth , so now , when for a full month Corinth had been abandoned by the Confederates , Halleck 's forces were being broken up and dispersed to all four of the winds , save that which might have blown them to the south . Halleck declared himself unable to respond to Farragut 's urgent appeal for help . " I can not , " he said , when urged by Stanton ; " I am sending reinforcements to General Curtis , in Arkansas , and to General Buell , in Tennessee and Kentucky . " Not only this , but he was being called upon by Lincoln himself for 25,000 troops to reinforce the Army of the Potomac before Richmond . " Probably I shall be able to do so , " Halleck told Farragut , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may delay the clearing of the river , but its accomplishment will be certain in a few weeks . " Meanwhile Williams was hard at work on the canal . In addition to such details as could be furnished by the troops without wholly neglecting the absolutely necessary portions of their military duties , Williams had employed a force of about 1,200 negroes , rather poorly provided with tools . The work was not confined to excavation , but involved the cutting down of the large cottonwoods and the clearing away of the dense masses of willows that covered the low ground and matted the heavy soil with their tangled roots . By the 4th of July the excavation had reached a depth in the hard clay of nearly seven feet . The length of the canal was about one and a half miles . By the 11th of July the cut , originally intended to be four feet deep and five feet wide , with a profile of twenty square feet , had been excavated through this stiff clay to a depth of thirteen feet and a width of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The river , which , up to this time , had been falling more rapidly than the utmost exertions had been able to sink the bottom of the canal , had now begun to fall more slowly , so that at last the grade was about eighteen inches below the river level . In a few hours the water was to have been let in . Suddenly the banks began to cave , and before any thing could be done to remedy this , the river , still falling , was once more below the bottom of the cut . Although with this scanty and overworked force he had already performed nearly twelve times the amount of labor originally contemplated , Williams does not seem to have been discouraged at this ; his orders were to make the cut , and his purpose clearly was to make it , even if it should take , as he thought it would , the whole of the next three months . He set to work with vigor to collect laborers , wheelbarrows , shovels , axes , carts , and scrapers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own words , " to the depth of the greatest fall of the river at this point , say some thirty-five to forty feet . " But this was not to be . Until toward the end of June , the Polk and Livingston , the last vestiges of the Confederate navy on the Mississippi spared from the general wreck at Memphis , lay far up the Yazoo River , with a barrier above them , designed to cover the building of the ram Arkansas . This formidable craft was approaching completion at Yazoo City . The Ellets , uncle and nephew , with the Monarch and Lancaster , steamed up the Yazoo River to reconnoitre . The rams carried no armament whatever , but this the Confederate naval commander in the Yazoo did not know ; so , unable to pass the barrier , he set fire to his three gunboats immediately on perceiving Ellet 's approach . On the 14th of July , Flag-Officers Farragut and Davis sent the gunboats Carondelet and Tyler , and the ram Queen of the West , on a second expedition up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greatly facilitated by the fact that the Arkansas had at this very moment just got under way for the first time , and was coming down the Yazoo to gather information of the Federal fleet . The Arkansas , which had been constructed and was now commanded by Captain Isaac N. Brown , formerly of the United States Navy , was , for defensive purposes , probably the most effective of all the gunboats ever set afloat by the Confederacy upon the western waters . Her deck was covered by a single casemate protected by three inches of railroad iron , set aslant like a gable roof , and heavily backed up with timber and cotton bales . Her whole bow formed a powerful ram ; the shield , flat on the top , was pierced for ten guns of heavy calibre , three in each broadside , two forward , and two aft . Had her means of propulsion proved equal to her power of attack and defence , it is doubtful if the whole Union navy on the Mississippi could have stood against her single-handed . The situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , in Hampton Roads before the opportune arrival of the Monitor . On board the Tyler was a detachment of twenty sharpshooters of the 4th Wisconsin regiment , under Captain J. W. Lynn , and on the Carondelet were twenty men of the 30th Massachusetts regiment , under Lieutenant E. A. Fiske . About six miles above the Yazoo the Union gunboats encountered the Arkansas . The unarmed ram Queen of the West promptly fled . After a hard fight the Carondelet was disabled and run ashore , and the Tyler was forced to retire , with the Arkansas in pursuit . The sharpshooters of the 4th Wisconsin suffered more severely than if they had been engaged in an ordinary pitched battle , Captain Lynn and six of his men being killed and six others wounded . The Queen of the West , flying out of the mouth of the Yazoo under a full head of steam , gave to the fleet at anchor the first intimation , though perhaps a feeble one , of what was to follow . Not one vessel of either squadron had steam . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , did nothing . The Arkansas , so seriously injured by the guns of the Carondelet and Tyler that the steam pressure had gone from 120 pounds to the square inch down to 20 pounds , kept on her course , and proceeded to run the gauntlet of the Union fleet , giving and taking blows as she went . Battered , but safe , she soon lay under the guns of Vicksburg . This decided the fate of the campaign , and extinguished in the breast of Farragut the last vestige of the ardent hope he had expressed to the government a few days earlier that he might soon have the pleasure of recording the combined attack of the army and navy , for which all so ardently longed . The river was falling ; the canal was a failure . Of the officers and men of the army , two fifths , and of the effective force of the army nearly three fourths , were on the sick-list . There was no longer any thing to hope for or to wait on . The night that followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and once more running the gauntlet of the batteries of Vicksburg . A flying attempt was made by each vessel in succession , but by all unsuccessfully , to destroy the offending Arkansas . On the 24th of July , Williams , with his small force , under convoy of Farragut 's fleet , sailed down the river . So ended the second attempt on Vicksburg , usually called the first , when remembered . Its sudden collapse gave the Confederates the river for another year . CHAPTER III . BATON ROUGE . On the 26th of July , the troops landed at Baton Rouge . In the five weeks that had elapsed since their departure their effective strength had been diminished , by privations , by severe labor , and by the effects of a deadly climate , from 3,200 to about 800 . For more than three months , ever since their re-embarkation at Ship Island on the 10th of April , they had undergone hardships such as have seldom fallen to the lot of soldiers , in a campaign whose existence is scarcely known and whose name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recreation had not yet come . No sooner did Van Dorn see the allied fleets of Davis and Farragut turning their backs on one another and steaming one to the north and the other to the south , than he determined to take the initiative . His preparations had been already made in anticipation of this event . He now ordered Breckinridge to hasten with his division to the attack of Baton Rouge , and even as the fleet got under way , the train bearing Breckinridge 's troops was also in motion . Breckinridge received his orders on the 26th , and arrived at Camp Moore by the railway on the 28th . At Jackson he had been told that he would receive rations sufficient for ten days , but he could get no more than half the quantity . Van Dorn had estimated the Union force to be met at Baton Rouge as about 5,000 , and had calculated that Breckinridge would find himself strong enough to dislodge the Union army and drive it away . In fact , Van Dorn estimated Breckinridge 's division , including 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camp Moore , at 6,000 men . The Arkansas was to join in the attack , and she was justly considered a full offset to any naval force the Union commander would be likely to have stationed at Baton Rouge . Breckinridge left Vicksburg with less than 4,000 . On the 30th of July he reports his total effective force , including Ruggles , at 3,600 . The same day he marched on Baton Rouge , and on the 4th of August encamped at the crossing of the Comite , distant about ten miles from his objective . His morning report of that day shows but 3,000 effectives , according to the methods by which effective strength was commonly counted by the Confederates . The distance from Camp Moore to Baton Rouge is about sixty miles , and the march had been thus retarded to await the co-operation of the Arkansas . This Breckinridge was finally assured he might expect at daylight on the morning of the 5th of August . The Arkansas had in fact left Vicksburg on the 3d . Van Dorn 's object obviously was by crushing Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rouge , to break the blockade of Red River and to open the way for the recapture of New Orleans . Williams was expecting the attack and awaited the result with calmness . At Baton Rouge the Mississippi washes for the last time the base of the high and steep bluffs that for so many hundreds of miles have followed the coasts of the great river and formed the contour of its left bank , overlooking its swift yellow waters and the vast lowlands of the western shore . The bluff is lower at Baton Rouge than it is above and slopes more gently to the water 's edge ; and here the highland draws back from the river and gradually fades away in a southeasterly direction toward the Gulf , while the surface of the country becomes more open and less broken . The stiff post-tertiary clays that compose the soil of these bluffs were in many places covered with a rich growth of timber , great magnolias and beautiful live oaks replacing the rank cottonwood and tangled willows of the lowlands , as well as the giant cypresses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moss , and the wild grape binding them fast in a deadly embrace . Six roads led out of the town in various directions . Of these the most northerly was the road from Bayou Sara . Passing behind the town its course continued toward the south along the river . Between these outstretched arms ran the road to Clinton , the Greenwell Springs road , by which the Confederates had come , the Perkins road , and the Clay Cut road . In numbers the opposing forces were nearly equal . The Confederates went into action with about 2,600 , without counting the partisan rangers and militia , numbering 400 or 500 more . Williams had about 2,500 fighting men . He had eighteen guns , the Confederates eleven . On both sides the men were enfeebled by malaria and exposure ; yet the Confederates had left their sick behind , while the Union force included convalescents that came out of the hospital to take part in the battle . " There were not 1,200 , " said Weitzel after the battle , " who could have marched five miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few had been under fire . " Among the Confederates were many of the veterans of Shiloh and more of the triumphant defenders of Vicksburg . The advantages of position was slight on either side . On the one hand Williams was forced to post his left with regard to the expected attack of the Arkansas , so that in the centre his line fell behind the camps . To offset this his right rested securely on the gunboats . As it turned out the Arkansas was not encountered , and the gunboats told off to meet her were therefore able to render material assistance on the left by their oblique fire across Williams ' front . Breckinridge commanded four picked brigades , three selected from his own division and one of Martin L. Smith 's Vicksburg brigades , the whole organized in two divisions , under Brigadier-Generals Charles Clark and Daniel Ruggles . Clark had the brigades of Brigadier-General Bernard H. Helm and Colonel Thomas B. Smith , of the 20th Tennessee , with the Hudson battery and Cobb 's battery . Ruggles had the brigades of Colonel A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry W. Allen , of the 4th Louisiana , with Semmes 's battery . From right to left the order of attack ran , Helm , Smith , Thompson , Allen . Clark moved on the right of the Greenwell Springs road , and Ruggles on the left . Scott 's cavalry was posted on the extreme left , four guns of Semmes 's battery occupied the centre of Ruggles 's division , while in Clark 's centre were the four guns of the Hudson battery and one of Cobb 's ; the other two having been disabled in a panic during the night march before the battle . On the extreme right the Clinton road was picketed and held by a detachment of infantry and rangers and the remaining section of Semmes 's battery . To meet the expected attack , Williams had posted his troops in rear of the arsenal and of the town , occupying an irregular line , generally parallel to the Bayou Sara road , and extending from the Bayou Grosse , on the left , to and beyond the intersection of the Perkins and Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , behind the Bayou Grosse , was the 4th Wisconsin , commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Bean . Next , but on the left bank of the bayou , stood the 9th Connecticut . Next , and on the left of the Greenwell Springs road , the 14th Maine . On the right of that road was posted the 21st Indiana , under Lieutenant-Colonel Keith , with three guns attached to the regiment , under Lieutenant J. H. Brown . Across the Perkins and Clay Cut roads the 6th Michigan was formed , under command of Captain Charles E. Clarke , while in the rear of the interval between the 6th Michigan and the 21st Indiana stood the 7th Vermont . The extreme right and rear were covered by the 30th Massachusetts in column , supporting Nims 's battery , under Lieutenant Trull . On the centre and left were planted the guns of Everett 's battery , under Carruth , and of Manning 's 4th Massachusetts battery . The left flank was supported by the Essex , Commander William D. Porter ; the Cayuga , Lieutenant Harrison ; and the Sumter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lieutenant-Commander Ransom , and Katahdin , Lieutenant Roe . These dispositions were planned expressly to meet the expected attack by the ram Arkansas , and in that view the arrangement was probably the best that the formation of the ground permitted . But the fighting line was very far advanced ; the camps still farther ; the reserve on the right was posted quite a mile and a half behind the capitol , and , as at Shiloh , no portion of the line was fortified or protected in any way , though the field was an open plain and the converging roads gave to the attacking party a wide choice of position . About daylight Breckinridge moved to the attack in a summer fog so dense that those engaged could at first distinguish neither friend nor enemy . The blow fell first , and heavily , upon the centre and right , held by the 14th Maine , 21st Indiana , and 6th Michigan . As our troops were pressed back by the vigor of the first onset , the exposed camps of the 14th Maine , 7th Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederates . The 9th Connecticut , with Manning 's battery , moved to the support of the 14th Maine and 21st Indiana , on the right of the former , and the 4th Wisconsin formed on the left of the 14th . Further to the right , the 30th Massachusetts advanced to the support of the 21st Indiana and 6th Michigan , covering the interval between the two battalions to replace the 7th Vermont . In the first fighting in the darkness and the fog this regiment had been roughly handled ; its colonel fell , a momentary confusion followed , and the regiment drifted back into a convenient position , where it was soon reformed , under Captain Porter . Nims brought his guns into battery on the right of the 6th Michigan . The battle was short , but the fighting was severe ; both sides suffered heavily , and each fell into some disorder . At different moments both wings of the Confederate force were broken , and fell back in something not very unlike panic . The colors of the 4th Louisiana were captured by the 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the increasing heat , it became clear to both sides that the attack had failed . The force of the fierce Confederate outset was quite spent . The Union lines , however thinned and shattered , remained in possession of the prize . " It was now ten o'clock , " says Breckinridge . " We had listened in vain for the guns of the Arkansas : I saw around me not more than 1,000 exhausted men . " The battle was over . Indeed it had been over for some hours ; these words probably indicate the period when the Confederate commander gave up his last hope . The Arkansas , disabled within sight of the goal by an accident to her machinery , was run ashore and destroyed by her commander to save her from capture . The Confederate losses were about 84 killed , 313 wounded , and 56 missing ; total , 453 . Clark was severely wounded and made prisoner . Allen was killed , and two other brigade commanders wounded . Helm , Hunt , and Thompson had been previously disabled by an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed , 266 wounded , and 33 missing ; total , 383 . The heaviest loss fell upon the 21st Indiana , which suffered 126 casualties , and upon the 14th Maine , which reported 118 . Of the killed , 36 , or nearly one half , belonged to the 14th Maine , while more than two thirds of the killed and nearly two thirds of the total belonged to that regiment and the 21st Indiana . The 4th Wisconsin , being posted quite to the left of the point of attack , was not engaged . Colonel G. T. Roberts , of the 7th Vermont , fell early in the action , and near its close Williams was instantly killed while urging his men to the attack . In him his little brigade lost the only commander present of experience in war ; the country , a brave and accomplished soldier . If he was , as must be confessed , arbitrary , at times unreasonable , and often harsh , in his treatment of his untrained volunteers , yet many who then thought his discipline too severe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct vindicate , the value of his training . The Confederates appear to have suffered to some extent during the last attack , until the lines drew too near together , from the fire of the Essex and her consorts . Ransom also speaks of having shelled the enemy with great effect during the afternoon from the Kineo and Katahdin , accurately directed by signals from the capitol ; but no other account even mentions any firing at that period of the day ; the effect can not , therefore , have been severe , and it seems probable that the troops against whom it was directed may have been some outlying party . Cahill 's seniority entitled him to the command after Williams fell , yet during the remainder of the battle Dudley seems to have commanded the troops actually engaged . Shortly after the close of the action Cahill assumed the command and sent word to Butler of the state of affairs . The Confederates were still to be seen upon the field of battle . Their force was naturally enough over-estimated . Another attack was expected during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had none to give without putting New Orleans itself in peril . However , during the evening he determined to release from arrest a number of officers who had been deprived of their swords by Williams at various times , and for various causes , mainly growing out of the confused and as yet rather unsettled policy of the government in reference to the treatment of the negroes , and to send all these officers to Baton Rouge . Among them were Colonel Paine of the 4th Wisconsin and Colonel Clark of the 6th Michigan . Since the 11th of June Paine had been in arrest ; an arrest of a character peculiar and perhaps unprecedented in the history of armies . Whenever danger was to be faced , or unusual duty to be performed , he might wear his sword and command his men , but the moment the duty or the danger was at an end he must go back into arrest . Paine , who was an extremely conscientious officer , as well as a man of high character and firmness of purpose , had from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his force in aid of the claims of the master to the service of the slave . Williams , strict in his idea of obedience due his superiors , not less than in his notions of obedience due to him by his own inferiors in rank , stood upon his construction of the law and the orders of the War Department , as they then existed ; hence in the natural course of events inevitably arose more than one irreconcilable difference of opinion . Paine was now ordered to go at once to Baton Rouge and take command . He was told by Butler to burn the town and the capitol . The library , the paintings , the statuary , and the relics were to be spared , as well as the charitable institutions of the town . The books , the paintings , and the statue of Washington , he was to send to New Orleans ; he was then to evacuate Baton Rouge and retire with his whole force to New Orleans . At midnight on the 6th of August Paine arrived at Baton Rouge . There he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an interior and shorter line , but expecting another attack . There was in fact an alarm before morning came , but nothing happened . On the 7th Paine took command and set about putting the town in complete condition for an effective defence . With his accustomed care and energy he soon rectified the lines and entrenched them with twenty-four guns in position , and , in co-operation with the navy , concerted every measure for an effective defence , even against large numbers . Breckinridge , however , after continuing to menace Baton Rouge for some days , had , by Van Dorn 's orders , retired to Port Hudson , and was now engaged in fortifying that position . Ruggles was sent there on the 12th of August . The next day Breckinridge received orders from Van Dorn , then at Jackson , to follow with his whole force . " Port Hudson , " Van Dorn said , " must be held if possible . " " Port Hudson , " remarks Breckinridge , in his report of the battle of Baton Rouge , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baton Rouge is not , and batteries there will command the river more completely than at Vicksburg . " Meanwhile Butler had changed his mind with regard to the evacuation of Baton Rouge , and had directed Paine to hold the place for the present . With an accuracy unusual at this period , Butler estimated Breckinridge 's entire force at 5,000 men and fourteen guns . On the 13th the defences were complete , the entrenchments forming two sides of a triangle of which the river was the base and the cemetery mound the apex . The troops stood to arms at three o'clock every morning ; one fourth of the force was constantly under arms , day and night , at its station . At two points on each face of the entrenchment flags were planted by day and lights by night , to indicate to the gunboats their line of fire . On the 16th of August Butler renewed his orders to burn and evacuate Baton Rouge . Its retention up to this time he had avowedly regarded as having political rather than military importance . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that it is necessary to evacuate Baton Rouge . . . . Begin the movement quietly and rapidly ; get every thing off except your men , and then see to it that the town is destroyed . After mature deliberation I deem this a military necessity of the highest order . " Against these orders Paine made an earnest appeal , based upon considerations partly humane , partly military . He was so far successful that Butler was induced to countermand the order to burn . The movement was not to be delayed on account of the statue of Washington . However , the statue had been already packed . It is now in the Patent Office at the national capital . All the books and paintings were brought off , " except , " to quote from Paine 's diary , " the portrait of James Buchanan , which we left hanging in the State House for his friends . " Finally , on the 20th , Paine evacuated Baton Rouge , and on the following day reached the lines of Carrollton , known as Camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER IV . LA FOURCHE . On the 22d of August Paine was assigned to the command of what was called the " reserve brigade " of a division under Phelps . The brigade was composed of the 4th Wisconsin , 21st Indiana , and 14th Maine , with Brown 's battery attached to the Indiana regiment . But this was not to last , for the tension that had long existed between Phelps and the department commander , on the subject of the treatment of the negroes , as well as on the question of arming and employing them , finally resulted in Phelps 's resignation on the 21st of August . On the 13th of September he was succeeded by Brigadier-General Thomas W. Sherman , himself recently relieved from command of the Department of the South , partly , perhaps , in consequence of differences of opinion of a like character . On the 29th of September the division , then known as Sherman 's , was reorganized , and Paine took command of the 1st brigade , composed of the 4th Wisconsin , 21st Indiana , and 8th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brown 's guns of the 21st Indiana . Paine 's command also included Camp Parapet . These lines had been originally laid out by the Confederates for the defence of New Orleans against an attack by land from the north ; as , for example , by a force approaching through Lake Pontchartrain and Pass Manchac . They were now put in thorough order , and the Indianians , who had received some artillery instruction during their term of service at Fort McHenry , completed the foundation for the future service as heavy artillerists by going back to the big guns . In October and November the 8th New Hampshire and 21st Indiana were transferred to Weitzel 's brigade and were replaced in Paine 's by the 2d Louisiana and temporarily by the 12th Maine . The official reports covering this period afford several strong hints of a Confederate plan for the recapture of New Orleans . With this object , apparently , Richard Taylor , a prominent and wealthy Louisianian , closely allied to Jefferson Davis by his first marriage with the daughter of Zachary Taylor , was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st of August was assigned to command the Confederate forces in Western Louisiana . It seems likely that the troops of Van Dorn 's department , as well as those at Mobile , were expected to take part . On the 8th of August orders were issued by the War Department transferring the district of West Florida to the Department of the Gulf . West Florida meant Pensacola . Fort Pickens , on the sands of Santa Rosa , commanding the entrance to the splendid harbor , owed to the loyalty of a few staunch officers of the army and the navy the proud distinction of being the one spot between the Chesapeake and the Rio Grande over which , in spite of all hostile attempts , the ensign of the nation had never ceased to float ; for the works at Key West and the Dry Tortugas , though likewise held , were never menaced . Though Bragg early gathered a large force for the capture of the fort , the only serious attempt , made in the dawn of the 9th of October , 1861 , was repulsed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union troops of 61 . Of these , the 6th New York had 9 killed , 7 wounded , 11 missing  --  in all , 27 . In December the 75th New York came down from the North to reinforce the defenders . Finally , after learning the fate of New Orleans , Bragg evacuated Pensacola , and burned his surplus stores , and on the 10th of May , 1862 , Porter , seeing from the passes the glare of the flames , ran over and anchored in the bay . The advantage thus gained was held to the end . This transfer gave Butler two strong infantry regiments , as well as several fine batteries and companies of the regular artillery , but at the same time correspondingly increased the territory he had to guard , already far too extensive and too widely scattered for the small force at his disposal . Toward the end of September Lieutenant Godfrey Weitzel , of the engineers , having been made a brigadier-general on Butler 's recommendation , a promotion more than usually justified by service and talent , a brigade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 12th and 13th Connecticut , 75th New York , and 8th New Hampshire , Carruth 's 6th Massachusetts battery , Thompson 's 1st Maine battery , Perkins 's Troop C of the Massachusetts cavalry , and three troops of Louisiana cavalry under Williamson . From that time , through all the changes , which were many and frequent , Weitzel 's brigade changed less than any thing else , and its history may almost be said to be the military history of the Department . Taylor , with his accustomed energy and enthusiasm , had collected and organized a force , primarily for the defence of the La Fourche country and the Teche , ultimately for the offensive operations already planned . Butler at once committed to Weitzel the preparations for dislodging Taylor and occupying La Fourche . This object was important , not only to secure the defence of New Orleans , but because the territory to be occupied comprised or controlled the fertile region between the Mississippi and the Atchafalaya . The country lies low and flat , and is intersected by numerous navigable bayous , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without naval assistance , the operation would have been difficult , if not impossible ; and the navy had in Louisiana no gunboats of a draught light enough for the service . With the funds of the army Butler caused four light gunboats , the Estrella , Calhoun , Kinsman , and Diana , to be quietly built and equipped , the navy furnishing the officers and the crews . Under Commander McKean Buchanan they were then sent by the gulf to Berwick Bay . When he was ready , Weitzel took transports , under convoy of the Kineo , Sciota , Katahdin , and Itasca , landed below Donaldsonville , entered the town , and on the 27th of October moved on Thibodeaux , the heart of the district . At Georgia Landing , about two miles above Labadieville , he encountered the Confederates under Mouton , consisting of the 18th and 33d Louisiana , the Crescent and Terre Bonne regiments , with Ralston 's and Semmes 's batteries and the 2d Louisiana cavalry , in all reported by Mouton as 1,392 strong . They had taken up a defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bayous the standing room is for the most part narrow ; and as the land , although low , is in general heavily wooded and crossed by many ditches of considerable depth , the country affords defensive positions at once stronger and more numerous than are to be found in most flat regions . Small bodies of troops , familiar with the topography , have also this further advantage , that there are few points from which their position and numbers can be easily made out . After a short but spirited engagement Mouton 's force was compelled to retreat . Weitzel pursued for about four miles . Mouton then called in his outlying detachments , including the La Fourche regiment , 500 strong , 300 men of the 33d Louisiana , and the regiments of Saint Charles and St. John Baptist , burned the railway station of Terre Bonne and the bridges at Thibodeaux , La Fourche Crossing , Terre Bonne , Des Allemands , and Bayou Boeuf , and evacuated the district . By the 30th , every thing was safely across Berwick Bay . For this escape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gunboats to lie to in Caillou Bay on their way to Berwick Bay , to cut off the retreat . Mouton 's report accounts for 5 killed , 8 wounded , and 186 missing ; in all 199 . Among the killed was Colonel G. P. McPheeters of the Crescent regiment . Weitzel followed to Thibodeaux , and went into camp beyond the town . He claims to have taken 208 prisoners and one gun , and states his own losses as 18 killed , and 74 wounded , agreeing with the nominal lists , which also contain the names of 5 missing , thus bringing the total casualties to 97 . Arriving off Brashear a day too late , Buchanan was partly consoled by capturing the Confederate gunboat Seger . On the 4th and 5th of November he made a reconnoissance fourteen miles up the Teche with his own boat , the Calhoun , and the Estrella , Kinsman , Saint Mary 's , and Diana , and meeting a portion of Mouton 's forces and the Confederate gunboat J. A. Cotton , received and inflicted some damage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Weitzel 's movement on La Fourche , Butler pushed the 8th Vermont and the newly organized 1st Louisiana Native Guards forward from Algiers along the Opelousas Railway , to act in conjunction with Weitzel and to open the railway as they advanced . Weitzel had already turned the enemy out of his position , but the task committed to Thomas was slow and hard , for all the bridges and many culverts had to be rebuilt , and from long disuse of the line the rank grass , that in Louisiana springs up so freely in every untrodden spot above water , had grown so tall and thick and strongly matted that the troops had to pull it up by the roots before the locomotive could pass . So ended operations in Louisiana for the year . Until the following spring , Taylor continued to occupy the Teche region , while Weitzel rested quietly in La Fourche , with his headquarters at Thibodeaux and his troops so disposed as to cover and hold the country without losing touch . On the 9th of November , the whole of Louisiana lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plaquemine and Terre Bonne , was constituted a military district to be known as the District of La Fourche , and Weitzel was assigned to the command . Meanwhile General Butler , with the consent of the War Department , had raised , organized , and equipped , in the neighborhood of New Orleans , two good regiments of Louisianans , the 1st Louisiana , Colonel Richard E. Holcomb , and the 2d Louisiana , Colonel Charles J. Paine , both regiments admirably commanded and well officered ; three excellent troops of Louisiana cavalry , under fine leaders , Captains Henry F. Williamson , Richard Barrett , and J. F. Godfrey ; and beside these white troops , three regiments of negroes , designated as the 1st , 2d , and 3d Louisiana Native Guards . This was the name originally employed by Governor Moore early in 1861 , to describe an organization of the free men of color of New Orleans enrolled for the defence of the city against the expected attack by the forces of the Union . This action was taken by Butler of his own motion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not interfered with . These three regiments were the first negro troops mustered into the service of the United States . At least one of them , the 1st , was largely made up of men of that peculiar and exclusive caste known to the laws of slavery as the free men of color of Louisiana . All the field and staff officers were white men , mainly taken from the rolls of the troops already in service ; but at first all the company officers were negroes . As this was the first experiment , it was perhaps , in the state of feeling then prevailing , inevitable , yet not the less to be regretted , that the white officers were , with some notable exceptions , inferior men . Fortunately , however , courts-martial and examining boards made their career for the most part a short one . As for the colored officers of the line , early in 1863 they were nearly all disqualified on the most rudimentary examination , and then the rest resigned . After that , the government having determined to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled policy to grant commissions as officers to none but white men . The 1st and 2d regiments were sent into the district of La Fourche to guard the railway . Then , between Butler and Weitzel , in spite of confidence on the one hand and respect and affection on the other , began the usual controversy about arming the negro . To one unacquainted with the history of this question and of those times it must seem strange indeed to read the emphatic words in which a soldier so loyal and , in the best sense , so subordinate as Weitzel , declared his unwillingness to command these troops , and to reflect that in a little more than two years he was destined to accept with alacrity the command of a whole army corps of black men , and at last to ride in triumph at their head into the very capital of the Confederacy . With the exception of the levies raised by its commander , the Department of the Gulf had so far received no access of strength from any quarter . From the North had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the poisonous swamps the effective strength melted away day by day . Thus the numbers present fell 3,795 during the month of July ; in October , when the sickly season had done its worst , the wastage reached a total of 5,390 . At the time of the battle of Baton Rouge , Butler 's effective force can hardly have exceeded 7,000 . When his strength was the greatest it probably did not exceed , if indeed it reached , the number of 13,000 effective . The condition of affairs was therefore such that Butler found himself with an army barely sufficient for the secure defence of the vast territory committed to his care , and for any offensive operation absolutely powerless . To hold what had been gained it was practically necessary to sit still ; and to sit still then , as always in all wars , was to invite attack . These things Butler did not fail to represent to the government , and to repeat . At last , about the middle of November , he received a few encouraging words from Halleck , dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured that the " delay in sending reinforcements has not been the fault of the War Department . It is hoped that some will be ready to start as soon as the November elections are over . Brigadier-generals will be sent with these reinforcements . " With them was to be a major-general , the new commander of the department ; but this Halleck did not say . CHAPTER V. BANKS IN COMMAND . When the campaigns of 1862 were drawing to an end , the government changed all the commanders and turned to the consideration of new plans . With President Lincoln , as we have seen , the opening of the Mississippi had long been a favored scheme . His early experience had rendered him familiar with the waters , the shores , and the vast traffic of the great river , and had brought home to him the common interests and the mutual dependence of the farmers , the traders , the miners , and the manufacturers of the States bordering upon the upper Mississippi and the Ohio on the one hand , and of the merchants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fully prepared to enter warmly into the idea that had taken possession of the minds and hearts of the people of the Northwest . From a vague longing this idea had now grown into a deep and settled sentiment . Indeed in all the West the opening of the Mississippi played a part that can only be realized by comparing it with the prevailing sentiment of the East , so early , so long , so loudly expressed in the cry , " On to Richmond ! " That the President should have been in complete accord with the popular impulse is hardly to be wondered at by any one that has followed , with the least attention , the details of his remarkable career . Moreover , the popular impulse was right . Wars take their character from the causes that produce them and the people or the nations by whom they are waged . This was not a contest upon some petty question involving the fate of a ministry , a dynasty , or even a monarchy , to be fought out between regular armies upon well-known plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The struggle was virtually one between two peoples hitherto united as one ,  --  between the people of the North , who had taken up arms for the maintenance and the restoration of the Union , and the people of the South , who had taken up arms to destroy the Union . Of such an issue there could be no compromise ; to such a contest there could be no end short of exhaustion . For four long years it was destined to go on , and at times to rage with a fury almost unexampled along lines whose length was measured by the thousand miles and over a battle-ground nearly as large as the continent of Europe . Looked at merely from the standpoint of strategy , and discarding all considerations not directly concerning the movements of armies , true policy might , perhaps , have dictated the concentration of all available resources in men and material upon the great central lines of operations , roughly indicated by the mention of Chattanooga and Atlanta ,  --  the road eventually followed by Sherman in his triumphant march to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the importance of cutting off the trans-Mississippi region as a source of supply for the main Confederate armies was obvious ; while from the governments of Europe , of England and France above all , the pressure was great for cotton , partly , indeed , as a pretext for interfering in our domestic struggle to their own advantage , but largely , also , to enable those governments to quiet the cry of the starving millions of their people . Instructed , as well as warned , by the events of the previous summer , the President now resolved on a combined attempt by two strong columns . On the 21st of October he sent Major-General John A. McClernand to Indiana , Illinois , and Iowa , with confidential orders , authorizing him to raise troops for an expedition , under his command , to move against Vicksburg from Cairo or Memphis as a place of rendezvous , and " to clear the Mississippi River and open navigation to New Orleans . " Perhaps because of the confidence still felt in Grant by the President himself , although within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McClellan , of Buell , and of so many others . The secret orders were not made known to him , yet it was settled that he was to retain the command of his department , while the principal active operations of the army within its limits were to be conducted by another . Even for this consideration it is rather more than likely he was indebted in a great degree to the exceptional advantage he enjoyed in having at all times at the seat of government , in the person of Washburne , a strong and devoted party of one , upon whose assistance the government daily found it convenient to lean . A few days later , on the 31st of October , Major-General Nathaniel P. Banks was sent to New York and Boston , with similar orders , to collect in New England and New York a force for the co-operating column from New Orleans . On the 8th of November this was followed by the formal order of the President assigning Banks to the command of the Department of the Gulf , including the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was , indeed , unsought and unsolicited , and the first offer , from the President himself , came as a surprise . At the close of Pope 's campaign , when the reorganized Army of the Potomac , once more under McClellan , was in march to meet Lee in Maryland , Banks had been forced , by injuries received at Cedar Mountain , to give up the command of the Twelfth Army Corps to the senior division commander , Brigadier-General A. S. Williams . As soon as this was reported at headquarters , McClellan created a new organization under the name of the " Defences of Washington , " and placed Banks in command . For some time after this Banks was unable to leave his room ; yet , within forty-eight hours , a mob of thirty thousand wounded men and convalescents , who knew not where to go , and of stragglers , who meant not to go where they were wanted , was cleared out of the streets of Washington , and pandemonium was at an end . Order was rather created than restored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps was sent to join the army in the field ; within a fortnight , a full army corps of able-bodied stragglers followed ; the fortifications were completed ; ample garrisons of instructed artillerists were provided . These became " the Heavies " of Grant 's campaigns . Almost another full army corps was organized from the new regiments . Finally the whole force of the defences , about equal in numbers to Lee 's army , was so disposed that Washington was absolutely secure . The dispositions for the defence of the capital and the daily operations of the command were clearly and constantly made known to the President and Secretary of War as well as to the General-in-chief . Thus it was that , less than two months later , in the closing days of October , President Lincoln sent for Banks and said : " You have let me sleep in peace for the first time since I came here . I want you to go to Louisiana and do the same thing there . " On the 9th of November Halleck communicated to Banks the orders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops from Baltimore and elsewhere , under Emory , already assembling in transports at Fort Monroe . An additional force of ten thousand men , he was told , would be sent to him from Boston and New York as soon as possible . Though this order was never formally revoked or modified , yet in fact it was from the first a dead letter , and Banks , who received it in New York , remained there to complete the organization and to look after the collection and transport of the additional force mentioned in Halleck 's instructions . Including the eight regiments of Emory , but not counting four regiments of infantry and five battalions of cavalry diverted to other fields , the reinforcements for the Department of the Gulf finally included thirty-nine regiments of infantry , six batteries of artillery , and one battalion of cavalry . Of the infantry twenty-one regiments were composed of officers and men enlisted to serve for nine months . Even of this brief period many weeks had , in some cases , already elapsed . To command the brigades and divisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuvier Grover , William Dwight , George L. Andrews , and James Bowen were ordered to report to Banks . The work of chartering the immense fleet required to transport this force , with its material of all kinds , was confided by the government to Cornelius Vanderbilt , possibly in recognition of his recent princely gift to the nation of the finest steamship of his fleet , bearing his own name . This service Vanderbilt performed with his usual vigor , " laying hands , " as he said , " upon every thing that could float or steam , " including , it must be added , more than one vessel to which it would have been rash to ascribe either of these qualities . Before the embarkation each vessel was carefully inspected by a board of officers , usually composed of the inspector-general or an officer of his department , an experienced quartermaster , and an officer of rank and intelligence , who was himself to sail on the vessel . This last was a new , but , as soon appeared , a very necessary precaution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , and as each vessel was loaded she was sent to sea with sealed orders directing her master and the commanding officer of the troops to make the best of their way to Ship Island , and there await the further instructions of the general commanding . Ship Island was chosen for the place of meeting because of the great draught of water of some of the vessels . At the same time Emory 's force , embarking at Hampton Roads , set out under convoy of the man-of-war Augusta , Commander E. G. Parrott , for the same destination with similar orders . For three months the Florida had lain at anchor in the harbor at Mobile , only waiting for a good opportunity to enter upon her historic career of destruction . Since the 20th of August the Alabama was known to have been scourging our commerce in the North Atlantic from the Azores to the Antilles . On the 5th of December she took a prize off the northern coast of San Domingo . Relying on the information with which he was freely furnished , Semmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of January . In the dead of night , " after the midwatch was set and all was quiet , " he meant , in the words of his executive officer , ( 1 ) slowly to approach the transports , " steam among them with both batteries in action , pouring in a continuous discharge of shell , and sink them as we went . " Fortunately Semmes 's information , though profuse and precise , was not quite accurate , for it brought him off Galveston on the 13th of January : the wrong port , a month too late . What might have happened is shown by the ease with which he then destroyed the Hatteras . To guard against these dangers , it had been the wish of the government , and was a part of the original plan , that the transports sailing from New York should be formed in a single fleet and proceed , under strong convoy , to its destination . However , it soon became evident that as the rate of sailing of a fleet is governed by that of its slowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to crawl along the coast at a speed hardly greater than five miles an hour . This would not only have exposed three ships out of five , and five regiments out of six , for at least twice the necessary time to the perils of the sea , increased by having to follow an inshore track at this inclement season ; it would not only have introduced chances of detention and risks of collision and of separation , but the peril from the Alabama would have been augmented in far greater degree than the security afforded by any naval force the government could just then spare . Therefore , the slow ships were loaded and sent off first and the faster ones kept back to the last ; then , each making the best of its way to Ship Island , nearly all came in together . Thus , when the North Star , bearing the flag of the commanding general and sailing from New York on the 4th of December , arrived in the early morning of the 13th at Ship Island , nearly the whole fleet lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a hasty inspection could be completed and fresh orders given , the expedition got under way for New Orleans . The larger vessels , however , like the Atlantic , Baltic , and Ericsson being unable to cross the bar , lay at anchor at Ship Island until they could be lightened . Truly grand as was the spectacle afforded by the black hulls and white sails of this great concourse of ships at anchor , in the broad roadstead , yet a grander sight still was reserved for the next day , a lovely Sunday , as all these steamers in line ahead , the North Star leading , flags flying , bands playing , the decks blue with the soldiers of the Union , majestically made their way up the Mississippi . Most of those on board looked for the first time , with mingled emotions , over the pleasant lowlands of Louisiana , and all were amused at the mad antics of the pageant-loving negroes , crowding and capering on the levee as plantation after plantation was passed . So closely had the secret been kept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose , probably not more than three or four officers , if so many , of all the force really knew its destination . Nor was it until the two generals met at New Orleans that Butler learned that Banks was to relieve him . On the 15th of December Banks took the command of the Department of the Gulf , although the formal orders were not issued until the 17th . The officers of the department , as well as of the personal staff of General Butler , were relieved from duty and permitted to accompany him to the North . The new staff of the department included Lieutenant-Colonel Richard B. Irwin , Assistant Adjutant-General ; Lieutenant-Colonel William S. Abert , Assistant Inspector-General ; Major G. Norman Lieber , Judge-Advocate ; Colonel Samuel B. Holabird , Chief Quartermaster ; Colonel Edward G. Beckwith , Chief Commissary of Subsistence ; Surgeon Richard H. Alexander , Medical Director ; Major David C. Houston , Chief Engineer ; Captain Henry L. Abbot , Chief of Topographical Engineers ; First-Lieutenant Richard M. Hill , Chief of Ordnance ; Captain Richard Arnold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signal Officer . Banks 's orders from the government were to go up the Mississippi and open the river , in co-operation with McClernand 's expedition against Vicksburg . " As the ranking general of the Southwest , " Halleck 's orders proceeded , " you are authorized to assume control of any military forces from the upper Mississippi which may come within your command . The line of the division between your department and that of Major-General Grant is , therefore , left undecided for the present , and you will exercise superior authority as far north as you may ascend the river . The President regards the opening of the Mississippi river as the first and most important of all our military and naval operations , and it is hoped that you will not lose a moment in accomplishing it . " Immediately on assuming command Banks ordered Grover to take all the troops that were in condition for service at once to Baton Rouge , under the protection of the fleet , and there disembark and go into camp . Augur was specially charged with the arrangements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting they were carefully inspected , and all that were found to be affected with disease of a contagious or infectious character were sent ashore and isolated . On the morning of the 16th the advance of Grover 's expedition got under way , under convoy of a detachment of Farragut 's fleet , led by Alden in the Richmond . Grover took with him about 4,500 men , but when all were assembled at Baton Rouge there were twelve regiments , three batteries , and two troops of cavalry . The Confederates , who were in very small force , promptly evacuated Baton Rouge , and Grover landed and occupied the place on the 17th of December . After sending off the last of the troops , Augur went up and took command . The lines constructed by Paine in August were occupied and strengthened , and all arrangements promptly made for the defence in view of an attack , such as might not unnaturally be looked for from Port Hudson , whose garrison then numbered more than 12,000 effectives . The two places are but a long day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate forces at Port Hudson had been commanded by Brigadier-General William N. R. Beall . On the 28th of December , however , he was relieved by Major-General Frank Gardner , who retained the command thenceforward until the end . While the war lasted , Baton Rouge continued to be held by the Union forces without opposition or even serious menace . An attempt to occupy Galveston was less fortunate . This movement was ordered by Banks a few days after his arrival at New Orleans , apparently under the pressure of continued importunity from Andrew J. Hamilton , and in furtherance of the policy that had led the government to send him with the expedition , nominally as a brigadier-general , but under a special commission from the President that named him as military governor of Texas . On the 21st of December , three companies , D , G , and I , of the 42d Massachusetts , under Colonel Isaac S. Burrell , were sent from New Orleans without disembarking from the little Saxon , on which they had made the journey from New York . With them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow ten days later on the Cambria , with the horses and men of troops A and B of the Texas cavalry . Protected by the flotilla under Commander W. B. Renshaw , comprising his own vessel , the Westfield , the gunboats Harriet Lane , Commander J. M. Wainwright ; Clifton , Commander Richard L. Law ; Owasco , Lieutenant Henry Wilson ; and Sachem , Acting-Master Amos Johnson ; and the schooner Corypheus , Acting-Master Spears , Burrell landed unopposed at Kuhn 's Wharf on the 24th , and took nominal possession of the town in accordance with his instructions . These were indeed rather vague , as befitted the shadowy nature of the objects to be accomplished . " The situation of the people of Galveston , " wrote General Banks , " makes it expedient to send a small force there for the purpose of their protection , and also to afford such facilities as may be possible for recruiting soldiers for the military service of the United States . " Burrell was cautioned not to involve himself in such difficulty as to endanger the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was not to take orders from General Hamilton . In reality , Burrell 's small force occupied only the long wharf , protected by barricades at the shore end , and seaward by the thirty-two guns of the fleet , lying at anchor within 300 yards . Magruder , who had been barely a month in command of the Confederate forces in Texas , had given his first attention to the defenceless condition of the coast , menaced as it was by the blockading fleet , and thus it happened that Burrell 's three companies , performing their maiden service on picket between wind and water , found themselves confronted by the two brigades of Scurry and Sibley , Cook 's regiment of heavy artillery , and Wilson 's light battery , with twenty-eight guns , and two armed steamboats , having their vulnerable parts protected by cotton bales . Long before dawn on the 1st of January , 1863 , under cover of a heavy artillery fire , the position of the 42d Massachusetts was assaulted by two storming parties of 300 and 500 men respectively , led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the troops being formed under Scurry in support . A brisk fight followed , but the defenders had the concentrated fire of the fleet to protect them ; the scaling ladders proved too short to reach the wharf , and as day began to break , the baffled assailants were about to draw off , when , suddenly , the Confederate gunboats appeared on the scene and in a few moments turned the defeat into a signal victory . The Neptune was disabled and sunk by the Harriet Lane , the Harriet Lane was boarded and captured by the Bayou City , the Westfield ran aground and was blown up by her gallant commander , and soon the white flag floated from the masts of all the Union fleet . Wainwright and Wilson had been killed ; Renshaw , with his executive officer , Zimmermann , and his chief engineer , Green , had perished with the ship . The survivors were given three hours to consider terms . When Burrell saw the flag of truce from the fleet , he too showed the white flag and surrendered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing on him as soon as they perceived his signal , but the navy , observing that the fire on shore went on for some time , notwithstanding the naval truce , thought it had been violated ; accordingly the Clifton , Owasco , Sachem , and Corypheus put out to sea , preceded by the army transport steamers Saxon and Mary A. Boardman . On the latter vessel were the military governor of Texas , with his staff , and the men and guns of Holcomb 's battery . The Confederates lost 26 killed and 117 wounded ; the Union troops 5 killed and 15 wounded , and all the survivors ( probably about 250 in number ) were made prisoners save the adjutant , Lieutenant Charles A. Davis , who had been sent off to communicate with the fleet . The navy lost 29 killed , 31 wounded , and 92 captured . So ended this inauspicious New Year 's day . The transports made the best of their way to New Orleans with the news . The Cambria , with the Texas cavalry and the horses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening of the 2d of January . For two days a strong wind and high sea rendered fruitless all efforts to communicate with the shore ; then learning the truth , the troops at once returned to New Orleans . Orders had been left with the guard ship at Pilot Town to send the transport steamers , Charles Osgood and Shetucket , with the remainder of the 42d , directly to Galveston . It was now necessary to change these orders , and to do it promptly . The bad news reached headquarters early in the afternoon of the 3d January : " Stop every thing going to Galveston , " was at once telegraphed to the Pass . ( 1 ) " Cruise and Combats of the Alabama , " by her Executive Officer , John Mackintosh Kell.  --  " Century War Book , " vol. iv. , p. 603 . CHAPTER VI . ORGANIZING THE CORPS . Meanwhile the new troops continued to come from New York , although it was not until the 11th of February that the last detachments landed . The work of organizing the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pursued with vigor . In order to form the moving column , as well as for the purposes of administration , so that the one might not interfere with the other , the main body of troops was composed of four divisions of three brigades each . The garrisons of the defences and the permanent details for guard and provost duty were kept separate . While this was in progress orders came from the War Office dated the 5th of January , 1863 , by which all the forces in the Department of the Gulf were designated as the Nineteenth Army Corps , to take effect December 14 , 1862 , and Banks was named by the President as the corps commander . To Augur was assigned the First division , to Sherman the Second , to Emory the Third , and to Grover the Fourth . Weitzel , retaining his old brigade , became the second in command in Augur 's division . In making up the brigades the regiments were so selected and combined as to mingle the veterans with the raw levies , and to furnish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the colonels as brigade commanders . Andrews , who had been left in New York to bring up the rear of the expedition , became Chief-of-Staff on the 6th of March , and Bowen was made Provost-Marshal General . To each division three batteries of artillery were given , including at least one battery belonging to the regular army , thus furnishing , except for the second division , an experienced regular officer as chief of artillery of the division . The cavalry was kept , for the most part , unattached , mainly serving in La Fourche , at Baton Rouge , and with the moving column . The 21st Indiana , changed into the 1st Indiana heavy artillery , was told off to man the siege train , for which duty it was admirably suited . When all had joined , the whole force available for active operations that should not uncover New Orleans was about 25,000 . Two thirds , however , were new levies , and of these half were nine months ' men . Some were armed with guns that refused to go off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , afterwards handsomely redeemed , the colonel , having to disembark his men , could think of no way save by the novel command , " Break ranks , boys , and get ashore the best way you can . " The cavalry , except the six old companies , was poor and quite insufficient in numbers . Of land and water transportation , both indispensable to any possible operation , there was barely enough for the movement of a single division . In Washington , Banks had been led to expect that he might count on the depots or the country for all the material required for moving his army ; yet Butler found New Orleans on the brink of starvation ; the people had now to be fed , as well as the army , and the provisions that formerly came from the West by the great river had now to find their way from the North by the Atlantic and the Gulf . The depots were calculated , and barely sufficed , for the old force of the department , while the country could furnish very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be occupied . Again , until he reached his post , Banks was not informed that the Confederates were in force anywhere on the river save Vicksburg , yet , in fact , Port Hudson , 250 miles below Vicksburg and 135 miles above New Orleans , was found strongly intrenched with twenty-nine heavy guns in position and garrisoned by 12,000 men . Long before Banks could have assembled and set in motion a force sufficient to cope with this enemy behind earthworks , the 12,000 became 16,000 . Moreover , Banks was not in communication either with Grant or with McClernand ; he knew next to nothing of the operations , the movements , or the plans of either ; he had not the least idea when the expedition would be ready to move from Memphis ; he was even uncertain who the commander of the Northern column was to be . On their part , not only were Grant , the department commander ; McClernand , the designated commander of the Vicksburg expedition ; and Sherman , its actual commander , alike ignorant of every thing pertaining to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most critical period of the campaign , not one of the three was in communication with either of the others . Under these conditions , all concert between the co-operating forces was rendered impossible from the start , and the expectations of the government that Banks would go against Vicksburg immediately on landing in Louisiana were doomed to sharp and sudden , yet inevitable , disappointment . Grant , believing himself free to dispose of McClernand 's new levies , had projected a combined movement by his own forces , marching by Grand Junction , and Sherman 's , moving by water from Memphis , on the front and rear of Vicksburg . Sherman set out from Memphis on the 20th of December in complete ignorance of Halleck 's telegram of the 18th , conveying the President 's positive order that McClernand was to command the expedition . Forrest cut the wires on the morning of the 19th just in time to intercept this telegram , as well as its counterpart , addressed to McClernand at Springfield , Illinois . On the 29th of December , Sherman met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of January he returned to the mouth of the Yazoo , and there found McClernand armed with the bowstring and the baton . Where was Grant ? While his main body was still at Oxford , in march to the Yallabusha , Forrest , the ubiquitous , irrepressible Forrest , struck his line of communications , and , on the 20th of December , at the instant when Sherman was giving the signal to get under way from Memphis , Van Dorn was receiving the surrender of Holly Springs and the keys of Grant 's depots . There seemed nothing for it but to fall back on Memphis or starve . Of this state of affairs Grant sent word to Sherman on the 20th . Eleven days later the despatch was telegraphed to Sherman by McClernand ; nor was it until the 8th of January that Grant , at Holly Springs , learned from Washington the bad news from Sherman , then ten days old . As if to complete a very cat's-cradle of cross-purposes , Washington had heard of it only through the Richmond newspapers . The collapse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson , had completely changed the nature of the problem confided to Banks for solution . If he was to execute the letter of his instructions at all , he had now to choose between three courses , each involving an impossibility : to carry by assault a strong line of works , three miles long , defended by 16,000 good troops ; to lay siege to the place , with the certainty that it would be relieved from Mississippi , and with the reasonable prospect of losing at least his siege train in the venture ; to leave Port Hudson in his rear and go against Vicksburg , upon the supposition , in the last degree improbable , that he might find Grant , or McClernand , or Sherman there to meet him and furnish him with food and ammunition . This last alternative appears to have been the one towards which the government leaned , as far as its intentions can be gathered , yet Banks could only have accepted it by sacrificing his communications , putting New Orleans in imminent peril , and creating irreparable and almost inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great success . In point of fact , in the early days of January , McClernand , accompanied by Sherman as a corps commander , was moving toward the White River and the brilliant adventure of Arkansas Post . After capturing this place on the 11th , McClernand meant to go straight to Little Rock , but Grant rose to the occasion and peremptorily recalled the troops to Milliken 's Bend . " This wild-goose chase , " as Grant not inaptly termed it , cost McClernand his new-fledged honors as commander of " The Army of the Mississippi , " and brought him to Sherman 's side as a commander of one of his own corps ; a bitter draught of the same medicine he had so recently administered to Sherman . Had Banks marched against Vicksburg at the same time that McClernand was moving on Little Rock , with Grant cut off somewhere in northern Mississippi , the Confederate commanders must have been dull and slow indeed had they failed to seize with promptitude so rare an opportunity for resuming , at a sweep , the complete mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eliminating 100,000 of his soldiers . Thus , almost at the first step , the two great expeditions were brought to a standstill . They could neither act together nor advance separately . The generals began to look about them for a new way . CHAPTER VII . MORE WAYS THAN ONE . Since Port Hudson could neither be successfully attacked nor safely disregarded , the problem now presented to Banks was to find a way around the obstacle without sacrificing or putting in peril his communications . The Atchafalaya was the key to the puzzle , and to that quarter attention was early directed , yet for a long time the difficulties encountered in finding a way to the Atchafalaya seemed well-nigh insuperable . The rising waters were expected to render the largest of the bayous that connect the Atchafalaya and the Mississippi navigable for steamboats of small size and light draught . Of these there were , indeed , but few , so that the work of transporting troops from the one line to the other must have been , at the best , slow and tedious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , with the help of the navy , above and beyond Port Hudson , with a sufficient line of communications open to the rear , and the Mississippi and the Red River closed against the enemy . The Confederates had in Western Louisiana , near the mouth of the Teche , a small division of Taylor 's troops , about 4,500 strong , with one gunboat . At first Banks thought to leave a brigade , with two or three light-draught gunboats , on Berwick Bay to observe Taylor 's force , and then to disregard it as a factor in the subsequent movements . This , while the Atchafalaya was high and the eastern lowlands of the Attakapas widely overflowed , might have been safely done , but all these plans were destined to be essentially modified by a series of unexpected events in widely different quarters . In the second week of January , Weitzel heard that Taylor meditated an attack on the outlying force at Berwick Bay , and that with this view the armament of the gunboat Cotton was being largely augmented . Weitzel resolved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole force of seven regiments , including four of his own brigade , besides the 21st Indiana , 6th Michigan , and 23d Connecticut , with Carruth 's and Thompson 's batteries , four pieces of Bainbridge 's battery , Barrett 's Troop B of the Louisiana cavalry , and Company B of the 8th New Hampshire , commanded by Lieutenant Charles H. Camp . The 1st Louisiana held Donaldsonville and the 114th New York guarded the railway . To open the way , as well as to meet the fire of the Cotton , there were four gunboats of the light-draught flotilla under Buchanan  --  the flagship Calhoun , Estrella , Kinsman , and Diana . At three o'clock on the morning of the 13th of January the crossing of Berwick Bay began ; by half-past ten the gunboats had completed the ferriage of the cavalry and artillery ; the infantry following landed at Pattersonville ; then the whole force formed in line and , moving forward in the afternoon to the junction of the Teche with the Atchafalaya , went into bivouac . The next morning began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the east or left bank of the bayou , while the main line moved forward on the west bank to attack the Cotton , now in plain sight . The gunboats led the movement , necessarily in line ahead , owing to the narrowness of the bayou . On either bank Weitzel 's line of battle , with skirmishers thrown well forward , was preceded by sixty volunteers from the 8th Vermont and the same number from the 75th New York , whose orders were to move directly up to the Cotton and pick off her gunners . The line of battle moved forward steadily with the column of gunboats . Between the Union gunboats and the Cotton the bayou had been obstructed so as to prevent any hostile vessel from ascending the stream beyond that point . A brisk fight followed . Under cover of the guns of the navy and of the raking and broadside fire of the batteries , the 8th Vermont and 75th New York first drove off the land supports and then moving swiftly on the Cotton silenced her . In this advance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreated out of range . That night her crew applied the match and let her swing across the bayou to serve as an additional obstruction . In a few moments she was completely destroyed . Then , having thus easily gained his object , Weitzel returned to La Fourche . His losses in the movement were 1 officer and 5 men killed , and 2 officers and 25 men wounded . Lieutenant James E. Whiteside , of the 75th New York , who had volunteered to lead the sharpshooters on the right bank , was killed close to the Cotton , in the act of ordering the crew to haul down her flag . Among the killed , also , was the gallant Buchanan  --  a serious loss , not less to the army than to the navy . During a lull in the naval operations above Vicksburg , occasioned by the want of coal , eleven steamboats that had been in use by the Confederates on the Mississippi between Vicksburg and Port Hudson , took advantage of Porter 's absence to slip up the Yazoo for supplies . There Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of January Grant landed on the long neck opposite Vicksburg , and once more set to work on the canal . Porter now determined to let a detachment of his fleet run the gauntlet of the batteries of Vicksburg for the purpose of destroying every thing the Confederates had afloat below the town . The ran Queen of the West , Colonel Charles R. Ellet , protected by two tiers of cotton bales , was told off to lead the adventure . On the 2d of February she performed the feat ; then passing on down the river , on the 3d , ran fifteen miles below the mouth of the Red River , and the same distance up that stream , took and burned three Confederate supply steamboats , and got safely back to Vicksburg on the 5th . Porter was naturally jubilant , for , as it seemed , the mastery of the great river had been the swift reward of his enterprise . A week later Ellet again ran down the Mississippi and up the Red , burning and destroying until , pushing his success too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Russy . A few shots sufficed to disable the Queen of the West , which fell into the hands of the Confederates , while Ellet and his men escaped in one of their captures . Below Natchez they met the Indianola coming down the river , after safely passing Vicksburg . On the 24th the Confederate gunboat Webb , and the ram Queen of the West , now also flying the Confederate colors , came after the Indianola , attacked her off Palmyra Island , and sank her . Thus , as suddenly as it had gone from them , the control of the long reach of the Mississippi once more passed over to the Confederates . At this news Farragut took fire . Between him and the impudent little Confederate flotilla , whose easy triumph had suddenly laid low the hopes and plans of his brother admiral , there stood nothing save the guns of Port Hudson . These batteries he would pass , and for the fourth time , yet not the last , would look the miles of Confederate cannon in the mouth . Banks , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the causes already mentioned , promptly fell in with the Admiral 's plans , and both commanders conferring freely , the details were soon arranged . CHAPTER VIII . FARRAGUT PASSES PORT HUDSON . While Farragut was putting his fleet in thorough order for this adventure , looking after all needful arrangements with minute personal care , Banks concentrated all his disposable force at Baton Rouge . By the 7th of March , leaving T. W. Sherman to cover New Orleans and Weitzel to hold strongly La Fourche , Banks had a marching column , composed of Augur 's , Emory 's , and Grover 's divisions , 15,000 strong . On the 9th of March tents were struck , to be pitched no more for five hard months , and the next morning the troops were ready , but repairs delayed the fleet , the last vessels of which did not reach Baton Rouge until about the 12th . On that day , for the first time , Banks reviewed his army , on the old battle-ground , in the presence of the admiral , his staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with some exceptions , showed plainly the progress already attained under the energetic training and constant work of their officers . The degree of instruction and care then apparent forecast the value of their actual service . The 38th Massachusetts and 116th New York were specially commended in orders . To hold Baton Rouge about 3,000 men were detached , under Chickering , including the 41st Massachusetts , 173d New York , 175th New York , 1st Indiana heavy artillery , 3d Louisiana native guards , Mack 's battery , and Troop F of the Rhode Island cavalry . All arrangements being concerted for the passage of the batteries on the evening of the 14th of March , Grover set out on the afternoon of the 13th , followed , at daybreak the next morning , by Emory , with Augur bringing up the rear . In the afternoon Grover went into camp , covering the intersection of the Bayou Sara road and the road that leads from it toward the river . Emory formed on his left , covering the branches of this road that lead to Springfield Landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre at Alexander 's plantation . Augur , on the right , held the cross-road that leads from the Bayou Sara road by Alexander 's to the Clinton road at Vallandigham 's . At two o'clock in the afternoon the signal officers opened communication from Springfield Landing with the fleet at anchor near the head of Prophet Island , and a strong detachment was posted near the landing to maintain the connection . As the Confederates were known to have a force of about 1,200 cavalry somewhere between Clinton and Baton Rouge , strong detachments became necessary to observe all the approaches and to hold the roads and bridges in the rear in order to secure the withdrawal of the army when the demonstration should be completed , as well as to guard the operation from being inopportunely interrupted . These dispositions reduced the force for battle to about 12,000 . It had been intended to concentrate nearly all the artillery near the river in the vicinity of Ross Landing in such a manner as to engage , or at least divide , the attention of the lower batteries of Port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , and when a reconnoissance , naturally retarded by the enemy 's advance guard , showed that the road by which the guns were to have gone into position did not exist , the daylight was already waning . A broken bridge also caused some delay . At five o'clock in the afternoon Banks received a despatch from Farragut announcing an important change in the hour fixed for the movement of the fleet . Instead of making the attempt " in the gray of the morning , " as had been the admiral 's first plan , he now meant to get under way at eight o'clock in the evening . When darkness fell , therefore , it found the troops substantially in the positions already described , yet with their outposts well thrown forward . About ten o'clock the fleet weighed anchor and moved up the river . The flagship Hartford took the lead , with the Albatross lashed to her port side , next the Richmond with the Genesee , the Monongahela with the Kineo , and last the side-wheeler Mississippi alone . The Essex and Sachem remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the advance . An hour later a rocket shot up from the bluff and instantly the Confederate batteries opened fire . They were soon joined by long lines of sharpshooters . To avoid the shoal that makes out widely from the western bank , as well as to escape the worst of the enemy 's fire , both of musketry and artillery , the ships hugged closely the eastern bluff ; so closely , indeed , that the yards brushed the leaves from the overhanging trees and the voices of men on shore could be distinctly heard by those on board . Watch-fires were lighted by the Confederates to show as well the ships as the range ; yet this did more harm than good , since the smoke united with that of the guns ashore and afloat to render the fleet invisible . On the other hand , the pilots were soon unable to see . The Hartford , meeting the swift eddy at the bend , where the current describes nearly a right angle , narrowly escaped being driven ashore . The Richmond , following , was disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper battery at the turn . The Monongahela 's consort , the Kineo , lost the use of her rudder , and the Monongahela herself ran aground on the spit ; presently the Kineo , drifting clear , also grounded , but was soon afloat again , and , with her assistance , the Monongahela too swung free , after nearly a half hour of imminent peril . Then the Kineo , cast loose by her consort , drifted helplessly down the stream , while the Monongahela passed up until a heated bearing brought her engines to a stop and she too drifted with the current . Last of the fleet , the Mississippi , unseen in the smoke , and therefore safe enough from the Confederate guns , yet equally unable to see either friend , foe , or landmark , was carried by the current hard on the spit ; then , after a half hour of ineffectual exertion , lying alone and helpless under the concentrated aim of the Confederate batteries , she was abandoned and set on fire by her captain . About three in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she floated free and drifted down the stream one mass of flames , in plain view , not merely of the fleet , but also of the army , condemned to stand to arms in sight and sound of the distant battle and now to look on idly as , with a mighty flash and roar , the Mississippi cast to the heavens her blazing timbers , amid a myriad of bursting shells , in one mountain of flame : then black silence . Thus , when at last the gray of the morning came , the Hartford and Albatross rode in safety above Port Hudson , while the Richmond , Monongahela , Genesee , and Kineo , all battered and more or less injured , lay at anchor once more near Prophet Island , and the Mississippi had perished in a blaze of glory . Narrowly escaping the total failure of his plans and the destruction of his fleet , Farragut had so far succeeded in his objects that henceforth the Confederates practically lost the control of the Mississippi above Port Hudson , as well as the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in skiff-loads , beef , corn , and salt could no longer be safely carried across the Mississippi , and the high road from Galveston and Matamoras was closed against the valuable and sorely needed cargoes brought from Europe by the blockade runners . As for the army , it had gained some facility of movement , some knowledge of its deficiencies , and some information of great future value as to the topography of the unknown country about Port Hudson ; more than this could hardly have been expected . Indeed , the sole object of the presence of the army was defeated by the movement of the fleet so many hours before the time agreed upon . This object was to make a diversion that might attract the enemy 's attention and thus tend to reduce the fire of musketry on the exposed decks of the fleet , and to draw off or hold off the fire of the field-pieces that might otherwise be massed on the river front . The disparity between the relative strength of Banks 's army and that of the garrison was too well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . Such , however , was not the opinion of the government , which to the last seems to have taken for granted that all that was needed to insure the surrender of Port Hudson was a desire to attack it . Even after the surrender , Halleck , in his annual report for 1863 , speaking of the position of affairs in March , said : " Had our land forces invested Port Hudson at this time , it could have been easily reduced , as its garrison was weak . . . but the strength of the place was not then known . " In truth , the place was never so strong , before or after , as at this time ; nor is it often in war that the information tallies so nearly with the fact . The effective strength of the garrison was more than 16,000 . Gardner 's monthly report accounts for 1,366 officers and 14,921 men present for duty , together 16,287 out of a total present of 20,388 . Besides the twenty-two heavy guns in position , he had thirteen light batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , either for attack or defence . Nothing was to be gained by staying there , and much was to be risked . As soon , therefore , as word came through the ever-active and adventurous signal-officers that all was well with what remained of the fleet , Banks once more took up the line of march for Baton Rouge , and went into bivouac in great discomfort on the soggy borders of the Bayou Montesanto , about eight miles north of the town . Meanwhile , what had become of Farragut ? The last seen of the Hartford and Albatross was on the morning of the 15th by the signal officers at Springfield Landing . The two vessels then lay at anchor beyond the bend above Port Hudson . Several attempts were made to communicate with the Admiral across the intervening neck of lowland . The first was on the 16th , by Parmele , with the 174th New York and a squadron of the 2d Rhode Island cavalry . Next , on the 18th , Banks , eager to advance the effort , took Dudley 's brigade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troop , and joined Parmele . But for a time these efforts accomplished nothing , since it was impossible to see far over the flat and wooded country ; and the Confederates having cut the great levee at Morganza , the whole neighborhood was under water and the bridges gone . Finally , on the 19th , Colonel Charles J. Paine went out with the 2d Louisiana , the 174th New York , and a small squad of cavalry , and leaving first the infantry and then most of the troopers behind , and riding on almost alone , succeeded in crossing the bend and gained the levee at the head of the old channel known as Fausse River , about three miles above Port Hudson . There he had a good view of the river , yet nothing was to be seen of the Hartford and Albatross . Again , on the 24th , Dudley sent Magen with his troop to Hermitage Landing . Pushing on with a few men , Magen got a full view of the reach above Waterloo for five miles , but he too learned nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river on the 15th , after vainly attempting to exchange signals with his ships below and with the army , and was now near Vicksburg in communication with Admiral Porter , engaged in concerting plans for the future . Before getting under way he had caused three guns to be fired from the Hartford . This was the signal agreed upon with Banks , but for some reason it was either not heard or not reported . Just before separating at Baton Rouge , Banks had handed to Farragut a letter addressed to Grant , to be delivered by the Admiral in the event of success . This letter , the first direct communication between the two generals , Grant received on the 20th of March , and from it derived his first information of the actual state of affairs in the Department of the Gulf . After stating his position and force Banks wound up by saying : " Should the Admiral succeed in his attempt , I shall try to open communication with him on the other side of the river , and , in that event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and movements , and especially as to your views as to the most efficient mode of co-operation upon the part of the forces we respectively command . " With the Hartford and Albatross controlling the reach between Port Hudson and Vicksburg , as well as the mouth of the Red River and the head of the Atchafalaya , Banks might now safely disregard the movements of the Confederate gunboats . Accordingly , while waiting for Grant 's answer , he turned to the execution of his former plan . CHAPTER IX . THE TECHE . In effect , this plan was to turn Port Hudson by way of the Atchafalaya . For the original conception , the credit must be given to Weitzel , who seems indeed to have formed a very similar scheme when he first occupied La Fourche . However , his force was , at that time , barely sufficient for the defence of the territory confided to his care . Not only was there then no particular object in moving beyond the Atchafalaya , but any advance in that direction would have exposed his little corps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numberless streams for a movement by detachments of the enemy into his rear . It was largely to prepare for an advance into Western Louisiana , as well as to defend his occupancy of La Fourche , that Butler , upon Weitzel 's suggestion , had created the gunboat flotilla . Soon after Banks took the command , Weitzel , who had opinions and the courage to enforce them , laid his ideas before his new chief . On the 18th of January , disturbed by hearing that Admiral Farragut meant to take one of the army gunboats , recently transferred to the navy , away from Berwick Bay , instead of sending more , Weitzel expressed himself strongly in a despatch to headquarters . " With such a naval force in that bay , in co-operation with a suitable land force , the only true campaign in this section could be made . Look at the map . Berwick Bay leads into Grand Lake , Grand Lake into the Atchafalaya , the Atchafalaya into Red River . Boats drawing not more than four or five feet and in the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , could clear out the Atchafalaya , Red River , and Black River . All communications from Vicksburg and Port Hudson cross this line indicated by me . By taking it in the manner I propose , Vicksburg and Port Hudson would be a cipher to the rebels . It would be a campaign that 100,000 men could not so easily fight , and so successfully . It is an operation to which the taking of Galveston Island is a cipher and the capture of the Mobile Bay forts a nonentity . " With these views Banks was himself in accord , yet not in their entirety . The pressure of time led him to desire to avoid divergences into the Teche country . If it were possible , he wished to gain the Atchafalaya by some route at once speedier and more direct . While the explorations were in progress to discover such a route , Weitzel once more took occasion to urge his original plan . On the 15th of February , he wrote to Augur , his division commander : " I feel it a duty which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this late hour in the night on the present proposed movement on Butte a la Rose and the Teche country . . . . In all honesty and candor , I do not believe the present plan to be a proper one . . . . Sibley 's Texas brigade is somewhere in the Opelousas country . . . . Mouton 's main body is in rear of intrenchments on Madame Meade 's plantation , six miles below Centreville . If we defeat these two commands we form a junction with our forces near Vicksburg . By pursuing our success to Alexandria , we may capture General Mouton 's force , and with little loss , unless it form a junction with Sibley . If it forms a junction , we will meet them near Iberia and engage them in open field , and with a proper force can defeat them . General Emory 's whole division ( moved to Brashear City ) and my brigade can do this work . Let the light transportation , now with General Emory , and all destined for and collected by me be collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to and landed at Indian Bend , while the other two are crossed and attack in front . If Mouton escapes ( which I think , if properly conducted , will be doubtful ) we form a junction at Indian Bend . We proceed to attack and with much superior force , because I do not believe Mouton and Sibley united will exceed 6,000 men . We can defeat them , pursue our success to Alexandria and of course get Butte a la Rose ; our gunboats to facilitate its fall , attacking it as they can not accompany us farther up than Saint Martinville . I believe this to be the true and only correct plan of the campaign . " These views were unquestionably sound ; they were such as might have been expected of an officer of Weitzel 's skill and experience and special knowledge of the theatre of operations . Supported by the strong current of events , they were now to be carried into effect . At the date of this despatch , Emory 's division had been for several weeks near the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoring to find or force a waterway to the Atchafalaya , while Weitzel was holding his brigade in readiness to co-operate by a simultaneous movement against Taylor on the Teche . Many attempts were made by Emory to carry out the object confided to him , yet all proved failures . Bayou Sorrel , Lake Chicot , Grand River , and the Plaquemine itself , from both ends of the stream , were thoroughly explored , but only to find the bayous choked with driftwood impossible to remove , and until removed rendering the streams impassable . Two of these drifts in Bayou Sorrel were carefully examined by Captain Henry Cochen , of the 173d New York . The first he reported to be about a mile in length , " composed of one mass of logs , roots , big and small trees , etc. , jammed tightly for thirty feet , the whole length of my pole . " The second drift , just beyond , was found nearly as bad , and farther on lay another even worse . Moreover , a thorough reconnoissance showed the whole country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be impracticable at that season for all arms . After more than a month of this sort of work , Emory was called across the river to Baton Rouge to take part in the events narrated in the last chapter . Banks returned to New Orleans on the 24th of March , and the next day ordered Grover to embark and move down the river to Donaldsonville , and thence march down the Bayou La Fourche to Thibodeaux . At the same time Emory was ordered , as soon as Grover 's river transports should be released , to embark his command for Algiers , and thence move by the railway to Brashear . Meanwhile , on the 18th of March , Weitzel learned of the presence of the Queen of the West and Webb in the Atchafalaya , and as this seemed to indicate an intention to attack him , and the navy had no more light-draught gunboats to spare for his further security , to avoid having his hand forced and the game spoiled , he discreetly fell back on the 21st to the railway bridge over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not exposed , as at Brashear , to the risk of being cut off by any sudden movement of the enemy . On the 28th of March the Diana was sent to reconnoitre the Confederate position and strength on the lower Teche ; but continuing on down the Atchafalaya , instead of returning by Grand Lake as intended , and thus running into the arms of the enemy , she fell an easy prey . The Calhoun went to her relief , but ran aground , and the Estrella had to go to the assistance of the Calhoun . Acting-Master James L. Peterson , commanding the Diana , was killed , and Lieutenant Pickering D. Allen , aide-de-camp to General Weitzel , was wounded . With the Diana there fell into the enemy 's hands nearly one hundred and fifty prisoners . This gave the Confederates three rather formidable boats in the Atchafalaya and the Teche . The movement of the troops was necessarily slow , as well by reason of the extremely limited facilities for transportation , as because of the state of the roads , but by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that day Banks moved his headquarters to Brashear . Weitzel , who had been reinforced by the siege-train , manned by the 1st Indiana heavy artillery , had already re-occupied his former front on Berwick Bay . Emory was in bivouac at Bayou Ramos , about five miles in the rear of Weitzel , and Grover at Bayou Boeuf , about four miles behind Emory . Thus the whole movement was almost completely masked from the Confederates , who from their side of the bay saw only Weitzel , and knew little or nothing of the gathering forces in his rear . So little , indeed , that Taylor , with his usual enterprise , seems to have thought this a favorable moment for attempting upon Weitzel the same operation that Weitzel had been so long meditating for the discomfiture of Taylor . Emory marched early in the morning of the 9th of April and closed up on Weitzel , who , an hour later , about ten o'clock , began to cross . No enemy was seen save a small outpost , engaged in observing the movement . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows . Weitzel at once sent his Assistant Adjutant-General , Captain John B. Hubbard , with Perkins 's and Williamson 's troops of cavalry and one section of Bainbridge 's battery to discover the enemy 's position . The Confederates were found to be in some force in front of Pattersonville , with their cavalry pickets advanced to within a mile of Weitzel 's front . As soon as Weitzel had completed his crossing , and released the boats , Emory followed him . The four brigades bivouacked in front of the landing-place that night . The gunboats , having done the greater share of the ferriage , went back to the east bank for Grover . Grover , who had marched from Bayou Boeuf at nine o'clock , just as Emory was arriving at Brashear , came there , in his turn , early in the afternoon . The plan had been that Grover should embark immediately , and , having his whole force on board by an early hour in the night , the boats should set out at daylight , so as to place Grover by nine o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work cut out for him . With few pilots , and the shores unlighted , it was out of the question to attempt the navigation of the waters of the Grand Lake during the night . However , it was not until the night of the 11th that Grover was able to complete the embarkation of his division . To understand this it is necessary to observe that Emory and Weitzel , in making the passage of Berwick Bay , were merely crossing a short ferry , so that the boats engaged in the transfer could be loaded rapidly to almost any extent , so long as they remained afloat , and being unloaded with equal facility , were in a few minutes ready to repeat the operation . In Grover 's case , however , the infantry , artillery , cavalry , and stores had all to be taken care of at once , with every provision for fighting a battle . For this the artillery was considered indispensable , and it was not without great trouble and long delay that the guns and horses were got afloat . Fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accomplished by the greatest exertion on his part , as well as on the part of his officers and the corps quartermasters , a fog set in so dense that the pilots were unable to see their way . This continued until nine o'clock on the morning of the 12th ; then at last the movement began . About noon , on the 11th of April , Weitzel , leading the advance of the main column , moved forward . At once his skirmishers felt the skirmishers of the enemy , who retired slowly , without attempting any serious opposition . In the evening , Weitzel rested in line of battle a short distance above Pattersonville . Emory followed closely , and went into bivouac on Weitzel 's left . The march had not been begun earlier , and the enemy was not pressed , because it was desired to keep him amused until Grover should have gained his rear , and Grover had not yet started . After the early morning of Sunday , the 12th of April , had been spent in light skirmishing and in demonstrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time to attract and hold his attention , word came that Grover was under way . Banks knew that the passing fleet must soon be in plain sight of the Confederates . Therefore , it was now necessary to move promptly , and to feel the enemy strongly , yet not too strongly , lest he should abandon his position too soon and suddenly spoil all . From this moment it is important to remember that , save in the event of complete success , no word could come from Grover for nearly two days . The first news from him was expected to be the sound of his guns in the enemy 's rear . At eleven o'clock the bugle again sounded the advance . The whole line moved forward , continually skirmishing , until , about four o'clock in the afternoon , the infantry came under fire of the Confederate guns in position on the lines known as Camp Bisland . The line of march led up the right bank of the Atchafalaya until the mouth of the Teche was reached , thence up the Teche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right bank . At first Weitzel formed on the right , Emory on the left , but as the great bend of the Teche was reached , about four miles below Bisland , and by the nature of the ground the front became narrowed at the same time that in following the change of direction of the bayou the line was brought to a wheel , Weitzel took ground to the left in two lines , while Emory advanced Paine 's brigade into the front line on Weitzel 's right , placed Ingraham in his second line , and made a third line with Godfrey . Then finding the enemy beyond the Teche too strong for the cavalry to manage single-handed , Banks called on Emory to reinforce the right bank . Emory sent Bryan across with the 175th New York and a section of the 1st Maine battery , commanded by Lieutenant Eben D. Haley . They were to push the enemy back , and to conform to the advance of the main line . The day was hot , the air close , and the march over the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into and over the deep ditches , was trying to the men , as yet but little accustomed to marches . Fortunately , however , there was no need of pressing the advance until Grover 's guns should be heard . About half-past five in the afternoon a brisk artillery fire began , and was kept up until night fell ; then Emory moved the 4th Wisconsin forward to hold a grove in front of a sugar-house , near the bayou , well in advance of his right , in order to prevent the Confederates from occupying it , to the annoyance of the whole line . After dark all the pickets were thrown well forward in touch with those of the enemy , but the main lines were drawn back out of range , for the sake of a good night 's sleep before a hard day 's work . CHAPTER X. BISLAND . The works behind which the Confederates now stood to battle were named Camp Bisland or Fort Bisland , in honor of the planter whose fields were thus given over to war . The defences consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rather low relief , thrown completely across the neck of dry land on either bank of the Teche , the flanks resting securely on the swamps that border Grand Lake on the left and on the right extend to the Gulf . The position was well chosen , for five miles below Centreville , where the plantation of Mrs. Meade adjoins the Bethel Place , the neck is at its narrowest . The Teche , passing a little to the left of the centre of the works , enabled the guns of the Diana , moving freely around the bends , to contribute to the defence , while the obstructions placed below the works hindered the ascent of the bayou by the Union gunboats . The Confederate right was also somewhat strengthened by the embankment of the unfinished railroad to Opelousas . On the other hand , from the nature of the ground , low and flat as it was , the works were in part rather commanded than commanding ; yet the difference of level was inconsiderable , and for a force as small as Taylor 's , outnumbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than compensated by the shortness of the line . Along the banks of the bayou were a few live oaks ; on either flank the swamp was densely wooded , mainly with cypress , cottonwood , and willow , with an outlying and almost impenetrable canebrake , while between the attacking columns and the Confederate position , on either bank of the bayou , stretched a field where the young shoots of the sugar-cane stood knee-high . This was crossed at right angles with the bayou , by many of those wide and deep ditches by which the planters of Louisiana are accustomed to drain their tilled lowlands . Such was the scene of the action now about to be fought , known to the Union army as the battle of Bisland or Fort Bisland ; to the Confederates , as the battle of Bethel Place or Bayou Teche . During the whole of the night of the 12th a dense fog prevailed , but this lifting about eight o'clock on the morning of Monday , the 13th of April , disclosed a day as bright and beautiful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole line advanced to within short musketry range , in substantially the same order as on the previous day . An attack by a detachment of Confederate cavalry upon the skirmishers of the 4th Wisconsin , in advance of the sugar-house , was easily thrown off , and a later demonstration by the Confederate infantry upon Paine 's position in the grove shared the same fortune . Emory moved first the 8th New Hampshire , and afterwards the 133d and 173d New York , to the support of the 4th Wisconsin . At the same time Banks ordered Emory to send the other four regiments of Gooding 's brigade and the two remaining sections of the 1st Maine battery to reinforce Bryan with the 175th New York on the left bank of the Teche , in order to be prepared , not only to meet a flank movement of the Confederates from that direction , but also to carry to works on that side , should this be thought best . After these dispositions had been completed the advance was steady and continuous , yet not rapid , until toward noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened fire with musketry . The ditches already spoken of hindered the progress of the Union artillery , yet not seriously , while they afforded an excellent protection for the supports of the batteries and enabled the lines of infantry to rest at intervals : no small gain , for the sun grew very hot , and the march over the heavy windrows and across the deep ditches was exhausting . The Confederate gunboat Diana took position well in front of the works , so as to command completely the right flank of Emory and Weitzel as they approached by a fire that , had it not been checked , must have enfiladed the whole line . Just as this fire was beginning to be disturbing it was silenced by a fortunate shot from one of the two 30-pounder Parrott guns , served by the 1st Indiana , posted in rear of Weitzel 's left and trained upon the Diana , under the personal supervision of Arnold . The third shot from this battery , aimed at the flash of the Diana 's guns , exploded in her engine room ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid the vessel , was seen a flash like a puff of vapor ; a rousing cheer was heard from the sharpshooters of the 4th Wisconsin and 8th New Hampshire , who had been told off to keep down the fire of the gunboat ; and the Diana was seen to pass up the bayou and out of the fight . All risk of an enfilade file being thus removed , the whole Union line quickly closed with the Confederates , and the engagement became general with artillery and musketry . On both sides of the bayou the firing was brisk , at times even severe . Save where the view was broken here and there by the trees or became lightly clouded by the smoke of battle , the whole field lay in plain sight . As the course of the Teche in ascending turned toward the left , Gooding , on the east bank , had the wheeling flank , while Weitzel formed the pivot . Gooding went forward in gallant style , his men quickening their pace at times to a run , in order to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perceiving on his extreme right , toward the lake , a fine grove or copse , Gooding threw out Sharpe with the 156th New York to examine the wood with a view of attempting to turn the left flank of the Confederate lines . These , as it proved , did not extend beyond the grove , but there ended in an unfinished redoubt . Indeed , nearly the whole of the Confederate works on the east side of the bayou , although laid out long since , had been but recently and hastily thrown up , after it became known to Taylor that Banks was crossing to attack him . In the wood , about five hundred yards in advance of the breastworks , Mouton had posted Bagby 's 3d Texas regiment . The Texans held their ground so stiffly that Gooding found it necessary to send his own regiment , the 31st Massachusetts , to the support of Sharpe . Mouton supported Bagby with the left wing of the 18th Louisiana and part of Fournet 's and Waller 's battalions . Gooding 's men carried the rifle-pits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two officers and eighty-four men prisoners . His main line in the open ground between the wood and the bayou was formed by the 38th Massachusetts , deployed as skirmishers , covering the front and followed , at a distance of about one hundred and fifty yards , by the 53d Massachusetts , in like order . Behind the 53d , two sections of the 1st Maine battery were posted to command two parallel plantation roads leading up the bayou , while the third section was held in reserve . After the 31st Massachusetts had gone to the support of the right , the main line here was composed of the 175th New York . Shortly after five o'clock the 53d Massachusetts relieved the 38th , which had expended its ammunition , and was falling back under orders to replenish . When this was done , the 38th once more advanced and formed in support of the skirmish line . Meanwhile on the left of the Teche the main body moved forward in two lines of battalions deployed , Paine on the right and Weitzel on the left , while Ingraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . Paine 's first line on the right , nearest the bayou , was composed of the 4th Wisconsin and 8th New Hampshire , his second line of the 133d New York and the 173d New York . Mack 's 20-pounders commanded the bayou road , and Duryea went into battery in advance of the centre , between Paine and Weitzel . Weitzel 's front line was composed of the 8th Vermont and 114th New York , with the 12th Connecticut , 160th New York , and 75th New York in the second line . The guns of Bainbridge and Carruth went into battery near the left flank , and working slowly kept down the fire of the Confederate artillery in their front . When the fire of musketry became hot , Weitzel sent the 75th New York to try to gain the canebrake on the left , in advance of the enemy 's works , with a view of turning that flank . Of this movement Taylor says in his report that it was twice repulsed by the 5th Texas and Waller 's battalion , under Green , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns of Semmes 's battery and the Valverde battery . However , the counter-movement on the part of the Confederates , being begun in plain view , was instantly seen , and Banks sent word to Weitzel to check it . With this object , Weitzel ordered the 114th New York to go to the support of the 75th . A brisk fight followed , without material advantage to either side . In truth , the canebrake formed an impenetrable obstacle to the combatants , who , when once they had passed within the outer edge of the tangle , were unable either to see or approach one another , although the struggle was plainly visible from the front of both armies . The reserve of Parrott guns , manned by the 1st Indiana and composed of four 30-pounders and four 20-pounders , was posted under McMillan to cover the left flank and the broken centre where it was pierced by the bayou , as well as to watch for the return of the Diana to activity . Toward evening the remaining guns of the 1st Indiana , two 12-pounder rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre , were sent to the left to assist Bainbridge and Carruth , whose ammunition was giving out . Banks , after gaining advanced positions in contact with the enemy , forbore to press them hard because , as has been seen , his whole purpose was to hold the Confederates where they stood until he could hear of Grover or from Grover . As the day advanced without news or the long-expected sound of Grover 's guns , Banks began to grow impatient and to fear that the adventure from which so much had been hoped had somehow miscarried . He therefore became even more anxious than before lest the Confederates should move off under cover of the coming night . Accordingly , during the afternoon , although it had been his previous purpose not to deliver an assault until certain that Grover held the Confederate line of retreat , Banks gave discretionary orders to Emory and Weitzel to form for an attack and move upon the Confederate works if a favorable opportunity should present itself . The exercise of this discretion in turn devolved upon the commanders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Gooding , being out of communication , except by signal , with the troops on the west bank , was occupied in conforming to their movements . Paine and Weitzel , after conferring , resolved to attack , and having made every preparation , only waited for the word from the commanding general . The day was waning ; it was already past four o'clock ; and Banks was still somewhat anxiously weighing the approach of night and the cost of the assault against the chance of news from Grover , when suddenly , straight up the bayou , and high above the heads of Banks and his men , a 9-inch shell came hurtling , and as it was seen to burst over the lines of Bisland , from far in the rear broke the deep roar of the Clifton 's bow-gun . Soon from below the obstructions that barred her progress came a messenger bearing the long-expected tidings of Grover . At last he was on land and in march toward his position . With a sense of relief Banks recalled the orders for the assault and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate musketry so that the men might rest . To relieve the exhausted skirmish line , the 4th Massachusetts and the 162d New York of Ingraham 's brigade were sent forward from the reserve , leaving him only the 110th New York . By dawn the next morning , at all events , Banks calculated , the turning column would be in place ; accordingly during the night he gave orders to assault along the whole front as soon as it should be light enough to see . However , shortly after midnight , sounds were heard on the picket line , indicating some unusual movement behind the Confederate works . When , at daybreak , the various skirmishers moved forward in eager rivalry , they found the Confederates gone . Captain Allaire , leading his company of the 133d New York , was the first to enter the works ; the regiment itself and the 8th New Hampshire followed closely , and the colors of the 8th were the first to mount the parapet , where they were planted by Paine . On the left bank , this honor fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so nearly simultaneous that the whole line of entrenchments on both sides of the bayou , from right to left , was crossed almost at the same instant . It was nine o'clock on Monday night when Taylor learned of Grover 's movements and position , as narrated in the next chapter . Taylor at once began to move out of the lines of Bisland and to direct his attention to Grover in order to secure a retreat . Just before daylight Green , to whom , with his 5th Texas , Waller 's battalion , and West 's section of Semmes 's battery , Taylor had given the more than usually delicate task of covering the rear , marched off the ground , leaving nothing behind save one 24-pounder siege gun and a disabled howitzer of Cornay 's battery . Without losing an instant the pursuit of the retreating Confederates was begun , Weitzel leading the way , and was conducted with vigor and with scarcely a halt , notwithstanding the energetic opposition of the Confederate rear-guard , until early in the afternoon , just beyond Franklin , Emory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , ran into Grover 's under Dwight , approaching from the opposite direction . Weitzel , having entered Franklin without opposition , kept the left-hand or cut-off road until he came to the burnt bridge over the Choupique , by which , as will presently be seen , the Confederates had escaped . Gooding , after occupying the works in his front , crossed the Teche by a bridge to the west bank and fell into Emory 's column behind Ingraham . The Clifton , as soon as the obstructions could be removed , got under way and moved up the bayou abreast with the advance of the army . The losses of the Nineteenth Army Corps in this its first battle were 3 officers and 37 men killed , 8 officers and 176 men wounded ; in all 224 . The 38th Massachusetts headed the list with 6 killed and 29 wounded , and Gooding 's brigade , to which this regiment belonged , reported 87 casualties , or 38 per cent . of the whole . In the six light batteries 15 horses were killed and 12 wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lost in crossing the Teche to go into action . The losses of the Confederates have never been reported and no means are known to exist for estimating them . The disparity of the forces engaged was more than enough to overcome the Confederate advantage of position , for Banks had 10,000 men with 38 guns , while Taylor reports but 4,000 men with four batteries , estimated at 24 or 25 guns . To these must be added the Diana , until disabled on Monday morning , and to the Union strength the Clifton , after she arrived and opened fire at long range on Monday afternoon . At Bisland the new headquarters flags were for the first time carried under fire . These distinguishing colors , as prescribed in General Orders on the 18th of February , were guidons four feet square attached to a lance twelve feet long , made for convenience in two joints . In camp or garrison they served to indicate the quarters of the general commanding the corps , division , or brigade , while on the march they were borne near his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flag of the Nineteenth Army Corps was blue with a white four-pointed star in the middle , and on the star the figures 19 in red . From this the division flags differed only in having a red ground and the number of the division in black . The brigade flags had blue , white , and blue horizontal stripes of equal width , with the number of the brigade in black in the white stripe . Thenceforward these colors were borne through every engagement in which the corps took part . Not one of them was ever abandoned by its bearer or taken by the enemy . CHAPTER XI . IRISH BEND . Grover 's instructions were to gain a landing on the shore of Grand Lake , and then marching on Franklin , to cut off Taylor 's retreat or to attack him in the rear , as circumstances might suggest . We have seen how , instead of being ready to move from Berwick Bay on the morning of the 10th of April , Grover found his departure delayed by the various causes already mentioned until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flotilla , under Lieutenant-Commander Cooke , composed of the flag-ships Estrella , Arizona , Clifton , and Calhoun , having completed the ferriage of Emory and Weitzel over Berwick Bay , was now occupied in assisting the army transports to convey Grover to his destination , besides standing ready to protect his movement and his landing with its guns . About noon , when off Cypress Island , the Arizona ran hard and fast aground , and four precious hours were lost in a vain attempt to get her afloat . If , in the light of after events , this may seem like time wasted , it should always be remembered that all four of the gunboats were crowded with troops , while an attack from the Queen of the West and her consorts was to be looked for at any moment . Finally , rather than to put the adventure in peril by a longer delay , Cooke determined to leave the Arizona to take care of herself , and once more steaming ahead , at half-past seven o'clock , the gunboats and transports came to anchor below Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place , known as Oak Lawn , Grover in the orders under which he was acting had been told he might expect to find a good shell road leading straight to the Teche , and crossing the bayou about the middle of the bow called Irish Bend . Grover at once sent Fiske with two companies of the 1st Louisiana ashore in the Clifton 's boats to reconnoitre . It was midnight when , after carefully examining the ground , Fiske returned to the gunboat and reported the road under water , and quite impracticable for all arms . The fleet then got under way , and proceeding about six miles farther up the lake , anchored beyond Magee 's Point . Before daylight Dwight sent two of his staff officers , Captain Denslow and Lieutenant Matthews , ashore , with a small detachment from the 6th New York , to examine the plantation road leading from this point to the Teche . The road being found practicable for all arms , the debarkation began at daybreak . Dwight landed first . As soon as his leading regiment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two companies , under Lieutenant-Colonel Fiske , as skirmishers , and formed the battalion in line to cover the landing . Taylor , when he first learned that the gunboats and transports had passed up Grand Lake , had sent Vincent , with the 2d Louisiana cavalry and a section of Cornay 's battery , to Verdun landing , about four miles behind Camp Bisland , to observe and oppose the movement . This was about noon on Sunday , the 12th . In the evening , hearing of the progress of the fleet , Taylor sent a second section of Cornay 's battery to the lake , and going himself to Vincent ordered him to follow the movement and try to prevent a landing . The next morning Taylor sent Reily with the 4th Texas , to join Vincent and aid him in retarding Grover 's progress . Taylor seems to have censured Vincent for letting Grover land , yet in truth Vincent was not to blame . The line he had to watch was too long for his numbers , and the Union flotilla could and did move more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads . When he had stationed his pickets at the probable landing-places , and taken up a central position to support them , he had done all that lay in his power . The range and weight of the 9-inch shells of the navy were alone enough to put a serious opposition to the landing out of the question , but as soon as Vincent found where the attempt was to be made , he disposed his men and guns to retard it . Two of Cornay 's guns even tried , ineffectually of course , to destroy the transports : Cooke quickly drove them off . As Holcomb 's skirmishers deployed they were met by a brisk fusillade from Vincent 's men strongly posted in ambush behind a high fence in the thick wood that skirts the shore ; but when Holcomb advanced his battalion Vincent 's men fell back on their main body and left the wood to Holcomb , who immediately moved to the edge of the clearing and held it , observing the enemy on the farther border . This was Vincent with his regiment and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was happening on the lake shore passed unseen by the Confederates . Meanwhile the landing went on very slowly , for the transports could not come nearer to the beach than a hundred yards , and , although the foot-soldiers were able to jump overboard and scramble ashore , and the horses could also take to the water , it was necessary to make a bridge of flats for the guns and caissons of the artillery . Thus it was four o'clock in the afternoon before the whole division found itself assembled on the plantation of Duncan McWilliams on the shore of the lake , with the Teche at the upper reach of Irish Bend four miles to the southward , and Charenton in the hollow of Indian Bend lying but two miles toward the southwest . There were roads in either direction , but Irish Bend was the way to Franklin , and to Franklin Grover was under orders to go . About nine o'clock in the morning Dwight had borrowed from Birge his two leading regiments , the 13th Connecticut and the 159th New York , to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery and Barrett 's troop of cavalry . Toward noon , moving a detachment by his left , Dwight seized the bridge that crosses the Teche in approaching Madame Porter 's plantation from the northward , just in time to extinguish the flames that Vincent 's men had lighted to destroy it . After seizing the bridge at Oak Lawn , Barrett galloped down the left bank of the Teche and seized the bridge a mile or two below , by which the same small plantation is reached from the eastward ; probably by the shell road that Grover had been told to take , and at which he had tried to land . Barrett was in time to save the bridge from Vincent , and to hold the advantage thus gained Dwight soon sent Holcomb with the 1st Louisiana , 131st New York , 6th New York , 22d Maine , and Closson 's battery . Meanwhile , the division being entirely without wagons , save a few that were loaded with the reserve ammunition , still another wait took place while the men 's haversacks were being filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having their effect upon Grover 's own calculations . He now knew nothing of Banks 's movements or his situation . Of his own movements he was bound to suppose that Taylor had received early and full information . Moreover , the topography of the country where Grover found himself was obscure and to him unknown . Instead , therefore , of marching forward as fast as his troops could land , boldly and at all hazards to seize the roads by which Taylor must retreat , Grover now took counsel with prudence and concealing his force behind the natural screen of the wood , waited till his whole division should be fully ready . Thus it was six o'clock and the sun stood low among the tree-tops when Grover , with Birge and Kimball , took up the line of march for the Teche . Crossing the upper of the two bridges , he went into bivouac on the right bank on the plantation of Madame Porter , and called in Dwight 's detachment . Before setting out to rejoin the division Holcomb burned the lower bridge , under orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper bridge at a late hour of the night . In Grover 's front stood Vincent alone , for Reily had not yet come ; but in the darkness it was impossible for Grover to make out the enemy 's force , or even to find his exact position . When about nine o'clock that night , as related in the last chapter , Taylor heard the news from Reily , he supposed Grover to be already in strong possession of the only road by which the Confederates could make good their retreat up the Teche ; yet desperate as the situation seemed , Taylor at once made up his mind to try to extricate himself from the toils . Sending his wagon train ahead , soon after midnight he silently moved out of the lines of Bisland and marched rapidly on Franklin , leaving Green to cover the rear and retard the pursuit . These dispositions made , Taylor himself rode at once to his reversed front , a mile east of Franklin . With him were Reily , whom he had picked up on the road below Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still watching Grover , and Clack 's Louisiana battalion , which had come in from New Iberia just in the nick of time . The plantation with the sugar-house , then belonging to McKerrall , is now known as Shaffer 's . The grounds of Oak Lawn adjoin it toward the east and north , and along its western boundary stand Nerson 's Woods , whence the coming battle takes the name given to it in the Confederate accounts . Here , beneath the trees , along their eastern skirt and behind a stout fence , Taylor formed his line of battle , facing toward the east , and waited for the coming of Grover . South of the bayou road stood Clack ; on his left , two pieces of Cornay 's battery , next Reily , then Vincent with a second section of Cornay 's guns . The task before them was simple but desperate . They were to hold off Grover until all but they had safely passed behind the living barrier . Then they were to extricate themselves as best they could , and falling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make good their own escape . Before this could happen , Grover might overwhelm them or Banks might overtake them ; yet there was no other way . As early on the morning of Tuesday the 14th of April as it was light enough to see , Grover marched on Franklin by the winding bayou road . Preceded by Barrett and a strong line of skirmishers , Birge with Rodgers 's battery led the column ; Dwight with Closson 's battery , followed ; while Kimball with Nims 's battery brought up the rear . The head of Grover 's column had gone about two miles , and in a few moments more would have turned the sharp corner of the bayou and faced toward Franklin , when , on the right , near the sugar-house , Birge 's skirmishers ran into those of Clack 's battalion , and the battle of Irish Bend began . Between Birge and the concealed Confederate ranks , past which he was in fact marching , while his line of direction gave his right flank squarely to the hostile front , lay the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young sugar-cane stood a foot high above the deep and wide furrows . From recent ploughing and still more recent rains the fat soil was soft and heavy under foot , and here and there the cross-furrows , widening and deepening into a ditch , added to the toil and difficulty of movement , both for men and guns . On the left flowed the dark and sluggish Teche . On the right lay the swamp , thickly overgrown and nearly impassable , whence the waters of the Choupique begin to ooze toward the Gulf . Along the southern border of this morass ran a great transverse ditch that carried off the gathered seepage of the lesser drains . In front , on the western edge of the cane-field , stood Nerson 's woods , where , as yet unseen , the Confederates lay in wait ; while before them , like a screen , stretched a low fringe of brake and undergrowth . Birge 's order of march placed the 25th Connecticut in the advance , one wing deployed as skirmishers across the road , the other wing in reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rodgers 's battery , then the 159th New York , then the remainder of Rodgers 's battery , while the 13th Connecticut brought up the rear . When he saw his skirmishers briskly engaged and by the sound and smoke discovered the position of the enemy , Birge made the reserved battalion of the 25th Connecticut change front forward and move across the field against the Confederate left . Bissell led his men quickly to within a hundred yards of the wood , where they lay down under the partial cover of a ditch and began firing . Hubbard , with the 26th Maine , came up on Bissell 's left and took up the same tactics . At once the enfilade fire of the Confederate line became vigorous and annoying , until Bradley took his two guns at a gallop to the skirt of the undergrowth opposite the interval between the infantry battalions and , opening fire at five hundred yards ' range , engaged for a time the whole attention of the Confederate cannoneers . Then Grover , who rode with Birge , sent in the 159th New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders to take the wood , while the 13th Connecticut , marching round the bend of the bayou , formed on the extreme left between the stream and the road . Molineux promptly deployed his regiment , and gallantly led it forward at the double-quick over and beyond the left of the line already formed , until the men were within short point-blank range of the enemy 's musketry ; there , finding them exhausted by the rapid advance over the rough and heavy ground , as well as suffering severely from the bullets of the enemy , he made the men throw off their blankets and overcoats , lie down , and open a vigorous fire . Perhaps under the stress of this , but more probably in preparation for the counter-attack , the Confederates slackened their fire , and Molineux , perceiving his opportunity , as it seemed , was in the act of uttering the command " Forward ! " when a bullet struck him in the mouth and he fell , painfully wounded , leaving the command of the regiment , for the time , to Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burt was with Grover , serving on the staff . At the word the men sprang to their feet , but before the command could be carried out , suddenly came the crisis of the battle . About seven o'clock , Gray had brought up the 28th Louisiana to Taylor 's aid , and with it the news that the rest of the forces from Bisland were close at hand and all was well with them . Under cover of the wood , Taylor moved Gray quietly to the left , and perceiving that his line now overlapped Grover 's right , promptly determined to gain the brief time he still needed for the safe retreat of his main body by a bold and vigorous attack with the whole force he had under his hand . The order was obeyed with spirit . Out of the wood beyond the right , and from the main ditch , well in the rear of the 159th , the Confederates came charging strongly , and halting , they poured in a hot volley . Seeing that the situation was critical Dayton ordered the regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , yet in good order , to the road . There it promptly re-formed on its colors , and Burt rejoining took command . In their retreat the New Yorkers swept over the position of the 26th Maine and the 25th Connecticut and carried these already shaken regiments with them , in some natural disorder ; but his lasted hardly longer than was needed for Dwight to hear and obey the command that now came back from Grover , to deploy the first brigade and take up the broken battle . Bradley held his ground stoutly to the last moment , and when finally the choice was narrowed to retreat or capture , he retired in good order to a fresh position , and there serving his canister with coolness and deliberation , held off the enemy 's advance . At this point , Rodgers , who with his centre section was in the road on the left , engaged at 800 and 400 yards with Cornay 's right section , turned his attention to the Confederate infantry on the right , and crossing with spherical case-shot the canister fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment when Taylor 's left was thus roughly bearing down the right of Birge , on his left his own 13th Connecticut , under Lieutenant-Colonel Warner , enveloped in a grove , was moving steadily on the Confederate right , where Clack stood and the two guns of Cornay . Emerging from the grove into an open field that still lay between them and the enemy in the wood , Warner 's men instantly replied to the volleys of cannon and small-arms that greeted their appearance and pushed on , firing as they went . More fortunate than their comrades in the direction and the moment of their attack , they pressed back Clack , drove off Cornay 's guns , and took two of his caissons , a limber , and a color presented to his battery by the ladies of Franklin . Nearly 60 prisoners at the same time fell into their hands . They were still advancing when Grover 's orders recalled them to the restored line of battle of the brigade . As Birge 's right retired , Dwight deployed in two lines , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 22d Maine , 1st Louisiana , and 131st New York in support , and advancing against Taylor 's left flank and overlapping it in its turn pushed it back into and beyond the woods . In this movement Dwight took 70 prisoners . The resistance he encountered was feeble compared with the vigor with which Birge had been met and turned back , for in that effort the Confederate line of battle had practically gained its main object and had now only to extricate itself and make good its own withdrawal . Birge , at the same time that he drew back the 13th Connecticut , once more moved forward his three other regiments and re-formed the brigade in two lines on Dwight 's left . Kimball , whose brigade was in two lines in reserve , brought up the 12th Maine to the support of the 13th Connecticut . This done , Grover advanced the whole division through the woods to the open fields on their farther or western verge , and seeing the Confederates in force on the knoll beyond , to which they had retired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right flank of the last Confederate position Semmes brought up the Diana , whose injuries of the day before he had during the night partly made good by repairs . Her 30-pounder Parrott now opened a slow fire without great effect other than to add to Grover 's caution . Shortly after eight o'clock Mouton rode up . To him Taylor turned over the command of the force confronting Grover , and then rode into Franklin to direct the retreat . By half-past nine Green with the rear-guard moved out on the direct road toward New Iberia . The last of Green 's troopers had not quitted the little town at the upper end when the first of Weitzel 's entered at the lower end . Some time passed before Mouton knew of this . Then for a brief space his peril was great ; but fortunately for him the unlooked-for situation of affairs raised a momentary doubt in the minds of Green 's pursuers . Should they go to the right or to the left ? And where was Grover ? After questioning prisoners and townspeople , Banks directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move up the bayou . The interval , short as it was , enabled Mouton to fall back quickly , and taking a by-way across country to strike into the cut-off road beyond the northern outskirts of Franklin . Not an instant too soon , for in the confusion Sibley had fired the bridge over the Choupique and across the blazing timbers lay Mouton 's last hope of escape . Hardly had his men reached the north bank in safety when Weitzel 's advance guard came in sight down the road . They galloped to the bridge only to find it impassable . Before retiring the Confederates blew up the Diana and applied the match to all their transport steamers on the Teche save the hospital boat , the Cornie , which loaded with the sick and wounded of Bisland fell into the hands of the Union forces . Captain Semmes , who had but the day before left his battery to command the Diana , was taken prisoner , with all his crew . He and Weitzel had been friends and classmates at West Point ; he now refused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , finding himself rather loosely guarded , cleverly managed to regain his liberty . To return to Grover . The situation of the enemy 's force in his front , the vigorous resistance encountered in his advance , and lastly , the information gathered from the prisoners he had taken , had convinced him that he had to deal with Taylor 's whole force , save a small rear-guard , and that Taylor had already succeeded in passing him , so that it was no longer possible to cut the Confederate line of retreat . Indeed , Grover seems rather to have thought that Taylor meant to attack him . It was while careful reconnoissances were being conducted to develop the true facts that Taylor slipped away , as we have seen , having thus adroitly extricated himself from the net spread in his sight . About two o'clock , however , as Taylor did not attack , Grover moved forward , and as he marched down the bayou road soon met Emory coming up , as related in the last chapter . Banks , seeing that the bridge could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be gained by marching his tired troops over the long roundabout of the bayou road , went into bivouac early in the afternoon , covering the northern approaches of Franklin . Grover occupied his battle-field of the morning , Emory held the bayou road between Grover and the town , and Weitzel the cut-off road . Taylor crossed the Cypremort and having marched fifteen miles since quitting Franklin , or twenty-five since midnight , rested near Jeannerette . Grover reported his loss during the 13th , 14th , and 17th as 53 killed , 270 wounded , and 30 captured or missing ; in all 353 . In the battle of Irish Bend , according to the nominal lists as complied in the Official Records , his loss was 6 officers and 43 men killed , 17 officers and 257 men wounded , and 30 men missing ; in all 353 ; agreeing with the first statement covering the three days , yet differing slightly in the details . Of this total Dwight 's brigade lost 3 killed and 9 wounded on the 13th , 1 killed and 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 wounded in the battle . Both statements seem to leave out the 1st Louisiana , which had 2 men killed and the lieutenant-colonel and 2 men wounded on the 13th . In Birge 's brigade the loss in the battle , according to Grover 's report , was 46 killed , 236 wounded , 49 missing ; in all 312 . The official reports show 16 less in the columns of wounded and in the total : these are probably the 16 wounded officers accounted for in the nominal lists . Of the regiments engaged the heaviest loss fell upon the 159th New York , in which the nominal lists show 4 officers and 15 men killed , 5 officers and 73 men wounded , and 20 men captured or missing ; in all 117. ( 1 ) But this fine regiment suffered even more severely than these figures indicate , for besides having to mourn the death of the gallant and promising Draper , Molineux received a grievous wound that for many weeks deprived the regiment of one of the best colonels in the service , while of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Birge 's loss was nearly one man in four or five , for his strength did not exceed 1,500 , and it is probable that his fighting line numbered not more than 1,200 . The Confederate loss is not reported . They left on the field , to be cared for by their adversary , 21 of their dead and 35 of their wounded . Among these were Gray , Vincent , and Reily . Taylor gives the number of his infantry engaged in the charge on Birge 's right as less than 1,000 . The disparity of the opposing forces in that affair was , therefore , not important , and Birge 's somewhat greater numbers may fairly be considered as off-set by the advantages of Taylor 's position and the familiarity with the country common to nearly all the Confederate soldiers there engaged , while to their antagonists it was an unknown land . Grover 's whole force was about 5,000 , of all arms , but of these , though all are to be taken into account , nearly a third were in reserve , neither firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so light that its loss was no more than one per cent . of its numbers  --  hardly more than it had suffered in the skirmishes of the day before . Grover had eighteen pieces of artillery , of which but four were in action ; Taylor also had four guns of which he made good use , and these , toward the close of the battle , were reinforced by the five heavy guns of the Diana , of which , however , it is probable that but one , or at most two , could be brought to bear . The field of battle was so contracted that Taylor 's strength sufficed to occupy its front , while Grover was hindered or prevented from deploying a force large enough to outflank and crush his antagonist at a blow . Viewed from a Confederate standpoint , the issue forms an instructive example of the great results that may be achieved by a right use of small forces . If , on the other hand , one turns to consider the lost opportunity of Grover , two things stand out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing forces , too large for the affair in hand or for the scene of operations ; the other , that bold adventures must be carried boldly to the end . Instead of making the campaign with four brigades and twenty-four guns , as Weitzel 's original plan had contemplated , Banks , for greater security , set out with seven brigades and fifty-six guns . So far as concerned the main body ascending the Teche , this excess of strength could do no harm , but it was otherwise with the turning column by the lake ; for to the needless augmentation of the artillery were directly due not only the day and night first lost , but also the still more precious hours of daylight consumed in landing guns that were not to fire a shot . Two brigades of infantry , with six guns at most , landing at Indian Bend , and marching directly toward the Cypremort , and quickly entrenching across both roads at or near their upper fork , would have been enough to hold the position against the best efforts of the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and thus Taylor must have been lost and the war in Western Louisiana brought to an end . Consequences many and far-reaching would have followed . Moreover , when it was determined to use more than two divisions one of these was naturally Grover 's , and thus it happened that to Grover , who knew nothing of the country , was assigned the delicate duty first cut out for Weitzel , while Weitzel , who had studied to the last point every detail of the topography and of the plan , stayed behind as the third in command of the column destined to butt its nose against the breastworks of Bisland and wait for the real work to be done a day 's march on their farther side . Grover has been often criticised and much misunderstood for alleged over-caution and for taking the wrong direction after quitting the borders of the lake . Both criticisms are unjust . Generals , like other men , act according to their temperaments . In the whole war no braver man than Grover ever rode at the head of a division , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his duty . No troops of his ever went into battle but he was with them . But he was by nature cautious , and the adventure was essentially one that called for boldness . Moreover , he was by nature conscientious . That his orders , based as they were on misinformation of a date much later than Weitzel 's intelligence , required him to land at Irish Bend instead of at Indian Bend , as first arranged , and to march on Franklin instead of toward the Cypremort , was not his affair . Surely no soldier is to be blamed , least of all in combined and complex operations , for choosing to obey the clearly expressed orders of those set over him , rather than to follow the illusory inspirations of the will-o ' - the- wisp commonly mistaken for genius . As for the orders themselves , they were correct upon the information at hand when they were given and the state of affairs then existing . To land at Madame Porter 's and to seize the roads at Franklin was better than to go farther afield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , and while on the march Grover was enabled to offer his front instead of his flank to the enemy . But the information proved inexact ; when Madame Porter 's road was tried it was found impassable , and with this and the unforeseen delays it happened that the orders became inapplicable . ( 1 ) According to the regimental history ( MS. ) , 4 officers and 22 men killed ; 5 officers and 76 men wounded ; 11 men missing ; in all , 118 : of the wounded , 2 officers and 10 men mortally . CHAPTER XII . OPELOUSAS . Cooke , after detaching the Clifton to go up the Teche after the Diana , as already related , remained at anchor in Grand Lake opposite Grover 's landing-place and awaited developments . He had not long to wait . The first news of Banks 's movement across Berwick Bay had overtaken and recalled Taylor on his way up the Atchafalaya to bring down the Queen of the West and her consorts , the Grand Duke and Mary T , to join in the intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff officer to urge despatch , yet from some cause more than two full days had passed before , on the afternoon of the 13th , the distant smoke of the Confederate gun-boats coming down Lake Chicot was seen by the lookouts of the Union navy in Grand Lake . At daylight the Queen of the West and the Mary T , were seen approaching from Chicot Pass . Cooke at once got the Estrella , Calhoun , and Arizona under way , opened fire at long range , and forming his boats in a crescent began to close with the enemy . Soon , however , the Queen of the West was seen to be in flames , from the explosion of the Union shells , and , her consort having promptly taken to flight , Cooke ceased firing and lowered all his boats to save the crew of the burning vessel from drowning . Captain Fuller , who had formerly commanded the Cotton , was rescued with 90 of his men , but nearly 30 were lost . Then with a loud explosion the eventful career of the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five guns , however , once more in the hands of the Union navy . This fortunate stroke gave the mastery of the Atchafalaya into Cooke 's hands with nothing save Butte-a-la-Rose and two feeble gunboats to hinder his taking possession . Once safely across the Cypremort , Taylor 's army began to melt away and his men , as they passed their homes , to fall out without hindrance . Many were of the simple class called Acadians , with scant sympathy for either side of the great war into which they found themselves drawn , and in all the regiments there were many conscripts . On the 15th of April , Taylor marched ten miles to New Iberia . While there , he had the unfinished ironclad gunboat Stevens , previously known as the Hart , floated two miles down the Teche , destroyed by fire , and the wreck sunk in the channel . On the 16th he marched twenty miles , crossed the Vermilion River , went into camp on high ground on the north bank , and burned the bridges behind him . Early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pursuit with his united force , now outnumbering Taylor 's as three to one . Weitzel led the advance of the main column on the direct road . Emory followed him , and Grover marching at first on the bayou road fell in the rear after passing the fork . The army halted for the night at Jeannerette . On the following afternoon Banks entered New Iberia . Here the ways parted , the right-hand road by Saint Martinville following for many miles the windings of the Teche , while the left-hand road leads almost directly to Opelousas , by way of Vermilionville , now called Lafayette . Beyond Indian Bend the lowlands , in many places below and nowhere much above the level of the adjacent waters , may be said to end and the plains to begin ; and soon after leaving New Iberia and Saint Martinville the troops found themselves on the broad prairies of Western Louisiana , where the rich grasses that flourish in the light soil sustain almost in a wild state vast herds of small yet fat beeves and of small yet strong horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advantage ; where the ground , gently undulating , gradually rises as one travels northward ; where the streams become small rivers that drain the land upon their borders , instead of merely bayous taking the back waters of the Mississippi and the Red . Near the right bank of the Teche runs even a narrow ribbon of bluffs that may be said to form the western margin of the great swamps of the Atchafalaya . Along the streams live-oaks , magnolias , pecans , and other trees grow luxuriantly ; but , for the most part , the prairies are open to the horizon , and at this time , though the gin-houses were full of cotton , the fields were mainly given over to the raising of corn for the armies and the people of the Confederacy . From New Iberia Banks ordered Grover to send a detachment to destroy the famous Avery salt-works , on Petit Anse Island , distant about twelve miles toward the southwest . On the 17th of April , Grover accordingly dispatched Kimball on this errand , with his 12th Maine , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Snow 's section of Nims 's battery . The extremely rich natural deposit of rock salt was , at that time , in the hands of the Confederate government , being , indeed , the main source of supply of this indispensable article for the whole Confederacy , especially for the region between the Mississippi and the Atlantic . The works required for its extraction are , however , very simple , for the deposit lies close to the surface , and has only to be quarried in blocks of convenient size . These , always as clear and beautiful as crystal , have only to be crushed or broken to be ready to use for common purposes , and when pulverized , however rudely , yield the finest table salt . Kimball burned all the buildings , destroyed the engines and implements , with six hundred barrels of salt , and marched back to New Iberia , and , on the 19th , rejoined Grover on the Vermilion . The Confederates having drawn off the detachment and the guns previously posted to guard the works , Kimball met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the main body of his division , reinforced by Gooding 's brigade , temporarily commanded by Colonel John W. Kimball , of the 53d Massachusetts , continued the pursuit toward Vermilion , while Banks , with Weitzel and Emory , marched to Saint Martinville , on the Teche . Early in the afternoon Grover caught sight of Green 's rear-guard of Taylor 's retreating forces , then about two miles distant , and in the act of crossing the Vermilion . Before Grover could overtake them , the bridges were in flames . Dwight 's skirmishers deployed on the right and left of the road , and , with the help of the guns of Closson and Nims , drove off the enemy , posted to hinder or prevent the work of reconstruction . In this affair Dwight lost one killed and five wounded . The next day , the 18th of April , was spent by Grover in rebuilding the main bridge . Then began to be felt the need of such a force of mounted troops as on these plains formed the main strength of Taylor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Banks 's cavalry , taken as a whole , with some splendid exceptions , was at this time greatly inferior , not only in numbers but in fitness for the work at hand , to the rough riders led by the restless and indomitable Green . A few more horsemen , under leaders like Barrett , Williamson , and Perkins , would have saved the bridge and insured the dispersion or the destruction of Taylor 's force . Weitzel , who , as far as Saint Martinville , had led the advance of the main column , followed by Emory with Paine and Ingraham , there took the road to the left and halted on the evening of the 17th of April at Cote Gelee , four miles in the rear of Grover . The next morning Weitzel moved up to Grover 's support , while Banks , with Emory , rested at Cote Gelee to await the rebuilding of the bridge . From St. Martinville , Emory sent the 173d New York , under Major Gallway , with Norris 's section of Duryea 's battery , to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bayou steamboats , five in number , that were still left to the Confederates . Five miles below the village of that name , Gallway met a small Confederate picket , and pushing it aside , soon afterward found the bridge over the bayou in flames . On the morning of the 18th he learned that four of the boats had been burned by the Confederates , and about the same time his farther advance was stopped by orders from Banks , despatched as soon as it was known that Grover had been brought to a stand . A courier from headquarters having lost his way in the night of the 18th , on the following morning Gallway found himself in the air without any apparent object . He accordingly marched along the banks of the Teche and the Bayou Fusilier , and taking the road to Opelousas , there rejoined Paine on the 1st . On the 19th of April the army crossed the Vermilion and the Carencro , and marched unopposed sixteen miles over the prairie to Grand Coteau . Gooding 's brigade rejoined Emory during the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Opelousas . Just outside the town the Corps went into bivouac , after throwing forward all the cavalry , the 13th Connecticut , and a section of Rodgers 's battery , to Washington , on the Courtableau . On the same day , after a brief engagement , Cooke , with the gunboats Estrella , Arizona , and Calhoun , and a detachment of four companies of the 16th New Hampshire from Brashear , captured Fort Burton at Butte-a-la-Rose , with its garrison of 60 men of the Crescent regiment and its armament of two 32-pounders ; thus at last gaining the complete control of the Atchafalaya , and at the same time opening communication with Banks by way of Port Barre or Barre 's Landing on the Courtableau , distant about nine miles northeasterly from Opelousas . Then Cooke steamed up the Atchafalaya to make his report to Farragut , lying in the Mississippi off the mouth of the Red River , and to seek fresh orders . At the outset of the campaign the 16th New Hampshire had been detached from Ingraham 's brigade of Emory and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage . After the battle of Bisland , the 4th Massachusetts was turned back to Brashear to relieve the 16th New Hampshire . This regiment having assisted in the capture of Butte-a-la-Rose , now formed the garrison of that desolate and deadly hummock . While at Opelousas the army could draw its supplies from Brashear by the Atchafalaya and the Courtableau , but so long as the direction of the future operations remained uncertain , it was necessary to keep a firm hold of the communications by the Teche . Accordingly , the 175th New York took post at Franklin and the 22d Maine at New Iberia . On the 22d of April the 162d New York , under Blanchard , with a section of the 1st Maine battery and one troop of the 2d Rhode Island cavalry , marched to Barre 's Landing , seized the position , and captured the little steamboat Ellen , the last of the Teche fleet . On the 23d of April the little Cornie arrived at Barre 's Landing from the depot at Brashear , and the next day the first wagon-train came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the white-covered wagons winding over the plain , the men gave way to those demonstrations of delight so familiar to all who have ever seen soldiers rejoice . For fifteen days they had been subsisting upon an uncertain issue of hard bread , coffee , and salt , eked out by levies , more or less irregular , upon the countryside . They were sick of chickens and cornbread , and fairly loathed the very sight , to say nothing of the smell , of fresh-killed beef ; tough at best , even in the heart of the tenderloin , the flesh had to be eaten with the odor and the warmth of the blood still in it , under penalty of finding it fly-blown before the next meal . Thus it was that , as Paine relates in his Diary , the men now " howled for salt pork and hard tack . " Although the army had now a double line of communication with its base , yet the long haul from New Iberia and the scarcity of light-draught steamboats adapted to the navigation of the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent wants of the troops both tedious and difficult . The herds near Opelousas were fast disappearing under the ravages of the foragers , authorized and unauthorized , yet had it not been for the beef obtained from this source and for the abundant grass of the prairie men and horses must soon have suffered greatly . On the 24th of April , Banks reviewed his army in the open plain , near Opelousas . The troops , not as yet inured to the long and hard marches , were indeed greatly diminished in numbers by the unaccustomed toil and exposure , as well as by the casualties of battle and the enervating effects of the climate , yet they presented a fine appearance , and were in the best of spirits . On learning of Cooke 's success at Butte-a-la-Rose , Banks detached Dwight , posted him at Washington in observation , and placed Grover with his remaining brigades at Barre 's Landing , to secure the depots , while Emory and Weitzel covered Opelousas . Having by burning the Vermilion bridge gained a day 's rest for his tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17th of April , and passing through Opelousas and Washington on the 18th and 19th , on the following day found himself with all his trains behind the Cocodrie and the Boeuf . On the 20th he sent Mouton , with all the cavalry except Waller 's battalion , westward over the prairie toward Niblett 's Bluff , on the Sabine . Then , with Waller and the frayed remnant of the infantry , day by day wearing away at the edges , Taylor continued his retreat toward Alexandria , halting with what may be called his main body at Lecompte . To hinder the pursuit he burned the bridges over the Bayou Cocodrie and the Bayou Boeuf . Opelousas , miles away from every thing , in the heart of a vast prairie , presented in itself no object for an invading army . Even the temptation of a good position was wanting . Banks meant merely to halt there a day or two for rest , and then , if it should be found practicable to obtain the necessary supplies , to push on rapidly to Alexandria , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether this could have been done will never be known , for although the army had now far outmarched its supplies , and even from its secondary base at Brashear was separated by nearly a hundred miles , and although the campaign had so far been made upon less than half the regular rations for men and animals , supplemented from farm , sugar-house , and prairie , the country on the line of march was no longer to be counted on for any thing save sugar in plenty and a little corn ; nevertheless , it might have been possible , by great exertions , to replenish the trains and depots , as well as to fill up the haversacks . Moreover , a three days ' march would find the army on the banks of Red River , with a new and ample source of supply open to them , and within easy reach of Grant , provided only the navy might be counted upon to control the waters of that stream and its larger tributaries . Of this Banks had no doubt whatever . To open communication with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends that Banks had proposed to himself in setting out on the campaign . These ends he now held almost in his hand . But on the 21st of April an event occurred that , slight as was its apparent importance , was destined , in the train of consequences , vitally to affect the operations of the Army of the Gulf . This was the arrival at headquarters of Lieutenant Joseph T. Tenney , one of Dudley 's aides-de-camp , who had been sent by Augur to find Banks , wherever he might be . With him Tenney brought important despatches from Grant and Farragut . What the contents were and what came of them will be related in the next chapter . From Opelousas Bean , with the 4th Wisconsin , a section of Duryea 's battery , and a squadron of the 2d Rhode Island cavalry , went a day 's march toward the southwest , to the crossing of the Plaquemine Brule , and discovered that Mouton was retreating beyond the Mermentau . From Washington , Dwight moved out twenty miles along the Bayou Boeuf to Satcham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning these things , on the 25th of April , Banks turned over the command of the forces to Emory and went to New Orleans to give his attention to affairs of urgency , chiefly affecting the civil administration of the department . He returned to headquarters in the field on the evening of the 1st of May . Meanwhile Emory sent Paine , who , when crossing the Carencro , had seen the last of the Confederates disappearing in the distance , with his brigade and a section of Duryea 's battery far out on the Plaquemine Brule road , in order to find and disperse some cavalry , vaguely reported to be moving about somewhere in that quarter , a constant menace to the long trains from New Iberia . In fact Mouton , with the Texans , was now on the prairie , beyond the Calcasieu eighty miles away , in good position to retreat to Texas or to hang on the flank and rear of the Union army , as circumstances might suggest . On the 26th of April Paine marched sixteen miles to the Plaquemine Brule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseback twenty miles farther toward the southwest across Bayou Queue de Tortue , and another detachment to Bayou Mallet to reconnoitre . Seeing nothing of the enemy , on the 28th Paine rejoined his division and resumed the command of it at Opelousas . Some time before this orders had been given to mount the 4th Wisconsin , and when the army finally marched from Opelousas this capital regiment made its appearance in the new role of mounted infantry . To say nothing of the equipments , a wide divergence in the size , color , and quality of the horses , hastily gathered from the four quarters of the prairie , gave to these improvised dragoons rather a ludicrous appearance it must be confessed ; yet marching afoot or standing to horse , the 4th Wisconsin was always ready and equal to the work cut out for it . From his advanced camp , on Shields 's plantation , twenty-three miles beyond Washington and twenty-nine from Opelousas , Dwight fell back on the 28th of April to his bivouac at Washington and waited for the movement of the army to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1st of May , Bean , with the 4th Wisconsin , mounted , was sent forward to join the main body of the cavalry , under Major Robinson , in front of Washington . That night Dwight , with the cavalry , his own brigade , and a section of Nims 's battery , marched out some distance to discover the position of the Confederate outposts . These , in the interval that elapsed , had been advanced to the junction of the Cocodrie and the Boeuf . After driving them in Dwight returned the next morning to Washington . The advance of the column from Franklin to Opelousas had been disfigured by the twin evils of straggling and marauding . Before the campaign opened , Banks had taken the precaution to issue stringent orders against pillage , yet no means adequate to the enforcement of these orders were provided , and the marches were so long and rapid , the heat at times so intense , and the dust so intolerable , that comparatively few of the men were able to keep up with the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious kind . One regiment , neither the best nor the worst , halting at the end of a particularly hard day 's march , found itself with scarcely fifty men in the ranks . Then , too , the men were on short rations , in what they considered the enemy 's country ; the whole region was sparsely populated ; and the residents had , for the most part , fled from their homes at the news of the approach of the Union army . With these disorders there sprang up a third , less prevalent indeed , but to the last degree annoying and not without its share of danger , for when the straggler chanced to find himself in easy range of any thing , from a steer to a chicken , that he happened to fancy for his supper , he was not always careful in his aim or accurate in his judgment of distance ; thus a number of officers and men were wounded and the lives of many put in peril . As if to complete the lesson so often taught in all wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand , when the army moved out from Opelousas , though but a fortnight later , a different state of things was seen . This must be ascribed to the fact that immediately after entering Opelousas the most stringent and careful orders were given for the regulation of future marches , and the punishment of stragglers and marauders . By these orders was provided for the first time a system adequate to their enforcement , and sufficiently elastic to meet without annoyance and difficulty all those cases , of hourly and even momentary occurrence in the movement of an army , that require officers or men to quit the column . In the rear of each regiment was posted a surgeon , without whose permission no sick man was allowed to fall out . In the rear of each brigade and division marched a detachment of cavalry , under the orders of the provost marshal of the brigade or division , charged with the duty of picking up as stragglers all men found out of the ranks without a written permit from the surgeon or the company commander . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally impressed upon the division and brigade commanders ; yet this was not now necessary , for there were but few persons in the column of any rank that did not realize , in part at least , the evil consequences resulting from the irregular practices that had hitherto prevailed . Thus the march to the Red River was made rapidly and in order , and now for the first time the soldiers of the Nineteenth Army Corps marched with that swift and regulated movement of the column as a unit that was to be ever afterwards a source of comfort to the men , of satisfaction to their officers , and of just pride to every one belonging to the corps . Unhappily , on the 25th of April , before the result of these arrangements had had a chance to show themselves , Dwight , while on detached service in the advance , caught an unfortunate man of the 131st New York , Henry Hamill by name , absent from his regiment under circumstances that pointed him out as a plunderer . Then , without pausing to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trial and judgment on the spot , and becoming satisfied of the man 's guilt , caused him to be shot to death at sunset in front of the brigade . This action Banks , who was just setting out for New Orleans , sustained in special orders as soon as he returned . Indeed , between this course and the instant delivery of Dwight to punishment , Banks had practically no choice . Nevertheless , whatever may have been the excuse or how extreme the provocation , the act was altogether wrong . The rules and articles of war lay down the penal code of armies in all its severity , in terms too clear to be misunderstood and too ample to warrant an attempt on the part of any one in the service , however exalted his rank , to enlarge or evade them . The offender should have been tried by court-martial . No emergency or exigency existed to delay the assembling of the court . Had he been found guilty , his death might swiftly have followed . Then the terrible lesson would have been impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violent , or unlawful . As it was , the wretched man 's punishment furnished chiefly matter for regret , and an example to be avoided . CHAPTER XIII . BANKS AND GRANT . The first effect of the despatches from Grant and Farragut , referred to in the preceding chapter , was to cause Banks to reconsider his plan of campaign , and to put the direction of his next movement in suspense . While waiting for fresh advices in answer to his own communications and proposals Banks halted , and while he halted Taylor got time to breathe and Kirby Smith to gather new strength . This correspondence has been so much discussed , yet so little understood , that , chronology being an essential part of history , the narrative of the events now at hand may be rendered clearer , if we turn aside for a moment to consider not only the substance of what was said upon both sides , but , what was even more important , the time at which it was heard . Farragut 's letter , written from the Hartford above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first communication Banks had received from Farragut , save a brief verbal message brought to him by the Admiral 's secretary , Mr. E. C. Gabaudan , on the 10th of April , just before the army set out from Brashear . Mr. Gabaudan had come straight from the Admiral , but without any thing in writing , having floated past Port Hudson by night in a skiff covered with twigs so as to look like a drift log . Farragut 's letter gave assurance of the complete control of the Red River and the Atchafalaya by the navy of the Union . Grant 's despatch bore date the 23d of March . It was the first writing received from him . It conveyed the answer to the letter addressed to him by Banks on the 13th of March , and placed in the hands of Farragut just before the Hartford ran the batteries of Port Hudson . Thus on either side began a correspondence clearly intended by both commanders to bring about an effective co-operation between the two armies , aided by the combined fleets of Farragut and Porter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Army by the Tennessee , upon the Army of the Gulf the practical effect , after the first period of delay and doubt , was to cause its commander to give up the thought of moving toward Grant and to conform all his movements to the expectation that Grant would send an army corps to Bayou Sara to join in reducing Port Hudson . Thus , quite apart from the confusion and the eventual disappointment , much valuable time was lost while the matter was in suspense ; and so was demonstrated once more the impossibility , well established by the history of war , of co-ordinating the operations of two armies widely separated , having different objectives , while an enemy strongly holds the country between them . When Banks wrote his despatch of the 13th of March , he was at Baton Rouge , about to demonstrate against Port Hudson . When Grant received this despatch he was on the low land opposite Vicksburg , with the rising river between him and his enemy , laboriously seeking a practical pathway to the rear of Vicksburg , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seventy thousand men to stand on . Grant 's first idea , derived from Halleck 's despatches , was that Banks should join him before Vicksburg , with the whole available force of the Army of the Gulf . When he learned from Banks that this would be out of the question so long as Port Hudson should continue to be held by the Confederates , Grant took up the same line of thought that had already attracted Banks , and began to meditate a junction by the Atchafalaya , the Red , the Tensas , and the Black rivers . What Grant then needed was not more troops , but standing-room for those he had . Accordingly , he began by preparing to send twenty thousand men to Banks , when the Ohio River steamers he had asked for should come. ( 1 ) They never came , yet even after he had embarked upon the campaign , alike sound in conception and splendid in execution , that was to become the corner-stone of his great and solid fame , Grant kept to his purpose . On the 14th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am concentrating my forces at Grand Gulf ; will send an army corps Bayou Sara by the 25th , to co-operate with you on Port Hudson . Can you aid me and send troops after the reduction of Port Hudson to assist me at Vicksburg ? " This message , although Banks and Grant were then only about two hundred miles apart , had to travel three thousand miles to reach its destination . Banks received it just before marching from Opelousas on the 5th of May , twenty-one days after it left Grant 's hands . As received , the message was in cipher and without a date . As the prevailing practice was , in conformity with the orders of the Secretary of War , the only persons in the Department of the Gulf who held the key to the cipher were the Superintendent of Military Telegraphs and such of his assistants as he chose to trust , and Mr. Bulkley was at New Iberia , where the wires ended . The code employed was the route cipher in common use in the service , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara " as guides the meaning was not hard to make out . Banks did not trust to this , however , and waited until , late at night , he received from the Superintendent an official translation , still without date , as indeed was the original document received at headquarters from New Orleans . The 25th Banks naturally took to mean the 25th of May . Grasping eagerly at the first real chance of effective co-operation , he at once replied : " By the 25th probably , by the 1st , certainly , I will be there . " This despatch was not in cipher , because he had no code . Captain Crosby carried it to the Hartford at the mouth of Red River . Captain Palmer , who was found in command , the Admiral having crossed Fausse Point and joined his fleet below , at once forwarded the despatch . Near Natchez Crosby met Captain Uffers of Grant 's staff and turned back with him bringing Grant 's despatch of the 10th of May , written at Rocky Springs . This Banks received at Alexandria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Grant was not coming . Having met the Confederates after landing at Grand Gulf and followed on their heels to the Big Black , he could not afford to retrace his steps ; but he urged Banks to join him or to send all the force he could spare " to co-operate in the great struggle for opening the Mississippi River . " The reasons thus assigned by Grant for his change of mind were certainly valid ; yet it must be doubted whether in these hurried lines the whole of the matter is set forth , for three weeks earlier , on the 19th of April , five days after the promise to send an army corps to Bayou Sara by the 25th , Grant had reported to Halleck : " This will now be impossible . " Moreover , until the moment when he crossed the river with his advance on the 30th of April he not only held firmly to his intention to send the twenty thousand men to join Banks at Bayou Sara as soon as the landing should have been secured , but the corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made up of the main body of McClernand 's corps and McPherson 's , and Grant himself meant to go with it . It was indeed the 2d of May when Grant received at Port Gibson Banks 's despatch sent from Brashear on the 10th of April indicating his purpose of returning to Baton Rouge by the 10th of May , and although Grant also attributes to this despatch the change of his plans , the 10th of May had already come before he made known the change to Banks . All this time Banks bore with him Halleck 's instructions of the 9th of November , and more than once studied with care and solicitude these significant words : " As the ranking general in the Southwest you are authorized to assume the control of any military force from the upper Mississippi which may come within your command . The line of division between your department and that of Major-General Grant is , therefore , left undecided for the present , and you will exercise superior authority as far north as you may ascend the river . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been entitled to the command they gave him , but the words showed him plainly what was expected of him by his government . To the incentives of patriotism and duty were thus superadded one of the most powerful motives that can affect the mind of the commander of an army ,  --  the hope and assurance of power and promotion . If , then , he held back from joining Grant in Mississippi , it was because he hesitated to take the extraordinary risks involved in the movement . In this he was more than justified . Since the miscarriage of Sherman 's attempt at the beginning of the year , Grant had been engaged in a series of tentative efforts , steadily prosecuted in various directions , yet all having a common object , the finding of a foothold of dry ground for a decisive movement against Vicksburg . Four of these experimental operations had failed completely , and Grant was now entering upon a fifth , destined indeed to lead to a great and glorious result , yet in itself conveying hardly more assurance of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perils greater than any that had been so far encountered . Of these , the greatest danger was that the enemy , after allowing him to land on the east bank of the river and to penetrate , with a portion of his army , into the heart of Mississippi , might then concentrate all the available forces of the Confederacy in that region and fall upon him with vigor at the moment when his supplies should be exhausted and his communications interrupted . In such an event the fortune of war might have rendered it imperative for him to retire down the river ; but what would have happened then if Banks , disregarding Port Hudson in his eagerness to join Grant before Vicksburg , should in his turn have abandoned his communications ? Both armies would have been caught in a trap of their own making , whence not merit but some rare stroke of luck could alone have rescued either . In the strong light of the great and decisive victory of Vicksburg , it is scarcely possible to reproduce , even in the mind of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed at the moment of Grant 's landing below Grand Gulf . This phenomenal success was not foreshadowed by any thing that had gone before it , and it would have been the height of imprudence to stake upon it the fate of two armies , the issue of an entire campaign , and the mastery of the Mississippi River , if not the final result of the war . Nor should it be forgotten that Grant himself regarded this movement as experimental , like its forerunners , and that up to the moment he set foot upon the soil of Mississippi , he had formed no conception of the brilliant campaign on which he was about presently to embark . But instead of concentrating and acting with instant determination upon a single plan with a single idea , at the critical moment the Confederates became divided in council , distracted in purpose , and involved in a maze of divergent plans , cross purposes , and conflicting orders . While events caused the Confederate leaders to shift from one plan to the other , with the chances of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his advantage , and thus the campaign was given into his hands . But on the 4th of May these great events were as yet hidden in the unknown future , and when , after waiting thirteen days at Opelousas , Banks began his march on Alexandria , it was with the earnest hope of a speedy meeting of the two Union armies on the Mississippi ; then came the cipher telegram to exalt this hope into a firm and just expectation of finding three weeks later an entire corps from Grant 's army at Bayou Sara , and as Banks mounted his horse to ride toward the head of his column , it was with the fixed purpose of being with his whole force at the appointed place at the appointed time . ( 1 ) " I sent several weeks ago for this class of steamers , and expected them before this . Should they arrive and Admiral Porter get his boats out of the Yazoo , so as to accompany the expedition , I can send a force of say 20,000 effective men to co-operate with General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , March 23d ; received by Banks , April 21st . The cipher message that followed seemed to Banks a confirmation of this . CHAPTER XIV . ALEXANDRIA . Every one was in high spirits at the prospect of meeting the Army of the Tennessee , and , to add to the general good-humor , just before quitting Opelousas two pieces of good news became known . Grierson rode into Baton Rouge on the 2d of May at the head of his own 6th Illinois and Prince 's 7th Illinois cavalry , together 950 horse . Leaving La Grange on the 17th of April , he had within sixteen days ridden nearly 600 miles around the rear of Vicksburg and Port Hudson and along the whole line of the Jackson and Great Northern railroad . Beside breaking up the railway and the telegraph , and destroying for the time being their value to the Confederate army , Grierson 's ride had an indirect effect , perhaps even more important than the direct objects Grant had in view when he gave his orders . That the railway should be rendered useless for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the transmission of orders and intelligence , was of course the essential purpose of the operation , yet no one could have foreseen the extent of the confusion that followed , aided by Grierson 's rapid movements , amid the fluttering and distracted councils at Vicksburg . Thus it happened that , when he heard of Grant 's landing below Grand Gulf , Pemberton actually thought himself menaced by the advance of Banks , and this misapprehension was the parent of the first of those mistakes of his adversary of which Grant made such good use . Lieutenant Sargent , ( 1 ) the aide-de-camp sent to communicate with Admiral Farragut , as stated in the last chapter , found at the mouth of the Red River Admiral Porter , with the gunboats Benton , Lafayette , Pittsburg , and Price , the ram Switzerland , and the tugboat Ivy , with which he had run the batteries of Vicksburg in preparation for Grant 's movement . Porter brought , indeed , no despatches , but he brought the great news that Grant had secured his landing at Grand Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sargent returned to headquarters at Opelousas , he brought with him a despatch from Porter , promising to meet the army at Alexandria . Banks had already broken up the depots at Barre 's Landing and New Iberia . On the afternoon of the 4th of May , he set Dwight in motion from his advance post at Washington . Weitzel marched from Opelousas at five o'clock the same afternoon , and Emory 's division under Paine followed on the morning of the 5th . Emory , who had been suffering for some weeks , had at last consented to obey his surgeon 's orders and go to New Orleans for a brief rest . Grover followed from Barre 's Landing early in the afternoon of the same day . Banks himself remained at Opelousas until early in the morning of the 6th , having waited to receive and answer the translation of the cipher telegram from Grant ; then he rode forward rapidly and joined his troops near Washington . From this time the communications of the army were to be by the Atchafalaya and the Red River . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the advance commanded by his brother , Captain Howard Dwight , Assistant Adjutant-General , was surprised and cut off at a sharp turn in the Bayou Boeuf by a party of armed men on the opposite bank . Having no reason to apprehend any special danger so far in the rear of the advance , the little party was proceeding along the road without precaution . At the moment of the encounter Captain Dwight was quite alone , concealed by the turn in the road from the ambulance and the few orderlies that were following at leisure . Armed only with his sword , and seeing that escape was hopeless , he instantly declared his readiness to surrender . " Surrender be damned ! " cried the guerillas , and , firing a volley without further parley , shot him dead . When the orderlies who were with the ambulance heard the firing they galloped forward , only to find poor Dwight 's lifeless body lying in the dusty road . The murderers had fled . By this painful event the service lost a brave and promising young officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The distinguished family to which this gallant gentleman belonged had given four brothers to the service of their country . Of these Howard himself most nearly resembled in character , looks , and bearing his elder brother Wilder , who fell at Antietam , honored and lamented by all that knew him . Upon hearing the news , Banks instantly sent order to Brigadier-General Dwight to arrest all the white men he might find near the line of his march to the number of one hundred , and to send them to New Orleans to be held as hostages for the delivery of the murderers . " The people of the neighborhood who harbor and feed these lawless men , " Banks wrote , " are even more directly responsible for the crimes which they commit , and it is by punishing them that this detestable practice will be stopped . " There were not a hundred white men in the region through which Dwight was marching , but many were punished by imprisonment after this order  --  a harsh measure , it must be admitted , yet not without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform , who acted in turn the part of soldiers in front of the Union army , of citizens on its line of march , and of guerillas in its rear . When , under a flag of truce , Dwight presently demanded from Taylor the surrender of his brother 's murderers , the Confederate officers not only disavowed but severely condemned the crime , declaring themselves , however , unable to pick out the criminals . Two miles beyond Washington the Bayous Boeuf and Cocodrie unite to form the Bayou Courtableau , out of which again , below the town , flows the Bayou Maricoquant , forming a double connection with the Teche at its head . For a long distance the Boeuf and the Cocodrie keep close company , each following a crooked channel cut deeply into the light soil . Crossing the Courtableau above Washington , the line of march now lay along the east bank of the Boeuf , by Holmesville and Cheneyville , through a country of increasing richness and beauty , gradually rising with quickened undulations almost until the bluffs that border the Red River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in Alexandria on the morning of the 9th of May ; but no opposition was encountered ; the roads were good , dry , and easy under foot ; the weather fine , and the men were filled with a desire to push the march , and with an eager rivalry to be first in Alexandria . Early on the afternoon of the 7th of May the brigades of Dwight and Weitzel , both under Weitzel 's command , arrived at the beautiful plantation of Governor Moore , and went into bivouac . Here the cavalry , who had ridden well forward , returned , bringing the news that Porter , with his gunboats , was already in the river off Alexandria , where the fleet had cast anchor early that morning , a full day before its time . This made Banks desire to push on , and he at first ordered Paine to continue the march , preceded by all the cavalry . When Weitzel heard this , his spirit rose for the honor of his brigade , and in emphatic yet respectful terms he protested against being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held almost since leaving Brashear . Banks yielded to Weitzel 's wishes , and his men , not less eager than their commander , notwithstanding the long march of twenty miles they had already made , at once broke camp and with a swinging stride set out the accomplish the twelve miles that still separated them from the river . One of the ever-present regimental wits sought to animate the spirits and quicken the flagging footsteps of his comrades by offering a turkey ready trussed upon his bayonet to the man that should get to Alexandria before him . For a long part of the way the men of the 8th Vermont and the 75th New York amused themselves by taking advantage of the wide and good roadway to run a regimental race . As the eager rivals came swinging down the hill , they found their progress checked by a momentary halt of the horsemen in their front , while watering their jaded animals . Then , " Get out of the way with that cavalry , " was the cry , " or we 'll run over you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men led the way into Alexandria . A full ration of spirits was served out to the men , who then threw themselves on the ground without further ceremony and used to the full the permission to enjoy for once a long sleep mercifully unbroken by a reveille . Paine followed and encamped near Alexandria on the following morning ; Grover rested near Lecompte , about twenty miles in the rear . Beside his own vessels , Porter brought with him to Alexandria the Estrella and Arizona from the flotilla that had been operating on the Atchafalaya under Cooke . Porter was thus fully prepared to deal with any opposition he might encounter from the Confederate batteries at Fort De Russy ; but , although only the day before the Albatross , Estrella , and Arizona had been driven off after a sharp fight of forty minutes , when , on the 5th of May , Porter arrived at Fort De Russy , he found the place deserted and the guns gone. ( 2 ) On the 8th of May , finding that the river was falling , Porter , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lafayette , and descending the Red River , sent four of the gunboats seventy miles up the Black and its principal affluent , the Washita , to Harrisonburg . This latter expedition had no immediate result , but it served to show the ease with which the original plan of campaign might have been followed to its end . While Banks was still at Opelousas , Kirby Smith , taking Dwight 's approach to signify a general advance of the Union army , had arranged to retire up the Red River and to concentrate at Shreveport . Thither , on the 24th of April , he removed his headquarters from Alexandria and called in not only Taylor but a division of infantry under Walker , and three regiments of Texans already on the Red River . All the troops that Magruder could spare from the 8,000 serving in Eastern Texas he was at once to put in march to the Sabine . These orders , though too late for the emergency , brought about the concentration that was presently to threaten the ruin of Banks 's main campaign on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear-guard to Lawson 's Ferry , forty-one miles by the river beyond Alexandria , taking a few prisoners . Taylor himself appears to have had a narrow escape from being among them . During the week spent at Alexandria , Banks was for the first time in direct and comparatively rapid communication with Grant , now in the very heart of his Vicksburg campaign , and here , as we have seen , the correspondence was brought to a point . When he first learned that Grant had given up all intention of sending to him any portion of the Army of the Tennessee , Banks was greatly cast down , and his plans rapidly underwent many changes and perturbations . At first he was disposed to think that nothing remained but to retrace his steps over the whole toilsome way by Opelousas , the Teche , Brashear , New Orleans , and the Mississippi River to Baton Rouge , and thence to conduct a separate attack upon Port Hudson . This movement would probably have consumed two months , and long before the expiration of that time it was fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to exist . What led Banks to this despondent view was the fact that he had been counting upon Grant 's steamboat transportation for the crossing of the Mississippi to Bayou Sara , and at first , he did not see how this deficiency could now be met . Indeed , on the 12th of May , he went so far as to issue his preparatory orders for the retrograde movement ; but the next day careful reconnoissances by his engineers , Major Houston and Lieutenant Harwood , led him to change his mind and to conclude that it would , after all , be possible to march to Simmesport , and there , using the light-draught boats of the Department of the Gulf , supplemented by such steamers as Grant might be able to spare for this purpose , to transfer the whole column to Grand Gulf and thence march to join Grant in the rear of Vicksburg . Accordingly , on the 13th of May , Banks gave orders for the immediate movement of his whole force in accordance with this plan , and set aside all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Washington that Grant had gone to Jackson and Banks to Alexandria , great was the dissatisfaction of the Government and emphatic its expression . On the 19th of May Halleck wrote to Banks : " These operations are too eccentric to be pursued . I must again urge that you co-operate as soon as possible with General Grant east of the Mississippi . Your forces must be united at the earliest possible moment . Otherwise the enemy will concentrate on Grant and crush him . Do all you can to prevent this . . . . " We shall watch with the greatest anxiety the movements of yourself and General Grant . I have urged him to keep his forces concentrated as much as possible and not to move east until he gets control of the Mississippi River . " And again , on the 23d of May , still more pointedly : " If these eccentric movements , with the main forces of the enemy on the Mississippi River , do not lead to some serious disaster , it will be because the enemy does not take full advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly disappointed that you and General Grant are not acting in conjunction . It thought to secure that object by authorizing you to assume the entire command as soon as you and General Grant could unite . " When the despatches were penned , Grant and Banks were already committed to their own plans for the final campaign on the Mississippi . When they were received , Grant was before Vicksburg , Banks before Hudson ; each had delivered his first assault and entered upon the siege . The censure was withdrawn as soon as , in the light of full explanations , the circumstances came to be understood . ( 1 ) Professor Charles Sprague Sargent , of Harvard University , Director of the Arnold Arboretum , the distinguished author of the great book on Forest Trees of North America . At this time he was serving zealously as a volunteer aide-de-camp without pay . ( 2 ) Under orders from Kirby Smith to Taylor , dated April 22d : " The General is of the opinion that if a portion of the force pursuing you should move against Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impossible to hold it . " See also Smith to Cooper , April 23d : " The people at Fort De Russy can not stand a land attack . The advance of the enemy 's column to the Hauffpaur . . . will ensure its speedy fall , with loss of guns and garrison . Under these circumstances , General Taylor has ordered the removal of the 32-pounder rifle and 11-inch columbiads to a position higher up the Red River . " CHAPTER XV . BACK TO PORT HUDSON . On the 7th of May Porter relived Farragut in the guardianship of the Mississippi and its tributaries above the mouth of the Red River . This left Farragut free to withdraw his fleet so long blockading and blockaded above Port Hudson . Accordingly he gave discretionary orders to Palmer to choose his time for once more running the gauntlet , and Palmer was only watching his opportunity when he yielded to the earnest entreaty of Banks , and agreed to remain and co-operate if the General meant to go against Port Hudson . Grover began the movement on the 14th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 15th , while Weitzel , still retaining Dwight , was ordered to hold Alexandria until the 17th , and then to retire to Murdock 's plantation , where the east and west road along the Bayou Hauffpaur crosses the road from Alexandria to Opelousas , and there await further orders . Besides the ordinary duty of a rear-guard , the object of this disposition of Weitzel 's force was to cover the withdrawal toward Brashear of the long train of surplus wagons for which there was now no immediate need , and which would only have encumbered the proposed movement of the Corps by water . All the troops took the road by Cheneyville instead of that by Marksville , in order to conceal from the Confederates as long as possible the true direction of the movement . Having given these orders , Banks embarked on one of the river steamboats on the evening of the 15th and transferred his headquarters to Simmes 's plantation on the east bank of the Atchafalaya opposite Simmesport . Thence he proceeded down the Atchafalaya to Brashear , and so by rail to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 14th of May , and marched seventeen miles to Cheneyville ; on the 15th , fourteen miles to Enterprise ; on the 16th , sixteen miles to the Bayou de Glaise ; and , on the morning of the 17th , twelve miles to Simmesport , and immediately began to cross on large flatboats rowed by negro boatmen . To these were presently added a little , old , slow , and very frail stern-wheel steamboat , named the Bee , which , a short time afterwards , quietly turned upside down , without any observable cause , while lying alongside the levee ; then the Laurel Hill , one of the best boats in the service of the quartermaster ; afterward gradually but very slowly the other steamers began to come in . Grover finished crossing on the morning of the 18th , and went into camp near the Corps headquarters . Paine , with the 6th New York added to his command for the few remaining days of its service , followed in the footsteps of Grover . Leaving Alexandria on the morning of the 15th , Paine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16th , he marched twenty-five miles to the Bayou Rouge ; on the 17th , twenty miles to the Bayou de Glaise , where the Marksville road crosses it ; on the 18th , seven miles to Simmesport , and on the following morning began to cross . Before leaving Alexandria , Weitzel , on the 14th May , sent two companies of cavalry to reconnoitre a small force of the enemy said to be near Boyce 's Bridge on Bayou Cotile . The Confederates were found in some force . A slight skirmish followed , with trifling loss on either side , and when , the next day , Weitzel sent the main body of the cavalry with one piece of Nims 's battery , accompanied by the ram Switzerland with a detachment of 200 men of the 75th New York , the Confederates once more retired beyond Cane River . Weitzel moved out of Alexandria at four o'clock on the morning of the 17th of May , and , lengthening his march to thirty-eight miles during the night , encamped on Murdock 's plantation on the following morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river off Alexandria until noon of the 17th to cover Weitzel 's withdrawal , and then dropped down to the mouth of Red River and the head of the Atchafalaya . The Confederates slowly followed Weitzel at some distance , observing his movements , and , on the morning of the 20th , attacked his pickets . Then Bean , who commanded Weitzel 's advanced guard , consisting of his own 4th Wisconsin , mounted , the 12th Connecticut , and all the cavalry , threw off the attack and pursued the Confederates nearly to Cheneyville , where Barrett , advancing too boldly after the main body had halted , was cut off , with a detachment of seventeen of his troop , and , finding himself surrounded , was forced to surrender . Barrett himself and several of his men afterwards succeeded in making their escape . The attacking party of the Confederates consisted of Lane 's regiment , fresh from Texas , Waller 's battalion , and a part of Sibley 's brigade , with a battery of artillery . On the morning of the 22d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murdock 's plantation , marched at a stretch the thirty-four miles to Simmesport without further molestation , and arriving there on the morning of the 23d , at once began the crossing . Chickering marched from Barre 's Landing on the morning of the 21st of May . His force consisted of his own regiment , the 41st Massachusetts , commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Sargent and mounted on prairie horses , the 52d Massachusetts , the 22d Maine , the 26th Maine , the 90th New York , the 114th New York , under Lieutenant-Colonel Per Lee , Company E of the 13th Connecticut , and Snow 's section of Nims 's battery . The 90th New York , Colonel Joseph S. Morgan , was among the older regiments in the Department of the Gulf , having been mustered into the service in December , 1861 . In January , 1862 , it went to Florida with Brannan , on his appointment to command the Department of Key West ; and in June , 1862 , it formed the garrison of Fort Jefferson on the Dry Tortugas and of Key West ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joined Seymour 's brigade on Port Royal Island , South Carolina . In March , 1863 , it was back at Key West . There both regiments remained together until May . Meanwhile the district , then commanded by Woodbury , had been transferred from the Department of the South to the Department of the Gulf by orders from the War Office dated the 16th of March . These Banks received on the 10th of April , just before leaving Brashear , and as soon as he learned the condition and strength of the post , he called in the 90th New York . The regiment arrived at Barre 's Landing just in time to go back to Brashear with Chickering . Morgan , though Chickering 's senior in rank , waived his claim to the command and accepted a temporary brigade made up of all the infantry and the artillery . The 114th New York , after quitting the column on the 19th of April , before passing the Vermilion , and performing the unpleasant duty of driving before it to Brashear all the beeves within its reach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return march , on the 12th of May , at the moment when Banks had made up his mind to retire to Brashear , and so just in time to face about and once more retrace its weary steps . Passing through Opelousas and Grand Couteau , the 114th turned to the left by the Bayou Fusilier and fell in with Chickering on the Teche . The way was by the Teche , on either bank . By this time Mouton , reinforced by a brigade of three regiments under Pyron , with a light battery , probably Nichols 's , had recrossed the Calcasieu under orders sent him by Kirby Smith on the 14th of May , before he knew of Banks 's latest movement , and was approaching the Vermilion just in time to harry the flank and rear of Chickering 's column , scattered as it was in the effort to guard the long train that stretched for eight miles over the prairies , with a motley band of 5,000 negroes , 2,000 horses , and 1,500 beeves for a cumbrous accompaniment . With the possible exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march through Georgia , this was perhaps the most curious column ever put in motion since that which defiled after Noah into the ark . On the 21st of May , Chickering halted near Breaux Bridge ; on the 22d , above Saint Martinville ; on the 23d , above New Iberia ; on the 24th , at Jeannerette . On the following afternoon the column had halted five miles beyond Franklin , battalion , fell upon the rear-guard and a few shots were exchanged , with slight casualties on either side , save that Lieutenant Almon A. Wood , of the 110th New York , fell with a mortal wound . However , although the troops had already traversed twenty-five miles , this decided Morgan , who seems by this time to have taken the command , to push on , and the march being kept up throughout the night , the wearied troops , after a short rest for breakfast arrived at Berwick Bay at eleven o'clock on the following morning . In the last thirty-one hours the command had marched forty-eight miles . In the forty-one days that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had covered a distance of almost 500 miles , nearly every mile of it afoot and with but three days ' rest . The same afternoon the crossing began , and by the 28th every living thing was in safety at Brashear . Banks had sent his despatches of the 13th of May to Grant by the hands of Dwight , with instructions to lay the whole case before Grant and to urge the view held by Banks with regard to the co-operation of the two armies . Dwight proceeded to Grand Gulf by steamboat , and thence riding forward , overtook Grant just in time to witness the battle of Champion 's Hill on the 16th of May . That night he sent a despatch by way of Grand Gulf , promising to secure the desired co-operation , but urging Banks not to wait for it . The message arrived at headquarters at Simmes 's plantation on the evening of the 17th , and was at once sent on to Brashear to be telegraphed to the commanding general at New Orleans . This assurance sent by Dwight really conveyed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a promise from Grant , and once more convinced that it would be futile to attempt a movement toward Grand Gulf with the limited means of transport he had at hand , he again changed his plan and determined to go directly to Bayou Sara , hoping and trusting to meet there on the 25th of May a corps of 20,000 men from Grant 's army . The effective strength of the force now assembled near the head of the Atchafalaya was 8,400 infantry , 700 cavalry , 900 artillery ; in all , 10,000 . This great reduction was not wholly due to the effects of the climate , hardships , and long marches , but is partly to be ascribed to heavy detachments . These included the six regiments with Chickering , one at Butte-a-la-Rose , and one at Brashear . At Simmesport the Corps sustained its first loss by expiration of service . The 6th New York , having completed the two years ' term for which it had enlisted , went by the Atchafalaya and the railway to New Orleans , and there presently took transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the army , though pressed as much as possible , were greatly retarded by the scanty means of water transportation and the pressing need of coal . From this cause the navy was also suffering , and urgent means had to be taken to supply the deficiency . Reconnoissances , conducted by Lieutenant Harwood , in the course of which the enemy 's cavalry was seen but not engaged , showed the roads from the Atchafalaya to Waterloo to be practicable for all arms . A detachment of cavalry sent out on the 18th to ascertain whether the Confederates had any force on the west bank of the Mississippi , encountered near Waterloo about 120 men of the 1st Alabama regiment , under Lieutenant-Colonel Locke , who had been sent over the day before from Port Hudson in skiffs to prevent any communication between the upper and the lower fleets . A skirmish followed , with slight loss on either side . First placing Emory in command of the defences of New Orleans , and ordering Sherman to take Dow and Nickerson and join Augur before Port Hudson , Banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his headquarters on the 21st , and at once set his troops in motion toward Bayou Sara . At half-past eight o'clock on the morning of the 21st of May , Paine broke up his bivouac on the Atchafalaya and marched to Morganza , after detaching the 131st New York and the 173d New York with a section of artillery to guard the ammunition train . Grover followed by water as fast as the steamboats could be provided . At two o'clock on the morning of the 22d of May , Banks and Grover , with the advance of Grover 's division , landed at Bayou Sara without meeting any opposition from the enemy , who , up to this time , seems not to have suspected the movement . The other troops followed as rapidly as the means of transport permitted . Grover 's division was sent ashore , followed by two brigades of Paine 's division from Morganza . The wagon train went on down the road to the landing directly opposite Bayou Sara , under the escort of the 110th New York , and the 162d New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the command of Benedict . Soon after the landing at Bayou Sara , a party of cavalry rode in , bringing the news of Augur 's battle of the 21st . Hearing that Augur was at that moment engaged with the enemy , Banks pressed forward his troops . In a violent storm of wind and rain Grover pushed on until he met Augur 's outlying detachments . Then , finding all quiet , he went into bivouac near Thompson 's Creek , north-west of Port Hudson . Paine followed , and rested on the Perkins plantation , a mile in the rear of Grover . Banks made his headquarters with Grover . Augur covered the front of the position taken up by the enemy after the battle of Plains Store . On the same day , the 22d , Sherman came up the river , landed at Springfield , and went into position on the Bayou Sara road on Augur 's left . Thus at night on the 22d the garrison of Port Hudson was practically hemmed in . On the 18th , Banks had ordered Augur to march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson to prevent the escape of the garrison . As early as the 13th of May , while yet the plan of campaign was in suspense , Augur had sent Grierson with the cavalry and Dudley with his brigade to Merritt 's plantation , near the junction of the Springfield Landing and Bayou Sara roads , to threaten the enemy and discover his movements . Dudley then took post near White 's Bayou , a branch of the Comite , and remained in observation , covering the road to Clinton and the fork that leads to Jackson . On the 20th of May Augur moved the remainder of his force up to Dudley , in order to be ready to cover T. W. Sherman 's landing at Springfield , as well as to meet the advance of the main column under Banks from Bayou Sara , now likely to occur at any moment . With Augur now were Dudley , Chapin , Grierson , Godfrey 's squadron composed of troops C and E of the Louisiana cavalry , two sections of Rawles 's battery , Holcomb 's battery , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At six o'clock on the morning of the 21st of May Augur marched toward the crossing of the Plains Store and Bayou Sara roads to seize the enemy 's line of retreat and to open the way for Banks . When Grierson came to the edge of the wood that forms the southern boundary of the plain , his advance fell in with a detachment of the garrison under Colonel S. P. Powers of the 14th Arkansas regiment , and a brisk skirmish followed . The same afternoon Gardner sent out Miles , with his battalion , about 400 strong , and Boone 's battery , to feel Augur 's advance and perhaps to drive it away . This brought on the action known as the battle of Plains Store . Unfortunately , no complete reports of the affair were made and the regimental narratives are meagre . In the heavy forest that then masked the crossroads and formed the western border of the plain , Miles met Augur moving into position ; Dudley , on the right of the road that leads from Plains Store to Port Hudson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting Rawles 's guns . For about an hour the artillery fire was brisk . The 48th Massachusetts , being badly posted in column on either side of the Port Hudson road , gave way in some confusion under the sharp attack of Miles 's men coming on through the thicket , and thus exposed the guns of Beck 's section of Rails . As the 48th fell back through the advancing ranks of the 49th Massachusetts , the progress of that regiment was momentarily hindered , but a brisk charge of the 116th New York restored the battle . On the right , a section of Boone 's battery got an enfilade fire on Rails and Chapin , and enabled Miles to draw off and retire behind the breastworks . Thus the affair was really ended before Augur , whose duty it was to act with prudence , had time to complete the proper development of his division as for a battle with the full force of the enemy , which he was bound to suppose was about to engage him . Then he completed the task of making good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with Sherman . The main loss fell upon Chapin , Dudley 's casualties numbering but 18 , Grierson 's but 2 . The total casualties were 15 men killed , 3 officers and 69 men wounded , and 25 men missing  --  in all , 102 . Miles reports his loss as 8 killed , 23 wounded , and 58 missing ,  --  in all , 89 . When Augur quitted Baton Rouge he placed Drew with the 4th Louisiana Native Guards in Fort Williams to hold the place , supported by the fleet , and ordered Nelson with the 1st and 3d Louisiana Native Guards to be ready to follow the division to Port Hudson . CHAPTER XVI . THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF MAY . Port Hudson was now held by Gardner with a force of about seven thousand of all arms . During the interval that had elapsed since its first occupation a formidable series of earthworks had been thrown up , commanding not only the river but all the inland approaches that were deemed practicable . The first plan for land defence was mainly against the attack expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about four miles below Port Hudson a system of works was begun that , if completed , according to the original trace , would have involved a defensive line eight miles in length , requiring thirty-five thousand men and seventy guns to hold it . As actually constructed , the lines were four and a half miles long , and ran in a semicircular sweep from the river near Ross Landing , below Port Hudson , to the impassable swamp above . Following this line for thirteen hundred yards after leaving the river on the south , the bluff is broken into irregular ridges and deep ravines , with narrow plateaus ; thence for two thousand yards the lines crossed the broad cotton fields of Gibbons 's and of Slaughter 's plantations ; beyond these for four hundred yards they were carried over difficult gullies ; beyond these again for fourteen hundred yards their course lay through fields and over hilly ground to the ravine at the bottom of which runs Sandy Creek . Here , on the day of the investment , the line of Confederate earthworks stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no attack was looked for in that quarter . Sandy Creek finds its way into the marshy bottom of Foster 's Creek , and from Sandy Creek , where the earthworks ended , to the river at the mouth of Foster 's Creek , is about twenty-five hundred yards . Save where the axe had been busy , nearly the whole country was covered with a heavy growth of magnolia trees of great size and beauty . This was a line that , for its complete defence against a regular siege , conducted according to the strict principles of military science , as laid down in the books , should have had a force of fifteen thousand men . At the end of March the garrison consisted of 1,366 officers , 14,921 men of all arms present for duty , making a total of 16,287 . The main body was organized in 5 brigades , commanded by Beall , Buford , Gregg , Maxey , and Rust . The fortifications on the river front mounted 22 heavy guns , from 10-inch columbiads down to 24-pounder siege guns , manned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably numbering 78 pieces , were available for the defence of all the lines : of these batteries only 5 were now left , with 30 guns . When , early in May , Pemberton began to feel the weight of Grant 's pressure , he called on Gardner for reinforcements ; thus Rust and Buford marched to the relief of Vicksburg on the 4th of May , Gregg followed on the 5th , and Maxey on the 8th . Miles was to have followed Maxey ; in fact the preparations and orders had been given for the evacuation of Port Hudson ; but now the same uncertainty and vacillation on the part of the Confederate chiefs that were to seal the doom of Vicksburg began to be felt at Port Hudson . Gardner , who had moved out with Maxey , had hardly arrived at Clinton when he was met by an order from Pemberton to return to Port Hudson with a few thousand men and to hold the place to the last . But ten days later , on the 19th of May , Johnston , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed radically from those of Davis and Pemberton , ordered Gardner to evacuate Port Hudson and to march on Jackson , Mississippi . This order , sent by courier as well as by telegraph , Gardner received just as Augur was marching from Baton Rouge to cut him off . Then it was too late , and when on the 23d Johnston peremptorily renewed his order for the evacuation , even the communication was closed . The investment was made perfect by the presence in the river , above and below Port Hudson , of the ships and gunboats of the navy . Just above the place and at anchor around the bend lay the Hartford , now Commodore Palmer 's flagship , with the Albatross , Sachem , Estrella , and Arizona . Below , at anchor off Prophet 's Island , were the Monongahela , bearing Farragut 's flag , the Richmond , Genesee , Essex , and the mortar flotilla . Both the upper and the lower fleets watched the river at night by means of picket-boats in order to discover any movement and to intercept any communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west bank of the river , Benedict was stationed with his own regiment , the 162d New York , the 110th New York , and a section of artillery to prevent the escape of the Confederates by water . As soon as Weitzel joined , on the 25th of May , Banks began to close in his lines along the entire front . Weitzel moved up to the sugar-house on the telegraph road near the bridge over Foster 's Creek ; Paine advanced into the woods on Weitzel 's left ; Grover moved forward on the north of the Clinton Railway , crossed the ravine of Sandy Creek , and occupied the wooded rest of the steep hill in front . Augur prolonged the line across the Plains Store road under cover of the woods , yet in plain view of the Confederate entrenchments . Sherman held the Baton Rouge road , occupying the skirt of woods that formed the eastern edge of Slaughter 's and Gibbons 's fields . The 1st and 3d Louisiana Native Guards , under Nelson , having come up from Baton Rouge , were posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme right of the line of investment . Banks now placed Weitzel in command of the right wing of the army , comprising his own brigade under Thomas , Dwight 's brigade of Grover 's division under Van Zandt , together forming a temporary division under Dwight , the six regiments that remained of Paine 's division after the heavy detachments , and the two colored regiments under Nelson . During the day of the 25th Weitzel gained the wooded slope covering the Confederate left front . The Confederate advanced guard on this part of their line , composed in part of the 9th battalion of Louisiana partisan rangers , under Lieutenant-Colonel Wingfield , resisted Weitzel 's advance stoutly , but was steadily and without difficulty pushed back into the entrenchments . When night fell on the 26th of May the division commanders met at headquarters at Riley 's on the Bayou Sara road to consider the question of an assault . No minutes of this council were kept , and to this day its conclusions are a matter of dispute . They may safely be regarded as sufficiently indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those present any immediate movement in the nature of an assault was objected to because of the great distance that still separated the lines of investment from the Confederate earthworks ; it was urged that the troops would have to move to the attack over ground the precise character of which was as yet unknown to them or to their commanders , although it was known to be broken and naturally difficult and to be obstructed by felled timber . The general opinion was , however , that prompt and decisive action was demanded in view of the unusual and precarious nature of the campaigns on which the two armies of Grant and Banks were now embarked , the uncertainty as to what Johnston might do , and the certainty that a disaster at Vicksburg would bring ruin in Louisiana . Moreover , officers and men alike were in high spirits and full of confidence in themselves , and they outnumbered the Confederates rather more than two to one . This was the view held by Banks himself . Upon his mind , moreover , the disapproval and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly , as soon as the council broke up he gave orders for an assault on the following morning . All the artillery was to open upon the Confederate works at daybreak . For this purpose the reserve artillery was placed under the immediate orders of Arnold . He was to open fire at six . Weitzel was to take advantage of the attacks on the left and centre to force his way into the works on his front , since it was natural to expect that , whether they should prove successful or not , these attacks would distract the attention of the enemy and serve to relieve the pressure in Weitzel 's front . Grover was thus left with five regiments to support the left centre , to reinforce either the right or left , and to support the right flank of the reserve artillery , or to force his way into the works , as occasion might require . Augur , holding the centre , with Dudley 's brigade forming his right and Chapin his left , and Sherman , at the extreme left , separated from Augur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the cannonade by advancing their skirmishers to kill the enemy 's cannoneers and to cover the assault . They were to place their troops in position to take instant advantage of any favorable opportunity , and , if possible , to force the enemy 's works at the earliest moment . Each division commander was to provide his own means for passing the ditch . These , for the most part , consisted of cotton bags , fascines , and planks borne by detachments of men , furnished by detail or by volunteering . It will be observed that no time was fixed for the assault of either column nor any provision made to render the several attacks simultaneous . Moreover , although the order wound up with the emphatic declaration that " Port Hudson must be taken to-morrow , " an impression prevailed in the minds of at least two of the division commanders that there were still to be reconnoissances by the engineers , and that upon the results of these would depend the selection of the points of attack . There were no roads along the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means by which communication was maintained between the left , the centre , and the right was either by wide detours or through dense and unknown woods and thickets . It was impossible to see the troops in front or rear or on either flank . On no part of the line was either division in sight of the other . The forest approached within 250 yards at the nearest point on Weitzel 's front , within 450 yards on Grover 's , within 500 yards on Augur 's , and within 1,200 yards on Sherman 's front . The field to be passed over was partly the cleared land of the plantations , crossed by fences and hedges , but in many places , especially on Augur 's approach , the timber had been recently felled , and , lying thick upon the ground , made a truly formidable obstacle . The morning of the 27th of May broke bright and beautiful . As the early twilight began to open out along the entire front the artillery began a furious cannonade . At first the Confederate guns replied with spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , moreover , the necessity of husbanding their scanty store of ammunition no doubt impressed itself upon the minds of the Confederate commanders . About six o'clock , when Weitzel judged that the movement on the left must be well advanced , he put his columns in motion through the dense forest in his front , forming his command , as far as the nature of the ground admitted , in column of brigades , Dwight 's brigade under Van Zandt leading , followed by Weitzel 's brigade under Thomas . Paine formed his division in two lines in support , his own brigade under Fearing in front , and Gooding 's in reserve . The Confederate skirmishers and outposts continued to occupy the forest and the ravines on this part of their front , and the first hour was spent in pressing them back behind their entrenchments . Then Thomas moved forward through Van Zandt 's intervals , and deploying from right to left the 160th New York , Lieutenant-Colonel Van Petter ; 8th Vermont , Lieutenant-Colonel Dillingham ; 12th Connecticut , Lieutenant-Colonel Peck ; and 75th New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Zandt , owing to the inequalities of the ground and the difficulty of finding the way , drifted somewhat toward the right . Thereupon Paine , finding his front uncovered , moved forward into the interval . Then began what has been aptly termed a " huge bushwack . " Until within three days a part of the Confederate lines in front of Weitzel had not been fortified at all , the defence resting on the great natural difficulties of the approaches no less than of the ground to be held ; but in the interval Gardner had taken notice of the indications that pointed to an advance in this quarter , and had caused light breastworks to be constructed in all haste . This the great trees that covered the hill rendered an easy task . On the morning of the 27th of May , therefore , the works that Weitzel was called upon to attack consisted mainly of big logs on the crest and following the contour of the hill , rendered almost unapproachable by the felled timber that choked the ravines . Thus , while Weitzel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves unable to move beyond the cover of the hollows and the timber without offering an easy mark for a destructive fire of small-arms , as well as of grape , shell , shrapnel , and canister . When finally , after climbing over hills , logs , and fallen trees , and forcing the ravines filled with tangled brush and branches , Weitzel had driven the Confederates into their works , he held the ridge about two hundred yards distant from the position to be attacked . Paine 's position at this time was to the right and rear of battery No. 6 , as shown on the map ; Weitzel and Dwight were on the same crest near batteries 3 , 4 , and 5 . The pioneers worked like beavers to open the roads as fast as the infantry advanced , and with such skill and zeal that hardly had the infantry formed upon the crest than the guns of Duryea , Bainbridge , Nims , Haley , and Carruth unlimbered and opened fire by their side . At length Thomas succeeded in making his way across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually forward , began to fortify with logs the hill on the right , afterward known as Fort Babcock , in honor of the Lieutenant-Colonel of the 75th New York . To support Weitzel 's movement , Grover sent the 159th New York , Lieutenant-Colonel Burt , and the 25th Connecticut by a wide detour to the right to make their way in on Paine 's left . Taking advantage of the protection afforded by the ravine , at the bottom of which ran or rather trickled Sandy Creek , these regiments , after the most difficult and exhausting scramble through the brush and over the fallen timber , came to the base of a steep bluff , near the position afterward occupied by siege battery No. 6 . This , although the works directly opposite were as yet light , was naturally one of the ugliest approaches on the whole front . In spite of every exertion , it took the 159th an hour to move half a mile . Just before reaching the foot of the hill over which they were to charge , they captured a Confederate captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut off by the advance and unable to retire . So crooked and obscure was the path and so difficult was it to see any thing , even a few feet ahead , that the officers had to stand at every little turning to tell the men which way to go . At last the regiment formed , and , with a rush , began the assault of the bluff , but they could get no farther than the crest , where they were met by a destructive flank fire from the Confederate riflemen . There , within thirty yards of the works , the men sought shelter . To try the effect of a diversion , Grover put in the 12th Maine , supported by the remaining fragment of his division , reduced to the 13th and 25th Connecticut , against the partly exposed west face of the bastion that formed the left of the finished portion of the Confederate earthworks . The point of attack is shown at X. and XI. , and the position whence Grover moved at 1 and 7 . After the first attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal , in conjunction with an advance on the centre and left , was momentarily expected , Dwight thought to create a diversion and at the same time to develop the strength and position of the Confederates toward their extreme left , where their lines bent back to rest on the river , and to this end he ordered Nelson to put in his two colored regiments . This portion of the Confederate line occupied the nearly level crest of a steep bluff that completely dominates the low ground by the sugar-house , where the telegraph road crosses Foster 's Creek . Over this ground the colored troops had to advance unsupported to receive their first fire . The bridge had been burned when the Confederates retired to their works . Directly in front of the crest , and somewhat below it , a rugged bluff stands a little apart , projecting boldly from the main height with a sharp return to the right , so as to form a natural outwork of great strength , practically inaccessible save by the road that winds along the bottom of the little rivulet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached ridge is about four hundred yards in length . It was held by six companies of the 39th Mississippi regiment , under Colonel W. B. Shelby , while behind , in the positions of land batteries III . and IV. , were planted six field pieces , and still farther back on the water front the columbiads of Whitfield and Seawell , mounted on traversing carriages , stood ready to rake the road with their 8-inch and 10-inch shell and shrapnel . Shortly after seven o'clock , Nelson sent in the 1st Louisiana Native Guards , under Lieutenant-Colonel Bassett , in column , to force the crossing of the creek . The 3d Louisiana Native Guards followed in close support . Just before the head of the column came near the creek , the movement was perceived by the Confederates , who immediately opened on the negroes a sharp fire of musketry from the rifle-pits on the detached bluff ; at the same moment the field guns opened with shell and shrapnel from the ridge behind , and as the men struggled on through the creek and up the farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columbiads . When , in mounting the narrow gorge that led up the hill , the head of the column , necessarily shattered as it was by this concentrated fire , had gained a point within about two hundred yards of the crest , suddenly every gun opened on them with canister . This was more than any man could stand . Bassett 's men gave back in disorder on their supports , then in the act of crossing the creek , and the whole column retired in confusion to its position near the sugar-house on the north bank . Here both regiments were soon re-formed and again moved forward in good order , anticipating instructions to renew the attack ; yet none came , and , in fact , the attack was not renewed , although the contemporary accounts , some of them even official , distinctly speak of repeated charges . In this abortive attempt , Captain Andrew Cailloux and Second Lieutenant John H. Crowder , of the 1st regiment , were instantly killed . Cailloux , who is said to have been a free man of color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time supposed to have resigned , fell at the head of the leading company of his regiment , while gallantly cheering on his men . The 1st regiment lost , in this brief engagement , 2 officers , and 24 men killed and 79 wounded  --  in all , 105 . The 3d , being far less exposed , as well as for a shorter time , lost 1 officer and 5 men killed , and 1 officer wounded  --  in all , 7 . The morning was drawing out when these movements were well spent , and the advanced positions simply held without further effort to go forward . The hour may have been about ten o'clock . Grover , Paine , and Weitzel listened in vain for any sounds of musketry on their left to indicate that either Augur or Sherman was at work , yet no sound came from that quarter save the steady pounding of the Union artillery . Now Weitzel believed that , by pursuing his advance in what might be called skirmishing order and working his way gradually forward from the vantage-ground of Fort Babcock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses , already heavy , a foothold on the high ground held by the Confederate left ; yet of the character of the defences of this part of the line Weitzel knew but little , and of the nature of the ground behind these defences and the direction of the roads , neither he nor any one in the Union army knew any thing . The topography of the ground in sight afforded the only indication of what might be expected farther on , and this was confusing and difficult to the last degree . Weitzel had , therefore , strong reason for believing that his difficulties , instead of ending with the capture of the Confederate works , might be only beginning . There was , of course , the chance that the garrison along the whole front might throw down their arms or abandon their defences the moment they should find themselves taken in reverse at any point , for it was known that they had no reserves to be reckoned with after breaking through the line . Grover had been ordered to support either the right or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works , as circumstances might suggest . This last he had tried , and failed to accomplish . On his left there was no attack to support . When riding toward the right he met Weitzel , who , although commanding the right wing , was his junior in rank as well as in experience , Grover gave Weitzel the counsel of prudence , and Weitzel fell in with these views . The two commanders decided to ask fresh orders or to wait for an assault on the centre or left before renewing the attack on the right . All this time Augur stood ready , his division formed and all in perfect order , waiting for the word from Banks , who made his headquarters close at hand , and who , in his turn , waited for the sound of Sherman 's musketry as the signal to put in Augur . With Sherman , Augur was in connection along the front , although not in easy communication . The precise nature of the causes that held Sherman back it is , even now , impossible to state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts , to form a conjecture that should seem to be altogether probable and at the same time reasonable . The most plausible surmise seems to be that Sherman supposed he was to wait for the engineers to indicate the point of attack , and that he himself did not choose to go beyond what he conceived to be his orders to precipitate a movement whose propriety he doubted . Sherman was an officer of the old army , of wide experience , favorably known and highly esteemed throughout the service for his intelligence , his character , and his courage . He was known as one of the most distinguished of the chosen commanders of the few light batteries that the government of the United States had thought itself able to afford in the days before the war . Before coming to Louisiana he had commanded a department , and in that capacity had carried to a successful conclusion the brilliant operations that gave Hilton Head and Port Royal to the forces of the Union . Neither in his previous history was there any thing to his personal discredit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains , however , account for it how we may , that when about noon , greatly disturbed by the check on the right , and still more by the silence on the left , Banks himself rode almost unattended to Sherman 's headquarters , he found Sherman at luncheon in his tent , surrounded by his staff , while in front the division lay idly under arms , without orders . Hot words passed , the precise nature of which has not been recorded , and Banks returned to his headquarters determined to replace Sherman by the chief-of-staff of the department . The roads had not yet been opened , and it was half-past one before these orders could be given . Andrews rode directly to the left , accompanied by but a single aide-de-camp , Lieutenant Fiske . When he came on the ground he found Sherman 's division deployed , and Sherman himself on horseback at the head of his men , ready to lead them forward . Then Andrews , with great propriety , deferred the delivery of the orders placing him in command , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman moved to the assault . Andrews remained to witness the operation . Nickerson moved forward on the right in column of regiments . The 14th Maine , deployed as skirmishers , covered his front , followed by the 24th Maine , 177th New York , and 165th New York in line . After emerging from the woods , Nickerson 's right flank rested on the road that runs past Slaughter 's house , near the position of battery 16 . Dow formed the left of the division and of the army . He advanced at the same time as Nickerson , and in like order , his right resting near the position of battery 17 and his left near Gibbons 's house , marked as the position of battery 18 . The 6th Michigan led the brigade , followed by the 15th New Hampshire , 26th Connecticut , and 128th New York . In the interval between the two brigades rode Sherman , surrounded by his whole staff and followed by his escort . No sooner had the line emerged from among the trees than the Confederates opened upon every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a galling fire of musketry and artillery . At first the troops moved forward steadily and at a good pace , but as they drew nearer to the enemy and the musketry fire grew hotter , their progress was delayed and their formation somewhat broken by four successive and parallel lines of fence that had to be thrown down and crossed . Once clear of the young corn , they found themselves entangled with the abatis that covered and protected the immediate front of the Confederate works on this part of the line . This had been set on fire by the exploding shells , and the smoke and flame now added to the difficulty of the movement . Here the men suffered greatly , many being shot down in the act of climbing the great trunks of the fallen trees , and many more having their clothing reduced to tatters and almost torn from their bodies in the attempt to force their way through the entangled branches . The impetus was soon lost , the men lay down or sought cover ; numbers of Dow 's men made their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their left ; of Nickerson 's , many drifted singly and in groups into the ravine on their right . Long before this , indeed within a few minutes after the line first marched out from the wood , Sherman had fallen from his horse , severely wounded in the leg ; under the vigorous fire concentrated upon this large group of horsemen in plain sight of the Confederates and in easy range , two of his staff officers had shared the same fate . This would have brought Dow to the command of the division ; but nearly at the same instant Dow himself was wounded and went to the rear , and so the command fell to Nickerson , who was with his brigade , and , in the confusion of the moment , was not notified . Thus , for some interval , there was no one to give orders for fresh dispositions among the regiments . Many officers had fallen ; the 128th New York had lost its colonel , Cowles ; the 165th New York , at last holding the front of Nickerson 's line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carr , both wounded , the former mortally , while standing by the colors . To retire was now only less difficult than to advance . Nickerson 's men , lying down , held their ground until after dark ; but Dow 's , being nearer the cover of the woods , fell back to their first position . Andrews now took command of the division , in virtue of the written orders of the commanding general , and prepared to obey whatever fresh instructions he might receive . None came ; there was , indeed , nothing to be done but to withdraw and to restore order . As soon as Banks heard the rattle of the musketry on the left , and saw from the smoke of the Confederate guns that Sherman was engaged , he ordered Augur forward . Augur , as has been said , had been ready and waiting all day . His arrangements were to make the attack with Chapin 's brigade , deployed across the Plains Store road , and to support it with Dudley 's , held in reserve under cover of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crossed and divided the fields on the right of the road . Chapin 's front was covered by the skirmishers of the 21st Maine ; immediately in their rear were to march the storming column of two hundred volunteers , under Lieutenant-Colonel O'Brien , of the 48th Massachusetts . The stormers rested and waited for the word in the point of the wood on the left of the Plains Store road , nearly opposite the position of battery 13 . Half their number carried cotton bags and fascines to fill the ditch . On the right of the road the 116th New York was deployed ; on its left the 49th Massachusetts , closely supported by the 48th Massachusetts , the 2d Louisiana , of Dudley 's brigade , and the reserve of the 21st Maine . O'Brien shook hands with the officer who brought him the last order , and , turning to his men , who were lying or sitting near by , some on their cotton bags , others on the ground , said in the coolest and most business-like manner : " Pick up your bundles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormers was the signal for the whole line . A truly magnificent sight was the advance of these battalions , with their colors flying and borne sturdily toward the front ; yet not for long . Hardly had the movement begun when the whole force  --  officers , men , colors , stormers , and all ,  --  found themselves inextricably entangled in the dense abatis under a fierce and continuous discharge of musketry and a withering cross-fire of artillery . Besides the field-pieces bearing directly down the road , two 24-pounders poured upon their flank a storm of missiles of all sorts , with fragments of railway bars and broken chains for grape , and rusty nails and the rakings of the scrap-heap for canister . No part of the column ever passed beyond the abatis , nor was it even possible to extricate the troops in any order without greatly adding to the list of casualties , already of a fearful length . Banks was all for putting Dudley over the open ground directly in his front , but , before any thing could be done , came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear to the most persistent that the day was miserably lost . When , after nightfall , the division commanders reported at headquarters , among the wounded under the great trees , it was known that the result was even worse than the first accounts . The attempt had failed without inflicting serious loss upon the enemy , save in ammunition expended , yet at a fearful cost to the Union army . When the list came to be made up , it was found that 15 officers and 278 men had been killed , 90 officers and 1,455 men wounded , 2 officers and 155 men missing , making the total killed 293 , total wounded 1,545 , total missing 157 , and an aggregate of 1,995 . Of the missing , many were unquestionably dead . Worse than all , if possible , the confidence that but a few hours before had run so high , was rudely shaken . It was long indeed before the men felt the same faith in themselves , and it is but the plain truth to say that their reliance on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed and wounded taxed to the utmost the skill and untiring exertions of the surgeons , who soon found their preparations and supplies exceeded by the unlooked-for demand upon them . All night long on that 27th of May the stretcher-bearers were engaged in removing the wounded to the field-hospitals in the rear . These were soon filled to overflowing , and many rested under the shelter of the trees . Hither , too , came large numbers of men not too badly hurt to be able to walk , and to all the tired troops the whole night was rendered dismal to the last degree by the groans of their suffering comrades mingled everywhere , the wounded with the well , the dying with the dead . Among the killed were : Colonel Edward P. Chapin , of the 116th New York ; Colonel Davis S. Cowles , of the 128th New York ; Lieutenant-Colonel William L. Rodman , of the 38th Massachusetts ; Lieutenant-Colonel James O'Brien , of the 48th Massachusetts ; Captain John B. Hubbard , Assistant Adjutant-General , of Weitzel 's brigade ; Lieutenant Ladislas A. Wrotnowkski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Lull , of the 8th New Hampshire , and Abel Smith , Jr. , of the 165th New York , were mortally wounded . The long list of the wounded included Brigadier-General Thomas W. Sherman , Brigadier-General Neal Dow , Colonel Richard E. Holcomb , of the 1st Louisiana ; Colonel Thomas S. Clark , of the 6th Michigan ; Colonel William F. Bartlett , of the 49th Massachusetts ; Major Gouverneur Carr , of the 165th New York . Farragut 's ships and mortar-boats , which had been harassing the garrison at intervals , day and night , for more than ten days , joined hotly in the bombardment , but ceased firing , by arrangement , as soon as the land batteries slackened . The fire of the fleet , especially that of the mortars , was very annoying to the garrison , especially at first , yet the actual casualties were not great . The Confederate losses during the assault are not known . In Beall 's brigade all the losses up to the 1st of June numbered 68 killed , 194 wounded , and 96 missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been incurred on the 27th of May . The Confederate artillery was soon so completely overpowered , that it became nearly useless , save when the Union guns were masked by the advance of assaulting columns . Three 24-pounders were dismounted , and of these one was completely disabled . With the result of this day the last hope of a junction between the armies of Banks and Grant vanished . It may therefore be convenient to retrace our steps a little in order to note the closing incidents of this strange chapter of well-laid plans by fortune brought to naught . Dwight returned from his visit to Grant on the 22d of May , and reported to Banks in person at his headquarters with Grover on Thompson 's Creek . In his account of what had taken place , Dwight confirmed the idea Banks had already derived from the despatch that Dwight had sent from Grand Gulf on the 16th , before he had seen Grant . Grant would send 5,000 men , Dwight reported , but Banks was not to wait for them . Practically this had no effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made upon the mind of Grant himself may be seen from his description , written in 1884 , of his interview with Dwight . It was the morning of the 17th of May and Grant 's troops were standing on the eastern bank of the Big Black ready to force the passage of the river : " While the troops were standing as here described , an officer from Banks 's staff came up and presented me with a letter from General Halleck , dated the 11th of May . It had been sent by way of New Orleans to Banks to forward to me . He ordered me to return to Grand Gulf and to co-operate from there with Banks against Port Hudson , and then to return with our combined forces to besiege Vicksburg . I told the officer that the order came too late and that Halleck would not give it then if he knew our position . The bearer of the despatch insisted that I ought to obey the order , and was giving arguments to support his position when I heard great cheering to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Lawler , in his shirt-sleeves , leading a charge upon the enemy . I immediately mounted my horse and rode in the direction of the charge , and saw no more of the officer who delivered the despatch , I think not even to this day . " ( 1 ) Here two mistakes are perhaps worth noting as curious rather than important : Dwight was not a member of Banks 's staff , and the letter from Halleck , dated the 11th of May , which General Grant strangely supposed to have come by way of New Orleans , was , in fact , Halleck 's telegram of that date , sent by way of Memphis , which Dwight had picked up as he passed through Grand Gulf , after Grant had cut his communications . Dwight 's account may have taken color from his hopes , yet the course of events gives some reason to think he may have had warrant for his belief . On the 19th of May Grant 's first assault of Vicksburg was repulsed with a loss of 942 . Three days later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cost of 3,199 killed , wounded , and missing . This drove him to the siege and put him in need of more troops ; yet when , on the 25th of May , he sat down to write to Banks , it was with the purpose of offering to send down a force of 8,000 or 10,000 men if Banks could now provide the means of transport . But even while Grant wrote , word came that Johnston was gathering in his rear ; and so the whole thing was one more given up , and instead , once again he called on Banks for help ; and this time he sent down two large steamers , the Forest Queen and Moderator , to fetch the men . But Banks had now no men to spare ; he too was cast for a siege ; he could only echo the entreaty and send back the steamboats empty as they came . So the affair ended .

THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition and the stores from the depot at Riley 's , near the headquarters of the day before , and early on the morning of the 28th of May established his headquarters in tents at Young 's , in rear of the centre , and began his arrangements to reduce Port Hudson by gradual approaches . At six o'clock in the morning he sent a flag of truce to Gardner , from Augur 's front on the Plains Store road , bearing a request for a suspension of hostilities until two o'clock in the afternoon , to permit the removal of the dead and wounded . To this Gardner at once refused to agree unless Banks would agree to withdraw at all points to a distance of eight hundred yards . He also demanded that the fleet should drop down out of range . Banks was unable to consent . A long correspondence followed , twelve letters in all , crossing and recrossing , to the utter confusion of time . At length , shortly after half-past three o'clock , Banks received Gardner 's assent to an armistice extending till seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send to the lines of the defence , by unarmed parties , such of the Confederate killed as remained unburied , and such of their wounded as had not already been picked up and sent to the rear . The killed and wounded of the Union army , lying between their lines and the Confederate works , were to be cared for in the same way . Arnold was ordered to bring up the siege train , manned by the 1st Indiana heavy artillery , and Houston to provide entrenching tools and siege materials . When all the siege artillery was in position there were forty pieces , of which six were 8-inch sea-coast howitzers on siege carriages , eight 24-pounders , seven 30-pounder Parrotts , four 6-inch rifles , four 9-inch Dahlgren guns , four 8-inch mortars , three 10-inch mortars , and four 13-inch mortars . To these were added twelve light batteries of sixty pieces , namely , six 6-pounder Sawyer rifles , two 10-pounder Parrotts , twenty-six 12-pounder Napoleons , two 12-pounder howitzers , twelve 3-inch rifles , and twelve 20-pounder Parrotts . The Dahlgren guns were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seventeen from the Essex , under Lieutenant-Commander Edward Terry , with Ensign Robert P. Swann , Ensign E. M. Shepard , and Master 's Mates William R. Cox and Edmund L. Bourne for chiefs of the gun divisions . In the course of the next few days the eight regiments that had been left on the Teche and the Atchafalaya rejoined the army before Port Hudson , coming by way of Brashear , Algiers , and the river . This gave to the cavalry under Grierson one more regiment , the 41st Massachusetts , now mounted , and henceforth known as the 3d Massachusetts cavalry , the three troops of the old 2d battalion being merged in it ; Weitzel got back the 114th New York ; Paine recovered the 4th Massachusetts and the 16th New Hampshire of Ingraham 's brigade , now practically broken up ; and Grover the 22d Maine and 90th New York of Dwight 's brigade , the 52d Massachusetts of Kimball 's , and the 26th Maine of Birge 's , while losing the 41st Massachusetts by its conversion into a mounted regiment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during its six week 's confinement in the heart of the pestilential swamp that it was reduced to a mere skeleton , without strength either numerical or physical . It was easy to see that officers and men alike were suffering from some aggravated form of hepatic disorder , due to malarial poison . Many were added to the sick-report every day . Few that went to the regimental or general hospital returned to duty , while of the men called well all were yellow , emaciated , and restless , or so drowsy that the sentries were found asleep on their posts at noonday . This unfortunate regiment was therefore taken from the front and set to guard the general ammunition depot , near headquarters . Without being once engaged in battle , so that it had not a single gunshot wound to report , the 16th New Hampshire suffered a loss by disease during its seven months ' service in Louisiana of 5 officers and 216 men  --  in all , 221 ; and nearly the whole of this occurred in the last two months . This regiment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pensacola . Dwight was now given the command of Sherman 's division , relieving Nickerson , who had assumed command the morning after the assault of the 27th . Dow being disabled by his wounds , his brigade fell to Clark . The 2d Louisiana was transferred from Dudley 's brigade to Chapin 's , bringing Charles J. Paine in command . Halbert E. Paine 's division was withdrawn from the earlier formation of the right wing under Weitzel , and was established in position on Grover 's left , covering the Jackson road and the second position of Duryea 's battery at No. 12 . Grover was placed in command , from the afternoon of the 27th , of the whole right wing , but Dwight 's brigade , under Morgan , remained with Weitzel as part of a temporary division under his command , Thomas retaining the command of Weitzel 's brigade . Finally , the 162d New York and the 175th New York were temporarily taken from Paine and lent to Dwight , who , directly after the 14th of June , united them with the 28th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigade . At the same time he transferred the 6th Michigan to Nickerson 's brigade , evidently meaning to take the command of the 1st brigade from Clark ; but these arrangements were promptly set aside by orders from headquarters . The left wing , comprising Augur 's division and Sherman 's , now Dwight 's , was placed under the command of Augur . Along the whole front the troops now held substantially the advanced positions they had gained on the 27th of May . This shortened the line , and , as it was on the whole better arranged and the connections and communications better , Augur took ground a little to the left and held , with Charles J. Paine 's brigade , a part of the field that had been in Sherman 's front on the 27th ; while Dwight , in closing up and drawing in his left flank , moved nearer to the river and covered the road leading in a southerly direction from the Confederate works around the eastern slope of Mount Pleasant and past Troth 's house . The cavalry , being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encumbrance upon them , was massed , under Grierson , behind the centre , and assigned to the duty of guarding the rear , the depots , and the communications against the incursions of the Confederate cavalry , under Logan , known to be hovering between Port Hudson and Clinton , and supposed to be from 1,500 to 2,000 strong . Logan 's actual force at this time was about 1,200 effective . Grierson had about 1,700 , including his own regiment , the 6th Illinois , the 7th Illinois , Colonel Edward Prince , a detachment of the 1st Louisiana , the 3d Massachusetts cavalry , and the 14th New York . As fast as the engineers were able to survey the ground and the working parties to open the roads , Arnold and Houston chose with great care the positions for the siege batteries , and heavy details were soon at work upon them , as well as upon the long line of rifle-pits , connecting the batteries and practically forming the first parallel of the siege works . The positions of some of these batteries , especially on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed and mounted , they began at the north , near the position of the colored regiments on the right bank of Foster 's Creek , and extended , at a distance from the Confederate works varying from six hundred to twelve hundred yards , to the Mount Pleasant road , across which was planted siege battery No. 21 . The first position of siege battery No. 20 is marked " old 20 , " and the three formidable batteries on the extreme left , Nos. 22 , 23 , and 24 , were not established till later , the attack of the Confederate works in their front being at first left to the guns of the fleet . Two epaulements for field artillery were thrown up on either side of the road at Foster 's Creek to command the passage of the stream , but no siege guns were mounted there . The extreme right of the siege batteries was at No. 2 . While all eyes were turned upon the siege works and every nerve strained for their completion , Logan 's presence in the rear , though at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a continual source of anxiety and annoyance . To find out just what force he had and what he was about , Grierson moved toward Clinton on the morning of the 3d of June with the 6th and 7th Illinois , the old 2d Massachusetts battalion , now merged in the 3d , a squadron of the 1st Louisiana , two companies of the 4th Wisconsin , mounted , and one section of Nims 's battery . Grierson took the road by Jackson , and , when within three miles of that place , sent Godfrey , with 200 men of the Massachusetts and Louisiana cavalry , to ride through the town , while the main column went direct to Clinton . Godfrey pushing on briskly through Jackson , captured and paroled , after the useless fashion of the time , a number of prisoners , and rejoined the column two miles beyond . When eight miles west of Clinton , Grierson heard a report that Logan had gone that morning toward Port Hudson , but pushing on toward Clinton , after crossing the Comite Grierson found Logan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly posted on Pretty Creek . A three hours ' engagement followed , resulting in Grierson 's retirement to Port Hudson , with a loss of 8 killed , 28 wounded , and 15 missing ; 3 of the dead and 7 of the wounded falling into the hands of the enemy . Logan reports his loss as 20 killed and wounded , and claims 40 prisoners . Among the killed , unfortunately , was the young cavalry officer , Lieutenant Solon A. Perkins , of the 3d Massachusetts , whose skill and daring had commended itself to the notice of Weitzel during the early operations in La Fourche , and whose long service without proper rank had drawn out the remark : " This Perkins is a splendid officer , and he deserves promotion as much as any officer I ever saw . " Banks determined to chastise Logan for this ; accordingly , at daylight on the morning of the 5th of June , Paine took his old brigade under Fearing , with the 52d Massachusetts , the 91st New York , and two sections of Duryea 's battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton by way of Olive Branch and the plank road . That night Paine encamped at Redwood creek ; on the 6th he made a short march to the Comite , distant nine miles from his objective , and there halted till midnight . Then , after a night march , the whole force entered Clinton at daylight on the morning of the 7th , only to find that Logan , forewarned , had gone toward Jackson . Then Paine countermarched to the Comite , and , remaining till sunset , marched that evening to Redwood , and , there going into bivouac , at two o'clock on the following morning , the 8th of June , returned to the lines before Port Hudson . On this fruitless expedition the men and horses suffered severely from the heat , and there were many cases of sunstroke . By the 1st of June the artillery and the sharp-shooters of the besieged had obtained so complete a mastery over the guns of the defenders , that on the whole line these were practically silent , if not silenced . In part , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the Confederate artillerists to reserve their ammunition for the emergency , yet something was also due to the effect of the Union fire , by which , in the first week , twelve heavy guns were disabled . The 10-inch columbiad in water battery 4 was dismounted at long range . This gun was known to the Union soldiers , and perhaps to the Confederates first , as the " Lady Davis , " and great was the dread awakened by the deep bass roar and the wail of the big shells as they came rolling down the narrow pathway , or searched the ravines where the men lay massed . The fire of the navy also did great damage among the heavy batteries along the river front . When the siege batteries were nearly ready , on the evening of the 10th of June , Banks ordered a feigned attack at midnight by skirmishers along the whole front , for the purpose , as stated in the orders , " of harassing the enemy , of inducing him to bring forward and expose his artillery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , and of favoring the operations of pioneers who may be sent forward to remove obstructions if necessary . " None of these objects can be said to have been accomplished , nor was any advantage gained beyond a slight advance of the lines , at a single point on Weitzel 's front , by the 131st New York . The full loss in this night 's reconnoissance is not known ; in Weitzel 's own brigade , there were 2 killed , 41 wounded , 6 missing  --  in all , 49 ; in Morgan 's , a partial report accounts for 12 wounded and 59 missing , including two companies of the 22d Maine that became entangled and for the moment lost in the ravines . On the evening of the 12th of June , all arrangements being nearly complete , Banks ordered a vigorous bombardment to be begun the next morning . Punctually at a quarter past eleven on the morning of the 13th , every gun and mortar of the army and navy that could be brought to bear upon the defences of Port Hudson opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious cannonade , limited only by the endurance of the Union guns and gunners , for the Confederates hardly ventured to reply , save at first feebly . When the bombardment was at its fiercest , more than one shell in a second could be seen to fall and explode within the narrow circuit of the defences visible from the headquarters on the field . The defenders had three heavy guns dismounted during the day , yet suffered little loss in men , for long before this nearly the whole garrison had accustomed themselves to take refuge in their caves and " gopher-holes " at the first sound of Union cannon , and to await its cessation as a signal to return to their posts at the parapet . They were not always so fortunate , however , for more than once it happened that three or four men were killed by the bursting of a single shell . When the hour was up the cannonade ended as suddenly as it began , and profound silence followed close on the intolerable din . Then Banks sent a flag of truce summoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the usages of war and a desire to avoid unnecessary sacrifice of life , impose on me the necessity of formally demanding the surrender of the garrison at Port Hudson . I am not unconscious , in making this demand , that the garrison is capable of continuing a vigorous and gallant defence . The events that have transpired during the pending investment exhibit in the commander and garrison a spirit of constancy and courage that , in a different cause , would be universally regarded as heroism . But I know the extremities to which they are reduced . . . . I desire to avoid unnecessary slaughter , and I therefore demand the immediate surrender of the garrison , subject to such conditions only as are imposed by the usages of civilized warfare . " To this Gardner replied : " My duty requires me to defend this position , and therefore I decline to surrender . " In the evening the generals of division met in council at headquarters . In anticipation of what was to come , Dudley had already been ordered to send the 50th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dwight ; and Dudley himself , with the 161st and 174th New York , was to report to Grover . This left under Augur 's immediate command only five regiments of his division , namely , one , the 30th Massachusetts , of Dudley 's brigade , and four of C. J. Paine 's . Shortly before midnight a general assault was ordered for the following morning . At a quarter before three Augur was to open a heavy fire of artillery on his front , following it up half and hour later by a feigned attack of skirmishers . Dwight was to take two regiments , and , with a pair of suborned deserters for guides , was to try and find an entrance on the extreme left of the works near the river . But the main attack was to be made by Grover on the priest-cap . Its position is shown on the map at XV . and XVI. , and the approach was to be from the cover of the winding ravine , near the second position of Duryea 's battery , at No. 12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three o'clock , and was to cease at a signal from Grover . At half-past three the skirmishers were to attack . The general formation of each of the two columns of attack had been settled in orders issued from headquarters on the morning of the 11th . Each column , assumed to consist of about 2,000 men , was to be preceded and covered by 300 skirmishers ; immediately behind the skirmishers were to be seventy pioneers , carrying thirty-five axes , eighteen shovels , ten pickaxes , two handsaws , and two hatchets ; next was to come the forlorn hope , or storming party , of 300 men , each carrying a bag stuffed with cotton ; following the stormers , thirty-four men were to carry the balks and chesses to form a bridge over the ditch , in order to facilitate the passage of the artillery , as well as of the men . The main assaulting column was to follow , marching in lines-of-battle , as far as the nature of the ground would permit , which , as it happened , was not far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each battery having its own pioneers . To the cavalry , meanwhile , was assigned the work of picketing and protecting the rear , as well as of holding the telegraph road leading out of Port Hudson toward Bayou Sara , by which it was thought the garrison might attempt to escape , on finding their lines broken through , or even to avoid the blow . As was the uniform custom during the siege , all watches at division and brigade headquarters were set at nine o'clock , by a telegraphic signal , to agree with the adjutant-general 's watch . These final orders for the assault bear the hour of 11.30 P.M. This was in fact the moment at which the earliest copies were sent out by the aides-de-camp , held in readiness to carry them . There were seven hundred and fifty words to be written , and eleven o'clock had already passed when the council listened to the reading of the drafts and broke up . From the lateness of the hour , as well as from the distance and the darkness of the night , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of the troops that were to execute them . Many arrangements had still to be carried out and many of the detachments had still to be moved over long distances and by obscure ways to the positions assigned to them . In some instances all that was left of the night was thus occupied , and it was broad daylight before every thing was ready . A dense fog prevailed in the early morning of Sunday , the 14th of June , strangely veiling , while it lasted , even the sound of the big guns , so that in places it was unheard a hundred yards in the rear . Punctually at the hour fixed the cannonade opened . It was an hour later , that is to say , about four o'clock , when the first attack was launched . For the chief assault Grover had selected Paine 's division and had placed the main body of his own division with Weitzel 's brigade , in close support . Paine determined to lead the attack himself . Across his front as skirmishers he deployed the 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire . The 4th Massachusetts was told off to follow the skirmishers with improvised hand-grenades made of 6-pounder shells . Next the 38th Massachusetts and the 53d Massachusetts were formed into line of battle . At the head of the infantry column the 31st Massachusetts , likewise deployed , carried cotton bags , to fill the ditch . The rest of Gooding 's brigade followed , next came Fearing 's , then Ingraham 's under Ferris . In rear of the column was posted the artillery under Nims . At a point on the crest of the ridge , ninety yards distant from the left face of the priest-cap , Paine 's advance was checked . Then Paine , who had previously gone along the front of every regiment , addressing to each a few words of encouragement and of preparation for the work , passed afoot from the head of the column to the front of the skirmish line , and exerting to the full his sonorous voice , gave the order to the column to go in . At the word the men sprang forward , but almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their front , with fairly level aim and at point-blank range , poured upon the head of the column a deadly volley . Many fell at this first discharge ; among them , unfortunately , the gallant Paine himself , his thigh crushed by a rifle-ball . Some of the men of the 4th Wisconsin , of the 8th New Hampshire , and of the 38th Massachusetts gained the ditch , and a few even climbed the parapet , but of these nearly all were made prisoners . The rear of the column fell back to the cover of the hill , while all those who had gained the crest were forced to lie there , exposed to a pitiless fire of sharp-shooters and the scarcely more endurable rays of the burning sun of Louisiana , until night came and brought relief . In this unfortunate situation the sufferings of the wounded became so unbearable , and appealed so powerfully to the sympathy of their comrades , that many lives were risked and some lost in the attempt to alleviate the thirst , at least , of these unfortunates . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretcher and tried to reach the point where Paine lay , but the attempt was unsuccessful , and cost both of them their lives . These heroes were E. P. Woods , of Company E of the 8th New Hampshire , and John Williams , of Company D , 31st Massachusetts . Not less nobly , Patrick H. Cohen , a private soldier of the 133d New York , himself lying wounded on the crest , cut a canteen from the body of a dead comrade and by lengthening the strap succeeded in tossing it within reach of his commander ; this probably preserved Paine 's life , for unquestionably many of the more seriously hurt perished from the heat and from thirst on that fatal day . It was about seven o'clock , and the fog had lifted , when Weitzel advanced to the attack on the right face of the priest-cap . The 12th Connecticut and the 75th New York of his own brigade were deployed to the left and right as skirmishers to cover the head of the column . Two regiments of Morgan 's brigade , loosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , with hand-grenades , and next the 24th Connecticut , every man carrying two cotton bags weighing thirty pounds each . In immediate support came the remainder of Weitzel 's brigade in column of regiments , in the order of the 8th Vermont , 114th New York , and 160th New York , followed by the main body of Morgan 's brigade . Birge was in close support and Kimball in reserve . Finally , in the rear , as in Paine 's formation , was massed the artillery of the division . Toward the north face of the priest-cap the only approach was by the irregular , but for some distance nearly parallel , gorges cut out from the soft clay of the bluffs by Sandy Creek and one of its many arms . The course of these streams being toward the Confederate works , the hollows grew deeper and the banks steeper at every step . At most the creeks were but two hundred yards apart , and the ridge that separated them gave barely standing room . Within a few feet of the breastworks the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as a formidable ditch until they united with the main stream and ravine below the bastion . This larger ravine near its outlet and the natural ditch throughout its length were mercilessly swept by the fire of the bastion on the right , the breastworks in front , and the priest-cap on the left . The smaller ravine led toward the south to the crest from which Paine 's men had recoiled , where their wounded and their dead lay thick , and behind which the survivors were striving to restore the broken formations . Weitzel therefore chose the main ravine . Bearing to the right from the Jackson road , the men moved by the flank and cautiously , availing themselves of every advantage afforded by the timber or the irregularities of the ground , until they gained the crest of the ridge at points varying from twenty to fifty yards from the works near the north face of the priest-cap . In advancing to this position the column came under fire immediately on filing out of the ravine and the wood in front of the position of battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be , they went forward with a rush and a cheer , but beyond the crest indicated few men ever got . From this position it was impossible either to advance or retire until night came . At the appointed hour Dwight sent the 6th Michigan , under Lieutenant-Colonel Bacon , and the 14th Maine , to the extreme left to make an attempt in that quarter , the arrangements for which have been already described ; but either Dwight gave his orders too late , or the column mistook the path , or else the difficulties were really greater than they had been thought beforehand or than they afterward seemed , for nothing came of it . Then recalling this detachment to the Mount Pleasant road , Dwight tried to advance in that direction . The 14th Maine was sent back to its brigade and Clark deployed his own regiment , the 6th Michigan , as skirmishers , supported by the 128th New York , now commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel James Smith . The 15th New Hampshire followed and the 26th Connecticut , under Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Selden , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column of companies on the main road , but as the Confederates immediately opened a heavy artillery fire upon the head of the column , they had to be deployed . However , the ground , becoming rapidly narrower , did not long permit of an advance in this order , so that it soon became necessary to ploy once more into column . About 350 yards from the outer works the Mount Pleasant road enters and crosses a deep ravine by a bridge , then destroyed . The hollow was completely choked with felled timber , through which , under the heavy fire of musketry and artillery , it was impossible to pass ; so here the brigade stayed till night enabled it to retire . Nickerson 's brigade supported the movement of Clark 's , but without becoming seriously engaged . Thus ended Dwight 's movement . It can hardly be described as an assault , as an attack , or even as a serious attempt to accomplish any valuable result ; yet indirectly it was the means of gaining , and at a small cost , the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , for it gave Dwight possession of the rough hill , the true value of which was then for the first time perceived , and on the commanding position of its northern slope was presently mounted the powerful array of siege artillery that overlooked and controlled the land and water batteries on the lower flank of the Confederate defences . Of Augur 's operations in the centre , it is enough to say that the feigned attack assigned to this portion of the line was made briskly and in good order at the appointed time , without great loss . The result of the day may be summed up as a bloody repulse ; beholding the death and maiming of so many of the bravest and best of the officers and men , the repulse may be even termed a disaster . In the whole service of the Nineteenth Army Corps darkness never shut in upon a gloomier field . Men went about their work in a silence stronger than words . On this day 21 officers and 182 men were killed , 72 officers and 1,245 men were wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 13 were reported as killed , 84 as wounded , and 2 as missing without distinguishing between officers and men , thus making a total of 216 killed , 1,401 wounded , 188 missing  --  in all , 1,805 . Among the wounded many had received mortal hurts , while of the missing , as in the first assault , many must now be set down as killed . Paine , as we have seen , fell seriously hurt while in the very act of leading his division to the assault . Nine days earlier he had received his well-earned commission as brigadier-general . He was taken to New Orleans , and there nine days later , at the Hotel de Dieu Hospital , after vain efforts to save the limb , the surgeons performed amputation of the thigh . A few days after the surrender , in order to avoid the increasing dangers of the climate , Paine was sent to his home in Wisconsin on the captured steamer Starlight , the first boat that ascended the river . Thus the Nineteenth Corps lost one of its bravest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his men , not less through respect for his character than by his unfailing sympathy and care in all situations , and who was commended to the confidence and esteem of his associates and superiors by talent and devotion of the first order joined to every quality that stamps a man among men . The fiery Holcomb , wounded in the assault of the 27th , yet refusing to leave his duty to another , fell early on this fatal morning at the head of his regiment and brigade , in the first moment of the final charge of Weitzel 's men . This was another serious loss , for Holcomb had that disposition that may , for want of a better term , be described as the fighting character . All soldiers know it and respect it , and every wise general , seeing it anywhere among his officers , shuts his eyes to many a blemish and pardons many a fault that would be severely visited in another ; yet in Holcomb there was nothing to overlook or forgive . As he was the most prominent and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last remained eager for the fatal assault , so he was among the earliest and noblest of its victims . Mortally wounded at the head of Weitzel 's brigade fell Colonel Elisha B. Smith , of the 114th New York . Barely recovered from a serious illness , his spirit could not longer brook the restraint of the hospital at New Orleans with the knowledge that his men were engaged with the enemy . Thomas was ill and had received a slight wound of the scalp ; this brought Smith to the head of the brigade ; his fall devolved the command upon Lieutenant-Colonel Van Petten , for though Thomas , unable to bear the torture inflicted upon him by the sounds of battle , rose from his sick-bed and resumed the command , his weakness again overcame him when the day 's work was done . No regiment at Port Hudson approached the 8th New Hampshire in the number and severity of its losses , no brigade suffered so much as Paine 's , to which this regiment belonged , and no division so much as Emory 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fearing commanded the brigade , and later the division , and Lull having fallen in the previous assault , the regiment went into action 217 strong , led by Captain William M. Barrett ; of this number , 122 , or 56 per cent. , were killed or wounded . On the 27th of May , out of 298 engaged , the regiment lost 124 , or 41 per cent . Next to the 8th New Hampshire on the fatal roll stands the 4th Wisconsin . This noble regiment , at all times an honor to the service and to its State , whence came so many splendid battalions , was a shining monument to the virtue of steady , conscientious work and strict discipline applied to good material . Bean had been instantly killed by a sharp-shooter on the 29th of May ; the regiment went into action on the 14th of June 220 strong , commanded by Captain Webster P. Moore ; of these , 140 fell , or 63 per cent . In the first assault , however , it had fared better , its losses numbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service from the British army , with the lustre of the Crimea still about him , rather brightened than dimmed by time and distance , fell severely wounded on the same fatal crest . He was struck down at the head of his regiment , boldly leading his men and urging them forward with the quaint cry of " Get on , lads ! " so well known to English soldiers , yet so unfamiliar to all Americans as to draw many a smile , even in that grim moment , from those who heard it . To the cannonade that preceded the assault and announced it to the enemy must be attributed not only the failure but a great part of the loss . The wearied Confederates were asleep behind the breastworks when the roar of the Union artillery broke the stillness of the morning , and gave them time to make ready . Such was their extremity that in Grover 's front they burned their last caps in repelling the final assault , and , for the time , were able to replenish only from the pouches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were able to walk or crawl made their way to places of safety in the rear ; while , disregarding the incessant fire of the sharp-shooters , heavy details and volunteer parties of stretcher-bearers , plying their melancholy trade , carried the wounded with gentle care to the hospitals and the dead swiftly to the long trenches . The proportion of killed and mortally wounded , already unusually heavy , was increased by the exposure and privations of the long day , while many , whom it was impossible to find or reach during the night , succumbed sooner or later during the next forty-eight hours . For although when , on the morning of the 15th , Banks sent a flag of truce asking leave to send in medical and hospital supplies for the comfort of the wounded of both armies , Gardner promptly assented , and in his reply called attention to the condition of the dead and wounded before the breastworks , yet it was not until the evening of the 16th that Banks could bring himself to ask for a suspension of hostilities for the relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But three days and two nights had already passed ; most of the hurt , and these the most grievously , were already beyond the need of succor . The same thing had already occurred at Vicksburg . The operations at Vicksburg and Port Hudson were so far alike in their character and objects that no just estimate of the events at either place can well be formed without considering what happened at the other . In this view it is instructive to observe that Grant assaulted the Confederate position at Vicksburg within a few hours after the arrival of his troops in front of the place , on the afternoon of the 19th of May , when two determined attacks were easily thrown off by the defenders , with a loss to their assailants of 942 men . On the 22d of May Grant delivered the second assault , in which about three fourths of his whole effective force of 43,000 of all arms were engaged . The full corps of Sherman and McPherson , comprising six divisions , were repulsed by four brigades of the garrison , numbering probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 3,199 . These are the reasons he gives for his decision to attack : " Johnston was in my rear , only fifty miles away , with an army not much in inferior in numbers to the one I had with me , and I knew he was being reinforced . There was danger of his coming to the assistance of Pemberton , and , after all , he might defeat my anticipations of capturing the garrison , if , indeed , he did not prevent the capture of the city . The immediate capture of Vicksburg would save sending me the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere , and would set free the army under me to drive Johnston from the State . But the first consideration of all was  --  the troops believed they could carry the works in their front , and they would not have worked so patiently in their trenches if they had not been allowed to try . " Having tried , he now " determined upon a regular siege  --  to ' outcamp the enemy , ' as it were , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22d convinced officers and men that this was best , and they went to work on the defences and approaches with a will . " ( 1 ) It has also to be remembered , in any fair and candid consideration of the subject , that at this comparatively early period of the war even such bloody lessons as Fredericksburg had not sufficed to teach either the commanders or their followers on either side , Federal or Confederate , the full value , computed in time , of even a simple line of breastworks of low relief , or the cost in blood of any attempt to eliminate this value of time by carrying the works at a rush . Indeed , it may be doubted whether , from the beginning of the war to the end , this reasoning , in spite of all castigations that resulted from disregarding it , was ever fully impressed upon the generals of either army , although at last there came , it is true , a time when , as at Cold Harbor , the men had an opinion of their own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very questionable whether earthworks manned by so much as a line of skirmishers , prepared and determined to defend them , have ever been successfully assaulted save as the result of a surprise . Sedgwick 's captures of the Rappanhannock redoubts and of Marye 's Heights have indeed been cited as instances to the contrary , yet on closer consideration it is apparent that although in the former case the Confederates had been looking for an attack , they had given up all expectation of being called on to meet it that day , when , just at sunset , Russell fell suddenly upon them and finished the affair handsomely before they had time to recover . Marye 's Heights , again , may be described as a moral surprise , for no Confederate officer or man that had witnessed the bloody repulse of Burnside 's great army on the very same ground , but a few weeks before , could have expected to be called on so soon to meet the swift and triumphant onset of a single corps of that army . Moreover , Sedgwick 's tactical arrangements were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of simple breastworks has almost always caused those general and staff-officers especially that viewed them through their field-glasses , with the diminishing power of a long perspective , to forget that an assault upon an enemy behind entrenchments is not so much a battle as a battue , where one side stands to shoot and the other goes out to be shot , or if he stops to shoot it is in plain sight of an almost invisible foe . European examples , as usual misapplied or misunderstood , have contributed largely to the persistency of this fatal illusion , and Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajos have served but as incantations to confuse many a mind to which these sounding syllables were no more than names ; ignorant , therefore , of the stern necessities that drove Wellington to these victories , forgetful of their fearful cost , and above all ignoring or forgetting the axiom , on which rests the whole art and science of military engineering  --  that the highest and stoutest of stone walls must yield at last to the smallest trench through which a man may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between an assault upon a walled town , delivered as a last resort after crowning the glacis and opening wide the breach , and any conceivable movement , though bearing the same name , made as the first resort , against earthworks of the very kind whereby walled towns are taken , approached over ground unknown and perhaps obstructed . Even so , in the storm of Rodrigo the defenders struck down more than a third of their own numbers ; Badajos was taken by a happy chance after the main assault had miserably failed ; at both places the losses of the assailants were in proportion less , and in number but little greater , than at Port Hudson ; yet , in the contemplation of the awful slaughter of Badajos , even the iron firmness of Wellington broke down in a passion of tears .

With that quick appreciation of facts that forms so large a part of the character of the American soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of battles and campaigns an influence not always reserved for considerations derived from a study of the principles of the art of war , the men of the Army of the Gulf had now made up their minds that the end sought was to be attained by hard work on their part and by starvation on the part of the garrison . Criticism and denunciation , by no means confined to those officers whose knowledge of the art of war is drawn from books , have been freely passed upon this peculiarity , yet both alike have been wasted , since no proposition can be clearer than that a nation , justly proud of the superior intelligence of its soldiers , can not expect to reap the full advantage of that intelligence and at the same time escape every disadvantage attending its exercise . Among these drawbacks , largely overbalanced by the obvious gains , not the least is the peculiar quality that has been aptly described in the homely saying , " They know too much . " When , therefore , the American volunteer has become a veteran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the simple sagacity of the soldier , it is often his way to stay his hand from exertions that he deems needless and from sacrifices that he considers useless or worse than useless , although the same exertions and the same sacrifices would , but a few months earlier in the days of his inexperience , have been met by him with the same alacrity that the ignorant peasant of Europe displays in obeying the orders of his hereditary chief in the service of the king . After the 14th of June the siege progressed steadily without farther attempt at an assault . This was now deferred to the last resort . At four points a system of comparatively regular approaches was begun , and upon these labor was carried on incessantly , night and day ; indeed , as is usual with works of this character , the greatest progress was made in the short hours of the June nights . The main approach led from Duryea 's battery No. 12 toward the priest-cap , following the winding of the ravines and the contour of the hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and danger , been carried to the crest facing the priest-cap , and only a few yards distant , the trench was rapidly and with comparative ease extended toward the left , in a line parallel with the general direction of the defences . The least distance from this third parallel , as it was called by an easy stretch of the language , to the enemy 's parapet was about twenty yards , the greatest about forty-five . About two hundred yards farther to the right of the elbow of the main sap , a zigzag ran out of the ravine on the left flank of Bainbridge 's battery , No. 8 , toward the bastion . Upon this approach , because of its directness , the use of the sap-roller , or some equivalent for it , could never be given up until the ditch was gained . From the extreme left , after the northern slope of Mount Pleasant had been gained , a main approach was extended from the flank of Roy 's battery of 20-pounder Parrotts , No. 20 , almost directly toward the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming meanwhile a covered way that connected all the batteries looking north from the left flank . Of these No. 24 was the seventeen-gun battery , including two 9-inch Dahlgrens removed from the naval battery of the right wing , and commanded by Ensign Swann . On the 2d of July , Lieutenant-Commander Terry took command of the Richmond and turned over the command of the right naval battery to Ensign Shepard . These " blue-jacket " batteries , with their trim and alert gun crews , were always bright spots in the sombre line . From the river bank the sap ran with five stretches of fifty or sixty yards , forming four sharp elbows , to the foot and well up the slope of the steep hill on the opposite side of the ravine , where the Confederates had constructed the strong work known to both combatants as the Citadel . From the head of the sap to the nearest point of the Confederate works the distance was about ninety-five yards . From the ravine in front of the mortar battery of the left wing , No. 18 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced lunette , No . XXVII. , and distant from it 375 yards . The object of this approach was partly to amuse the enemy , partly to prevent his breaking through the line , now drawn out very thin , and partly also to serve as a foothold for a column of attack in case of need . From the ravine near Slaughter 's house a zigzag , constructed by the men of the 21st Maine , under the immediate direction of Colonel Johnson , led to the position of battery No. 16 , where were posted the ten guns of Rails and Baines . The distance from this battery to the defences was four hundred yards . On the 15th of June , on the heels of the bloody repulse of the previous day , Banks issued a general order congratulating his troops upon the steady advance made upon the enemy 's works , and expressed his confidence in an immediate and triumphant issue of the contest : " We are at all points on the threshold of his fortifications , " the order continues . " Only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last duty that victory imposes , the Commanding General summons the bold men of the corps to the organization of a storming column of a thousand men , to vindicate the flag of the Union , and the memory of its defenders who have fallen ! Let them come forward ! " Officers who lead the column of victory in this last assault may be assured of the just recognition of their services by promotion ; and every officer and soldier who shares its perils and its glory shall receive a medal to commemorate the first great success of the campaign of 1863 for the freedom of the Mississippi . His name will be placed in General Orders upon the Roll of Honor . " Colonel Henry W. Birge , of the 13th Connecticut , at once volunteered to lead the stormers , and although the whole project was disapproved by many of the best officers and men in the corps , partly as unnecessary and partly because they conceived that it implied some reflection upon the conduct of the brave men that had fought and suffered and failed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling of confidence in Birge that within a few days the ranks of the stormers were more than filled . As nearly as can now be ascertained , the whole number of officers who volunteered was at least 80 ; of enlisted men at least 956 . Of these , 17 officers and 226 men belonged to the 13th Connecticut . As the different parties offered and were accepted , they were sent into camp in a retired and pleasant spot , in a grove behind the naval battery on the right . On the 15th of June Birge was ordered to divide his column into two battalions , and to drill it for its work . On the 28th this organization was complete . The battalions were then composed of eight companies , but two companies were afterwards added to the first battalion . To Lieutenant-Colonel Van Petter , of the 160th New York , Birge gave the command of the first battalion , and to Lieutenant-Colonel Bickmore , of the 14th Maine , that of the second battalion . On that day , 67 of the officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for duty in the camp of the stormers . Among those that volunteered for the forlorn hope but were not accepted were 54 non-commissioned officers and privates of the 1st Louisiana Native Guards , and 37 of the 3d . From among the officers of the general staff and staff departments that were eager to go , two were selected to accompany the column and keep up the communication with headquarters and with the other troops ; these were Captain Duncan S. Walker , assistant adjutant-general , and Lieutenant Edmund H. Russell , of the 9th Pennsylvania Reserves , acting signal officer . Then the officers and men quietly prepared themselves for the serious work expected of them . Those that had any thing to leave made their wills in the manner sanctioned by the custom of armies , and all confided to the hands of comrades the last words for their families or their friends . Meanwhile an event took place , trifling in itself , yet accenting sharply some of the more serious reasons that had , in the first instance , led Banks to resist the repeated urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had formed powerful factors in determining him to deliver and to renew the assault . Early on the morning of the 18th of June a detachment of Confederate cavalry rode into the village of Plaquemine , surprised the provost guard , captured Lieutenant C. H. Witham and twenty-two men of the 28th Maine , and burned the three steamers lying the bayou , the Sykes , Anglo-American , and Belfast . Captain Albert Stearns , of the 131st New York , who was stationed at Plaquemine as provost marshal of the parish , made his escape with thirteen men of his guard . The Confederates were fired upon by the guard and lost one man killed and two wounded . In their turn they fired upon the steamboats , and wounded two of the crew . Three hours later the gunboat Winona , Captain Weaver , came down from Baton Rouge , and , shelling the enemy , hastened their departure . In the tension of greater events , little notice was taken at the moment of this incident ; yet it was not long before it was discovered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Taylor was about to invade La Fourche , intent upon the bold design of raising the siege of Port Hudson by blockading the river and threatening New Orleans . Thus Banks was brought face to face with the condition described in his letter of the 4th of June to Halleck : " The course to be pursued here gives me great anxiety . If I abandon Port Hudson , I leave its garrison , some 6,000 or 7,000 men , the force under Mouton and Sibley , now threatening Brashear City and the Army of Mobile , large or small , to threaten or attack New Orleans . If I detach from my command in the field a sufficient force to defend that city , which ought not to be less than 8,000 or 10,000 , my assistance to General Grant is unimportant , and I leave an equal or larger number of the enemy to reinforce Johnston . If I defend New Orleans and its adjacent territory , the enemy will go against Grant . If I go with a force sufficient to aid him , my rear will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do both . Under these circumstances , my only course seems to be to carry this post as soon as possible , and then to join General Grant . If I abandon it I can not materially aid him . " Taylor 's incursion caused Banks some anxiety and appreciable inconvenience , without , however , exercising a material influence on the fortunes of the siege ; accordingly , it will be better to reserve for another chapter the story of this adventure . About the same time , Logan again became troublesome . At first he seems to have thought of retiring on Jackson , Mississippi ; but this Johnston forbade , telling him to stay where he was , to observe and annoy the besiegers , and if pressed by too strong a force , to fall back only so far as necessary , hindering and retarding the advance of his assailants . By daylight , on the morning of the 15th of June , Logan dashed down the Clinton road , surprised the camp of the 14th New York cavalry , who made little resistance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made none . In this raid Logan took nearly one hundred disabled prisoners , including six officers , and carried off a number of wagons . However , finding Grierson instantly on his heels , Logan promptly " fell back as far as necessary . " On the evening of the 30th of June , while hovering in the rear of Dwight , Logan captured and carried off Brigadier-General Dow , who , while waiting for his wound to heal , had taken up his headquarters in a house some distance behind the lines . At daylight , on the morning of the 2d of July , Logan surprised the depot at Springfield Landing , guarded by the 162d New York , Lieutenant-Colonel Blanchard , and a small detachment of the 16th New Hampshire , under Captain Henry . Careless picket duty was the cause , and a great stampede the consequence , but Logan hardly stayed long enough to find out exactly what he had accomplished , since he reports that , besides burning the commissary and quartermasters ' stores , he killed and wounded 140 of his enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destroyed 100 wagons , with a loss on his part of 4 killed and 10 wounded ; whereas , in fact , the entire loss of the Union army was 1 killed , 11 wounded , 21 captured or missing , while the stores burned consisted of a full supply of clothing and camp and garrison equipment for about 1,000 men . The wagons mentioned by Logan were part of a train met in the road , cut out , and carried off as he rapidly rode away , and the number may be correct . The end of June was now drawing near , and already the losses of the besiegers in the month of constant fighting exceeded 4,000 . At least as many more were sick in the hospitals , while the reinforcements from every quarter barely numbered 3,000 . There were no longer any reserves to draw from ; the last man was up . The effective strength of all arms had at no time exceeded 17,000. ( 1 ) Of these less than 12,000 can be regarded as available for any duty directly connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller in numbers , as the men fell under the fire of the sharp-shooter , or succumbed to the deadly climate , or gave out exhausted by incessant labor and privation . The heat became almost insupportable , even to those who from time to time found themselves so fortunate as to be able to snatch a few hours ' rest in the dense shade of the splendid forest , until their tour of duty should come again in the trenches , where , under the June sun beating upon and baking all three surfaces , the parched clay became like a reverberating furnace . The still air was stifling , but the steam from the almost tropical showers was far worse . Merely in attempting to traverse a few yards of this burning zone many of the strongest men were sunstruck daily . The labor of the siege , extending over so wide a front , pressed so severely upon the numbers of the besieging army , always far too weak for such an undertaking in any climate at any season , above all in Louisiana in June , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging , as guards of the trenches , as sharp-shooters , or on outpost service ; and as the number available for duty grew smaller , and the physical strength of all that remained in the ranks daily wasted , the work fell the more heavily . When the end came at last the effective force , outside of the cavalry , hardly exceeded 8,000 , while even of this small number nearly every officer and man might well have gone on the sick-report had not pride and duty held him to his post . This will seem the less remarkable when it is remembered that the garrison during the same period suffered in the same proportion , while from like causes less than a year before Breckinridge had , in a much shorter time , lost the use of half his division . Butler 's experience had been nearly as severe . To the suffering and labors that are inseparable from any operation in the nature of a siege were added insupportable torments , the least of which were vermin . As the summer days drew out and the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek lost itself in the pestilential swamp ; the wells and springs gave out ; the river fell , exposing to the almost tropical sun a wide margin of festering ooze . The mortality and the sickness were enormous . The animals suffered in their turn , the battery horses from want of exercise , the train horses and mules from over-work , and all from the excessive heat and insufficiency of proper forage . There was never enough hay ; the deficiency was partly eked out by making fodder of the standing corn , but this resource was quickly exhausted , and after the 3d of July , when Taylor sealed the river by planting his guns below Donaldsonville , all the animals went upon half or quarter rations of grain , with little hay or none . At length , for two or three days , the forage depots fairly gave out ; the poor beasts were literally starving when the place fell , nor was it for nearly a week after that event that , by the raising of Taylor 's blockade below and the arrival of supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two colored regiments , the 1st and 3d Louisiana Native Guards , besides strongly picketing their front , were mainly occupied , after the 27th of May , in fatigue duty in the trenches on the right . While the army was in the Teche country , Brigadier-General Daniel Ullmann had arrived at New Orleans from New York , bringing with him authority to raise a brigade of colored troops . With him came a full complement of officers . A few days later , on the 1st of May , Banks issued , at Opelousas , an order , which he had for some time held in contemplation , for organizing a corps of eighteen regiments of colored infantry , to consist , at first , of five hundred men each . These troops were to form a distinct command , to which he gave the name of the Corps d'Afrique , and in it he incorporated Ullmann 's brigade . By the end of May Ullmann had enrolled about 1,400 men for five regiments , the 6th , 7th , 8th , 9th , and 10th . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to Port Hudson , organized , and set to work in the trenches and upon the various siege operations . About the same time the formation of a regiment of engineer troops was undertaken , composed of picked men of color , formed in three battalions of four companies each , under white officers carefully chosen from among the veterans . The ranks of this regiment , known as the 1st Louisiana engineers , were soon recruited to above a thousand ; the strength for duty was about eight hundred . Under the skilful handling of Colonel Justin Hodge it rendered valuable service throughout the siege . Company K of the 42d Massachusetts , commanded by Lieutenant Henry A. Harding , had for some months been serving as pontoniers , in charge of the bridge train . During the siege it did good and hard work in all branches of field engineering under the immediate direction of the Chief Engineer . While at Opelousas , Banks had applied to Halleck to order Brigadier-General Charles P. Stone to duty in the Department of the Gulf . Stone had been without assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long and lonely imprisonment in the casemates of the harbor forts of New York , and , up to this moment , every suggestion looking to his employment had met the stern disapproval of the Secretary of War . Even when in the first flush of finding himself at last at the top notch of his career , Hooker , in firm possession , as he believed , of the post he had long coveted , as commander of the Army of the Potomac , had asked for Stone as his Chief of Staff , the request had been met by a flat refusal . A different fate awaited Banks 's application . On the 7th of May Halleck issued the orders asked for , and in the last days of the month Stone reported for duty before Port Hudson . At first Banks was rather embarrassed by the gift he had solicited , for he saw that he himself was falling into disfavor at Washington ; the moment was critical ; and it was easy to perceive how disaster , or even the slightest check , might be magnified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , Stone was equally unknown to and unknown by the troops of the Nineteenth Army Corps . Instead , therefore , of giving him the command of Sherman 's division , for which his rank indicated him , Banks kept Stone at headquarters without special assignment , and made every use of his activity , as well as of his special knowledge and ready skill in all matters relating to ordnance and gunnery . On the evening of the 26th of June a strange thing happened . While it was yet broad daylight Colonel Provence of the 16th Arkansas , posted in rear of the position of battery XXIV , discovering and annoyed by the progress made on battery 16 in his front , sent out , one at a time , two bold men , named Mieres and Parker , to see what was going on . After nightfall , on their report , he despatched thirty volunteers , under Lieutenant McKennon , to drive off the guard and the working party and destroy the works . The position was held by the advance guard of the 21st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason hard to understand , ordered his men not to fire . The Arkansas party , therefore , accomplished its purpose , without further casualty than having one man knocked down , as he was leaping the parapet of the trench , by a soldier who happened to consider his orders as inapplicable to this method of defence . Then Major Merry , with the reserves of the 21st , coming promptly to the rescue , easily drove out the enterprising assailants , with whom went as prisoners Lieutenant Bartlett and five of his men , with fourteen muskets that had not been fired. ( 2 ) As the saps in front of Bainbridge 's and Duryea 's batteries drew every day nearer to the bastion and the priest-cap , the working parties were harassed and began to be greatly delayed by the unceasing fire of the Confederate sharp-shooters . Moreover , in spite of the vigilance of the sharp-shooters in the trenches , their adversaries had so much the advantage of ground that they were able to render the passage of certain exposed points of the approaches slow and hazardous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the sap , but these the adventurous enemy set alight with blazing arrows or by sallies of small parties under cover of darkness . In the short night it was impossible to raise a pile of sand-bags high enough to overlook the breastworks . Toward the end of June this was changed in a single night by the skill and ingenuity of Colonel Edward Prince , of the 7th Illinois cavalry . Happening to be at headquarters when the trouble was being talked about , he heard an officer suggest making use of the empty hogsheads at the sugar-house ; how to get them to the trenches was the next question . This he promptly offered to solve if simply ordered to do it and left to himself . Cavalry had never been of any use in a siege , he said ; it was time for a change . The order was instantly given . Prince swung himself into the saddle and rode away . Before daylight his men had carried through the woods and over the hills to the mouth of the sap , opposite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make two tiers . The heads had been knocked in , a long pole thrust through each hogshead , and thus slung , it was easy for two mounted troopers to carry it between them . Quietly rolled into position by the working parties and rapidly filled with earth , a rude platform erected behind for the sharp-shooter to mount upon , with a few sand-bags thrown on top to protect his head ,  --  this was the beginning of the great trench cavalier , whose frowning crest the astonished Confederates awoke the next morning to find towering high above their heads . Afterwards enlarged and strengthened , it finally dominated the whole line of defence not only in its immediate front , but for a long distance on either side . Not less ingenious was the device almost instinctively resorted to by the artillerists for the safety of the gunners when , after the siege batteries opened , the Confederate sharp-shooters began picking off every head that came in sight . The first day saw a number of gunners stricken in the act of taking aim , an incident not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successors at the guns . The next sunrise saw every exposed battery , from right to left , protected by a hinged shutter made of flat iron chiefly taken from the sugar troughs , covered with strips of rawhide from the commissary 's , the space stuffed tight with loose cotton , and a hole made through all , big enough for the gunner 's eye , but too small for the sharp-shooter 's bullet . Such was substantially the plan simultaneously adopted at three or four different points and afterwards followed everywhere . The remedy was perfect . On the 3d of July arrangements were made for the daily detail of a brigade commander to act as General of the Trenches during a tour of twenty-four hours , from noon to noon . His duties were to superintend the siege operations , to post the guards of the trenches , to repulse sorties , and to protect the works . The works to be constructed were indicated and laid out by the Chief Engineer , whose duties , after the 17th of June , when Major Houston fell seriously ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overlooked by General Andrews , the Chief of Staff . Daily , at nine o'clock in the morning , the General of the Trenches and the Chief Engineer made separate reports to headquarters of everything that had happened during the previous day . Each of these officers made five reports , yet of the ten but two are to be found printed among the Official Records . These are the engineer 's reports of work done on the 5th and 6th of July . They contain almost the only details of the siege to be gathered from the record , notwithstanding the fact that every paper , however small , or irregular in size or form , or apparently unimportant in substance , that related in any way to the military operations of the Army of the Gulf was carefully preserved on the files of its Adjutant-General 's office , where , for safety as well as convenience , documents of this character were kept separate from the ordinary files covering matters of routine and requiring to be handled every day or hour . The proof is strong that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the War Office , where , for a considerable period after the close of the war , little or no care seems to have been taken of the documents thus turned in by the several Corps and Departments , as these were discontinued ; and although the care and management of the War Records division of the Adjutant-General 's Office at Washington has , from its earliest organization , been such as to deserve the highest admiration , yet many of these papers are not to be found there . The probability is that they were either mislaid or else swept away and destroyed before this office was organized . Palfrey 's report for the 5th of July shows the left cavalier finished and occupied , and the right cavalier nearly finished , but constantly injured by a 24-pounder gun that had so far escaped destruction by the artillery of the besiegers . The sap in front of Bainbridge 's battery , No. 8 , was advanced about twenty yards during this day , and the parallel in front of the priest-cap extended to the left eleven yards ; work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mine was so far advanced that a shaft was begun to run obliquely under the salient , this course being chosen instead of the usual plan of a vertical shaft with enveloping galleries , as shorter in time and distance , although more dangerous . On the 6th the sap was pushed forward forty-two feet , and the parallel carried to the left sixty-nine feet . The mine shaft , begun the day before , was carried about twenty-seven feet underground , directly toward the salient . The cavaliers were finished . During the 7th , although there is no report for that day , the shaft for the mine under the priest-cap was finished , the chamber itself excavated and charged with about twelve hundred pounds of powder , and the mine tamped with sand-bags . The mine on the left had been ready for some days ; it was now charged with fifteen hundred pounds of powder and tamped . Heavy thunder-storms , accompanied by warm rain , had been frequent of late , and the night dews had been at times heavy . Accordingly it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explosion of the mines to the chance of a damp fuse . Daybreak on the 9th of July having been set as the hour for the simultaneous explosion of the mines , to be instantly followed by one last rush through the gaps , Captain Walker was sent on the evening of the 7th , to the Richmond to ask for dry fuses from the magazines of the Navy . Meanwhile events were moving rapidly to an end . In the early morning of Tuesday , the 7th , the gunboat General Price came down the river bringing the great news that Vicksburg had surrendered to Grant on the 4th of July . Commodore Palmer , on board the Hartford , was the first to receive the news , but for some reason it happened that signal communication was obstructed or suspended between the Hartford and headquarters , so that it was not until a quarter before eleven that Colonel Kilby Smith , of Grant 's staff , delivered to Banks the welcome message of which he was the bearer . In less time than it takes to tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trenches bearing the brief announcement , " Vicksburg surrendered on the 4th of July . " This note , written upon the thin manifold paper of the field order-books , the General of the Trenches was directed to wrap securely around a clod of clay  --  the closest approach to a stone to be found in all the lowlands of Louisiana  --  and toss it over into the enemy 's works . At the same time the good news was sped by wire and by staff officers to the commanders of divisions . At noon a national salute was to be fired and all the bands were to play the national airs ; but the men could not wait for these slow formalities . No sooner was the first loud shout of rejoicing heard from the trenches , where for so many weary nights and days there had been little to rejoice at , than by a sort of instinct the men of both armies seem to have divined what had happened . From man to man , from company to company , from regiment to regiment , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers of the soldiers of the Union rang out , and again the forest echoed with the strains of " The Star-Spangled Banner " from the long-silent bands . Many a rough cheek , unused to tears , was wet that morning , and the sound of laughter was heard from many lips that had long been set in silence ; but when the first thrill was spent , it gave way to a deep-drawn sigh of relief . The work was done ; all the toil and suffering was over . Nor was this feeling restricted to the outside of the parapet ; the defenders felt it even more strongly . At first they received the news with real or affected incredulity . An officer of an Arkansas regiment , to whom was first handed the little scrap of tissue paper on which the whole chapter of history was told in seven words , acknowledged the complement by calling back , " This is another damned Yankee lie ! " Yet before many minutes were over the firing had died away , save here and there a scattering exception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of everything the men began to mingle and to exchange story for story , gibe for gibe , coffee for corn-beer , and when night fell there can have been few men in either army but believed the fighting was over . That evening Gardner summoned his commanders to meet him in council . Among them all there was but one thought  --  the end had come . Shortly after half-past twelve the notes of a bugle were heard on the Plains Store road sounding the signal , " Cease firing . " A few seconds later an officer with a small escort approached , bearing a lantern swung upon a long pole , with a white handkerchief tied beneath it , to serve as a flag of truce . At the outpost of Charles J. Paine 's brigade the flag was halted and its purpose ascertained . This was announced to be the delivery of an important despatch from Gardner to Banks . Thus it was that a few minutes after one o'clock the hoofs of two horses were heard at the same instant at headquarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in keeping with its story . One , a slow and measured trot , told of duty done and stables near ; the other , quick and nervous , spoke of pressing news . Two officers dismounted ; the clang of their sabres was heard together ; together they made their way to the tent where the writer of these lines lay awake and listening . One was Captain Walker , with the fuse , the other was Lieutenant Orton S. Clark , of the 116th New York , then attached to the staff of Charles J. Paine . The long envelope he handed in felt rough to the touch ; the light of a match showed its color a dull gray ; every inch of it said , " Surrender . " When opened it was found to contain a request for an official assurance as to the truth of the report that Vicksburg had surrendered . If true , Gardner asked for a cessation of hostilities with a view to consider terms . At a quarter-past one Banks replied , conveying an exact copy of so much of Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told when and how the despatch had come , and wound up by regretting that he could not consent to a truce for the purpose indicated . In order to avoid all chance of needless excitement or disturbance , as well as of the premature publication of the news , the Adjutant-General carried this despatch himself , and , accompanied by Lieutenant Clark , as well as , at his own request , by General Stone , rode first to Augur 's headquarters to acquaint him with the news and to borrow a bugler , and then to the outposts to meet the Confederate flag of truce . A blast upon the bugle brought back the little party of horsemen , with the lantern swaying from the pole ; but it was nearly daylight before they again returned with Gardner 's reply . Meanwhile , right and left word had been quietly passed to the pickets to cease firing . In his second letter Gardner said : " Having defended this position so long as I deem my duty requires , I am willing to surrender to you , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission , appointed by yourself , at nine o'clock this morning , for the purpose of agreeing upon and drawing up the terms of surrender , and for that purpose I ask a cessation of hostilities . Will you please designate a point outside of my breastworks where a meeting shall be held for this purpose ? " To this Banks answered at 4:30 A.M. : " I have designated Brigadier-General Charles P. Stone , Colonel Henry W. Birge , and Lieutenant-Colonel Richard B. Irwin as the officers to meet the commission appointed by you . They will meet your officers at the hour designated at a point near where the flag of truce was received this morning . I will direct that all active hostilities shall entirely cease on my part until further notice for the purpose stated . " The division commanders , as well as the commanders of the upper and lower fleets , were at once notified , and at six o'clock Captain Walker was sent to find Admiral Farragut , wherever he might be , and to deliver to him despatches conveying the news of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in La Fourche , and urging the Admiral to send all the light-draught gunboats at once to Berwick Bay . Banks meant to march Weitzel directly to the nearest landing , which was within the lines of Port Hudson , as soon as the formal capitulation should be accomplished , and to send Grover after him as fast as steamboats could be found . This called for many arrangements ; the occupying force had also to be seen to ; and finally , it was necessary that the starving garrison should be fed . Colonel Irwin was therefore relieved , at his own request , from duty as one of the commissioners , and Brigadier-General Dwight was named in his stead . This drew an objection from Weitzel , who naturally felt that there were claims of service as well as of rank that might have been considered before those of the temporary commander of the second division ; however , it was too late to make any further change , and when Banks offered to name Weitzel , whose protest had been not for himself but for his brigades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer was declined . Among the officers of the navy , too , especially those of higher grades , great cause of offense was felt that , after all their services in the siege , they were left unrepresented in the honors of the surrender . This feeling was natural enough ; yet before determining how far the complaints based on it were just , it is necessary to consider how important was every hour , almost every moment , with reference to the operations against Taylor , while three and a half hours were required to make the journey between headquarters and the upper fleet , and four and a half hours to reach the lower fleet . Moreover , the Admiral had gone to New Orleans the evening before . At nine the commissioners met under the shade of the beautiful trees , nearly on the spot where O'Brien had rested among his men while waiting for the word on the 27th of May . On the Confederate side the commissioners were Colonel William R. Miles , commanding the right wing of the garrison , Colonel I. G. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing , and Lieutenant-Colonel Marshall J. Smith , Chief of Heavy Artillery . Among those thus brought together there was more than one gentleman of marked conversational talent ; the day was pleasant , the shade grateful , and , to one side at least , the refreshment not less so ; and thus the time passed pleasantly until two o'clock , when the commissioners signed , with but a single change , the articles that had been drawn up for them and in readiness since six in the morning . The alteration was occasioned by the great and unexpected length to which the conference had been protracted . Five o'clock in the afternoon had been named as the time when the besiegers were to occupy the works ; this had to be changed to seven o'clock on the morning of the 9th . The terms , which will be found in full in the Appendix , were those of an unconditional surrender . Gardner , who was in waiting conveniently near , at once approved the articles , and at half-past two they were completed by the signature of Banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with provisions , that had been standing for hours in the Plains Store road , was signalled to go forward . The cheers that welcomed the train , as it wound its way up the long-untravelled road and through the disused sally-port , were perhaps not so loud as those with which the besiegers had greeted the news from Vicksburg , yet they were not less enthusiastic . From this moment the men of the two armies , and to some extent the officers , mingled freely . Andrews was designated to receive the surrender , and from each division two of the best regiments , with one from Weitzel 's brigade , were told off to occupy the place . Punctually at seven o'clock on the morning of the 9th of July the column of occupation entered the sally-port on the Jackson road . At its head rode Andrews with his staff . Next , in the post of honor , came the stormers with Birge at their head , then the 75th New York of Weitzel 's brigade , followed by the 116th New York and the 2d Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 13th Connecticut of Grover 's division , the 6th Michigan and the 14th Maine of Dwight 's division , and 4th Wisconsin and the 8th New Hampshire of Paine's. ( 3 ) With the column was Duryea 's battery . The 38th Massachusetts was at first designated for this coveted honor , but lost it through some necessary changes due to the intended movement down the river . Weitzel , with his own brigade under Thomas , on the way to the place of embarkation , closely followed the column and witnessed the ceremonies . These were simple and short . The Confederate troops were drawn up in line , Gardner at their head , every officer in his place . The right of the line rested on the edge of the open plain south of the railway station ; the left extended toward the village . At the word " Ground arms " from their tried commander , followed by the command of execution from the bugles , every Confederate soldier bowed his head and laid his musket on the ground in token of submission , while Gardner himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few complimentary words , waived its acceptance . At the same instant the Stars and Bars , the colors of the Confederacy , were hauled down from the flagstaff , where they had so long waived defiance ; a detachment of sailors from the naval batteries sprang to the halyards and rapidly ran up the flag of the United States ; the guns of Duryea 's battery saluted the colors ; the garrison filed off as prisoners of war , and all was over . The last echo of the salute to the colors had hardly died away when Weitzel , at the head of the First Division , now for the first time united , marched off to the left , and began embarking on board the transports to go against Taylor . With the place were taken 6,340 prisoners of war , of whom 405 were officers and 5,935 enlisted men . The men were paroled with the exact observance of all the forms prescribed by the cartel then in form ; yet the paroles were immediately declared void by the Confederate government , and the men were required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in accordance with the retaliatory orders of the period , had to be kept in captivity ; they were , however , given the choice of their place of confinement . About 211 elected to go to Memphis , and were accordingly sent up the river a few days after the surrender , the remainder were sent to New Orleans with instructions to Emory to keep them safely under guard in some commodious house or houses , to be selected by him , and to make them as comfortable as practicable. ( 4 ) There were also captured 20 pieces of light artillery and 31 pieces of field artillery ; of these 12 heavy guns and 30 light guns were in comparatively good order . The total losses of the Corps during the siege were 45 officers and 663 men killed , 191 officers and 3,145 men wounded , 12 officers and 307 men captured or missing ; in all , 4,363 . Very few prisoners were taken by the Confederates , and little doubt remains that a large proportion of those set down as captured or missing in reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever made . A partial return , without date , signed by the chief surgeon , shows 176 killed , 447 wounded , total 632 . In this report the number of those that had died in the hospital is included among the wounded . Nor does this total include the losses at Plains Store , which , according to the surgeon 's return , were 12 killed and 36 wounded , or , according to Colonel Miles 's report , 8 killed , 23 wounded , 58 missing ; in all , 89 . Major C. M. Jackson , who acted as assistant inspector-general under Gardner , and , according to his own account , came out through the lines of investment about an hour after the surrender , reported to Johnston that the total casualties during the siege were 200 killed , between 300 and 400 wounded , and 200 died from sickness . ( 1 ) The figures here given do not agree with those of the monthly and tri-monthly returns for May and June . These returns are , however , simply the returns for March carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reports of regiments , brigades , and divisions during active operations . ( 2 ) Colonel Provence , in his report , claims 7 prisoners , and says : " The enemy fired but once , and then at a great distance . " ( Official Records , vol. xxvi. , part I. , p. 150. ) ( 3 ) No record exists of these details , but the list here given is believed to be nearly correct . ( 4 ) As evidence of the considerate manner in which these gentlemen were treated , see the interesting article , " Plain Living on Johnson 's Island , " by Lieutenant Horace Carpenter , 4th Louisiana , printed in the Century for March , 1891 , page 706 . CHAPTER XIX . HARROWING LA FOURCHE . It will be remembered that when Banks marched to Opelousas , Taylor 's little army , greatly depleted by wholesale desertion and hourly wearing away by the roadside , broke into two fragments , the main body of the cavalry retiring , under Mouton , toward the Sabine , while the remainder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last to Natchitoches . As soon as Kirby Smith became aware that his adversary was advancing to the Red River , he prepared to meet the menace by concentrating on Shreveport the whole available force of the Confederacy in the Trans-Mississippi from Texas to Missouri , numbering , according to his own estimate , 18,000 effectives . He accordingly called on Magruder for two brigades and drew in from the line of the Arkansas the division of John G. Walker . However , this concentration became unnecessary and was given up the instant Smith learned that Banks had crossed the Atchafalaya and the Mississippi and had sat down before Port Hudson . While this movement was in progress , Walker was on the march toward Natchitoches or Alexandria , by varying routes , according as the plans changed to suit the news of the day . Taylor observed Banks and followed his march to Simmesport , while Mouton hung upon the rear and flank of Chickering 's column , guarding the big wagon-train and the spoils of the Teche campaign . Then Kirby Smith , not caring as yet to venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division back into Northern Louisiana and try to break up Grant 's campaign by interrupting his communications opposite Vicksburg ; but this attempt turned out badly , for Grant had already given up his communications on the west bank of the Mississippi and restored them on the east , and Taylor 's forces , after passing from Lake Catahoula by Little River into the Tensas , ascending that stream to the neighborhood of Richmond and occupying that town on the 3d of May , were roughly handled on the 7th in an ill-judged attempt to take Young 's Point and Milliken 's Bend . Then , leaving Walker with orders to do what damage he could along the river bank  --  which was not much  --  and , if possible , as it was not , to throw supplies of beef and corn into Vicksburg , Taylor went back to Alexandria and prepared for his campaign in La Fourche , from which Kirby Smith 's superior orders had diverted him . Meanwhile nearly a month had passed and Walker , after coming down to the Red River , a week too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan was for Major , with his brigade of cavalry , to cross the Atchafalaya at Morgan 's Ferry , while Taylor himself , with the main body under Mouton , should attempt the surprise and capture of Brashear : then , if successful , the whole army could be thrown into La Fourche , while in case of failure Major could easily return by the way he came . Major left Washington on the 10th of June , marched twenty-eight miles to Morgan 's Ferry , by a road then high and dry although in April Banks had found it under water , and crossing the Atchafalaya on the 14th rode along the Bayou Fordoche with the intention of striking the river at the Hermitage ; but a broken bridge turned him northward round the sweep of False River toward Waterloo . Sage was at False Point with six companies of his 110th New York , a squadron of the 2d Rhode Island cavalry , and a section of Carruth 's battery . As soon as he found the enemy approaching in some force he moved down the levee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance of gaining and giving timely notice of Major 's operation . Major on his part rode off by the Grosstete through Plaquemine , as already related , and so down the Mississippi to Donaldsonville , having passed on the way three garrisons without being seen by any one on board . Making a feint on Fort Butler , Major , under cover of the night , took the cut-off road and struck the Bayou La Fourche six miles below Donaldsonville ; thence he rode on to Thibodeaux , entering the town at daylight on the 21st of June . At Thibodeaux Major picked up all the Union soldiers in the place to the number of about 100 , mostly convalescents . Soon after taking command in New Orleans , Emory had begun to look forward to what might happen in La Fourche , as well as to the possible consequences to New Orleans itself . The forces in the district were the 23d Connecticut , Colonel Charles E. L. Holmes , and the 176th New York , Colonel Charles C. Nott , both regiments scattered along the railroad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruits of the 1st Indiana , under Captain F. W. Noblett , occupying the field works at Brashear , and two companies of the 28th Maine at Fort Butler . About this time Holmes , who as the senior colonel had commanded the district since Weitzel quitted it to enter on the Teche campaign , resigned on account of ill-health . Nott and Wordin , the lieutenant-colonel of the 23d , were on the sick-list . Finding the country thus feebly occupied and the service yet more feebly performed , as early as the 7th of June , Emory had chosen a very intelligent and spirited young officer of the 47th Massachusetts , Lieutenant-Colonel Albert Stickney , placed him in command of the district , without regard to rank , and sent him over the line to Brashear to put things straight . In this work Stickney was engaged , when , at daylight on the morning of the 20th of June , he received a telegram from Emory conveying the news that the Confederates were advancing on La Fourche Crossing ; so he left Major Anthony , of the 2d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point where the danger threatened . When , on the afternoon of the 21st of June , the Confederate force drew near , Stickney found himself in command of a medley of 838 men belonging to eight different organizations  --  namely , 195 of the 23d Connecticut , 154 of the 176th New York , 46 of the 42d Massachusetts , 37 of the 26th Maine , 306 of the 26th Massachusetts , 50 troopers of the 1st Louisiana cavalry , 20 artillerymen , chiefly of the 1st Indiana , and one section , with 30 men , of Grow 's 25th New York battery . The levee at this point was about twelve feet high , forming a natural fortification , which Stickney took advantage of and strengthened by throwing up slight rifle-pits on his flanks . These had only been carried a few yards , and were nowhere more than two feet high , when , about seven o'clock in the evening , under cover of the darkness , Major attacked . The attack was led by Pyron 's regiment , reported by Major as 206 strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters of Stickney 's force . For this result the credit is largely due to the gallantry and good judgment of Major Morgan Morgan , Jr. , of the 176th New York , and the steadiness of his men , inspired by his example . Grow 's guns being separated and one of them without support , this piece was abandoned by its gunners and fell for the moment into the hands of the Confederates ; the other piece , placed by Grow himself to protect the flank , poured an effective enfilade fire upon Pyron 's column . Stickney 's loss was 8 killed and 41 wounded , including Lieutenant Starr , of the 23d Connecticut , whose hurt proved mortal . The Confederate loss is not reported , but Stickney says he counted 53 of their dead on the field , and afterward found nearly 60 wounded in the hospitals at Thibodeaux . The next morning , June 22d , their dead and wounded were removed under a flag of truce. ( 1 ) While the flag was out , Cahill came up from New Orleans with the 9th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the remainder of Grow 's battery . This gave Stickney about 1,100 men , with four guns in position and six field-pieces . Cahill 's arrival was seen by Major , who , after waiting all day in a drenching rain , began to think his condition rather critical ; accordingly , at nine o'clock in the evening he set out to force his way to Brashear , where he was expecting to find Green . Riding hard , he arrived at the east bank of Bayou Boeuf late the next afternoon , and , crossing by night , at daylight on the 24th he had completely surrounded the post of Bayou Boeuf , and was just about to attack , when he saw the white flag that announced the surrender of the garrison to Mouton . Before this , Captain Julius Sanford , of the 23d Connecticut , set fire to the sugar-house filled with the baggage and clothing of the troops engaged at Port Hudson . Meanwhile , for the surprise of Brashear , Mouton had collected thirty-seven skiffs and boats of all sorts near the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the lead of Major Sherod Hunter . At nightfall on the 22d of June Hunter set out , and by daylight the next morning his whole party had safely landed in the rear of the defences of Brashear , while Green , with three battalions and two batteries of his command , stood on the western bank of Berwick Bay , ostentatiously attracting the attention of the unsuspicious garrison , and three more regiments were in waiting on Gibbon 's Island , ready to make use of Hunter 's boats in support of his movement . Banks meant to have broken up the great depot of military stores at Brashear , and to have removed to Algiers or New Orleans all regimental baggage and other property that had gone into store at Brashear and the Boeuf before and after the Teche campaign ; such were his orders , but for some reason not easy to explain they had not been carried out . Besides the Indianians , who numbered about 30 all told , there were at Brashear four companies  --  D , G , I , K  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , about 150 strong , and one company , or the equivalent of a company , of the 42d Massachusetts , making in all rather less than 400 effectives ; there were also about 300 convalescents , left behind by nearly thirty regiments . Notwithstanding the vast quantity of stores committed to their care , including the effects of their comrades , and in spite of all warnings , so slack and indifferent was the performance of duty on the part of the garrison of Brashear that , on the morning of the 23d of June , the reveille was sounded for them by the guns of the Valverde battery . Thus sharply aroused , without a thought of what might happen in the rear , the garrison gave its whole attention to returning , with the heavy guns , the fire of Green 's field-pieces across Berwick Bay . Soon the gunboat Hollyhock backed down the bay and out of the action , and thus it was that about half-past six Hunter 's men , running out of the woods toward the railway station , and making known their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , and , after a short and desultory fight , more than 700 officers and men gave up their swords and laid down their arms to a little less than one half of their own number . Of the men , nearly all were well enough to march to Algiers four days later , after being paroled . Worse still , they abandoned a fortified position with 11 heavy guns  --  24- , 30- , and 32-pounders . The Confederate loss was 3 killed and 18 wounded . Hunter says the Union troops lost 46 killed and 40 wounded , but about this there seems to be some mistake , for the proportion is unusual , and the whole loss of the 23d Connecticut in killed and wounded was but 7 , of the 176th New York but 12 . Green crossed Berwick Bay as fast as he could , and pushing on found the post at Bayou Ramos abandoned . The Union troops stationed there had retired to Bayou Boeuf , and so at daylight on the 24th , without feeling or firing a single shot , the united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , with four guns , commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Duganne , of the 176th New York , promptly surrendered to the first bold summons of a handful of Green 's adventurous scouts riding five miles ahead of their column . Taylor now turned over the immediate command of the force to Mouton and hastened back to Alexandria to bring down Walker , in order to secure and extend his conquests . Mouton marched at once on Donaldsonville . When the Union forces at La Fourche Crossing found the Confederates returning in such strength , they made haste to fall back on New Orleans , and were followed as far as Boutte Station by Waller 's and Pyron 's battalions . On the 27th of June , Green , with his own brigade , Major 's brigade , and Semmes 's battery appeared before Donaldsonville , and demanded the surrender of the garrison of Fort Butler . This was a square redoubt , placed in the northern angle between the bayou and the Mississippi , designed to command and protect the river gateway to La Fourche , mounting four guns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parapet was high and thick , like the levee , and was surrounded by a deep ditch , the flanks on the bayou and the river being further protected by stout stockades extending from the levees to the water , at ordinary stages . The work was now held by a mixed force of 180 men , comprising two small companies of the 28th Maine  --  F , Captain Edward B. Neal , and G , Captain Augustine Thompson ,  --  besides a number of convalescents of various regiments . Major Joseph D. Bullen , of the 28th , was in command , and with him at the time was Major Henry M. Porter , of the 7th Vermont , provost-marshal of the parish of Iberville , whose quarters in the town on the other side of the bayou were no longer tenable . Farragut , who had gone down to New Orleans and hoisted his flag on the Pensacola , leaving Palmer and Alden in command of the upper and lower fleets before Port Hudson , had disposed his gunboats so as to patrol the river in sections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Donaldsonville ; the Winona , Lieutenant-Commander A. W. Weaver , near Plaquemine ; and the Kineo , Lieutenant-Commander John Watters , between Bonnet Carre and the Red Church . As soon as the Confederates appeared before Donaldsonville , Woolsey was notified , and couriers were sent up and down the river to summon the Winona and the Kineo . Green brought to the attack six regiments and one battery , between 1,300 and 1,500 strong , ( 2 ) including three regiments of his own brigade , the 4th , 5th , and 7th Texas , and three regiments of Major 's brigade  --  Lane 's , Stone 's , and Phillips 's . The river , and therefore the bayou , were now low , exposing wide margins of batture , and Green 's plan was , while surrounding and threatening the fort on its land faces , to gain an entrance on the water front by crossing the batture and passing around the ends of the stockades . At ten minutes past midnight the red light of a Coston signal from the fort announced to the Navy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fight was opened by the Confederates with musketry . Instantly the fort replied with the fire of its guns , and of every musket that could be brought to the parapet . Five minutes later the Princess Royal , which , since nightfall , had been under way and cleared for action , began shelling the woods on the right of the fort , firing a few 9-inch and 30-pounder shells over the works and down the bayou , followed presently by 30-pounder and 20-pounder shrapnel and 9-inch grape , fired at point-blank range in the direction of the Confederate yells . The assault was made in the most determined manner . Shannon , with the 5th Texas , passed some of his men around the end of the river stockade , others climbed and helped one another over , some tried to cut it down with axes , many fired through the loopholes ; Phillips made a circuit of the fort and tried the bayou stockade , while Herbert 's 7th Texas attempted to cross the ditch on the land side . The fight at the stockade was desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning this barrier found an impassable obstacle in the ditch , whose existence , strange to say , they had not even suspected . Here the combatants fought hand to hand ; even the sick , who had barely strength to walk from the hospital to the rampart , took part in the defence . The Texans assailed the defenders with brickbats ; these the Maine men threw back upon the heads of the Texans ; on both sides numbers were thus injured . Lane , who was to have supported Phillips , somehow went adrift , and Hardeman , who was to have attacked the stockade on the bayou side , was delayed by his guide , but toward daylight he came up to join in the last attack . By way of a diversion , Stone had crossed the bayou to the east bank on a bridge of sugar coolers , and his part in the fight was confined to yells . At a quarter before four the yelling , which had gone on continuously for more than two hours , suddenly died away , the fire slackened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few minutes later the Winona came down and opened fire , and at half-past four the Kineo hove in sight . The fight was ended . " The smoke clearing away , " says Woolsey , " discovered the American flag flying over the fort . Gave three cheers and came to anchor . " Yet the same sun rose upon a ghastly sight  --  upon green slopes gray with the dead , the dying , and the maimed , and the black ditch red with their blood . Green puts his loss at 40 killed , 114 wounded , 107 missing , in all 261 . However , during the 28th , the Princess Royal and the Kineo received on board from the provost-marshal 124 prisoners , by actual count , including 1 lieutenant-colonel , 2 major , 3 captains , and 5 lieutenants ; and Lieutenant-Commander Woolsey says the garrison buried 69 Confederates and were " still at it . " Among the Confederates killed was Shannon , and among the missing Phillips . Of the garrison , 1 officer , Lieutenant Isaac Murch , of the 28th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 11 men wounded  --  in all 21 . The Princess Royal had 1 man killed , 2 wounded . The vessel was struck in twenty places by grape-shot . Green has been sharply criticised for the apparent recklessness with which he delivered his assault , even after having announced to Mouton his intention of waiting ; yet it is clear that he was sent there to attack ; if he was to attack at all , he had nothing to gain by waiting ; an assault by daylight would have been wholesale suicide ; while , on the other hand , the garrison would unquestionably be reinforced by troops and gunboats before another night . Having paid this tribute to his judgment , and to his daring and the intrepidity of his men the homage that every soldier feels to be his due , one may be allowed to quote without comment this passage from Green 's report of the affair , in naked frankness hardly surpassed even among the writings of Signor Benvenuto Cellini : " At daylight I sent in a flag of truce , asking permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was refused , as I expected . My object in sending the flag so early was to get away a great number of our men , who had found a little shelter near the enemy 's works , and who would have been inevitably taken prisoners . I must have saved one hundred men by instructing my flag-of-truce officer , as he approached the fort , to order our troops to steal away . " Bullen 's message to Emory has the true ring : " The enemy have attacked us , and we have repulsed them . I want more men ; I must have more men . " Emory responded with the remaining two companies of the 28th Maine , that had been left near New Orleans when the regiment moved to Port Hudson , and Banks relieved the 1st Louisiana on the lines and sent it at once to Donaldsonville , with two sections of Closson 's battery under Taylor , and Stone to command . This put the place out of peril . Even this bright spot on the dull , dark background was not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July , Bullen , the hero of this heroic defence , whose name deserves to live in the memory of all that love a sturdy man , a stout heart , a steady mind , or a brave deed , was murdered by a tipsy mutineer of the relieving force . On Friday , the 14th of August , 1863 , this wretched man , Francis Scott , private of Company F , 1st Louisiana , suffered the military penalty of his crime . Taylor now gave up the attempt to capture the position at Donaldsonville , and devoted his attention to a blockade of the river by establishing his batteries at various points behind the natural fortification formed by the levee . Seven guns , under Faries , were placed on Gaudet 's plantation , opposite Whitehall Point , while the guns of Semmes , Nichols , and Cornay were planted opposite College Point and at Fifty-five Mile Point , commanding Grand View reach . On the 3d of July Semmes opened fire on the Union transports , as they were approaching College Point on their way up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time until after the surrender no transport passed up , except under convoy , and it was only with great difficulty that even the fastest boats made their way down with the help of the current . When this state of things was reported to Farragut , who had gone back to Port Hudson , he sent to New Orleans for his Chief of Staff , Captain Jenkins , to come up , in order that he himself might once more go down and give his personal attention to the affair . On the 7th of July the Tennessee started from New Orleans with Jenkins aboard ; she had successfully run the gauntlet of the batteries , when , between eight and nine o'clock in the evening , as Faries was firing his last rounds , a solid shot struck and instantly killed Commander Abner Read . Captain Jenkins was , at the same time , wounded by a flying fragment of a broken cutlass . Of the crew two were killed and four wounded . On the 8th the Saint Mary 's , a fine seagoing steamer and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Emerson , Acting-Assistant Adjutant-General , with important despatches from headquarters to Emory and to the Chief Quartermaster , when , about three o'clock in the morning , she drew the fire of all the Confederate guns . The Princess Royal and the Kineo convoyed her past the upper battery , but from this point she had to trust to her speed and her low freeboard . In rounding Fifty-five Mile Point she was struck five times , one conical shell and one shrapnel penetrating her side above the water-line and bursting inboard . At half-past six on the morning of the 9th of July , Farragut , who had left Port Hudson on the Monongahela on the evening of the 7th , started from Donaldsonville with the Essex , Kineo , and Tennessee in company , ran the gauntlet of the batteries , swept and silenced them with his broadsides , and endured for nearly two hours a brisk musketry fire from the enemy without serious loss suffered or inflicted . At half-past one o'clock on the morning of the 10th of July , the gunboat New London , bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrender of Port Hudson , came under the fire of Faries 's battery , opposite Whitehall . She was very soon disabled by a shot through her boilers , and was run ashore near the left bank , where the Tennessee and the Essex came to her assistance from below . Landing on the east bank , Captain Walker made his way afoot down the river along the levee until he came in sight of the Monongahela , when , at six o'clock in the morning , his signals being perceived , he was taken aboard in one of the ship 's boats and communicated to the admiral the good news that the campaign was at an end . To dispose of Taylor could be but a matter of a few days ; then once more , in the words of Lincoln , would the great river flow " unvexed to the sea . " Taylor 's plans were well laid , and had been brilliantly executed . In no other way , with the force at his disposal , could he have performed a greater service for his cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had had everything his own way : he had overrun La Fourche ; his guns commanded the river ; his outposts were within twenty miles of the city ; he even talked of capturing New Orleans , but this , in the teeth of an alert and powerful fleet , was at best but a midsummer fancy . In New Orleans , indeed , great was the excitement when it became known that the Confederate forces were so near . In Taylor 's army were the friends , the brothers , the lovers , the husbands , even the fathers of the inhabitants . In the town were many thousands of registered enemies , and of paroled Confederate prisoners of all ranks . At one time there were no Union troops in the city , save a detachment of the 42d Massachusetts , barely two hundred and fifty strong . But the illness that had deprived Emory 's division of its leader in the field had given to New Orleans a commander of a courage and firmness that now , as always , rose with the approach of danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose character had earned the respect of the townspeople . These , though their hearts beat high and their pulses were tremulous with emotion , conducted themselves with a propriety and an outward calmness that reflected the highest credit upon their virtue and their good sense . Yet , when all that was possible had been done , things were at such a pass that , on the 4th of July , Emory thought it imperative to speak out . " I respectfully suggest , " he wrote to Banks , " that unless Port Hudson be already taken , you can only save this city by sending me reinforcements immediately and at any cost . It is a choice between Port Hudson and New Orleans . " Banks made the choice with serenity and without a moment 's hesitation determined to run the remote risk of losing New Orleans for the moment , with the destruction of Taylor 's army in reserve as a consolation , rather than to insure himself against this peril at the price of instant disaster at Port Hudson , even on the very eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply sent from headquarters on the 5th to Emory 's urgent appeal , " can last but two or three days longer at the outside , and then the whole command will be available to drive back the enemy who is now annoying our communications and threatening New Orleans . " So the event proved and such was now the task to be performed . Augur , who had been ill for some time , yet unwilling to relinquish his command , now found himself unfitted for the summer campaign that seemed in prospect . He accordingly turned over his division to Weitzel , took leave of absence on surgeon 's certificate , and went North to recruit his health . Shortly afterward he was assigned to the command of the Department of Washington and did not rejoin the Nineteenth Corps . Weitzel , as has been said , took transport on the 9th of July immediately after the formal capitulation . Getting under way toward evening , he landed at Donaldsonville early the next morning . His presence there so threatened the flank and front of Taylor 's forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and the calling in of all detachments . Morgan , with Grover 's First brigade and Nims 's battery , followed Weitzel about midnight on the 10th , and Grover himself , with his other two brigades , on the 11th . During the night of that day , Grover therefore found himself before Donaldsonville , holding both banks of Bayou La Fourche with two divisions . He was confronted by Green with his own brigade and Major 's , together with the batteries that had lately been annoying the transports and drawing the attention of the gunboats on the river . When , on the 10th , Green saw the transports coming down the Mississippi laden with troops , it did not at once occur to him that Port Hudson was lost ; he simply thought these troops were coming to attack him . Concentrating his whole force , he posted Major with four regiments and four guns on the left or east bank of the bayou , and on the right or west bank three regiments and two guns of his own brigade . Green 's pickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took more ground in his front , Green drew back toward Paincourtville . On the morning of the 13th of July , without any intention of bringing on a battle or of hastening the enemy 's movements , but merely to gain a little more elbow-room and to find new fields for forage for his animals , Grover moved out an advance guard on either side of the bayou . " The enemy is evidently making preparation , " he said in his despatch of the 12th before ordering this movement , " to escape if pursued by a strong force or to resist a small one . Our gunboats can hardly be expected at Brashear City for some days , and it is evidently injudicious to press them until their retreat is cut off . " Dudley , with two sections of Carruth 's battery under Phelps and with Barrett 's troop , marched on the right bank of the bayou , supported by Charles J. Paine 's brigade with Haley 's battery . Morgan , under the orders of Birge , temporarily commanding Grover 's division , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went forward slowly until , about six miles out , they found themselves upon the estate of the planter whose name is variously spelled Cox , Koch , and Kock . Here , as Dudley and Morgan showed no disposition to attack , Green took the initiative , and , favored by a narrow field , a rank growth of corn , dense thickets of willows , the deep ditches common to all sugar plantations in these lowlands , and his own superior knowledge of the country , he fell suddenly with his whole force upon the heads of Dudley 's and Morgan 's columns , and drove them in almost before they were aware of the presence in their front of anything more than the pickets , whom they had been seeing for two days and who had been falling back before them . Morgan handled his brigade badly , and soon got it , or suffered it to fall , into a tangle whence it could only extricate itself by retiring . This fairly exposed the flank of Dudley , who was making a good fight , but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the fierce onset of Green 's Texans . The result of this bad mismanagement was that the whole command was in effect clubbed and on both banks driven back about a mile , until Paine came to its support ; then Grover rode out , and , seeing what had happened , drew in his whole force . Grover 's losses in this affair , called the battle of Cox 's Plantation , were 2 officers and 54 men killed , 7 officers and 210 men wounded , 3 officers and 183 men captured or missing ; in all 465 . To add to the reproach of this rough treatment at the hands of an inferior force , two guns were lost , one of the 1st Maine battery and one of the 6th Massachusetts , but without the least fault on the part of the artillerists . After the close of the campaign Colonel Morgan was arraigned before a general court-martial upon charges of misbehavior before the enemy and drunkenness on duty , and , being found guilty upon both charges , was sentenced to be cashiered and utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States ; but Banks disapproved the proceedings , findings , and sentence on the ground that the evidence appeared to him too conflicting and unsatisfactory . " The execution of this sentence , " his order continue , " is suspended until the pleasure of the President can be known . " When the record with this decision reached the Judge Advocate-General of the Army at Washington , he sent it back to Banks with instructions that , as no sentence remained for the action of the President , the proceedings were at an end and Colonel Morgan must be released from arrest . This was accordingly done on the 26th of October , 1863 . Green puts his loss at 3 killed and 30 wounded , including 6 mortally wounded . The Union loss , he says , was " little less than 1,000 ; there were over 500 of the enemy killed and wounded , of whom 200 were left out on the field , and about 250 prisoners . " When , on the evening of the 14th of July , at Port Hudson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donaldsonville to confer with Grover and Weitzel on the situation and the plan of campaign . It was agreed on all hands that it was inexpedient to press Taylor hard or to hasten his movements in any way until time should have been allowed for the light-draught gunboats to re-enter Berwick Bay and thus gain control of Taylor 's line of retreat . In thus refraining from any attempt to avenge promptly what must be regarded as a military affront , the depleted ranks and the wearied condition of the troops were perhaps taken into account , and , moreover , it must have been considered to the last degree inadvisable to entangle the command in the dense swamps that would have to be crossed , after pushing Taylor prematurely back from the fertile and comparatively high lands that border the Bayou La Fourche . Then Banks continued on to New Orleans , where he arrived on the 18th , and renewed his pressure on the admiral for the gunboats ; but , unfortunately , the gunboats were not to be had . Of those that had accompanied the army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble Hollyhock , had remained in Berwick Bay after the army descended the Red River , crossed the Atchafalaya , and moved on Port Hudson . The others , with the transports , had followed the movements of the troops and had been caught above the head of the Atchafalaya when the waters fell . Thus they had long been without repairs and not one of them was now in condition for immediate service . The water on the bar at the mouth of the Atchafalaya was now nearly at its lowest point , so that even of the light-draught gunboats only the lightest could cross . Accordingly it was not until the 22d of July that the Estrella and Clifton made their appearance in Berwick Bay and put an end to Taylor 's operations . On the afternoon of the 21st of July , knowing that the gunboats were coming , Taylor set the finishing touch to his incursion by burning the rolling-stock of the railway and running the engines into the bay . He had already destroyed the bridges as far back as Tigerville , thus rendering the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . On the morning of the 25th the advance of Weitzel 's brigade , under Lieutenant-Colonel Peck , consisting of his own 12th Connecticut and the 13th Connecticut , commanded by Captain Comstock , arrived at Brashear by steamer from Donaldsonville , and , landing , once more took possession of the place ; but in the meantime Taylor had safely withdrawn to the west bank , and gone into camp on the Teche with all of his army intact and all his materials and supplies and most of his captures safe . ( 1 ) The history of the 23d Connecticut says : " We delivered to them 108 dead . We captured 40 prisoners . "  --  " Connecticut in the War , " p. 757. ( 2 ) When Green says 800 , he of course refers to the four regiments actually engaged in the assault ; for , after losing , as he says , 261 of these 800 , he makes the four regiments of Major 's brigade , with two sections of Faries 's battery , number 800 ; while his own force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 750. 800 + 750 + 261 = 1,811 . CHAPTER XX . IN SUMMER QUARTERS . Before Banks parted with Grover at Donaldsonville , he left orders for the troops to rest and go into " summer quarters " as soon as the pending operation should be decided . Accordingly , in the last days of July , Weitzel broke away from the discomforts of muddy , dusty , shadeless Donaldsonville , and marching down the bayou , once more took up his quarters near Napoleonville and Thibodeaux , and encamped his men at ease among the groves and orchards of the garden of La Fourche . On the 16th of July the steamboat Imperial , from St. Louis on the 8th , rounded to at the levee at New Orleans in token that the great river was once more free . The next day she set out on her return trip . On the 5th of August a despatch from Halleck , dated the 23d of July , was received and published in orders : " I congratulate you and your army on the crowning success of the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last blow to open the Mississippi River . The country , and especially the great West , will ever remember with gratitude their services . " Afterwards , on the 28th of January , 1864 , Congress passed a joint resolution of thanks " to Major-General Nathaniel P. Banks and the officers and soldiers under his command for the skill , courage , and endurance which compelled the surrender of Port Hudson , and thus removed the last obstruction to the free navigation of the Mississippi River . " Admiral Porter now came down the river to New Orleans in his flagship Black Hawk , and arranged to relieve Admiral Farragut from the trying duty of patrolling and protecting the river , so long borne by the vessels of his fleet . Farragut then took leave of absence and went North , leaving the West Gulf Squadron to Commodore Bell . When Port Hudson surrendered , two of the nine-months ' regiments had already served beyond their time . The 4th Massachusetts claimed its discharge on the 26th of June , the 50th four days later , insisting that their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being without information from Washington on this point , Banks counted the time from the muster-in of the field and staff , and therefore wished to hold these regiments respectively eighty-one and forty-two days longer , or at all events until the receipt of instructions or the end of the siege . To this view officers and men alike objected , many of them so strongly that whole companies refused duty . They were within their lawful rights , yet , better counsels quickly prevailing , all consented to stay , and did good service to the last . Of seven other regiments the term of enlistment was on the point of expiring . They were the 21st , 22d , 24th , and 26th Maine , the 52d Massachusetts , the 26th Connecticut , and the 16th New Hampshire . These nine regiments were now detached from the divisions to which they belonged and placed under the orders of Andrews to form part of the garrison of Port Hudson until the transports should be r//               @ @ @ @ @ @
