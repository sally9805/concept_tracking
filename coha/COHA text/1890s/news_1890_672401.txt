txt Baatiano Ipaldo , an Italian bootblack , was killed at 4:40 o'clock yesterday afternoon , apparently by electricity from a wire of the .. United States Illuminating Company . The idea thatthe public has been permitted to oheriSh of late that human life was no longer in danger from the electric lighting wires was thus shown to have no good basis . The killing occurred in front of the Parmly Building , at ** Ipaldo , the ** besides blaoking boots , did other odd jobs , and was yesterday afternoon engaged in washing the windows of the Inter-State National Bank , which is on . the first floor above the basement of the Parmly Building . In the basement of the building is the Buffet Lunch . Over the door and ' Window of the lunch room is a broad awning , which was yesterday drawn up . This awning and the ledges of the bank windows formed a footing for Ipaldo while at his work . Four wires from a pole in the street enter the building just under one of the windows at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building from a point on the pole considerably higher than the. , point where they enter the building . . It would have been easy , therefore , for Ipaldo to have put his foot on one of the wires where it entered the building and to grasp the wire in his hand further up . That appears to be what he did and what led to his death . The story of an eye ' witness and the marks on the body confirm that belief . John Wood , janitor of the building at 170 Broadway , opposite where the killing occurred , says that he saw Ipaldo come out of the bank , window preparatory to cleaning it . He had been outside only a moment or two when Wood saw him lean over and grasp 4i , wire . " There . was nothing about that , " says Mr. Wood , " to attract attention until his hand grasping the wire began to smoke . Then a blue flame could be seen . But all this happened in less time than it takes to tell it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian grasped the wire before he fell headlong . There was no writhing and no cry . He fell the one story from the bank window to the grating at the entrance of the basement and then the crowd began to gather . " Officer Mulrooney of the Broadway squad was on the opposite side of Broadway at the time , but did not see Ipaldo until after he had fallen . He then crossed over to him and found hire still breathing . The officer immediately sent a call to the Chambers Street Hospital for an ambulance and began clearing the street . The ambulance arrived in seven or eight minutes , but Ipaldo was then dead . The officer states that he lived two and a half minutes after his fall . The police took the body to the Second Precinct Station House . Frank Bailey of 91 Sixth Avenue , who is employed in the Buffet lunch , is mentioned by the police as one of the eye-witnesses . Mr. Bailey said last night that he did not see the man fall , but heard him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still breathing . " I had just served a with customer a glass of soda water , " he said . " and the customer had just gone out and I was preparing to go home . The noise of the fall was loud , and produced a severe shock . I supposed a heavy sign had fallen . But I went out and saw : a man lying on his back there , still breathing . He moved slightly , but did not live long . " Mr. W. A. Downes of East Orange , N. Ja was ' just coming out of the Buffet where Bailey had served him with a glass of soda water . " As I came out of the door , " said Mr. Downes , " somethingiell in front of me so near that it touched ' my hat and person . If I had held out my arms I should have caught it . Of course I was startled for I could not imagine for a moment what had happened . Then I saw the figure of a man lying on the grating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made a slight move . But I did not wait . The man appeared to be still alive when I left . I felt as if I had had a narrow escape . Had the man fallen on me I should have been crushed . " The police say that Ipaldo struck almost on the flat of his back . When the body was examined a burn two inches long and half as broad was found on the sole of the left shoe , and the left hand was badly burned and discolored . Between the thumb and forefinger a spot as large as a flve-oent nickel was burned through the skin and into the flesh . The whole inside of the hand was badly blackened with fire or smoke . Otherwise the body did .. not present any unusual feature . The place where the accident occurred was carefully looked over by reporters after the crowd had dispersed . A piece of the insulation from one of the wires was found lying on the window sill . An iron brace by which a sign ? ad been fastened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form that 1paldo 's shoe was burned . This seemed to indicate that everything iron in that vicinity had been charged with electricity . It was some time after the killing before Ipaldo'e name and residence could be learned . An Italian who worked for him was at hand , ' but could not put it into English . After the body was taken to the station house , however , a cousin appeared who gave his name andsaid that he lived at 65 Mulberry Street . He had no family , and his nearest relative in this country was a brother who worked in the upper part of the city . In the evening the brother.appeared and identified the body . Ipaldo was about twenty-six years old , and though not a large man , was well built and strong . The body remained at the police station last evening . THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE . WHAT EXPERT WHEELER THINKS OF THE CONDITION OF OVERHEAD WIRES . Schuyler S. Wheeler , expert of the Board of Electrical Control , talked freely to a TINES reporter last night of the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of these conductors Mr. Wheeler is not stall satisfied , and from what he said it would appear that the chance of the average oftizen dying the death by electricity-le far greater than is generally supposed to be the ease , and that the experience of the luckless Italian is only a sample of what might easily ' happen to scores of persons who are obliged to work near the wires , carrying heavy currents of electricity . In discussing the tragedy in Broadway , Expert Wheeler declared that not one among the overhead electric lighting lines in the city had been certified to by him as safely insulated , although the rules of the board hold that such certification is necessary , and that the electric lighting comnanies were using these lines on their own responsibility . In the opinion of the expert there are about six hundred miles of these lines in New York . Mr. Wheeler had not heard of the death of the Italian until he was informed of it by the reporter . When asked how it was that the wires at 167 Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state of things at the lower end of the great thoroughfare : 13 " There are so many wires in lower Broadway that at present the subway can not accommodate them all . There is now only one subway in that part of the street . Jan. 8 the Board of Electrical Control ordered the companies to take down their overhead wires there . That gave them until April 8 for the work , the order allowing them 90 days ' time . But April 8 the board , considering the great number of wires and connections to be looked after , decided on the construction of a second subway on the other side of the street from the first . Upon this decision the companies were allowed sixty days more to . take down their-wires . That explains how it is that there are still overhead wires at that point " S ' Is anything being doue about the second subway ? " I ca n't say as to that . " Then Mr. .
