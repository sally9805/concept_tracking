txt It seems that the authorities of the World 's Fair have not yet committed themselves irrevocably to the exclusion of Mr. PADEREWSKI from the Music Hall unless he consents to appear as a performer upon a piano made by a persona grata . The question involved has been referred to the Board of Administration , and it is very much to be hoped , not , of course , in the interest of any manufacturer , but in the interest of the fair itself , that that body will not put itself in a position that would be at once grievous and ridiculous . The question involved is not at all a question of the rights of pianomakers , either Eastern or Western , or of a surreptitious exhibition , so to speak , of an instrument which the makers have withdrawn from the exhibition in the regular way . It is strictly and purely a question of art . Mr. PADEREWSKI has himself explained that he is not bound by contract to use any particular instrument , but that , if he plays , ho will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had altered to suit him , and to which he is accustomed . Any musician will understand without being told , and any sensible man ought to understand after he has been told , that ho would appear at a disadvantage with any other instrument , even though it might be equally good ; and certainly every artist of any description will sympathize with his determination not to appear at all unless he can appear to advantage . For an artist like Mr. PADEREWSICI to offer to play for nothing is to make a very considerable pecuniary sacrifice and a very handsome contribution to the fair . ' There would be something extremely boor-. ish in rejecting this offered compliment . unless the man who offered it consented to play upon an instrument not of his own choice . The fair has lately had its own troubles with trades unions . But if it rejects the services of the most popular of living pianists because he proposes to play  --  a " scab " piano , in pursuance of its boycott declared against the instrument , it - will be exhibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trades unionism . It is not to be assumed in advance that the Board of Administration will do so boorish and uncivilized a thing .
