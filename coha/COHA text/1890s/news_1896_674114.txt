Senator A. D. James said he did not consider himself expelled from the Senate , claiming that that body was adjourned before his expulsion was voted on . In the Senate this morning Mr. Jones ( Rep. ) offered an amendmdent to the Journal which made it appear that the Senate had adjourned before the report declaring seats vacant was considered .

" This removed the menace to the Democrats from the presence of James and Walton , even if Dunlap were also present . The Chair demanded the roll call for the vote for Senator , while Mr. Bronston demanded that the Sergeant at Arms remove all who were not entitled to seats . This Assistant Sergeant Sommers started to do , but as it interfered with the roll call , which had been started , he sat down .
