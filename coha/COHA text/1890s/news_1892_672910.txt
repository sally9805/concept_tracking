txt Judge John M. Hall of the Superior Court here to-day overruled the demurrer of the defendant , Acting State Secretary Walsh , to the complaint of John J. Phelan , in the quo warrauto ease to test the title to the office of State Secretary . It is a substantial victory for the Democratic contestant . When Mr. Phelan , following the suggestion of the Supreme Court in the ease of Morris vs . Bulkeley , went to the Superior Court with an amended complaint , the Republicans demurred to the proceedings mainly upon the ground that , the Legislature being still in session , the courts could not take jurisdiction . Judge H all says that the excuse advanced by the Supreme Court for avoiding the main question of the issue is not left open to him . Ho finds , however , in the decision of that higher court a plain declaration that In certain contingeneiee the court may take jurisdiction . He believes that those contingencies exist , and that the Legislature has lost its power to make a declaration . He holds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election of State officers by the General Assembly , in the event of no choice by the people , must be made upon the second day of the session it meant precisely what it said . Therefore , the declaration not having been made before the end of the second day , can not now be made . Judge Hall is coniirmod in this opinion by the reasoning or the Supreme Court , and hopes that that court will soon be called upon to decide that question definitely . Further , as to the power of the General Assembly , the Judge says that though that body is technically in session it might practically , and so far as this case is concerned , have adjourned sine die . Each house of the Assembly has placed itself on record again , and by adhering to its former disagreeing action has taken the only parliamentary course known to indicate finally its intention . Therefore . the court assumes jurisdiction in order to afford opportunity for legal redress to the plaintiff , who is acknowledged in the pleadings to have received a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Judge expresses his readiness to hear the facts in the case . What the Republicans will do has not been determined . Two courses are open to them  --  to accept judgment of ouster against them and appeal from the judgment , or to file a new pleading , denying the facts set up by the complainant. in which event a trial as to the facts would be had . As it is morally certain that they do not desire a setting forth of the facts , it is expected that they will accept judgment and take their chances again with the Supreme Court . This decision of judge Hall , unless reversed by the Supreme Court , opens the door of the court to all the Democratic candidates who have been kept out of their ollicea by the Republican House ; and , as proceedings in quo warranto are privileged , there is still a chance that the State officers chosen in November , 1890 , may get their places before it is time to choose their successors .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
