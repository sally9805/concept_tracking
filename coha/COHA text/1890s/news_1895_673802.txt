txt Some of the testimony as to the deterrent effects of the late . blizzard on inward-bound sailing craft wan - given last night when the ships Constance and Susquehanna reached port . The Susquehanna , which is one of the largest sailing ships afloat , is from Hongkong , 102 days out . Capt . Sewall says the vessel had fine weather until Hatteras bore abeam . Then storms came . The first one was met on Feb. ? 4 . The ship was hove to until the storm abated , and then , under filled topsails , she resumed her way up the coast . She had not proceeded far before another wintry blast compelled her to again point her frigate-like bows to the swollen seas . Shortly after the vessel had been hove to the gale developed into a hurricane . Its arctic breath had ' a demoralizing effect upon the crew , all of whom were Japanese with the exception of the Captain and his two mates .

Instead of spending itself quickly , as exceptionally violent outflies are wont to do , it settled into a heavy gale after its first violent raging had been spent . The weather continued intensely cold , and the chilled and shivering Japs suffered greatly from its effects . One of their number became so benumbed that he lost his footing while aloft and tumbled from the mainyard into the sea . Owing to the waves that were running it was impossible to launch a boat . Even had a boat been launched it is almost certain that rescue could not have been effected , as the seas were hid beneath a swirling cloud of spoondrift , and it would have been impossible to have found the man , supposing that he had survived the fall . Two others of the crew , also Japanese , were dashed against the lee bulwarks and severely injured . The wind finally abated its furY , the ship was again put upon her course and headed for port .

She would have made a record passage had she not been delayed by the succession of gales encountered when nearing  --  port . In speaking of his Japanese crew last night , Capt . Sewall said that it was the first time in his knowledge that so large a ship as the Susquehanna had been manned throughout with a Japanese crew . They are ' good sailors , he said , and are especially distinguished for obedience to orders and for sobriety . When the blizzard first struck the ship , the vessel was hove to on the port tack and under three lower topsails . The rigging and running gear soon froze hard and fast , and when the storm developed into a hurricane , the Captain became anxious about his spars and wanted to take in the three topsails and lie to under bare poles . The Japs were willing enough to obey the command , but wer too benumbed with cold to execute it . Fortunately , the vessel 's spars and canvas were stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to go , the ship rode out the storm undamaged . The ship Constance , the other arrival , is from Dunkirk , seventy-seven days out . Capt . Edgett says his ship encountered the storm at a point thirty miles southeast of the Scotland Lightship . A few hours more of fair sailing would have enabled the ship to reach harbor . But the hurricane came whirling off shore and , scudding before the blast , the good ship was driven nearly 200 miles to sea . The vessel commenced her flight on the night of Feb. 8 , and ever since has been beating her way back to port . Capt . Edgett adds in his report that on Feb. 11 , in a locality 220 miles southeast of Sandy Hook , the Constance passed through large quantities of new pitch pine lumber , railroad ties , and square timber . The timber was apparently from some vessel recently wrecked in that vicinity . According to the Captain it covered the ocean for many miles .

Edgett 's report was made there was an effort to connect her disappearance with the lumber sighted by the Constance . The - City of St. Augustine sailed Feb. 2 from Jacksonville for this port , lumber laden . The vessel should have reached here at least ten days ago . No definite news has been had from her since Feb. 7 , on which date the pilots of the pilot boat E. C. Knight , which put into the Delaware Breakwater , reported that they had sighted the vessel . The steamship Salisbury , about whose welfare some anxiety was felt , is safe , but somewhat the worse for a long struggle with the elements . She sailed from Gibraltar Jan. 17 , and should have reached this port several days ago . Nothing was heard from her until yesterday , when a-dispatch from Halifax announced her - arrival at that port in tow of the steamship Saint Jerome . The Salisbury 's mast had been carried away and her coal supply had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter vessel was bound from Galveston for Liverpool . The Salisbury ran out of coal , and had one of the hardest fights to reach port that her master , Capt . Haldorf , ever experienced . Just two weeks ago the vessel was within 500 miles of New-York . Then she encountered a hurricane , . which was followed by a series of adverse gales . Ice coated the rigging and sides , and the cargo , 3,000 crates of oranges and lemons , was shifted by the heavy lurchings of the vessel . The coal began to run short , and In order to husband the fuel an effort was made to heave the ship to until the , weather moderated . The few sails that the vessel carried were set , but these , blew away . In the endeavor to work the vessel back into the path of stenmeliips , all spare , wciodwork was chopped up and used . for fuel .
