txt An interview with Mr. HENRY W. OLIVER of Pittsburg concerning the tariff is published by our neighbor , The Commercial Advertiser . Mr. OLIVER was a member of the Tariff Commission of 1882 . He represented the Pittsburg manufacturers before the Ways and Means Committee in 1890 , and reported , if our memory serves us , that in the Tariff act they obtained all that they asked for . He and his brothers are prominent manufacturers in the iron and steel Industry . Our neighbor reports his remarks , in part , as follows : " I should like to see the old law used as a framework , and a general horizontal reduction made . Of course , I can not go into details and indicate the places in which there should be no change ; but , as a general proposition , I think that there should be a horizontal reduction of 23 per cent. , and the duties should be specific . * * ? We do n't want to build a Chinese wall around this country . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue for running the Government . If you put your tariff too high , you get very little revenue . As I said before , I think there should be a horizontal reduction of about 25 per cent . on the old bill . This would be a concession to the argument that all prices have been reduced , and that many staples are much cheaper than formerly . * * So far as the iron and steel trade is concerned , I think that would be satisfied with a 25 per cent . reduction of the old schedule . " In other words , Mr. OLIVER would make the tariff lower than it is now . He would substitute for the " wicked freetrade tariff " now in force one in which the average duty would be even lower . The annual average rate of duty during the four years of the tariff was 48.66 per cent . The annual average for the two fiscal years of the present tariff has been 40.45 per cent . If the average of 48.66 per cent . be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36.49 per cent. , which is considerably less than the average for the tariff now in force . We commend Mr. OLivER 's opinions to the attention of Mr. MCKINLEY and other Republicans who are saying that the present duties ought to be increased in order that goods now imported may be shut out . Mr. OLIVER 'S remark that " if you put your tariff too high you get very little revenue " should not be overlooked by the Republican statesmen who would have all the goods consumed in this country " made at home , " and who at the same time propose that the revenue shall be increased by higher duties on imports .
