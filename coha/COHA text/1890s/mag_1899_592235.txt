AN OLD VIRGINIA CORRESPONDENCE . THE letters here given stretch over a period of forty-three years , and cover a lifetime spent under conditions that are now past . The earliest of them were written during the Revolutionary War , the last when nearly a quarter of this century had gone . They have the charm of their time , a gentle formality and a quiet regard for effect , and the grace of good company ; the little accounts of Washington and Chief Justice Marshall having a pleasant air of intimacy . The first is from Miss Mildred Smith , a grave person of sixteen years , to Miss Betsy Ambler , who is a year younger . . L. YORK , VA. , 1780 . When you left our dear little town , I felt as if every ray of comfort had // fled . Oh , my dearest loved Betsy ( now what would I give if you had a name a little more romantic ! ) , how shall I exist without you ? Life seems a dreary waste since deprived of your loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , but they are all so much my senior ; and besides , there is so much freedom and levity , almost amounting to indiscretion , in their conduct that I often blush for them , and certainly can never repose that confidence in them that I have long been accustomed to place in you . Fain would I cast a veil over their frivolities , but since the arrival of the French ships , commanded by the Viscount Rochambeau and Captain M their heads seem turned , and a thousand times have I said that it is well for my well loved Betsy that she is removed from these scenes of amusement and dissipation . Her giddy brain would also have been turned were she here . There is something so flattering in the attentions of these elegant French officers , and though not one in ten of them can speak a word of English , yet their style of entertaining and their devotion to the ladies of York are so flattering that almost any girl of sixteen would be enchanted . But you know how little effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one rational hour 's conversation with my solid English B d for all the bagatelles these sprightly Frenchmen lavish daily upon me . Apropos of poor B d , he has abjured his own country and got a commission in our army , I really and truly believe , from principle ; but my Uncle and Aunt still look coldly on him . Alas ! I must endeavour to do so too ! What a prospect have I of ever having it in my power to reward his constancy ? None , for , as my Aunt says , poverty and dependence must be the portion of those who marry a stranger without a shilling ! My own weak heart reluctantly consents to the truth of the observation . As soon as the bustle and fatigue of moving is over I shall expect a long letter from you . I am all impatience to hear your description of Richmond , which they tell me is enchantingly beautiful . You must not for the world draw any comparisons between it and York . We lowlanders can not yet make up our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our old folks at the removal of the seat of government ; to us it is pretty much the same . God bless you , prays your affect . MILDRED . Though the letter in reply has no date other than 1780 , it was evidently an early response . II . FROM BETSY JAQUELIN AMBLER TO MIL1*EED SMITE . RICHMOND , VA. , 1780 . Mv DEAREST MILDRED , - ... And so you really wish that the name of Betsy could be changed , - softened and romanticized into Bessie or Jaquelin or Sophia , or a more modern termination of any sort . Who would have thought that my Millia , or rather my charming Mildred , who is just as sweet and lovely as any heroine of times past , present , or to come , should try her powers of the heroic ? You who know me so well can readily judge how my heart fluttered when , on the second evening after our arrival at Williamsburg , we received invitations for a ball . It was given at the Palace , by certain gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Misses Amblers . " Though I can not for my life treat the poor fellow who was the prime mover in this civility with common good manners , yet was I delighted with an opportunity of showing my consequence by accepting his invitation and playing off a thousand airs which would have provoked a lecture from you an hour long . His // more successful friend , Marshall , ' was devoted to my sister . The entertainment in itself was like most of the entertainments of the present time , simple and frugal as to its viands , but of the brilliancy of the company too much can not be said ; it consisted of more Beauty and Elegance than I had ever witnessed before , and I was transported with delight at being considered a distinguished personage . ( The lady to whom a party is given must always be held , you know , as making the principal character in the Drama . ) In serious truth , however , it was a most charming entertainment , and so much attention did your giddy friend receive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded on our journey the next morning at a very early hour . Nothing material happened on our way , and we arrived on the evening of the second day at this famous Metropolis ; for so we may now call it , as all heads of departments , 2 like ourselves , have arrived here in safety . But where we are to lay our weary heads Heaven knows ; so recently has it become a place of any consequence that accommodations can not be found for one half the people who are necessarily brought here . It is indeed a lovely situation , and may at some future period be a great city , but at present it will scarce afford one comfort in life . With the exception of two or three families this little town is made up of Scotch factors , . who inhabit small tenements scattered here and there from the river to the hill . Some of them look , as Colonel Marshall8 observed , as if the poor Caledonians had brought them over on their backs , the weakest of whom being glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others a little stronger proceeding higher , whilst a few of the stoutest and the boldest reached the summit . One of these hardy Scots has thought 1 Afterward Chief Justice Marshall . 2 Her father , Richard Ambler , was first Treasurer of Virginia . proper to vacate his little dwelling on the hill , and though our whole family can scarcely stand up all together in it , my father has determined to rent it as the only decent tenement on the hill . When I have seen more of this delectable spot you may expect another epistle . It would seem as if I should have abundance of leisure for writing , so little have we to amuse us in this New World , for it is absolutely a New World to me . Farewell . Your BETSY . In the interval of more than a year that seems to have elapsed between this letter and that which follows the war was pressed with vigor in Virginia , Tarleton 's men making themselves especially dreaded by the patriots . The letter itself , broken by sudden flights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best evidence of the disturbed state of the country . III . FROM BETSY AMBLER TO MILDRED SMITH . RICHMOND , 1781 . Mv DEAR MILDRED , - Our removal from York to this place , which I considered one of the calamities of my life , lost much of its bitterness when I found , the succeeding fall , that you and your much loved family would also be obliged to follow . No sooner had you from necessity been forced to join us , and we were looking forward to days of happiness , than we were forced to separate again . Even here we found no rest for the sole of our foot . Another alarm this morning ! Should it be confirmed that the British are really coming up James River , my poor dear mother will not continue a moment . Poor dear soul , what sufferings are hers ! THE COTTAGE , Friday evening . At the moment I was writing you , we had too certain confirmation of the Brit * Father of the Chief Justice . // ish having landed and being actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be lost , and we were off in a twinkling . I would have almost wished you could get a view of them in your snug little retreat , - where I should hope that you are perfectly secure ; - but my father seemed to think we had not a moment to lose . Such terror and confusion you have no idea of . Governor , Council , everybody scampering . I have just received yours of last night . How thankful I am that your residence was too remote to subject you to the outrages of these barbarians ! What a gloomy time do I look forward to ! Oh that you were here with me to beguile the tediousness of these unmeasurable days ! Continue to write , I beseech you . Your account of your neighbour S s escape just as the enemy entered the town made even my poor mother smile . What a gallant fellow he was , to look back and bid them come on , when he was a full mile ahead , with a swift horse that had borne him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughable than the accounts we have of our illustrious Governor , who , they say , took neither rest nor food for man or horse till he reached C r 's Mountain . LOUISA COURT Housx , Tuesday . Oh , my dearest girl , I tremble for your safety . Where were you hid when the enemy passed your door ? We only had time to learn that they were on the road from Richmond , when we were again in the carriage , and in a few hours reached this place where it would seem impossible for us to be in any danger . My much loved father is full of anxiety for us . Much have we to apprehend for him . The public office which he holds makes it absolutely necessary for him to run no risks of falling into the hands of the enemy . We therefore see him safely lodged in the old coach every night , with faithful old Sam as his guard , while we endeavour to make ourselves as comfortable as we can in the overseer 's tiny dwelling , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where shall we find rest ? Such a journey as we have again had , and now are precisely in the same spot we set out from ! No sooner had we committed our dear father to his solitary confinement on the night I last wrote you , and were endeavouring to console ourselves with the idea that the miserable little hovel we were in was too solitary a situation for us to fear any danger ; then while enjoying our frugal supper of Bonny Clabber , honey , etc. , a terrible clatter of horses at the door set us all scampering . The British ! Nothing but the word British did we hear ; upon opening the door , however , we soon discovered a parcel of miserable militia belonging to the neighbourhood . They had called to give notice that the enemy were actually proceeding on their way through the country , but not one of them could say which route they had taken . A consultation of our party was then held , and if we had had one particle of our natural reason about us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight had so long been the word that it was determined unanimously that we should lie off in a moment . The nearer the mountains the greater the safety , was the conclusion ; so on we traveled through byways and brambles until we could get to the main road leading to Charlottesville . Our design was first to reach a plantation in the neighbourhood of the Springs , where we were at least sure of house room and a bed ( a friend of ours having removed his furniture to this place for security ) ; and to this place we proceeded , where we arrived just as the sun appeared in all his glory . With difficulty we got admittance , - no soul being in the house , - and were just spreading pallets to rest // our weary heads , when the landlord , out of breath , reached the house , saying that Tarleton and all his men had just passed , and would catch the Governor before he could reach Charlottesville . What a panic for us all ! Our best beloved father had pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the place appointed for public officers to repair to . Fortunately , however , the enemy had got ahead of him by another road , which he by good luck hearing , he immediately joined us and hurried us back to the selfsame spot we had left the night before . Thus were we one whole night and the greater part of the next day accomplishing what placed us precisely in the same situation we were in before , a spot that I defy the British or even the d-l himself to find . Great cause have we for thankfulness , and however dreary it is I will endeavour to be contented , hoping and trusting for a speedy deliverance . But how dreadful the idea of an enemy passing through such a country as ours committing enormities that fill the mind with horror , and returning exultingly without meeting one impediment to discourage them ! Your affectionate E. J. A. Another break of about a year occurs in our record of the relations between the two friends , but the next letter shows Miss Smith still in the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . YORK , 1782 . Mv- DEAR BETSY , - Again are we quietly seated in our old mansion . But oh ! how unlike it once was ! Indeed , were you to be suddenly and unexpectedly set down in the very spot where you and I have so often played together , - mu that very garden where we gathered flowers or stole your father 's choice fruit , - you would not recognize a solitary vestige of what it once was . Ours is not so totally annihilated , being more remote from the shock and battery - but Heaven knows , it is shocking enough ! Others that remain are so mutilated particularly the L-ys ' home , which several balls passed through - as to grieve one 's very soul . But it is over ! Our individual sufferings are nothing now we can reflect that the great end is accomplished . Peace is again restored , and we may yet look forward to happy days . The time passed in the neighbourhood of Richmond so near you , though so often spent in fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorable period which made it necessary that you abandon your home , - was yet productive of many pleasurable moments , and but for our British prejudices respecting this one native home , I should have been well satisfied to have made it my residence . Then I should always be near you , always ready with my watchful tenderness to guard you against those juvenile extravagances that , you must allow me to say , need some restraint . - And this leads me to the recollection of your late obstinate infatuation concerning a certain Mr. B- . Oh , my friend , a thousand times have I wondered at the strange weakness of your conduct . It appears to me that if left entirely to your own will you would marry W- , and yet , as if purposely to vex your father , you have suffered the matter to go such lengths ! Will you quit such trifling ? Remember you are this year leaving your childhood- Farewell . Yours sincerely , M. S. The three years that elapse between this letter and the one in reply seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last her friend feels moved to defend herself- Her disclaimer of vanity appears not wholly superfluous . // V. FROM BETSY AMBLER TO MILDRED SMITH . RIcinwoEn , 1785 . DEAREST MILDRED , - Cease now , dearest friend , with your lectures ; all former follies are done away , and now I am about to take a new character entire ly . Really it must be acknowledged that I have behaved very badly , but hereafter you shall have no cause to blame me . You know I have never , with all my faults , betrayed one symptom of vanity ; but now if you should discover a little spice of it , can you wonder ? Just at this moment are at my disposal two of the very smartest beaux this country can boast of . What think you of G- . and B- , both at my feet at once ? There is much speculation going on as to the preference I shall give - and though I do not intend to practice one coquettish air , as you are pleased to call my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to leave these speculating geniuses to their own conjectures for some time . At least till I have made up my mind as to the time . For you must know I mean to make one surprise do for all , by being married offhand . Believe me , it is impossible for me to think too long on the subject lest I should in truth be whimsical . They are both men that are not to be trifled with , -* men that , either coming separately , no girl in our city would refuse ; but both in one day ! What would be done if a little fluttering at the heart did not enable me to decide ? This I found no hesitation in doing ; and yet had the other appeared some little time ago , it would not have been impossible to have loved him . Still a little spice of the coquette , I hear you say . No , my friend , not one particle , believe me ; it is only when the object is not entirely to my mind that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my heart seriously interested , and from this moment do I resolve to act precisely as you and all my dear friends would have me . Colonel Brent is everything that can be wished . In his last visit to Richmond during the summer session he was introduced to me at the theatre . He remained long in our box , but as my friend Eliza was with me , who has the knack of attracting more certainly than the Loadstone , I took it for granted that her charms had riveted him . Not so ; your own giddy friend , who did not consider it worth while to practice one grace extraordinary , stole into his heart , and now he is declaring most vehemently that he has thought nor could think of no other mortal since . How ready we poor silly girls are to believe ! He has lost no opportunity since he has been in town , which is nearly two months , of repeating this , and indeed has done everything in his power to ingratiate himself with my family through our mutual friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now , if you were not just at this time laying a similar plan for yourself , I would entreat that about the last week in March you would gladden our hearts by repairing to . But this is impossible , so after wishing you as much happiness as I am contemplating for myself , I am Your own affectionate E. J. A. The next , which is the first dated letter we have had , gives a melancholy cause for the new observance of days and dates . In spite of the youthful excess of the letter , it is difficult to realize that the writer was only twenty when it was written . TI . FROM BETSY AMBLER BRENT To MILDRED SMITH . RICHMOND , July 10 , 1785 . M* DEAR MILDRED , - When I prevailed upon my friend Eliza Marshall to write you before I left the Potomac , it did not appear possible that I should // ever gain composure enough to write myself ; but flow that I have reached my dear Parents arid changed those dreadful scenes which Eliza 's letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unburthening my heart to my friend would in some measure mitigate my sufferings . Four months only have passed since I last wrote you . What have I not endured since then ! Widowed , wretched , forlorn - a month since , I was the happiest of wives , and now - Oh , my friend ! In February only I think it was I last wrote you . What vicissitudes have I not experienced since ! The 31st of March made me the happiest of wives ; the 15th of June - oh , day never to be forgotten - my adored Brent was snatched from my arms . Forty hours of suffering such as no pen can describe , and then , oh then , I had to give him up forever . Think , oh think , my friend , what it is to part forever with those we fondly love . Forever did I say ? Let me indulge in better hopes and blot out that word . This dreadful , dreadful blow came too under the most aggravating circumstances . Three weeks after our marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey us to his seat on the Potomac . E- and C accompanied us . Everything that the season held there so delightful to one who had seldom had an opportunity of ' beholding the beauties of nature ; the full tide of health and spirits ; in short , every circumstance that could spread a charm over mortals conspired to make our journey delightful . On our arrival at Richlands what a reception had we ! A tender and respectable mother , with a countenance beaming with delight at the view of her eldest son 's appearance , watched our approach ; two lovely sisters , eager to call me by that endearing name , ran to meet us . Relations of every degree assembled to welcome us ; in short , nothing was wanting to my happiness . A few weeks was I permitted to taste these pure delights , and then - one fatal night - but it is impossible for me to give you an idea of the scene that succeeded . How I kept my senses is the wonder . The melancholy news soon reached my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatched the carriage with my darling brother Marshall to bring me to my old apartment , where I now sit , - no longer the happy , cheerful friend you once had , but miserable , oh , how miserable ! Come , if it is possible , to soothe my wretched state . Farewell . Yours ever affect . E. J. A. B. A period of fourteen years separates this broken-hearted letter from the next , which is written to her sister from the serene atmosphere of Washington 's home at Mount Vernon . The writer has won a serenity of spirit , too . She is again married , - to Colonel Carrington , an old friend of hers and her husband 's ; in fact , the " mutual friend " she speaks of in an earlier letter , and a friend and comrade-in-arms of Washington . VII . FROM BETSY AMBLER CAREINGTON To HER 5I5TER NANcY . MOUNT VERNON , November 22 , 1799 . M* DEAR NANCY , - We arrived at this venerable mansion in perfect safety , where we are experiencing every mark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Colonel Carrington could lead us to expect . His reception of my husband was that of a Brother . He took us each by the hand , and , with a warmth of expression not to be described , pressed mine and told me that I had conferred a favour , never to be forgotten , in bringing his old friend to see him . Then bidding a servant to call the Ladies , he entertained us most facetiously till they appeared . They were , Mrs. Washington , venerable , kind , and plain , very much resem 541 // bling our Aunt Ambler ; Mrs. Steward , her daughter-in-law , once Mrs. Custis , with her two young daughters , Misses Steward , all pleasant and agreeable ; Mrs. H. Lewis , formerly Miss Pof Richmond ; and last , but not least , Mrs. Lawrence Lewis . But how describe her ? Once I had heard my neighbour , Mrs. Tucker , give a romantic account of her when Miss Custis ; how , her lovely figure made doubly interesting by a light fanciful summer dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apron full that she had selected , she came in and threw them at her grandmother 's feet , - all which I considered as the fanciful effusions of my friend 's romantic turn of mind . But now when I see her the Matron , - for such her situation makes her appear , though she has only been ten months a wife ; lovely as nature could form her ; improved in every female accomplishment , and what is still more interesting , amiable and obliging in every department that makes woman most charming , particularly in her conduct to her aged Grandmother and the General , whom she always calls Grandpa , - I seem actually transported in beholding her . Having once seen her as she passed through our town seems to give me a claim to her kindness , and her attentions are unremitted . On retiring for the night , she took me into her apartment , which was elegantly prepared for an expected event . When we separated , " How glad I am that you are here ! " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain you , till this dreaded event has passed . " I assured her nothing would give me more pleasure than to remain and to offer every friendly aid in my power . In this promise I thought this morning I should be indulged , for , on entering the Breakfast Room , I understood she had been complaining all night ; but unfortunately my husband spied the armchair being carried up-stairs , and a moment after ordered our carriage . In vain did the General insist upon our stay , promising to take him over the grounds and farm and show him the Mill , etc. , which would occupy them until 3 o'clock ; but no , - the world could not tempt him to stay , at a time when , he said , every one should leave the family entirely undisturbed , but that , after a few days , when we should have finished our visit to my friends in Maryland , we would again see them and prolong our visit . Is it not vexatious to have so scrupulous a husband ? Nothing could distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment ; but I am bound to obey , and at 12 we are to leave this place for Washington . When I return you may expect to hear further from me . MOUNT YJ*xNoN , November 27th . After passing a week most charmingly with my numerous friends in and about the City , we returned to finish our visit to this revered mansion . Ou* Headquarters whilst in the city ( for I shall have no terms to use but what are military , hearing as I do a repetition , from these dear old veterans , of Battles , Fortifications , Marches and Countermarches , which are familiar as every-day topics to one connected as I have been with Soldiers and Heroes ) - our Headquarters , then , as I said before , were here at D C s , the husband of your old friend Annie Brent . This visit of a week would furnish subjects for a series of letters instead of one . I must therefore only tell you that I found myself while in Washington in a new world , though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite at home . On those very farms where dwelt my old friends , the Youngs , the Carrolls , etc. , did I see the stately edifices of the Capitol , President 's house , etc. , all appearing to me like enchantment . But a few years since , when passing an Autumn with these dearly loved friends , I saw the first trees felled on their farms . Now avenues and intersecting streets cover // the ground I so often passed over in going from one friend 's house to another . It is absolutely magic ! I could not have imagined that the cutting down trees and rearing a few houses ( for as yet there are but few in the city ) could so totally have metamorphosed this charming spot . I , having missed the post , continue to scribble , and am well pleased that my letter was not ready , as I have much to say , and am really delighted that our first visit here was shortened so that we are at liberty to finish it at a time when our presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been before . It is really an enjoyment to be here and to witness the tranquil happiness that reigns throughout the house , except now and then a little bustle occasioned by the young Squire Custie , when he returns from hunting , bringing in a " Valiant Deer , " as he terms it , " that Grandpa and the Colonel will devour . " Nice venison , I assure you , it is , and my taste in seasoning the stew is not passed unnoticed while the whole party - I wo n't say devour it , but do it ample justice . My mornings are speiit charmingly , alternately in the different chambers . First , an hour after breakfast , with The Lady in the Straw , dressing the pretty little stranger , who is the delight of the Grandmamma . Then we repair to the old lady 's room , which is precisely on the style of . our good old Aunt 's ; that is to say , nicely fixed for all sorts of work . On one side sits the chambermaid with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning to sew ; a decent old woman , with her table and shears , cutting out the negroes ' winter clothes ; while the good old lady directs them all , incessantly knitting herself , and pointing out to me several pairs of nice colored stockings and gloves she has just finished , and presenting me with a pair half done , which she begs I will finish and wear for her sake . Her netting too is a great source of amusement , and is so neatly done that all the younger part of the family are proud of trimming their dresses with it , and have furnished me with a whole suit , so that I shall appear * la domestique at the first party we have when I get home . It is wonderful , after a life spent as these good people have necessarily spent theirs , to see them , in retirement , assume the domestic manners that prevail in our country , when but one year since they were forced to sacrifice all these innocent delights , which are so congenial to their years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Levee . The recollections of these " Lost Days , " as Mrs. Washington calls them , seem to fill her with regret , but the extensive knowledge she has gained in this general intercourse with persons from all parts of the world has made her a most extraordinary companion , and having a vastly retentive memory , she presents an entire history of half a century . The weather is too wintry to enjoy out-of-door scenes , but , as far as I can judge in a view from the windows , the little painting we have seen , that hangs up in my friend Mrs. Wood 's drawing room , furnishes a good specimen of the outlook . Everything within doors is neat and elegant , but nothing remarkable except the paintings of different artists which have been sent as specimens of their talent , - I think there are five portraits of the General , - some done in Europe and some in America , that do honour to the painters . There are other specimens of the fine arts from various parts of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these there is a complete greenhouse , which at this season is a vast source of pleasure . Plants from every part of the world seem to flourish in this neatly finished apartment , and from the arrangement of the whole I conclude that it is managed by a skilful hand , but whose I can not tell . Neither the General nor Mrs. Washington seems more interested than the visitors . // We have met with no visitors here , but are told that scarcely a week passes without some , and often more than is convenient or agreeable . When transient persons who call from curiosity , they are treated with civility , but never interfere with the order of the House or the General 's disposition of time , which is as regular as when at the head of the army or in the President 's chair . Even friends who make a point of visiting him are left much to themselves , - indeed , scarcely see him from breakfast to dinner , unless he engages them in a ride , which is very agreeable to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent . Indeed , one evening the General was so fascinating , and drew my husband out into so many old stories relating to several campaigns where they had been much together , and had so many inquiries to make respecting their mutual friends , particularly Kosciusko and Pulaski , - who have always corresponded with Colonel Carrington , - that it was long after twelve o'clock before we separated . By the bye , I will show you some of those letters , on my return , for I know you will find great pleasure in them . At breakfast I feel quite at home , - everything is so plain . The rest of this letter is missing . After another long silence , Mrs. Carrington , who has now become matronly and begun to be reminiscent , writes to strengthen her sister 's remembrances of their father . The office their father held to which she refers was that of Collector of Customs for the King at York , Virginia . VIII . RICHMOND , 1801 . M* DEAR NANCY , - In my last letter I dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I bring the best of fathers to your recollection . Our poor mother being too infirm to engage much in the care of her children , it almost entirely devolved upon my father . When my sister Moll and myself were barely five and six years old , he went through the arduous task of teaching us , and in every particular supplying the place of a mother . Notwithstanding he held an office that afforded little leisure for such employment , every hour from business was devoted to us . Our copies , as soon as we could write , were written in the fairest hand by himself ; short , but always containing a lesson of piety or an elegant moral quotation , the orthography and grammar entirely defective , which we were to correct . No English grammar at that time could be found . Parents and teachers in later times owe much to Lindley Murray in that branch of education , but in my own opinion the good old-fashioned teaching to spell has greatly the advantage of the modern . Our arithmetic commenced most pleasantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flowers , which had a happy effect in drawing our attention . Amusing books were carelessly left open on the writing table ; letters from the children of his friends in Philadelphia were given us to answer ; and so our education went on without rules or forms . Thus did our dear father devote himself to us and pursue every means in his power to give us instruction at a time when girls in our country were simply taught to read and write at twenty-five pounds and a load of wood per year . A boarding school in Virginia was nowhere to be found . Such attentions as we experienced were without parallel . It was thought , however , to have too much of severity ; for the Rod , at that time , was an instrument never to be dispensed with , and our dear father used it most conscientiously . . . At this time our country was thrown into great confusion by the long continuance of the war , and afterwards seemed to imbibe too much of that infidelity // which so much prevailed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more insinuating distinguished personage gave his lessons at home . The churches in Virginia were almost entirely shut up , and the holy ordinances of religion were unobserved . Most of our men were engaged in the war . Your loving sister , E. In the next letter , also to her sister , Mrs. Carrington , in setting down the memories of her girlhood , gives an interesting picture of travel in the Virginia of the eighteenth century . Among the officers with Colonel Carrington , whom she mentions meeting on the way , was Major Brent , who became her first husband . Ix . 1810 . Mv DEAR NANCY , - When in our childhood we were left at Winchester , as we were , our female relation who had us in charge , though truly amiable , was but young and inexperienced , and almost as childish as ourselves . The society of Winchester consisted of all descriptions of persons who seek a new country to better their fortunes . Thus , you may suppose there could be little refinement and of course little improvement gained amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respectable families . There were English , Irish , and Dutch , but the chief population was Dutch . During our stay we often met with genteel travellers , and not unfrequently made acquaintance with agreeable men , who were condemned in various parts to banishment to this dreary place , on account of disaffection , as it was called , to the great cause of liberty . In this remote corner they were entirely precluded any intercourse with Britain or British agents , of course , unable if they had the disposition to enter into any plans with them .. Amongst these , proscribed genteel QuakVOL . Lxxxiv. - *O. 504. 35 ers from Philadelphia were numerous , and I also remember with much pleasure a Colonel Elligood from Norfolk . Added to these there were many charming young officers who had been prisoners in Canada , and just then liberated . Such were Heath , Brown , McGuire , etc . Here was a fine field open for a romantic girl to exhibit in , and here I could tell you many pretty stories of sighing swains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be blended with so many childish absurdities that I will not venture to repeat them . Fortunately , nature blessed inc with such versatility of temper that at that time it would have been impossible to have fixed my attention on any one object , so that consequently I escaped an entanglement that might have eventuated in regret . Early in the spring our good father returned and withdrew us from scenes that were so truly improper ; and though he treated us himself as children , yet it was evident he saw that we had been considered of an age to attract.too much attention . The only consolation I have ever felt for the youthful follies was that , in a subsequent visit to Winchester , I found that my temper and deportment , to those of my acquaintance who remained there , had been such as to inspire them with an affection for me which had induced them to throw a veil over my youthful follies , and that they continued to love me with unabated affection . It is not a pleasant thing to retrace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candid representation of different periods of my life , to guard our dear little girls against errors that I have fallen into ; if our lives are prolonged , probably they may not be exposed or placed in similar situations . Certain it is that another Revolutionary War can never happen to affect and ruin a family so completely as ours has been . The only possible good from the // entire change in our circumstances was that we were made acquainted with the manner and situation of our country , which we otherwise should never have known . Added to this , necessity taught us to use exertions which girls of the present day know nothing of . We were forced to industry , to appear genteelly ; to study manners , to supply the place of education ; and to endeavour by amiable and agreeable conduct to make amends for the loss of fortune , which by this time was reduced to a pretty low ebb . See us at this period reduced to the necessity of travelling in a common wagon , which to be sure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good old vicar 's family we were rather ashamed of our cavalry , but the constant attentions we received from all who knew the virtuous and independent spirit of my father rendered it more supportable . One little mortification , however , I may relate . We arrived at Fredericksburg rather at a late hour in the evening . Our equipage was safely lodged . We passed the next day with our friends there , had much attention paid us , and were invited to a ball that evening that we declined going to , not having ball dresses with us , which , by the way , were not to be found elsewhere , and besides we were to take our departure at a very early hour in the morning . We prevailed upon our father to let us walk to the outskirts of the town where our vehicle would be in readiness for us , when lo and behold ! just as we were stepping into it several genteel and elegant officers appeared who had encamped with their regiment the preceding night at this very spot . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Miss Prinaroses we began to bridle , and perhaps would have glanced at better days and talked of the coach we had lately passed that way in , on our journey up , but our vicar-like father cut the matter short by shaking hands with the gentlemen , all of whom he had known before , said he was carrying his children ( for he still treated us as such ) to join their mother , and wished them a good journey . The commanding officer proved to be Colonel Carrington , afterwards the friend of all others most respected , and ultimately the husband of my choice . Your loving sister . The account of Chief Justice Marshall contained in the next letter is interesting for its warm personal tone and the pleasant light in which it reveals his domestic relations , especially his care of Mrs. Marshall , who , as the letter shows , was an invalid for the greater part of her life . The York referred to is of course Yorktown , the scene of Cornwallis ' surrender , and the river is York River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Had I the talents or the necessary information for writing the history of my country , the period of my life mentioned in my last letter would afford an ample opportunity to distinguish myself ; but possessing neither the one nor the other , it is impossible to give you an idea of the interesting state of the Colonies at that time . That eventful war , which I so often had occasion to dwell on , was at that period carried on in the Northern States with the utmost rigor . Our own , however , for some time was exempt from its ravages , and we returned to our dear York ; not indeed to our former mansion , but to a small , retired tenement that had long been occupied by others . My father at this time accepted an appointment which kept him almost constantly in Williamsburg . Our town had now become a garrison . We should have been left to experience repeated alarms had we not been fortunately next-door neighbour to the commanding officer , // Colonel Marshall . It was at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Captain Marshall , who , being just then without a command , left the Northern army , to visit his father and friends . Perhaps no officer that had been introduced to us excited so much interest . We had been accustomed to hear him spoken of by all as a very paragon ; we had often seen letters from him fraught with filial and paternal affection . The eldest of fifteen children , devoted from his earliest years to his younger brothers and sisters , he was almost idolized by them , and every line received from him was read with rapture . Our expectations were raised to the highest pitch , and the little circle of York was on tip-toe on his arrival . Our girls , particularly , were emulous who should be first introduced . It is remarkable that my sister Mary , then only fourteen , and diffident beyond all others , declared that we were giving ourselves useless trouble , for that she , for the first time , had made up her mind to go to the ball , though she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her cap at him , and eclipse us all . This in the end proved true , and at the first introduction he became devoted to her . For my own part , I am free to confess that I felt not the smallest wish to contest the prize with her ; in this , as in every other instance of my life , my sister 's superior discernment and solidity of character has made me feel my own insignificance . She with a glance divined his character and understood how to appreciate it , while I , expecting an Adonis , lost all desire of becoming agreeable in his eyes when I beheld his awkward figure , unpolished manners , and total negligence of person ( which , by the bye , did often produce a blush on her cheek ) . Nevertheless , how trivial now seem such objections ! Under the slouched hat there beamed an eye that penetrated at one glance the inmost recesses of the human character ; and beneath the slovenly garb there dwelt a heart complete with every virtue . From the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ( a blessing which before I had never known ) , and the reciprocal interest which we have each felt for the other has never known abatement . During the short stay he made with us our whole family became attached to him , and though there was then no certainty of his becoming allied to us , we felt a love for him that can never cease ; and how could it have been otherwise when there was no circumstance , however trivial , in which we were concerned that was not his care ? Much indeed do I owe him in every respect , and if I claim any consequence in life it may be ascribed to my early intimacy with so estimable a friend . Certain it is that whatever taste I may have for reading was entirely gained from him , who used to read to us from the best authors , particularly the Poets , with so much taste and feeling , and pathos too , as to give me an idea of their sublimity , which I should never have had an idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our amusements , and thereby gave us a taste for books which probably we might never otherwise have had . Soon after making his acquaintance we learned with pleasure that he was determined to attend the law studies in Williamsburg during his absence from his regiment , of about three months ; and at the end of that time , after obtaining a license , he rejoined his regiment , - gaining as much in that short time as would have employed many the same number of years . Notwithstanding his amiable and correct conduct , there were those who would catch at the most trifling circumstance to throw a shade over his fair fame . Once in particular , I remember an observation // of one of his contemporaries , when allusion was made to his short stay at William and Mary College , that he could have gained but little there , and that his talents were greatly overrated . How far he has left this wise observer behind him might be easily shown , were I at liberty to describe the distinguished personage . One remarkable trait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never known to make even to his most intimate friends an invidious or malevolent retort , though slanders were propagated and whispered in the ear of those with whom of all others he wished to stand well , insidiously representing the most trifling failings into crimes of the blackest dye . And yet has he always preserved the same amiable , unsuspicious temper which so remarkably distinguished him , and has wisely shown that nothing can so completely blunt the shaft of envy and malice as a life spent in virtuous and noble usefulness . The year after the war closed his marriage took place at the cottage in Hanover County , to which place we had been invited by our relation , John Ambler . It has been ill-naturedly said that my father made objection on the score of fortune , but nothing was ever less true ; for though I have heard Mr. Marshall say a hundred times that , after paying the parson , he had but one solitary guinea left , yet had that been lacking , my father would have considered him the very best choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved so , for no man , in my estimation , his ever , save one , stood so high in our country . What his conduct has been in the tender relations of domestic life you have had as good an opportunity of knowing as myself . His exemplary tenderness to our unfortunate sister is without parallel . With a delicacy of frame and feeling that baffles all description , she became early after her marriage a prey to extreme nervous affection which more or less has embittered her comfort through life ; but this has only seemed to increase his care and tenderness , and he is , as you know , as entirely devoted as at the moment of their first being married . Always and under every circumstance an enthusiast in love , I have very lately heard him declare that he looked with astonishment at the present race of lovers , so totally unlike what he had been himself . His never failing cheerfulness and good-humor are a perpetual source of delight to all connected with him , and , I have not a doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is so tenderly devoted to . Affect . your sist&amp;r , ELIZA JAQUELIN AMBLER CARRINGTON . The closing letter of this broken series , written on her fifty-eighth birthday , is an old woman 's letter ; cheerful , however , and showing the mellowness and serenity of spirit which came with age . XI . RIcHMOND , March 11 , 1823 . M* DEAR NANCY , - This date brings me indeed to my grand climacteric . What an age , with such infirmities as I have had to contend with ! Surely they are now fast drawing to an end . This being a snowy day , my natural propensity for scribbling to you recurs . It is my habit , when time hangs heavy on my hands , which is often the case , to look over old manuscripts and letters which have been carefully put away with a view to retrace a long and variegated life , and so many of them appear so frivolous that I am tempted to commit them to the flames . Frequently have they been brought to the verge of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consigning them to everlasting oblivion . With the reflection that they have frequently beguiled a miserable day , I again put them back into the little cabi // net which with its contents was always intended for you , either to destroy or to be handed to your daughter . You will discover in them what you have often seen , a strange mixture of good and bad that should induce you to peruse them with a sister 's eye , such as they are . Unless I again change my mind they will at my death be yours . In the same cabinet are my letters to and from friends ( for by strange circumstances I have fallen heir to my own letters ) . Many from dear Miss Cairns , Kingsdown , Bristol , England . Mildred Smith 's , afterwards Mrs. Dudley of York , etc. , etc. , with whom I was in correspondence from early life . The remainder of this letter torn off . The mention , in the closing sentence of the last letter , of Mildred Smith , the writer of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the long gap of time and knit the series together .
