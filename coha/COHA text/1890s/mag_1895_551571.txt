By David Nelson Beach . ASi was leaving America last summer to spend a month in study and special research in England , I was urged by friends with whom I had co-operated in the recent Norwegian agitation here , to divide the time between England and Norway , in order to observe the workings of the liquor-selling system in the latter country . Not without reluctance at abandoning part of my English plans , I acceded to the proposal , as first-hand information seemed as desirable to me as it did to my friends . The purpose of the journey was not to gather statistics . That had been thoroughly and abundantly done by Professor Gould for the National Department of Labor , by Mr. John Graham Brooks for the Massachusetts Commission , by Mr. John Koren , secretary of the commission , and by others . Neither did the journey intend an examination into the economic aspects of the system . The purpose was strictly practical . It was to look at the matter in the concrete . It was to understand as one can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to observe the system from the point of view of one profoundly interested in the ethical side of the question and one who had given some of the best strength of his life to the effort of overthrowing , in some neighborhoods , the power of the liquor traffic . It is the purpose of this article to give , in a simple form , the impressions which this journey conveyed . Before entering upon this narrative , however , it is desirable to make two or three general statements . As early as 1890 the subject of some Norwegian legislation in Massachusetts with reference to the liquor traffic was mooted . In 1893 it came up in the legislature . That body referred the matter to the next legislature , and authorized the appointment of a commission to investigate the subject , provided that the commission should serve at private expense . That commission , consisting of Judge John Lowell , lately of the United States Circuit Court , Dr. Henry P. Bowditch , dean of the Harvard Medical School , and Mr. John Graham Brooks , the sociologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly examined by Professor Gould of Johns Hopkins University for the national I ) epartment of Labor . Mr. Brooks himself travelled in Scandinavia , and the commission sent , to look up additional points , Mr. John Koren , who speaks fluently the Scandinavian languages , who is himself an expert in such investigations , and whose service in preparing the commission 's legislative documents was invaluable . The result was an elaborate report submitted to the legislature of 1894 , with the form of a proposed bill . On this report prolonged hearings were had . Probably no hearings at the State House for years have brought forward greater ability in the presentation of a subject , or more thoroughly digested and impressive facts . The joint committee of senate and house were deeply impressed by the arguments , and did not hesitate to say so . Nevertheless , the committee , with a single dissenting voice , reported " inexpedient to legislate . " In this form the matter lay upon the table of the house . It was proposed to take it up , accept the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined spirit in the house , co-operated with by a number of other earnest men , declared that this should not be done . The position taken was that the matter had a right to lie upon the table until the state should be heard from . The state was heard from . Earnest committees working along several lines precipitated an agitation of the whole subject , by public meetings , by use of the periodical press and by other means , which within a month put an entirely new face upon the proposal . The result was that the matter2 then taken up in the houses received // earnest attention , and the bill amended in several important respects passed its three stages in the house , and passed the senate down to the last stage . In that stage it was defeated under very mysterious circumstances . The date of its defeat was June 19 , although June 20 , when an attempt at reconsideration was also defeated , is the latest date of its appearance in the Senate. * The subj&amp;t , however , was referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where it is hoped that all earnest and intelligent citizens of the commonwealth will cause their influence to be felt in its favor . This being , in a few words , the history of the attempted legislation , what , in brief , did the bill propose ? It proposed merely permissive legislation . It simply extended the now well-established local option principle so as to permit , in cities and towns already thoroughly committed to a license policy , and that only under most stringent conditions , the putting of a second question on the ballot , after that about granting licenses , namely : " If licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors are granted in this city ( or town ) , shall they be granted under the Norwegian system ? It merely , under such strict conditions , referred the question to the people to decide . If the people decided favorably , a monopoly of liquor licenses in such cities or towns was to be granted to a company of philanthropic residents , who should undertake to conduct the business with an eye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest amount possible ; who should turn over all profits , beyond a small per cent on money actually invested , to objects of public utility ; and , moreover , this company should be so surrounded with safeguards as to be compelled to carry on the business according to the principles involved , with the provision of swift and sure means of dissolving the company if such ends were not attained . The great advantages claimed for such a method of handling the traffic were : first , the elimination of private profits , which alone cause the business to be so * For a tolerably complete outline of the legislative history of this matter , see Qatlook , July 7 , 5894 , " The Norwegian campaign in Massachusetts . " energetically pushed ; secondly , the removal from the business of all those allurements by which , in a great variety of forms , the traffic is at present rendered thrice as dangerous as the other system would make it ; and , thirdly , the entire divorce of the business from politics , which are in greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The comprehensive principle underlying the whole measure was this , - that a traffic the most dangerous of all traffics to the community should , like the sale of gunpowder or of dynamite , be placed in the hands only of the most trustworthy and public-spirited men . It will be observed that this legislative proposal was not analogous to the South Carolina plan , in that neither the state nor the municipality might undertake it or become in any considerable degree party to it , but that , just as at present , the matter was left in private hands , these private hands only being insured to be those having the good of the community at heart . It will also be observed that , unlike the system in Scandinavia , all alcoholics were included under the proposed legislation , instead of spirits alone . It will be observed finally that , although the legislation was called Norwegian , from the country where the system is most thoroughly worked , the legislation differed in many vital respects from that in force in Norway , and might , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American bill or the Massachusetts bill . Another remark which ought to be made is that , in the case of probably a large majority of its advocates , this legislation was conceived of as but an auxiliary and supplementary measure to go with the state 's present policy of encouraging local prohibition . While doubtless some advocates of the system have grave doubts about the wisdom even of local prohibition , by far the larger number of those actively interested in pushing the agitation are stanch believers in local prohibi* tion just as fast as communities can be educated up to that standard and to the thorough enforcement of laws locally excluding the saloon . It had been for years a source of the heaviest discouragement to not a few of them , actively engaged as // they were in pushing local prohibition , that there was always a line beyond which it seemed impossible to carry that movement . Just in proportion as cities and towns in the neighborhood of Boston , for example , could be effectively rid of the saloon , would Boston become a worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion of the saloon greatly diminished drinking , as figures conclusively prove , at the same time many persons would have liquor and would go to Boston for it . On the hearts of such men the case of Boston , of Worcester , of Springfield and other places lay as a heavy load . As long as they must have the saloon , must they have the saloon in its present abominable form ? Had not minorities a responsibility ? If they could not , by their votes , exclude the saloon , then had they not a responsibility to join with the worthier men among those favoring it , for a form of saloon vastly better than the present horrible type ? To the minds of such persons it seemed that the present advanced condition of temperance sentiment and of practical temperance law in Massachusetts caused the state to be well armed , but armed only with a single weapon ; and they desired to have it supplied with a second weapon for special cases. * On board the ship by which I went to England there chanced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different parts of our own country . It was an interesting preliminary to my Norwegian journey itself to find how many of these men were alert to the agitation which had been started in Massachusetts , and were looking toward its future with the liveliest interest . This showed one , what not a few of us have long felt , that in this agitation Massachusetts is not only serving herself , but is serving the whole country . Reaching Liverpool on a certain evening , I dropped a note to the bishop of Chester , the leading English advocate of the system , stating that I brought a letter of introduction from Commissioner Brooks , and asking at what time it would be convenient for him to see me . The * For a discussion of the inter-relation of the Massachusetts movements in the direction of local prohihition and toward the Norwegian method , and for a fuller account of the proposed legislation in res ect to the latter , see Jade*ende , d , Octoher * , 5894 , " the No*egian Agitation in I assachusetta. " - next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to him that very afternoon , and assigning a generous amount of time for our conference . Obviously that bishop was one alert to push any work in hand . I found him as eager and enthusiastic as Bishop Brooks used to be , with a zeal for applied Christianity , and with a disposition to attend thoroughly to details , as marked as are those traits in Dr. Hale . He was full of the Grosvenor House meeting in this interest , which had been held July 7 . He showed me a copy of Mr. Chamberlain 's great speech on that occasion . He passed over to me considerable additional local literature on the subject ; and - what interested me most - he said that before he was in orders , not having at that time ever heard of the Scandinavian plan , he had conceived the idea of himself getting control of the public houses in his native town in Wales , in order to better them . In this project he did not succeed , but it had always been a favorite idea with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost immediately become an earnest student of it . Thus it appears that the foremost leader of the agitation in Eugland had , as it were , a baptism for it from early youth , and is now , in his high place of influence and authority , only working out the impulses of his dawning manhood . Our conversation covered wide ranges , not only with regard to this work , but with regard to the great subject of Christian unity , and he kindly proposed that , on my return from Norway , I should come to him again , when he would put me in tQuch with other leaders of the movement . In a few days I was hard at work at Oxford . My surprise and joy were great , in a lecture one day at Balliol College , to see , only a few seats from me , Dr. Philip S. Moxom . Neither of us knew that the other was on that side of the Atlantic . As soon as the lecture was done we clasped hands , - and almost as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his quick and generous way he exclaimed : " I 'll go too . It will involve some serious changes of plan , and there may be some hindrance ? - but I think I // can manage it . " He did manage it ; and on the morning of July 24 we left London for Hull , whence we sailed for Bergen the same afternoon . We made that port at noon of the second day out , and that afternoon started upon our investigations . This accidental meeting with Dr. Moxom , who had run down from London to Oxford for but twenty-four hours , was one of the happy coincidences of the journey . It gave me not only the best of company , but the assistance of an acute , thoroughly trained , thoroughly alert mind in the work that I was undertaking . In this article I do not speak for him , but I think that he will concur in most , perhaps in all , that I shall say . I carried a note of introduction to a wholesale merchant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of high civic and Christian character . I found him in his office , presented my note , and received at once his cheery " I will go out with you at once . " His store was near that part of the harbor of Bergen which is devoted to yvharves and warehouses having to do with the great fisheries of that port . One would think himself along Gloucester wharves , except that Bergen has an importance as a seaport not by any means confined to its enormous fishing interests . Within a stone 's throw of his store , and close by these wharves , he led us into a shop kept by the Bergen Samlag , - that is , the company , in that city of fiftythree thousand people , which handles this business . We hardly knew we were entering a liquor shop . The place was small , scrupulously neat , with nothing outside or in to attract , and for a sign only a small board indicating that this was a shop of the Bergen Samlag . There was not a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . A small narrow counter ran along part of one side of the room . On it were a number of small glasses , into each of which were etched or ground the letters " B. S. , ' ' standing for " Bergen Samlag . " The glasses are accurately graduated , though without graduation marks , and only out of these glasses may spirits be sold . This enables each sale to be accounted for , as the nickels given on our electric cars must be accounted for . Thus there can be no stealings of liquor . The men behind the counter were about such a class of men as would run a locomotive on our railroads , - somewhat of a workingman 's type , but of a superior intelligence , clear eye , strong , clean face , impressing you immediately with dignity and with strength . Our friend explained to them our errand , and they and he did their utmost to make everything clear to us . During our stay two or three persons came in and bought drinks . I never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorous and orderly as if it had been the most serious sort of business transaction . At once the tiny glassful had been swallowed , the buyer turned on his heel and was gone . Almost the only thing on the walls of this place was a framed copy of the rules governing the shop . They were explained to us . They were exceedingly terse , and conveyed ideas like these : " This place opens at 8 , closes at 12 , reopens at 1.30 , and closes at 8 , except nights before Sundays and holy days , when it closes at 5 . " " Only the company 's glasses may be used in selling . " " It is not permitted to treat the bartender . " " No one may buy on credit here . " " When you have drunk , go out . " " There may be here no improper language or disorderly conduct . " " No one under eighteen may enter this place . " " It is not permitted to sell to any person giving the least sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensations of a person hating the liquor traffic , who is compelled in the discharge of his duties very often to pass by the numberless liquor saloons in the neighborhood of the northern and southern depots in Boston and who is accustomed to see those places glaring with lights , filled with everything that can allure drinking men , and crowded with buyers who spend whole evenings there , as he stood in this place . It moved me to the depths . I had been hearing that Scandinavia was fifty years behind the times ; that Massachusetts would be false to her standards if she suffered herself to fall back into the middle or early part of // the century by following Norway . To me , haunted continually as I am by the vision of those gateways of hell with which Boston is filled , it seemed , on the contrary , that Bergen was fifty years ahead of Boston , and that a sort of sctcrilege had been committed by those who filled our ears last spring with words like those . The merchant conducted us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we saw practically duplicated what we had already seen . He next took us to the head office of the Samlag . This was a fair-sized building , given up to the storage , the offices , etc. , of the company . Here analyses are made of all the kinds of liquor sold . Only the very best quality , the purest , and containing as low a per cent of alcohol as buyers will tolerate , are permitted by the company . The accounts are kept in an accurate and thorough manner , and are open to the public . Employees must be of the best character , are on a regular gradation of salaries , receive promotion for good behavior and not with reference to the amount of sales which they effect ( in fact , the less they sell the better their standing with the company ) , and are liable to swift discharge upon any violation of the company 's rules . I met , later , a gentleman who told me that , in the same building where his office was , an employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a single instance , to allow a man his tiny glass of spirits on credit , and that for this slight breach of the rules he was summarily discharged . Such is the thoroughness and discipline of the Bergen Samlag . Mr. Irgens , the manager of the company , struck me as a person profoundly interested in the ideas and in the economic and moral bearings of the movement . He is able to speak English fairly well , and gave to Dr. Moxom and me a printed copy of a letter in English which he had written to a lady in England who had applied to him for information upon the workings of the system in Bergen . I mention these facts as illustrating the sort of men who are set to work the system out . I caused to be marked for me , on a map of Bergen which I had , the places where the fourteen shops of the company could be found . Of these , ten are for the sale of spirits by the glass , and four for its sale in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen shops , but they have now been cut down to fourteen . The aim of this company is to open the fewest possible places , and to safeguard them more and more , as it becomes practicable , by rules and provisions which shall reduce the evils of the traffic to a minimum . The people at Berkeley Temple in Boston have recently been deeply agitated over the question whether another retail place should be opened near their church . The license commissioners took a wavering attitude . They wished the officers of the church to assume the responsibility if a license was refused . In Bergen , on the contrary , the whole spirit is not only not to open new places , but to extinguish , as fast as may be practicable , the places that already exist . Under this system , groups of philanthropists , in the cities where liquor must be sold , are eager and earnest , partly by diminishing the number of places and partly by stringent regulations , to accomplish everything that can be accomplished , in the view of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the liquor regime in Boston , for instance , which seems to seek to do its very worst . This ended our contact with the official side of the system in Bergen . I utilized all the time I could spare during the remainder of my stay in going about , guided by the marks on my map , and generally alone , to other shops of the company , most of which I visited ; and to seeing what I saw in disguise , as it were , lest the matter might by any possibility , were I accompanied by another , or by an officer of the company , get itself on dress parade . And what I saw as an unknown stranger , coming in almost as a detective , entirely accorded with what I saw in the company of that well-known merchant , and of the manager of the company , who also had accompanied me to one shop . I particularly remember , in a place where nobody could speak English , as I could not speak Norwegian , the sudden and swift departure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun , of one or two persons // from the place . The thing was done so quickly that I scarcely noticed it until it was done . By unmistakable signs , and by a little broken English , I ascertained that these persons were suspected to be nearing the point where they should take no more ; and either a look , a shake of the head or a single word had caused them to leave the place as if a police officer were after them . In fact , I understand that in places where this system is best worked in Scandinavia the companies have a kind of black list of persons to whom , even though not giving immediate signs *of nearing intoxication , the keepers of the shops will not sell because they are prone to drunkenness . Is that fifty years behind Massachusetts , or some years ahead ? We landed at Bergen July 26 . It was necessary for Dr. Moxom to leave Christiania for a continental journey on the night of August 2 , and for me to sail from the same port for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergen on the afternoon of July 27 , to travel overland to Christiania . This was accomplished by going by rail to Voss ; thence by conveyance to Gudvangen on the Sognefjord ; thence by steamer on that fjord to flerdal ; thence by conveyance , three days ' journey , to Odna*s , the intervening nights being spent respectively at Nystuen and at Fagermes ; from Odna*s by steamer down the Randsfjjord to Randsfjord Station at its foot ; and thence by rail , several hours ' ride , via Drammen ( at which city , however , we could not stop ) , to Christiania . The route , comprehensively , was the " Valders " route . The total distance by conveyance alone was one hundred and sixty miles , of which I managed to tramp forty miles , and Dr. Moxom to cover a considerable distance in the same manner . I indicate these details that the reader may know exactly where we went , and when , and how fast ; and I speak of the foot journeying because one sees a country in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best , maintained by the government , but laid out through a more or less sparsely settled country . However , we came upon many important watering-places and innumerable hamlets . In some of these places , at least , the authorities of the community - for in that land such matters are settled not by direct vote , but by the decision of the elected magistrates - had permitted no company to be organized ; that is to say , local option had kept spirits out . For example , at Voss , a magnificent summering place , inquiry in a great hotel proved that no spirits could be had , the authorities having permitted no company for the traffic there . This overland journey was not only glorious for its natural scenery , its bracing air and its contact with the people , but was most impressive by reason of the remarkable absence of drunkenness and of the signs of dissipation , and for the number of persons with whom we came in contact who gave us the most valuable testimony with reference to the excellence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the results of this kind of observation . Christiania has a population of about one hundred and seventy thousand . It is the capital and metropolis of the country . It is a beautiful and picturesque city . It is a great port , as well as the capital . The maritime interests are enormous . It is an important railway centre . The gayety , frivolity and sin of a metropolis are there . The results of our observations were not as satisfactory at Christiania as at Bergen . There are more difficulties . For example , that being the capital city , there still survive within it as many as twentytwo persons who hold life licenses for the sale of spirits , granted many years ago by royal authority as special kindnesses or honors ; and to these licenses the holders cling tenaciously . Not one of these persons is under seventy-two years old , and a considerable number of them are widows , these licenses being of such a nature that the survivor of any family , whether the wife or the husband , shall have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountering far greater difficulties than in Bergen , we received the same excellent impression with regard to the system as it works there . We saw nothing which invalidated its principle . Notwithstanding* // the largeness of the city , the Christiania Samlag has only fourteen shops , as at Bergen , and , as there , ten of them are for sales by the glass , and four for sales in bottles . Probably the number would be larger , except for the life licenses to which I have alluded . The holders of the latter co-operate to some extent with the Samlag in respect to limited hours and the like . The shops of the Christiania Samlag were somewhat roomier and in a general way more attractive than those in Bergen , but never roomy or attractive in the objectionable sense which marks our American saloons . They have simply been made somewhat better architecturally , and somewhat better adapted as regards light and air for the carrying on of the business . At the main office of the company I found just such a manager as at Bergen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . An attache of the American consulate , a native of Christiania , kindly insisted on accompanying Dr. Moxom and myself to a number of the company 's shops to act as our interpreter . We went , however , in such a way as to secure the practical advantages of the method of investigation which we had employed at Bergen . We sounded no trumpet before us , came in in the quietest , least-to-beobserved manner , and , I am sure , saw the thing as it is . Our impressions were the same as those which we received in Bergen , modified solely by the fact that obviously greater difficulties had to be encountered by the company in Christiania than in that city . I did a little investigating by aid of a map of the city , and entirely alone , but mainly was accompanied as I have indicated . Our conductor was thoroughly familiar with the different districts of the city ; and the most striking thing , to my mind , in all that I saw was the fact that what is naturally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great wharves and the parts which in an American city we should call slums , had company 's shops which were in the highest degree orderly and quiet , and conducted with as much care as in Bergen . It was as if one should go into the North End of Boston , or into the neighborhood of the Cunard and White Star docks in New York , and should find , in the selling of liquor , the precise opposite of what is so deeply to be lamented in those places . Almost the last thing I did in Christiania - it was after Dr. Moxom had started on his continental journey - was to spend an hour or two in the company of the Hon. H. B. Berner . Norway has two national banks , one for circulation and one for government loans , the pushing of national and local enterprises , etc . Of the latter this gentleman is the manager . In other words , he is a financier suitable to be secretary of the treasury . He has been much in parliament , but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chairman of the Royal Commission to consider what improvements could be made in the liquor laws , and to report the same to the parliament which had just adjourned when we visited Norway . I chanced to call upon him at the bank at the worst time as regards banking hours ; and this was made the more unfortunate by the fact that he had only returned within a day or two from his vacation , and had accumulated work on his hands . He , however , though I brought no note of introduction , immediately dropped everything , save the signing of documents which would from time to time be brought him in his private office , and gave freely and enthusiastically all the time to me which I could desire . That interview was the most impressive thing in my Norwegian journey . It was the touch of a great , earnest , passionate soul . He is at the head of the movement in Norway . He seemed to me very much such a person as I have always understood our Henry Wilson to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with greater indignation than did he against the evils which at the best still exist . He could have little patience especially with his own city of Christiania . He maintained that that city , although the national laws are not yet strict enough , ought of its own volition to move forward more rapidly than it is moving . He outlined to me the general condition of parties in the // country on the temperance question , the obstacles which the movement has had to encounter in coming thus far , and gave me somewhat elaborate memoranda concerning the more marked features of the bill improving the present law which had passed parliament two or three weeks earlier . This is not the place to describe the main features of this bill ; but two items of it , one of them incidental , the other primary , will illustrate the progressive state of the movement in Norway at present . One of these illustrations is an enactment requiring that no , person owning a life license - like the twenty-two in Christiania , no one of whom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widows - may let out his or her license , but must be either directly in the business or in a bona Jide partnership for carlying it on . By this provision it is obvious either that persons now leasing their licenses to others must discontinue their use altogether , or must assume a personal responsibility in what is done under them . Another example of the enactments of this bill is the requirement that a much smaller proportion of the profits under the present system shall go to the advantage of the particular town which permits the carrying on of the business . By this means the town itself will derive , directly and indirectly , less advantage from the profits of the system , and will therefore be the less tempted to continue in it beyond the time when the business can be entirely extinguished . I was particularly interested in this feature of the bill because some warm friends of our cause in the last campaign held up to the rest of us the warning note that , if any community derived , though indirectly , any great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tempted to continue it beyond the time when it could be extinguished . I hope that this feature , so dear to Berner 's heart , will become a distinct peculiarity of the bill to be offered in the Massachusetts legislature at the next session . This heart-stirring conference with such a leader not only revealed the depth and fire of earnestness which underlies the movement in Norway , but showed , as by a lightning1s flash , how thoroughly the movement even there is only in its earlier stages , and how full of possibilities of growth and of large promise it is . One felicitous phrase , though in the simplicity of one to whom English was not Vernacular , will illustrate this . Speaking of the president of the National Total Abstinence Society , who in parliament had done wonders for the successful passage of the bill , and of that person s desire in conference to go farther than the bill went , he said , " The president of the National Society was anxious to go even farther , but I said to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " A movement which has back of it souls thoroughly on fire , indignant at evils still existing , and devoting themselves with sagacity and yet with abandon to the gradual extension and strengthening of every branch of the undertaking , is not to be sneered at , as it was sneered at by opponents of the Norwegian bill in Massachusetts last spring . Furthermore , a certain passage from Berner , in Professor Gould 's report , in which he speaks of evils still existing with almost fiery indignation , gets , in the light of this conference , its proper background and perspective . That passage , it is said , was used by leading extreme temperance men as a chief weapon for defeating the bill in the Massachusetts senate . By any canon of fairness can the fiery indignation of one believing to the bottom of his soul in the Norwegian principle , in expressing itself against abuses still existing , be used as an argument against that principle ? Had I seen nothing else than the fine spirit of Berner and the evidences of the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , these would well have repaid me for my trip to Norway . I group together now , with little logical order , some of the side-lights of my trip . An attache of the Department of Archives at Brussels in Belgium , a scholar and antiquarian , who came with us on the same ship to Bergen , took a long walk up one of the precipitous heights which surround that city . The city is shut in by an amphitheatre of mountains and , with the long continuance of sunlight at that // season , is apt to be very hot . This gentleman having taken this long , hard walk , was near being overcome by the heat , and desired a small amount of brandy . He knew nothing of this system , and made application for a small quantity . He could not get it . At first he supposed it could not be obtained in Bergen . By and by he found how it was ; he could only get it by going to one of those few shops of the Samlag . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that long overland driving and tramping , was a person who obviously was not an abstainer . He was conducting a party of travellers over that section of the Valders route . It did not please him that some article upon the table for dessert was very lightly seasoned . " Humph ! " he exclaimed , " there is about as much seasoning in that dish as there is brandy in the article which the Bergen Samlag sells . " This man knew nothing about our purpose in this journey . He was condemning the dessert and the Bergen Samlag ; and thus , like a straw showing the current , he became the most valuable sort of witness to the thoroughness with which , in Bergen , the company system seeks to diminish , even in spirits sold , the amount of alcohol to be drunk . A corroborative illustration of the same type , but from the other side , was this : at some point on our journey I heard an earnest man say that he feared that the Bergen company was so alert and exacting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , against the company . What a testimony , from a serious person , was this to the thoroughness and good faith with which , at an important fishing and commercial port , a little group of earnest men have been able to handle this great economic and moral problem ! Travelling with us a part of our way were two gentlemen whose testimony I wish especially to adduce ; if necessary , I can give their names . One of them was a resident of Bergen , a business man engaged in the disposal at wholesale of a certain line of goods for various Scandinavian cities . He had been for twelve years a member of the Bergen School Board . He was a very thoughtful man , as his conversation showed , especially on civic questions . He told me that he was able to recall well the condition of things in Bergen before the company system went into operation , and that he had observed carefully its workings from the moment of its introduction . He said that he was strenuously opposed to the system at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civic nature . He questioned the right to interfere , by national permission and municipal option , with a line of trade even such as that . But the good fruits of the system were so niarked that he long ago conceded that his position had not been well taken , and in his judgment hardly anything better could be devised anywhere for handling this evil . Drunkenness had decreased in Bergen greatly ; it was constantly to be seen upon the streets in the earlier days , but under this system had nearly disappeared . The order of the city had improved very greatly . It was not an uncommon thing , in the earlier days , to see fighting and disorder , but these had nearly vanished . There was still considerable liquor drunk , but the whole matter had passed into altogether a different and higher range . It would be difficult , he thought , to praise too highly the workings of the system in Bergen . The other of these men , travelling with his family and with a business friend , we were with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a native of Norway , but was engaged in extensive manufacturing near Gothenburg in Sweden . I asked him to tell me about matters in Gothenburg . He spoke in the same general strain as the fellow traveller last quoted . He told of the remarkable effects of the company system upon workingmen , of whom his concern employed in the summer between four hundred and five hundred , and in the winter about one hundred . The placing of the liquor traffic under the limitations and under the partial condemnation involved in the company system had caused great decrease in drunkenness among workingmen as well as among others . They were thrifty , stayed long with their employers , often owned their own houses , and were emancipated from the general // evils to be found connected with drunkenness in lands where another system prevailed . The thing which most impressed me in our conversation was what he had to say of the Wieselgrens , father and son . Peter Wieselgren , dean of Gothenburg , now long dead , this gentleman told me , was held in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People could not praise him enough . He had devoted his life to the extinction , as far as might be , of two evils , drunkenness and the social evil . In his efforts for the former he had started the present movement . Of his sincerity , his earnestness , his devotion , his ability and power no one had the least question . In most of his children , this gentleman said , the great reformer has worthy successors . One of them , Magnus , at present dean of Gothenburg , is following almost precisely the lines of work to which his father gave his life . This is the kind of spirit which has been , and which now is , back of this movement in Sweden ; and in Berner , whom I have described , one sees what is back of the yet more successful movement in Norway . It would not be just , in closing this kind of evidence , not to include the testimony of the master of the steamship which bore me from Christiania to Hull . This commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great XVilson line , was , by his very calling , obliged to spend not a little of his time in Norway . There he was a keen observer . He knew the system of public houses in England and the system in Norway . He frankly said that he himself had not very high views on the , general subject , - that is to say , he was not pronouncedly a temperance advocate . At the same time , he conveyed to me most distinctly the sturdy impression which had been formed in his honest English mind by the relative merits of the English and the Scandinavian systems ; and he told me that any rational movement , such as that which the bishop of Chester is leading in England , for reducing the evils of the traffic by such methods as are employed in Scandinavia , ought to have the support of every thinking man , whatever his particular convictions on the liquor question . It is right for me to add , as I leave this part of the subject , my own impression on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw two of its principal cities . I was constantly on the move . In those cities I turned aside from the things which would most interest me to give almost my exclusive attention to the crowded and what one would expect to find the dissolute parts of those cities . I spent much of my time in liquor saloons . Very often I was entirely alone . I kept my eyes and my ears open . In journeying across the entire peninsula between Bergen and Christiania I had opportunity to see many things and to talk with many persons . I was in the company of one of the acutest and one of the most observing minds of this or any other land . We were constantly comparing notes . He was investigating as well as I. He paid particular attention to sides of the investigation which only in an indirect way I attempted to examine . During our stay in Norway we were guests at seven hotels , dined or supped at five more , and , for baiting horses , stopped for short intervals at eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all that travel , devoting attention almost exclusively to that subject , frequenting especially the poorest and worst parts of cities and their drinking-places , I saw but one drunken man , - and he was not on the soil of Norway , but on the gang-plank of the steamer which conveyed me from Christiania to Hull . He appeared to be an emigrant of the better class ; friends had come to the wharf to see him off ; and , under those circumstances , he had taken enough drink to make him not quite himself . When I thought of the sights and sounds which , under like circumstances in America , I should have been witness of , it seemed to me again that those persons who had been telling us about Scandinavia being fifty years behind the times , and our not wanting to learn anything from her , were themselves either strangely ignorant or strangely blinded . // Chester had planned helpful things for me on my return to England . A letter in his hand was given me before I left the ship at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should telegraph him my further address , that he might give me additional particulars . One of these appointments was to lunch with the vicar of Frodsham , in Cheshire , one of the most earnest ministers of the Church of England in that section , who had visited Norway on the same errand a year or two earlier , and who had issued a pamphlet , published by the Church of England Temperance Society , entitled , " What I saw of the Gothenburg System in Bergen . " Another was to spend a delightful hour with the bishop himself at the palace in Chester , where we compared notes on what I had seen , on the results of the Grosvenor House meeting in July , and on other aspects of the subject The bishop was on his holiday in Wales , but had taken the trouble to come up to Chester for this purpose . Besides this , by the courtesy of Judge and Mrs. Thomas Hughes , it had been kindly arranged that he and I should dine with them in their beautiful Chester home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to them , but to show that the accidental circumstance of one 's being on that side of the Atlantic on such an errand was the occasion for such courtesies and opportunities for acquiring information to be put in one 's way . It would not be proper for me to speak , except in a purely general way , of these visits . They are among the sweetest memories of my life . I never quite understood , until the bishop had brought me into Judge Hughes 's home , how the disciples felt about the tabernacles in the Mount of Transfiguration . What will especially remain with me will be the fact that a high ecclesiastic of the Church of England is giving time , strength and love without measure to this cause , has been the means of enlisting some of the ; foremost men and women of England in the work , - persons like the Duke and Duchess of Westminster , Mr. Chamberiain and Mr. Gladstone ; that a large working organization has been already formed to push the endeavor ; and especially that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose intimacy with our own Lowell was like that of a brother and sister , are thoroughly committed to the cause , and that Judge Hughes wrote to the Grosvenor House meeting regarding it - " Please enter my name as an original member of the Association which is to be started there . I have been a temperance ( would be ) reformer , in and out of parliament for more than thirty years , but have never had such faith in or hope for any proposal as I have in this of adapting the Scandinavian system to our English circumstances and needs . I wish we could claim the honor of being the first English folk to try it ; but I see that their Norwegian bill , ' as they call it , is law in New England , having passed through both houses of the Massachusetts legislature . Let us hope this example may strengthen the feeble knees ' of our temperance men and women in Old England . " I have now brought to a close some outline of the observations and experiences of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I started on it , " Are you going as a partisan , simply to find here and there a fact to support your theory ? or are you going without bias to see things as they are ? " The latter was my conscientious aim . I strove to be candid and thorough . I know I was the latter ; I trust I was the former . And candor requires me to state ( and I can say it the more readily because , as it seems to me , it is a strong point in favor of our movement rather than against it ) that there is some truth in what has been told us in America about matters not being all that could be desired in Scandinavia . The best system will have defects in its administration . Not infrequently men will fall below the ideal in working out the best system . Church life itself is an example of that . Now what as it seems to me is to be regretted in Scandinavia , may be thus summarized - First , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandinavia was an excessively drunken country ; and , notwithstanding all that has been done , that country could not be expected even yet to have gotten entirely away from the effect of its antecedents . I // suppose it was the very desperateness of its situation and the inadequacy of any kind of legal provisions which were resorted to to produce the desired effect , which - as with the method of balloting in Australia - led to the discovery and application of the Scandinavian principle . In the second place , there never has swept over Scandinavia that wide-reaching personal total abstinence reform which we have enjoyed in America and particularly in New England . Many of its people have still very much the same idea about the wisdom of using a moderare amount of stimulants which was common in America before our great reform . It is just to say , however , that the reform has started and is steadily making headway . In the third place , this system has as yet been applied only to spirits . Fermented drinks are outside its pale . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latterly it is coming to be seen that a good deal of fermented drink and a little spirits are almost worse in their tendency to produce drunkenness than pure spirits themselves . It is to this new stage of the reform which men like Berner are looking forward with eagerness . Berner says that that must be the next step . In the fourth place , the survival in Scandinavia of persons , generally aged , who hold life licenses , must for a considerable number of years yet handicap the movement . In the light of such statements it should surprise no one that there is still much drinking in that land ; that those who patronize the shops even of the Samlags are numerous ; that persons are met from time to time who bear the look of those habituated to drink , though few the look of excessive drinking ; and that one longs to see there , as Berner does , a more thorough-going personal reform . When , however , all this has been conceded , I submit to candid and open minds , whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened last spring , about Scandinavia being behind the age , and Massachusetts wanting nothing from her ; or whether , on the contrary , the proper form of the argument is not this , namely : if , laboring under such great disadvantages , Scandinavia has been able to produce such results in the decrease of the amount of spirits consumed as statistics abundantly prove , and such results in better order and the decrease of drunkenness as the statements I have made involve , - what might not be accomplished by the application of the Scandinavian principle in Massachusetts , applied , as we propose to apply it , to all alcoholics , backed by many of the noblest men and women of the commonwealth , and employed permissively only as an auxiliary weapon alongside of our strong movement in the direction of local prohibition ? Do not the untoward conditions in Scandinavia , the obstacles and the difficulties , so far from detracting , add to the splendor of principles which , amidst such an environment , can produce such results ? Is not the case all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter is the proper form of the argument . And though I had no doubt , when I set out , of the soundness of the principles underlying our movement , my convictions on the subject grew steadily throughout my journey . I was , over and over again , sometimes in the shops of their Samlags , and sometimes in conversation with earnest men , so moved that my eyes would blind with tears , and my voice cease to be in my command , as there would come rolling over me a sense of the immense moral force and the superb gains which the system involves . As I said to Commissioner Brooks on my return , the half had not been told . The deepest and noblest spirit of Norway , at any rate , is back of the movement . The deepest and noblest spirit of England is back of it , also . England , encountering obstacles of which we in Massachusetts know little , is turning with eager and hungry eyes toward Massachusetts to see if she will not break ground in this direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we had already done . If we have the wisdom , the firmness and the courage to discern our opportunity and , the coming winter and spring , to meet it by focusing the intelligence and // consecration of the commonwealth at the State House so as to compel the legislature to pass the bill , we shall have ushered in the beginning of the end of the tyranny of the drink traffic in our time . For , if Massachusetts shall take up this work and do it thoroughly , as an auxiliary to ever-growing local prohibition , the movement will spread from this into other states , as the Australian system of balloting has spread from us all over the country ; and England , strengthened by our example , will carry out the same work in our mother land ; the movement will spread from her to her colonies ; and thus these cognate peoples , those of the Scandinavian peninsula and those whose ancestors were first found along the shores of the Baltic and of the German Ocean , will open the way for the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRENCH 'S " DEATH AND THE SCULPTOR .
