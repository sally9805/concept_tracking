txt The most interesting feature of the imports of gold which have taken place recently and which the financiers of the other side clearly expect to continue is that the movement takes place with little cr no regard to the political situation in this country . We do not mean to assert that the future of the currency of the United States is no longer without any influence whatever in determining investments or in affecting the plans of European capitalists . That is not the truth , and can not be until our currency system is so reformed as to relieve the Government from the risk of demands upon its reserve which can not clearly be calculated and for which no adequate provision is made . But for some years now the question will be definitely in abeyance , and as to current operations or any not covering a long period , the opinion of ransatla.ntic capitalists does not take it into account . One obvious result of this situation is that our securities of all sorts are now dealt in very much as are our grain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the prospect of profit suggests , and the prospect of profit is judged not by the declarations of political conventions or the returns of elections , but by the course of trade . And the demand growing out of the state of mind in the English public especially is sufficiently substantial often to cause prices there to be higher for a time than they are in New York . It is true that the American correspondents of some of the English papers are just now engaged in showing that we in New York are on the verge of anarchy because of the possibility that HENRY GEORGE may get more than one-fourth of the votes cast for Mayor , but this is only a journalistic freak as likely to be directed toward Spanish or French credit as toward ours . The fact remains that we are now reaping the harvest of last year 's elections , when the Nation decided irrevocably that the currency should not be changed for the worse ? an absolute condition precedent to a change for the better which is bound to come . When that change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have , we shall have taken a long step toward establishing New York in that central position of financial power and influence that London now holds .
