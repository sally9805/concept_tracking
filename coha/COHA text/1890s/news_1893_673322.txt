txt Another step was taken yesterday by the Board of Aldermen in the long process of determining the income and expenses of the City Government for the current year . This process begins at the opening of the year with the estimate of expenses made by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment and confirmed by the Aldermen , which becomes in effect the appropriation of money for the various purposes designated . The total for this year was $37,444,154.68 , and this amount less the resources of the General Fund was to be raised by taxation . The General Fund is the receptacle of such city revenues from other sources than taxation as are not otherwise disposed of by law , the bulk of such revenues going into the Sinking Fund . After deducting the General Fund revenues and adding the Aldermen 's estimates for deficiencies the amount to be raised by taxation this year is just over $35,000.000 , of which about $10,000,000 is for State taxes and the account of the municipal debt . After the estimates of the year have been made up , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is July before the assessment rolls are submitted to the Board of Aldermen upon which they calculate the tax for the year . The total assessed valuation this year is .. $1,933,518,529 , an increase of more than $103,000,000 over that of last year , . and the tax rate has been fixed at 1.82 per cont . This is .03 tower than that of last yeas , anti is said to be the lowest within the memory of men . It is not , however , to be taken as an index of public expenditures . The low rate is in part due to increased valuations , and in part to the virtual concealment of certain classes of expenditures by the Sinking Fund operations . ? The expenses of the Dock Department , for instance , never appear in the estimates for the year . They are met by the issue of bonds , which are authorized by the Sinking Fund Commission , and . which , under the present law , can not exceed . $3,000,000 a year . On the other hand , the revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the redemption of the city debt . It is presumed that the Dook Department is practically self-supporting , but nobody can tell whether it adds more to the Sinking Fund . from its receipts than it adds to the debt by its expenditures without a study and analysis of reports or statements which the public rarely sees or pays attention to . A good deal of the paving that has been going on in the last few years , besides various public improvements , is paid . for by the issue of bonds . To get a full understanding of the subject of municipal receipts and expenses one must study , not only the estimates and the taxes , but the statistics of the city debt and Sinking Fund . One general fact in regard . to the city finances is easily grasped . A recent report of the Controller showed that additions to the Sinking Fund more than keep pace with the increase of bonded indebtedness , so that the not debt was diminished in the first half of the year , and now it appears that the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
