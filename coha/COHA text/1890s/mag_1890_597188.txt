111. - THE DIFFERENTIATING OF CHRISTIANITY FROM JUDAISM . OXV the ties which at the outset held Christianity and Christian believers within the pale of the Jewish religion , with no thought of breaking away from its appointed ordinances and rites , came to be completely dissolved , forms a highly interesting chapter in early Christian history . The leading agent , the man specially chosen of Providence to introduce this new stage of development , was a converted Pharisee , Saul of Tarsus . A remarkable characteristic of the revolution - or evolution , if one prefers so to call it - is the circumstance that there neither lurked in it nor ensued from it any antipathy to the Old Testament religion . It involved no discarding of the ancient Scriptures in which the revelation to the Jews was recorded . Moses and the prophets continued to be reverenced as divinely commissioned teachers . The Old Testament continued to be the Bible of the Christian churches . Up to the time of the composition and collection of the Apostolic writings they had no other Bible . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshiped was the God of the patriarchs , the same who " spake . . . unto the fathers by the prophets . " The religion of the Gospel assumed no antagonistic relation to the religion of the Old Testament . Yet it came to pass that the Old Testament ritual was dropped . The title of the Jews to peculiar and exclusive privileges in the community of Christian believers was set aside . The demand that the Christian believer should come into the Church through the door of Judaism , by conforming to the rites ordained for heathen proselytes , was no longer made . Christianity was , and was perceived to be , one thing , and Judaism another ; and soon there was a wide gulf between them . At the beginning we find the Disciples " continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple , " although they met , also , by themselves for social worship ( Acts ii . 46 , Revised Version ) . If they were , in a sense , to borrow a phrase now current , " churchgoers , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews ; only they believed that the Messiah had come , and , although he had been rejected and crucified , they looked for his second appearing in power and splendor . The daily devotions , the solemn festivals , the smoking altars of the Jewish system , were as dear and sacred to them as they had ever been . The converts were to be baptized , but baptism did not supersede the necessity of circumcision for admission into the Judaic-Christian fraternity . But pass over a few decades of years and we discover that this conformity to the old system has vanished . Numerous Christian churches are planted in which the Mosaic ceremonies are not practiced . In process of time the revolution is complete . The synagogue is no more a place of resort for Christians . Their fellowship , such as it was , with disbelieving Jews , who formed the bulk of the Jewish people , is broken off . The rupture is absolute . The opposition is mutual . The Jews pursue the Christians with bitter maledictions . The Christians are of one mind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinances is obsolete . They no longer tolerate the observances which at first they expected all of their number to practice . This revolution was the consequence of no injunction of Jesus . He himself kept the law in its ceremonial as well as in its moral parts , notwithstanding that he protested against the overrigid interpretations of the Pharisaic school . He distinguished between the laws themselves and the " traditions of the elders "  --  the glosses and additions which the doctors had affixed to the Old Testament legislation under the pretext of expounding it , or of applying it to unforeseen cases . He denounced the pernicious casuistry which brought in now an evasion of moral duties , and now an imposition of ceremonial performances which the spirit of the law did not exact . He taught that the value of institutions consisted in their usefulness . They were not an end in themselves , but a means for attaining a good beyond them . Rules were not framed for their own sake . Even the Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he even enjoined conformity to it according to its proper meaning , and himself set an example of such conformity , the spirit of his teaching and the work done by him undermined it . They could not fail to lead to the discontinuance of the Jewish cultus . Eventually it would 532 // be seen to have no longer a raison d ' * ' /re . It would come to be felt to be as needless a burden as winter garments in the mild air of summer . The time must arrive when the Jewish system would be consciously outgrown . To keep it up would then be like the attempt of an adult to wear the clothes of a child . Jesus did not decree the subversion of the Jewish cultus , that ancient fabric which had sheltered religious faith in the days of its immaturity , when the community of God was waiting for a full disclosure of his purpose of mercy and of deliverance for the race . He did not by one sudden stroke demolish that system , but he put gunpowder under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We should rather say that he prepared the way for the gradual , intelligent abandonment of it . There might be temporary confusion and even occasional contests ; but on the whole the change was to be in a true sense natural , like the melting of the winter snows and the coming out of the leaves and blossoms under the increasing warmth of the vernal sun . Jesus taught that religion is spiritual . He showed , as the prophets before him had proclaimed , how empty is a round of observances into which the heart does not enter , and which are not accompanied by righteousness of conduct . " Mercy is better than sacrifice . " He said of one that he was not far from the kingdom of God because he discerned that the love of God and man " is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices . " The illustrations in the Sermon on the Mount of that fulfillment of the law which he came to secure all relate to moral tempers and moral conduct . He taught the infinite worth of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the substance of the law . His teaching was void of sympathy with J udaic exclusiveness . That the institutions of the Gospel could not be identical with those of the old system , he taught when , in answer to the question why his disciples did not fast , he said that " new wine must not be put into old bottles . " He said that not what goeth into the mouth defileth a man . This he declared , the Evangelist adds , " making all meats clean . " He laid down the principle that defilement is from the heart alone , from bad feelings and motives - a principle which cut the ground from under the ritual as far as it related to meats and drinks . Jesus implied that he was conscious of an authority higher than that which prescribed the laws of the Old Testament , when he superseded the Mosaic l ) recept concerning divorce ( Matt. xix. 8 , Mark x. * ) ; when he declared the Son of man to be " the Lord of the Sabbath " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when he affirmed that he and his disciples were not under an obli gation to pay the tax to the temple ( Matt. xvii. 24-27 ) . " In this place , " he said , " is one greater than the temple . " The priests , it had been understood , were absolved from the strict observance of the sabbatical law . They might on any day offer their sacrifices ; they might " profane the Sabbath " without guilt . The thought was not so remote that he who was greater than the temple might supersede the temple . To the woman of Samaria he said that worship was confined to no local sanctuary ( John iv . 23 , 24 ) . There were predictions of a downfall of the temple , of the letting out of the vineyard to other husbandmen ( Matt. xxiv. 2 , Mark xiii . 2 , Luke xxi. 6 , John ii . is , Matt. xxi. 41 , Mark xii . 9 ) . Then he made everything turn on the relation of men to himself . The test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one condition and source of communion with God was personal communion with him whom God had sent . When this last truth should be fully apprehended , what space would be left for any other priesthood or sacrifice ? At the Last Supper he so connected his death with the forgiveness of sins as virtually to dispense with the need of any other offering or intercession than his own . In fine , the large and spiritual view of the nature of religion which Christ presented , together with the sufficiency which he ascribed to his own work as a reconciler , made the cultus of the Hebrews , including the national rite of circumcision , superfluous . But how should the free and catholic spirit of the Gospel come to be recognized ? How should the fetters of custom , and ingrained reverence , and national self-esteem - the claim on the part of the Jews to precedence and to some kind of perpetual sway in the concerns of religion - be broken ? For so great a change time was required . In matters where feeling is strongly enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usages are closely linked , from long association , with devotional sentiment , there is often between the premises and the legitimate conclusion a long road to travel . The purport of the Gospel in the particulars to which I have referred was discerned by the Apostle Paul at an early date , and it was more clearly and vividly perceived by him than by any other . Whether Paul had in his hands written accounts of the teaching of Jesus we are not informed . For what he says of the institution of the Lord 's Supper ( i Cor. xi . 23 seq. ) he had in some way the direct authority of the Lord . He refers it to a direct revelation ; for so we must interpret his language . On the contrary , what he says of the appearances of Jesus to the other Apostles after his resurrection ( i Cor. xv . i seq. ) he had ascertained from // them . We can not be mistaken in supposing that Paul was acquainted with teachings of Christ which , in his judgment , contained an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the privilege of the Gentiles under it which he adopted ; such teaching of Jesus as we have cited above from the Evangelists . In his intercourse with the other Apostles - it is important to remember that Paul spent a fortnight with Peter-he had the best opportunity to rectify any mistake , if he had fallen into any mistake , in respect to this part of the Saviour 's teaching . It has been sometimes said that Paul himself professes not to be acquainted with the facts of the ministry of Jesus . This strange statement is founded on a misunderstanding of his meaning when he says that he did not receive the Gospel from men , but " through revelation of Jesus Christ " ( Gal . i. 12 ) . This direct relation to Christ , who revealed himself to him and called him to be an Apostle , does not preclude the obtaining of knowledge through secondary sources . That he did not care to learn what Christ had taught and done during his earthly life is something quite incredible in a man of his active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the work of emancipating the Church from Judaism has been sometimes attributed to the liberalizing influence of culture and learning . He was that one of the Apostles , we are reminded , whose mind had been expanded by study , and whose intellect had been invigorated and widened by a scholastic training . But on this subject of the education of the Apostle to the Gentiles there are prevalent mistakes which require to be corrected . One of them is the ascription to him of a familiarity with Greek classical writers . This idea is based partly on certain utterances of his which correspond to sayings of Greek authors . There are three of these passages . The first is in the Apostle 's speech at Athens : " As certain even of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring " ( Acts xvii. 28 ) . The quotation is found in Aratus , a poet who belonged to Soli , a place near Tarsus , and it occurs , also , in that noblest example of devotional poetry that has come down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Aratus and Cleanthes belonged to the Stoic sect . The second passage of this kind is an Iambic verse : " Evil company doth corrupt good manners " ( i Cor. xv . 33 ) . This has been referred to Euripides by many , including John Milton , who remarks that " Paul thought it no defilement to insert into holy Scripture the sentences of three Greek poets , and one of them a tragedian . " But the passage is traced by scholars at present to the " Thais " of Menander . The third of the passages traceable to heathen sources is the unflattering description given of the Cretans ( Titus i. 12 ) : " Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , idle gluttons . " The words form a hexameter and are from Epimenides , a Cretan poet , whom Plato styled a " divine man , " and whom Paul does not scruple to call a " prophet " - recognizing in him , as regards this particular saying at least , a remarkable divination or foresight . But probably all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by the Apostle from the conversation of the day . According to the correct reading of the passage from Menander , Paul deviates from the metrical form ; which indicates that , unless he did not know what the original was , he preferred to give it in the shape in which it passed current as a proverb . There is really nothing either in the style of Paul 's writings , or in their contents , to show that he was versed in the Greek classical authors . As to his style , it is unlettered Greek . It is not likely that a man of his high intellectual qualities could have read an author like Plato without distinct traces of the fact being evident both in his language and in his thoughts . On a mind of an inferior order a feeble impression might have been left by the masters of Greek philosophy , poetry , and eloquence , but not on a mind like that of Paul , in case he had been conversant with them . He was born , to be sure , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered recently in that region do not indicate that the Greek in use there was of a choice character . Tarsus was a seat of Stoic philosophy . It must be remembered , however , that Paul was the son of a Pharisee , that he was a Hebrew of the Hebrews , and was no doubt brought up after the strict method of Pharisaic training . Such a father as he had would not have put pagan authors into his boy 's hands . He had for his teacher at Jerusalem the rabbi Gamaliel . The advice which , according to Luke , was given by this noted rabbi to his fellow-members of the Sanhedrim reveals a certain moderation and sagacity . He dissuaded them from using force against the Apostles , for the reason that , if their cause was right it could not be put down , and the attempt to put it down would be impious ; while , if their cause was wrong , it would come to nothing all the sooner for being let alone . His appeal to the instances of Theudas and Judas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a little while , would seem to indicate that he anticipated a like failure for the new enterprise which the Apostles were trying to promote . Whether Gamaliel was simply politic , or had some genuine tolerance in his temper , // may be a question . This we know very well , that his ardent pupil did not share in any sentiment of this kind . He was an approving spectator of the killing of Stephen . He plunged into the work of a heresy-hunter and inquisitor . He seized on the disciples of Jesus and shut them up in prison . He tried in the synagogues to force them to recant . He chased them from one place to another ; for he was " exceedingly mad against them " ( Acts xxvi. ii ) . It is certain , therefore , that Paul had not imbibed any lenient sentiment towards dissentients from the standards of orthodoxy ; and it would be irrational to credit him with feelings of this kind towards the heathen . His education was rabbinical ; and traces of its peculiar character crop out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even after he had been lifted into the higher atmosphere of the apostolic calling . Nevertheless , there exist in the writings of Paul striking coincidences with Stoic philosophic teaching . The correspondences between New Testament passages and Stoic maxims and precepts is a fact that calls for explanation . It is more marked in relation to Seneca , the Roman Stoic , the preceptor of Nero , than in regard to any other of the philosophers of the Porch . The similarity in his case extends to numerous sayings of Jesus as well as to other portions of the New Testament . The theory was broached by several of the ancient fathers that Seneca was a Christian convert . There appeared a forged correspondence between him and the Apostle Paul . From the time of Jerome , it was taken for granted that Seneca had been won over by the Apostle to the Christian faith . There is nothing to disprove the supposition that Seneca may have gathered up , perhaps from slaves of his household , fragments of the teaching of Christ and of Paul . Yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with the Epistle to the Hebrews , and this Epistle was written after Seneca s death . The whole basis of Seneca 's philosophical view is utterly at variance with the Christian system . This circumstance is fatal to the hypothesis that he was connected with Paul , as the legend represented . But how shall we account for the Stoic phraseology which is undeniably found in Paul 's speeches and writings ? The Stoic ideal of the sage painted him as lacking nothing , as the possessor of all things , as alone free , as alone happy , as alone rich , as the true xvise man , the true priest , the true king . In similar terms the Apostle delineates the Christian believer . We seem to be hearing echoes of Stoic sayings . The Stoic system was cosmopolitan in its character . The kinship of mankind , that the Stoic is a citizen of the world , a denizen of all lands , are frequent affirmations of Seneca , of Epictetus , and of the imperial philosopher , Marcus Aurelius . This universality of fellowship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boundaries of race and nationality are effaced . Such ideas in Paul are presented in an original , entirely different setting . There is a groundwork for them in Christ and his kingdom , which was wanting to the Stoic , with whom these lofty distinctions could have but little more than a negative import and value . However , the verbal resemblance remains . This is best accounted for by the intercourse into which the Apostle was brought with Stoics , both at Tarsus , where he dwelt for a considerable time after his conversion , and in other cities which he visited . At Athens , as we are told , he disputed with Stoics and Epicureans . These were the popular philosophical sects at that time . With the Epicurean tenets he could find few points of contact . But in the ethical ideas and maxims of the Stoics , although they rested on no basis of fundamental truth that was satisfactory , and although the Stoic ideal , for this reason , could not be realized , the Apostle discerned features which he , from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them up and infuse into them both a significance and a worth which they had not before possessed . The relation of Paul to certain Stoic terms and phrases was somewhat like that of the Apostle John to the term Logos , or Word , and possibly to some other phrases in his writings . Terms in current use in the discussions of the day John could take up and transfigure , as it were , so that they became a fit vehicle for expressing the higher truth which was derived , not from any philosophical source , but from revelation and from the direct impression made by Jesus upon the susceptible spirit of his disciple . The reason , certainly the main reason , for the exceptional liberality of Paul , or his complete emancipation from Judaic prejudice , is not to be found either in his learning , or in his marked perspicacity . His mind was no doubt disciplined and made capable , above most others , of looking into a question to its very core . He had no need of an acquaintance with Aristotle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to carry it out to the legitimate inferences . And he had a superiority in knowledge - not merely in that sort of kr*owledge which an eager scholar of the rabbis would of course acquire . He had a store of knowledge , constantly increasing , drawn from observation and from contact with adherents of differing schools of opinion in the places where he sojourned . But the secret of his catholicity , as we have // seen , is not to be found either in his talents or in his culture . To discover that secret we must turn to the history of his conversion . Great as the transformation was at that crisis , yet in important respects he was the same man after as before . If we look at him first on the day when he was on the road to Damascus , armed with credentials from the high priest , and then look at him again when he was on one of his great missionary journeys , we behold the same energy , the same aggressive , conquering force . He was a crusader from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral temper could be greater . He had become humane , loving , willing to give up his life , and even his own salvation , for the sake of the Jewish countrymen who detested him as an apostate . And the end in view-how different ! Then he was bent on exterminating the class whom now he regards with an almost motherly tenderness . Then it was to extirpate a faith which now he cherishes , and for which he is ready to be offered up ! Nevertheless , the natural qualities of the man , the qualities that made him a leader and , when consecrated to the service of the Gospel , a Christian hero , were his in the first as well as the last of the eras into which his life was divided , and between which seemingly a great gulf was fixed . There is one other element of resemblance , or thread of continuity , of more consequence still . His ideal from the beginning to the end of his career was righteousness . To stand right before God , acquitted , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the forum of conscience , was always to his mind the one inestimable good . He attached the same value to it after his conversion as before , the same before as after . As to what is involved in being righteous , and how righteousness can be attained , these were points on which there was a world-wide difference between the earlier and the later conception . But the aim in its generic character was unaltered . In the attempt to explain the conversion of Paul in such a way as to eliminate the miraculous elements in the event , a naturalistic solution has been suggested . The persecutor , it is said , was probably haunted with misgivings in reference to the course that he was pursuing . He had heard of the moral excellence of Jesus ; perhaps he had seen him . He had been touched by the forgiving , heavenly spirit of the dying Stephen . The meek demeanor of the harassed disciples was not without its influence . In short , there was a conflict arising in his mind ; there was inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged , was a state of feeling which might give rise to hallucination - to the imaginary vision of Jesus . The trouble with this theory is that not only is there no evidence that Paul felt any such disquiet respecting the rectitude of the errand on which he was bent , but there is decisive evidence that he did not . The phrase " It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks " means nothing more nor less than that he was engaged in a futile enterprise . It has no reference to any feeling of compunction . He was like an animal kicking against the goad . That is to say , his undertaking against the Christian faith was a hopeless one . But he says : " I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth " ( Acts xxvi. 9 ) ; " I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief " ( i Tim . i. 13 ) . There was no insincerity , no inward halting , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Messiah . There was no psychological state of the kind which would pave the way for an illusive vision of Jesus . In epistles the genuineness of which is beyond dispute , the Apostle attributes his conversion exclusively to the grace of God and an act of revelation ( Gal . i. 12 , i6 ) . " While , " writes Weiss , " he constantly accuses himself of persecuting the Church , as being the greatest sin of his life , he never intimates that he struggled long against better knowledge and conscience , in opposition to the testimony of the truth . " He never ascribes the revolution in his convictions , which was accomplished at a single stroke , to proofs appealing to his understanding , but always to facts accepted in faith , " on the believing acceptance of which his peace of soul and his eternal salvation depend . " Hence if it was a vision that produced the change , it was a real vision , and no product of illusion . It was a vision that convinced him not only that Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodily form ; so that , if this was an error , " it was God himself , by causing this vision , who led him into the error . " This perception of Christ , while he was on the way to Damascus , stands apart from other visions , of which he did not care to speak . On it he rested as the guaranty of his apostolic office ( i Cor. ix . I ) . There was included in it not only his commission to be an Apostle , but more specifically , to be an Apostle to the heathen . The sight of Jesus in the glorified state swept away the " stumbling-block " which was contained in the idea of a crucified Messiah , and served to demonstrate the fact of his resurrection . But into the conversion of Paul there entered something more than the giving up of disbelief in the divine mission of Jesus . That , in itself considered , might not have carried with it any great spiritual change . In the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the course of his inner life . Without doubt he speaks of his own personal experience , although he speaks as in this matter consciously the representative of human nature . He shows how the attempt to get inward peace by the method of law had collapsed . The seeking for righteousness on this path had brought him to utter despair , to a sense of helplessness . At the outset , as we may suppose ,  - -  in his younger days ,  --  he was " alive . " His natural feelings and desires were in full activity , with no painful consciousness of wrong . But " the law came . " There came a time when the holy ideal of duty to God and man rose before him in the rigor of its perfection . Then he " died . " His peace of mind was gone . The conflict between the desires on the one side and the restraints of law on the other produced a schism in the soul . A distressing battle raged within , in which the better nature was felt to be powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but struggling in vain to free itself . To what extent this feeling of condemnation and of bondage was experienced by him when he was on the way to Damascus - whether this consciousness of guilt and of weakness was not greatly intensified in the days that immediately followed - he does not tell us , and we have no means of knowing . But this moral conflict it was that prepared him to welcome the gospel of deliverance . There was a better way to attain to righteousness ; namely , a free pardon from God , and a new life in the spirit , a heart-fellowship , a grateful feeling , a filial relation which made obedience easy . He learned by experience that a legal system had in it no life-giving power . It could only condemn . It could only make one aware of his need of help from some other quarter . When it had done this work it had fulfilled its office , and was superseded by those forces of spiritual aid and healing which are contained in the gospel of grace . Now what must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Old Testament legal system , including the ceremonial features ? He could look on that system only as something preparatory and provisional . It was like the ancient pedagogue , whose business it was to lead boys to school and leave them there . Law and grace , the old dispensation and the new , appeared to him in the sharpest contrast . In his philosophy of religion , ceremonial prescriptions , as means of salvation , were " beggarly elements " ; that is , rudiments which had had their day . The other Apostles , the original Disciples , had not passed through a like spiritual crisis . They had been led on , step by step , in the company of Jesus , into a full sympathy with him and trust in him as a Saviour . They knew that , believing in him , and followVOL . XXXIX. - 75- 76. ing him with a loyal spirit , they were forgiven and saved . In common with Paul they held with one accord that reconciliation was through Christ , and that the humility of the publican in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinful man . The gradualness of their religious progress , the absence of a momentary , decisive turning-point , prevented them from seeing at once , and from seeing so distinctly , that relation of the new to the old , of gospel to law , which Paul 's experience made as clear to him as sunlight . Their minds were open ; they were ready to be guided by the Spirit , and they were thus guided ; but , so far as human instrumentality is concerned , it was Paul who led the way . What effect on his mind had these new perceptions , the outcome of a living experience ? They could have no other effect than to level the barriers of race and nationality . Where were now the privileges on which the Jew plumed himself ? Sin was a characteristic equally of Jew and Gentile . The same divine law which through Moses and the prophets had been revealed to the Jew had been written on the heart of the Gentile . Both rested under the same condemnation . It was not on the Gentiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the burden of guilt rested . And what could circumcision , lustrations , the sacrifice of animals , do to deliver any from the double yoke of self-accusation and evil habit ? There was only one means of deliverance , one remedy for heathen and Hebrew alike . It was the Christ and faith in him . Moreover , Paul had seen the Christ on a heavenly throne . His kingdom was evidently not a temporal one having its seat in the city of David . Even when he should come again , the kingdom was not to have this earthly character . The Apostle no more knew Christ " after the flesh , " as belonging to one nation and leading here among them a human life . He says , " Our citizenship is in heaven " ( Phil . iii . 20 ) . There Christ is , and there , for this reason , is the center of our polity . There is the seat of authority in the commonwealth in which we are citizens . XVhen the Lord comes , the " body of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecution , privation , suffering - is to be assimilated to his glorified body , to that heavenly mode of being that belongs to him . Paul 's conception of the kingdom is changed . His idea of it is wholly different from that of those who had not shaken off the associations of a political theocracy , with Jerusalem for its capital and with the temple on Mount Zion for the place of resort for all nations . When we consider the birth , and education , and earlier characteristics of this Pharisee , this inquisitor , thirsting for the blood of heretics , how astonishing is // the declaration , " There is no distinction between Jew and Greek " ( Rom . X. 12 ) ! Few more remarkable utterances ever fell from human lips . Yet the reason which is connected with it explains all : " For the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich unto all that call upon him . " There was but one Lord , and there was not less mercy in his heart for the heathen than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is but one Lord , and salvation is a free gift from him , there " can not be Greek and Jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , bondman , freeman : but Christ is all , and in all . " We pause for a moment to point out a profoundly interesting parallel between Paul 's conception of the death of Christ as bringing Jew and Gentile together , and certain most instructive and pathetic words of Jesus . At the last Passover , we read in John 's Gospel , certain " Greeks , " - who were not Jews , but heathen , probably proselytes of the gate ,  - -  who had come up to the festival to worship , came to Philip , one of the twelve , and exl ) ressed their wish to see Jesus ( John Xli. 20 , seq . ) . Philip reported this to Andrew , and then both carried the request to the Master . It is one of those circumstantial accounts which in its manner , not to speak of its contents , shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered their message , Jesus exclaimed : " The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified . Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die , it abideth by itself alone ; but if it die , it beareth much fruit . " The visit of the Greeks , heathen , proselytes of the gate , and their request , was a suggestion to Jesus that the time had come for him to die , and thus to open the door for the wide extension and growth of his kingdom beyond the limits of Judaism . That very idea of the significance of his death is intimated which is clearly brought out by the Apostle Paul . THE first sign ofa disposition to break through the wall that fenced off the Gentiles appears in the liberality of tone which was manifested by Stephen . It drew on him the charge of having threatened with destruction the whole Mosaic system of worship . His death dispersed the Church and sent abroad many to engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached with success in Samaria , and the Samaritan converts were recognized by the Apostles . The Samaritans , however , were among the circumcised . But the Ethiopian chamberlain , the eunuch , was only a proselyte of the gate , if he was even that . It required supernatural communications to Peter 9 to induce him to receive the Roman centurion Cornelius , and others with him , as disciples , and to sit at the same table with them . But Peter , when he returned to Jerusalem , was taken to task for his proceeding . When he told his tale the accusers were quieted , and there was joy over this accession of Gentile believers . The illiberal spirit was quelled , but only for a time . It was not at Jerusalem , but at Antioch that the catholic interpretation of the Gospel first gained a foothold . There some of the dispersed disciples , Hellenists , or foreign Jewish converts , preached the new faith to the heathen . There in that great city , which was one of the three principal cities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , the message of the Gospel met with a quick response in heathen souls that found in it satisfaction for their spiritual hunger . Barnabas , himself a foreign-born Jew , a native of Cyprus , was sent by the Jerusalem church to look after this new movement . For a number of years after Paul 's conversion he is almost lost to our knowledge . There was a sojourn in Arabia ; and then , after the lapse of three years , a return to Damascus . From there he was soon obliged to flee . Then followed a visit to Jerusalem to see Peter , with whom he spent fourteen days . After this visit he went into " the regions of Syria and Cilicia . " The churches in Judea had not met him , but had only heard that he who had been a violent enemy of their cause had now become a preacher of the faith which he had persecuted . Later , he is found at Tarsus , and thence he is brought by Barnabas , who needed his help , to Antioch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disciples were first called " Christians . " There is a coincidence between the ceasing to be a Jewish sect and the acquisition of the new name by which believers in Jesus were thenceforward to be designated . Up to this time they had been called " Nazarenes , " " Galileans , " or " Ebionites . " Paul and Barnabas , according to Luke , were sent upon the occasion of a famine in Judea with contributions to the Jewish Christians there ; but as Paul makes no allusion to his being there on this errand , it is probable that by some accident he was hindered from accomplishing it . So vigorous was the Antioch church that it sent missionaries into Asia Minor . On the return to Antioch of Paul and Barnabas from their missionary journey , they found the church in a ferment . Men from Judea had arrived and had raised a disturbance by warning the disciples that they must conform to the Jewish law and be circumcised , or give up the hope of salvation . There was discussion and debate between Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . // Finally it was resolved that the two Antioch leaders should depart at the head of a deputation to confer with the Jerusalem church on this all-important subject of dispute . In that church there had been an addition of members from the Pharisaic sect who were opposed to conceding liberty to the Gentile converts in this controverted matter . The rapid growth of the Antioch church , the multiplying of heathen converts , might naturally awaken anxiety and give rise to misgivings among many who had given way under the peculiar circumstances in the case of Cornelius . It was not now a question about a few individuals . Here was an organized church , on the basis of absolute freedom from " the law , " and engaged in a successful work of propagandism . What was to become of the distinctive privilege of the Jew ? Was the new kingdom to abolish the old cultus ? Was it to be composed largely , and perhaps predominantly , of uncircumcised heathen ? The turn of events brought up afresh a question of vital moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the importance of the crisis . He resolved to meet it in the frankest and most direct manner . He would go to Jerusalem and meet the Apostles and the church there , face to face . He went tip , he tells us , by " revelation " - by divine sanction ; but he went , as Luke states , with the sanction of the Antioch church and as their commissioner . Fourteen years had elapsed since his visit to Peter ; seventeen years had passed since his conversion . We are brought to the memorable occurrences of which we have accounts in the fifteenth chapter of Acts and the second chapter of Galatians . At Jerusalem the demand was made of Paul that Titus , a Greek convert who accompanied him , should be circumcised . Here was a practical test that would decide the point in dispute . This demand the Apostle met with a resolute denial . That there was a pressure upon him which it was not an easy thing to withstand is evident from his language . At that supreme moment he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis stirred within him is betrayed in his language . It causes him in referring to it , as Lightfoot remarks , to make shipwreck of grammar . We can well believe that his voice trembled as he dictated the passage to his amanuensis . Did the other Apostles join in this request , so repugnant to his views and feelings ? We are not justified by anything that he says in inferring that they did . Yet it would appear that Paul was left to stand alone , with no outspoken sympathy from any quarter . It is not improbable that even the Apostles , at that moment , under the circumstances , recommended him to yield , and to make the required concession . But he felt that the principle was at stake . The very meaning of the Gospel , the breadth of its grace , the liberty of the Gentile , hung on a pivot . The Apostle took a stand like that which Luther took at Worms ; but with a difference . But for Paul , there would have been no Luther ; unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , in the room of Paul , another equally clear-sighted expositor of the truth and intrepid leader in the Church . There was another difference . There were numerous friends at Worms to sympathize with Luther 's position . Paul was alone . Paul and Barnabas took the precaution to have a private conference with the leading persons in the Jerusalem church before they should meet its members as a body . Paul laid before the select company the substance of his preaching , the Gospel as he understood it , in order that his career as a missionary might not be interfered with by a division among the Apostles themselves , and an opposition to him , the fruit of misconception . The other Apostles were told not only what Paul and Barnabas had preached , but also the result of their preaching - how that among the heathen Paul had been as successful as Peter had been among the Jews . No further persuasion was needful . Peter , James , and John had nothing to add to Paul 's teaching by way of correction or amendment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right hand of fellowship , with the understanding that their work was to be among the heathen , while their own work should continue to be among the circumcised . There was a cordial fellowship , as was implied in the engagement of Paul to collect alms from the Gentile converts for the poor disciples of the mother church . The danger of a rupture was now over . It was settled that the heathen were not to be driven to become Jews in order to be Christians . But it remained for the apostle of liberty to meet the Jerusalem church as a body . Our knowledge of this public gathering we owe to Luke . At the meeting the recruits from the Pharisaic sect renewed their demand . Peter opposed it in a characteristic address wherein he referred to what had occurred in relation to Cornelius . James spoke the final word , quoting , as he naturally would , passages from the prophets . He gave his voice in behalf of catholicity , but recommended that the heathen converts should be enjoined to abstain from certain practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been trained to observe the laws of Moses and were to continue to do so . These articles of peace clashed with no principle which Paul valued . They included nothing that could fairly be called a modification of his teaching . They probably put in a definite form what was already a custom of the Gentile converts . They // are based on the injunctions , imposed alike on Israelites and strangers among them , which are set forth in the seventeenth and eighteenth chapters of Leviticus , and included the usages which were practiced by proselytes of the gate . The agreement of the Jerusalem conference , therefore , was not a compromise or concession to Jewish prejudices . It served to keep the peace among the disciples in Syria and Cilicia , to whom it was addressed . At a later day , when Gentile churches were independently established and in remoter places , the Apostle does not feel himself bound to refer to this pastoral letter of the Jerusalem conference . In writing to the Corinthians he considers the question of " meat offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for gifts of money for the Jerusalem Christians without referring to the stipulation that he should make a collection for their benefit . Yet he teaches nothing at variance with the essential purport of the instructions given to the Gentile converts . We may l ) e sure that James would have been content with nothing less than these " necessary things , " and that Paul would not have consented to go farther in the path of concession . To the fact of their harmony and satisfaction with one another Paul himself testifies . That he did not go to the extreme attributed to him by Baur and his fellow-critics is clear enough from his express recognition of the " gospel of the circumcision " as having been committed to Peter , and of the divine blessing which had been accorded to Peter in his work ( Gal . ii . 8 ) . Ecclesiastical settlements were not then more certain to be final than in later times . It was understood on all hands that the Gentiles were to be left unmolested . But it was expected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conform to the old observances . To this Paul felt no objection . What he refused to do was to impose an obligation of this sort on the heathen ; he would not allow it a place among the terms of salvation . If in the consultation of the Apostles at Jerusalem his own work had been approved by Peter , he in turn had approved Peter 's work as the Apostle of " the circumcision . " It was enough for him that the legal observances were not made the foundation of the disciples ' hope in Christ . As regards outward things , he was no revolutionist . He let the Jewish national usages remain as they were . He willingly conformed to them himself . Not needlessly to offend Jews , he caused Timothy , whose mother was a Jew , to be circumcised . But still there were points which the Jerusalem conference left undetermined . So the controversy was reopened at Antioch in relation to one of these unsettled points . The Jewish and heathen converts there mingled together freely and sat down at a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had no scruples of conscience respecting this kind of free intercourse . But at length certain persons came from James . We are sure that they were persons of influence ; for when they objected to this liberality on the part of Jewish Christians , not only Barnabas , but even Peter , deferred to them , and " drew back and separated " themselves . The rest of the Jewish Christians followed them . Here there was suddenly drawn a new line of division between the two classes of Christians . Once more Paul had to stand by himself . He sharply and publicly rebuked Peter for timidity and unfaithfulness to principle . He , a Jew , had been living as a Gentile himself , and now he was trying , so far as his example went , to bring the Gentiles to live as if they were Jews . The authors of this trouble came from James . It is not safe to conclude that they came expressly on this errand . Yet it may be that the liberal course taken by Peter was the occasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that their view of the subject was one in which James participated . He had given to Paul and Barnabas , in all sincerity , the right hand of fellowship . It does not follow that he expected the old restrictions as to eating with the Gentiles , and their social relations in general , to be swept away . It is likely that he did not interpret the Jerusalem arrangement in so broad a way as Paul construed it . A church made up , as at Antioch , of Gentiles and Jews together , presented a case which in the conference had not been definitely considered . The tradition about James as it was given by Hegesippus , the Jewish Christian historian , in the middle of the second century , represents him as an ascetic , observing the Nazarite rule , strict in all his ways , frequently resorting alone to the temple , " praying for the forgiveness of the people until his knees grew hard and thin . " We see him , on the occasion of Paul 's last visit to Jerusalem , receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure ; yet advising him to make a further manifestation of his respect for the ritual by taking on himself a vow , which involved the shaving of the head . The motive of James 's counsel is thus explained in his own language : " That . . . all may know . . . that thou thyself also walkest orderly , and keepest the law " ( Acts xxi. 24 ) . The occurrence shows how strenuous James was for the keeping up of the Mosaic ceremonies by the Jewish Christians , and how anxious he was that Paul should do something to efface a prevailing impression that he had tried to induce Jews to discard them . The spirit of James is clearly disclosed in the Epistle which bears his name . It was in- // cluded in the ancient Syriac canon , and as it was addressed to Jewish Christians outside of Palestine , it was not improbably intended to be read primarily by Syrian disciples . The law , in the spiritual import given to it by Jesus , is prominent in the writer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoes of the teaching of Christ . The practical tone , averse to all theory and theologic disputation , is obvious . Its doctrine is not contradictory to that of Paul , but moves in a different line . As Jesus had taught , it is said that men are to be judged by their works . There is a verbal contrast with sayings of Paul ; for example , in the definite assertion that Abraham was justified by works . Whether or not we are to conclude that the author had in mind a current use and misuse of Pauline phraseology , depends on the date to which James 's Epistle is to be assigned . Some would place it too early to admit of any reference to Pauline theology . There is much in the peculiarities of the Epistle - as in the application of the name " synagogue " to the meeting-place of Christians  --  to favor the supposition of a very early date . Could it be shown that it was written by James at a later point of time , the opinion that it refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate outcome of the renewed controversy at Antioch , the Apostle in his letter to the Galatians does not inform us . Taken up with his theme - salvation by faith alone - he drops the consideration of personal matters . About seven years after the Apostolic conference at Jerusalem and the subsequent rebuke of Peter , we find Paul writing an epistle to the Christians at Rome . During this interval he had been pursued with animosity by the Judaizing faction , of whose malignity he repeatedly complains . Nowhere does he imply that the other Apostles are in sympathy with these enemies of himself and of the Gospel . On the contrary , his references to the other Apostles imply the opposite . Yet the reports which the Judaizers set afloat concerning him , to which a reference has just been made , might easily excite a certain degree of alarm and uneasiness even among the Apostolic leaders who had extended to him the right hand of fellowship . We must bear in mind that the disturbance at Antioch had followed . Whether the separation of Paul from Barnabas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had any connection with that incident , we are not informed . At all events , when Paul writes to the Romans , he is looking forward to another visit to Jerusalem , not without some anxiety about the reception that will be accorded to him . He asks for the prayers of the Roman brethren not only that he may be delivered from the hostility of the unbelieving Jews in that city , but also that his " ministration might be acceptable to the " saints " there . There was some apprehension in his mind lest the collection which he had been making for the poor in the Jerusalem church might be unwelcome ( Rom. xv . 3 i ) , gathered as it was from churches composed of heathen converts , and while the accusation of being hostile to the observance of the Mosaic rites by anybody was circulated against him . His kind and fraternal reception by James and his associates dispelled this apprehension . The mob of Jews that assailed him , notwithstanding the precautions taken to appease their wrath , showed the hatred which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary campaigns in which he had spent the later eventful years . The Apostle now passed into the custody of Roman officers . At the end of about two years he was conveyed to Rome . After the lapse of another equal interval , he appears to have been set free for a time . Once more a captive , it was in the closing part of Nero s reign , the period of the tyrant 's unbridled cruelty , and in the year 66 or 67 , that he fell under the sword of the executioner . If the name of James is not an interpolation in a passage of Josephus , James perished in the interval between the death of the procurator Festus and the arrival of his successor , or in the year 62 . As to the main fact that James was stoned to death , the traditions agree . It is evident that the animosity of the Jews even against the most conservative - if the term may be allowed - of the followers of Jesus was growing fierce . The lines between the adherents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more sharply drawn . At length , in the year 66 , the great insurrection against Rome burst out . In the blaze of the popular fanaticism there was no safety for Christians within the walls of Jerusalem . The church there was broken up . When the epoch of the mortal struggle of Judaism with Roman power was fast approaching , the Jewish Christians must necessarily find that the middle position which , in a certain sense , they had held , was no longer tenable . There were circumstances which might tempt them to give up their faith in Jesus , and to find their comfort exclusively in the old system in which they had been bred and whose ceremonies they still observed . They had hoped for the conyersion of their countrymen , but that hope grew more and more faint . They had hoped for the reappearance of the ascended Messiah , but where was the promise of his coming ? Patriotic instincts might naturally awake to a new life , and sympathy with the national enthusiasm impelling to a revolt against // foreign domination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands in the canon an Epistle to the Hebrews , concerning the authorship of which opinion has been divided from ancient times . At the present day there are few scholars who attribute it to Paul . Some , with Luther , ascribe it to Apollos ; others to Luke , or to Barnabas . Whoever the writer was , it is certain that it was addressed to Jewish Christians . The purpose of the author , moreover , is clear . He sees a danger and he is striving to ward it off . He seeks to deter Jewish believers from lapsing from their faith and returning to Judaism . He is anxious to show them that they have in the Gospel a treasure infinitely more precious than anything offered them in the old ritual , and that the ordinances and ceremonies of the ancient Covenant are but types of blessed and enduring realities brought to them through Christ . To go back to the old sacrificial system is to give up the substance for the shadow . If there was a retrograde movement , a reactionary tendency in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish state and the Jewish religion hung in the balance , the same circumstances would engender in another class an opposite feeling . They would cling to the Christian faith with redoubled ardor and firmness . The tie that still held them to the old ceremonies would be loosened . The rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish people , and the persistent rejection of him , with the attendant fact of the astonishing spread of the new faith among the Gentiles , must have tended to open the eyes of many to a more just and liberal interpretation of the purpose of God . A fatal blow was dealt at Jewish Christianity by Divine Providence - the same Providence which had been the teacher from the beginning , removing , step by step , prejudice and misconception . No doubt there were those with whom the legions of Titus were more effective than persuasion and argument . The " logic of events " could not be disputed . Many Jewish Christians must have seen in the ruins of the Temple a sign of the passing away of the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden in Jerusalem , and it was converted by Hadrian into a heathen city ( A. D. 135 ) , the lesson was taught afresh with an irresistible emphasis . It was probably about the time of the beginning of the Jewish war , and after the death of the Apostle Paul , that there was a migration of a number of Jewish Christians to Asia Minor . Among them were the two Apostles Andrew and Philip , and among them also was the Apostle John . John took up his abode at Ephesus . Traditions of his life and teaching and traces of his influence remained in all that region . There , in his serene old age , he wrote his Gospel and Epistles . From one of his pupils , the martyr Polycarp , Irenteus in his youth heard personal reminiscences of the Beloved Disciple . It is the same Apostle who , long before , had given to the Apostle to the Gentiles " the right hand of fellowship . " After all these years , after the providential occurrences which had swept away the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be strange indeed if no further advance had been made in catholicity of perception . The sayings of Jesus , which indicate the spiritual and universal nature of the Gospel , are present in John 's recollection . He remembered that Jesus had said that the worship of the Father was not to be confined to Mount Gerizim or to Jerusalem . Christianity was now set free from Judaism , and in the second century Judaic Christianity survived only in sects beyond the borders of the Church . To revert for a moment to the causes which brought on this result , the historical events to which reference has been made have an important place . The subjugation of the Jews by Hadrian and the exclusion of their worship from the Holy City were of especial conse ( luence . An essential condition on which the result depended was the multiplying of churches made up of Gentile converts . The rapid spread of the Gospel in the Gentile world and the comparative fewness of its Jewish adherents excited surprise even in the lifetime of Paul . It was to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had a great influence in molding the institutions of the Gospel . But underlying all these agencies was the leavening influence of the teaching of Jesus . The catholic elements of that teaching produced their legitimate effect . They were the warrant for the doctrine of the Apostle Paul . It was Jesus and the teaching of Jesus that liberated Christianity from the entanglements of Judaism .
