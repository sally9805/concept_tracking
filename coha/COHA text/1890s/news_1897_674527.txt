txt The destruction of the Government buildings on Ellis Island , used for the reception and inspection of immigrants , will cause inconvenience , but no serious loss , except to the Government . Arrangements have already been made under which it is believed that the immigration machinery will work smoothly and rapidly . Commissioner General of Immigration I Stump arrived here yesterday afternoon from Washington , . and at 7 o'clock last night was on the island , after a conference with Dr. Senner , the Immigration Commissioner for this port . When he returned from the island Col. Stump said he was convinced that the management of the fire , the conduct of all the officials on the island , and the arrangements already made for the future were all admirable . They received his full approval , and were , in his opinion , creditable to all concerned . Many steamships are due this week , and they have more than 7,000 immigrants aboard . The Friesland with 170 , the Ems with 456 , and the A.urania with about 100 are expected to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own dock by an ample force of his men . The inspections will be conducted on the piers . Acceptable immigrants will be passed immediately . The sick will be sent to the city hospitals , those with contagious diseases or requiring disinfection going to Quarantine . Those detained will be lodged in the barge office at the Battery . The work of fitting this up will be begun to-day , and will be completed in two weeks . It is improbable that the number of detentions will overcrowd this building . but such a contingency will be provided against by renting some suitable building convenient to the Battery . Loss Not Over $500,000 . Commissioner General Stmup thinks the loss will not exceed $500,000 . He will ask Congress for an immediate special appropriation of that amount for new buildings . He has no doubt that it will be granted , especially as the Immigration Bureau has always been self-supporting . It has now $225,000 to its credit unexpended . This balance , the Commissioner said , will not be used for new buildings , but he is sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given for such purpose if required to do so . The Commissioner added that so far as he has influence he will insist that the new buildings be brick or stone and as nearly fireproof as it is possible to make them . Like Commissioner General Stump . Commissioner Senner is delighted with the conduct of his subordinates on the island and with the general management of the affair . Dr. Senner was on the scene soon after 1 O'clock yesterday morning , and took personal charge . He says everything had been so well done , however , that he had only to look after o .. ae datalle , inquiry Shows that not a life ? was lost , and that not one Derson was injured or suffered serious bodily harm . How the Fire Started , The fire was discovered at 12:38 o'clock by Watchman Gaines . There were 191 immigrants on the island , 55 of them in the hospital and 136 in the dormitOries , including several Hindus and a number of Mormon girls . The night force of officials and helpers consisted o Superintendent Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 4 firemen , 2 laborers , a matron , an apothecary , a cook , 2 doctors , 3 hospital nurses , 3 railroad watchmen in care of the baggage , and 3 employes of the restaurant . The steamer John G. Carlisle lay at the ferry slip with steam up , as she is required by her contract to do , and three watchmen on duty . She was connected with the buildings by an electric alarm wire , according to rules . Dr. Senner said yesterday that he had always known the big building to be a fire trap , and had taken all those precautions for that reason . The building was supplied with automatic sprinklers and many fire plugs , with regulation rubber hose and nozzles attached , and an ample supply of water from the steam pumps in the power house , but no confidence was felt in these arrangements . When Watchman Gaines , who was in the main building , was led to the fire by the smell of smoke , he saw a blaze in the tower nearest the Battery . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , was there . By the time he had shouted " Fire ! " and run to give the alarm , the flames were racing along the walls and floors up stairs . He does not definitely know where the fire originated , and in what place . Both Col. Stump and Dr. Senner are in the same plight . " We have no theories , " said the Colonel , and so far as I know now an investigation into the cause will be useless . There is nothing to investigate . " Saving the Immigrants . The night force immediately began work . Superintendent Burke led some of them into the dormitories , and the sleeping people were aroused . There were symptoms of panic and hysteria at first , but they were sternly repressed . Mr. Burke knows just enough Italian to say " come quick . " Most of the immigrants were Italians . As a group was aroused and dressed , it was put in charge of a man who led , drove , or pushed it down to the boat . At the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines . There was not a word or exclamation to excite or alarm the patients . All were thoroughly wrapped up before being lifted or assisted out . E. R. Brandow and George B. Emmons of the Carlisle were the litter bearers , and they carried patient after patient to the boat without even jostling one of them . The long shed leading to the ferry slip sucked in the fire from the main building and was soon ablaze . It was pulled and pushed , and fell down , and the patients were carried out over it , although its tin roof was nearly red hot . By 1 o'clock the last person was safe . Dr. White 's family , in the surgeon 's quarters , was the last gotten away . It consisted of two ladies , several children , and a servant . Much of Dr. White 's furniture was removed . The removal of the immigrants to the boat did not take more than seventeen minutes . Lines of hose were run ashore from the fireboats and steamers , and firemen fought the flames until daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scorch . The surgeon 's quarters are standing and can be restored . The walls of the record office and kitchen are standing . Everything else is ruin  --  a tangle of charcoal , battered and rusted iron , and ashes , from which smoke was still lazily rising in clouds all day yesterday . Most of the Records Recovered . Commissioner Senner was surprised and delighted to find yesterday afternoon that fully two-thirds of the records in the records office had been found , more or less damaged , but yet useful . The safe of the railroad office was opened , and all the paper money in it , estimated at $200 , was found to be destroyed beyond hope of redemption . The silver and gold were melted , and all the papers were gone . On the other hand , the safe in the money exchange office of F. T. Scully had kept its contents , probably $6,000 or more , intact . Not a paper or note was even scorched , and coins of many nations were taken out in tin pans and dumped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were many small individual losses , none of them , of course , covered by insurance . All the minor officials lost their uni- forms , some of them just purchased , which had been left in the building . Of the 136 people taken from the island , the 55 sick were sent to Bellevue , 69 were released and wept to their friends , 22 were sent off on outgoing steamers , 33 men who have been excluded or are detained are quartered in the upper story of the Barge Office , 12 women and children , who are de- tained , are comfortable at the House . of Our Lady of Hope , which also sent cots for the men . Leo House also offered ar-eommodations , and gifts of clothing from several sources have made all the rescued people fairly comfortable . It is not likely that any of their losses are very serious , as most of them carry their money and valuables on their persons . Commissioner Senner said last night that those who lost baggage will probably be paid for it by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
