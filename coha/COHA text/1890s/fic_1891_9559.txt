Footnote : 1Kb DRAMATIS PERSON . Will Scarlett ( of Robin Hood 's Sherwood Outlaws . ) Lady Jacqueline Werewood . The period is the close of the twelfth century . The place is the castle hall of Sir John Werewood . The time is half past twelve of an October night . Main text The scene is the hall of the castle of Sir John Werewood . It is an ancient hall of stone , after the manner of the Saxon castles of the twelfth century . There is a great fireplace ; the logs are smouldering low , as if the fire had been banked with ashes . A few pieces of massive furniture . As the curtain rises , Lady Jacqueline pushes aside the arras that hangs over one of the doors , and comes in , speaking as she does so , backward , to some one in the corridor without . She wears the dress of a boy of the period . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Come your ways in , Will Scarlett . Nay , man , in with thee ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much caution . He carries his long bow : a sheaf of arrows is slung over his back . ) Will . Will Scarlett " What fear I ? " quoth he . Ay , marry , what should any he who hunts with Robin Hood , fear in the stronghold of a righteous magistrate ? A naught , a whifflet . Merely a stout cord around the arms for first " God speed thee , "  --  and presently a stouter cord around the neck . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Nay , Will . Here 's my word that that stout throat of thine shall know naught more comfortless than a draught of the soundest Rhenish . Will . Will Scarlett " Rhenish ! " As he were lord o ' the castle ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Lord of the castle am I not ; yet I can guess me shrewdly where good Rhenish grows therein ; ay , and a crusty loaf , to test those excellent teeth of thine ; and a cheese so rich with age , that e'en the mice race from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take my word that presently we 'll feast as fair as good comrades should , when they are come to the farewell , and to the end of the way . Will . Will Scarlett The end of the way . Ay , and had I not been fool , e'en to the marrow of me , I had met the end of the way , a good rood or two nearer to where lies mine own safety . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood But thou wert loath to cry me farewell . Nay , say it , churl ; ' t was for that thou didst cry " Down ! " to thy good caution . Will . Will Scarlett Nay , I 'll speak truth and no smoothness . I came with thee unsafely beyond the forest , for that I mistrusted thy hot head would ne'er get thy fool 's feet in surety to the end of thy race . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Yet my fool 's feet have led thee to the losing of thy wager , eh , Will Scarlett ? Will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they . I wagered thee thou ne'er wouldst get uncaught into the strong castle o ' Sir John Werewood , worshipful magistrate ; and it seemeth thou art here ; and for my sins , I also  --  and the more fools be we all . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( At fireplace . ) The more fool this green wood , for that it smokes like half-caught love , and warms a wayfarer as little . Burn warmlier , thou varlet . ( Pokes fire . ) Will . Will Scarlett A murrain on thy clamor ! Wouldst wake the castle ? What say I ? Is't mayhap thy will to wake the castle ? For this was thy wager ? God 's death ! Has my thick wit led me into the snare the honest are aye laying for us greenwood thieves ? ( He fits an arrow to his bow . ) Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Faces him squarely . ) And with this word , Will Scarlett , thou facest a leal comrade , at the end o ' the way ? Will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee ? Nay , I can not read thine eyes and not know I have wronged thee . Traitor 's a vile word . Reckon with me as thou wilt , lad  --  thy fist or a throw at wrestling . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Nay , and I said ay to either , where were I in the next breath taken ? I am in no haste to see Paradise . Will . Will Scarlett Paradise would be a strange lodging for thee , thou fly-afield . ' T is from the other road I guess thy journey 's wended . ( Points significantly downward . ) Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Mayhap ; and mayhap ' t is why I find this world too cold a spot for comfort . ( Pokes fire again . ) Will . Will Scarlett Quiet , I say . Wouldst have theri ghteous magistrate afoot ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood The righteous magistrate 's at a far calling . Sir John 's in Palestine . Will . Will Scarlett At the Crusades ? I thought him home ere this . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' court folk . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Sir John doeth in Palestine , Will , what thou and thy greenwood lads make shift at here ; namely , relieve the heathen of goods which Heaven meant for true Christians ! Will . Will Scarlett With this good difference , lad : The robbers in the Holy Land come back with praise and pelf ; and the robbers o ' the greenwood are fair game for every sheriff 's arrow . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood All good sheriffs ' arrows sleep i ' their quivers . ' T is hours since curfew-time . Rest thee by the fire , good Will ; I 'll e'en go a-hunting for that Rhenish I have vowed to thee . Will . Will Scarlett Nay , I 'll rest not . ' T is not so many hours to dawn ; ' t is a shrewd mile to Sherwood , lad , ' t is the way 's end ; and so God speed thee . ' T was a good journey , though the strangest e'er I wended ; but the journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way 's not ended , Will , till we 've pledged its good end in good Rhenish . I 'll fetch it thee , ere thou hast said , " Where goest thou ? " Will . Will Scarlett ( Laying his hand heavily on her shoulder . ) Nay , that 's already said ; and more 's said . Not only " Where goest thou ? " but " Thou goest not "  --  till I know where thou goest . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ' T is not the hunter of hares , ' t is the hare that fears hunting that holds me here . I ne'er thought to see Will Scarlett o ' this complexion . Will . Will Scarlett Thou'lt see more in Will Scarlett than thou e'er hast seen , and thou'lt feel that from Will Scarlett that thou ne'er hast felt , if thou curb not thy fool 's tongue . " Hunted hare " ? What else is every right-born Englishman that stands for his right-born king ? Is't for mine own skin I fear ? Thou'st fared with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Nay , Will  --  dear Will , thy life hath guarded mine when no need was , at the call of thy good heart ; and in my heart thy courage is writ sure . ' T is but that I do not know thee in thy new humor . Will . Will Scarlett ' T is the humor of him who fears for a comrade ; and that 's the fearsomest fear of all . Hark ye , Jackbrain ! Seest thou not ' t is not alone Will Scarlett 's life I bring here to-night on this fool 's wager ? If I 'm taken ? If they lay me on the rack , and my pluck cracks with my bones ... and when they say , hand on screw , " Where bides Robin Hood , and what 's his password ? ... God 's my life ! Better men than I have said the word that 's sped a comrade to the rope , and themselves to the hell of traitors . I 'll take no chance . It is farewell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's ended . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood A man foresworn art thou . " If thou interest the Werewood hall uncaught , "  --  this thy word under last night 's white stars  --  " I 'll tarry there with thee and drink thy pluck in Sir John 's borrowed wine . " We 're here , the wine is within easy stealing . I claim thy pledge , man . Will , let me to the cellar . Will . Will Scarlett ' T was a fool 's pledge . I 'll not keep it to a right man 's risking . Thy hand . Nay ? Then farewell and no clasping ! ( He starts for the door . ) Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Farewell ; and good riddance to a liar . Will . Will Scarlett ( Starting back in hot anger . ) Nay , now I go not , tide what betide , till the hand thou wouldst not clasp hath taught thee the lesson thou art aching for . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Greatly startled . ) What meanest thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarlett Good will I do thee ,  --  I and my stout belt . Nay , many a time in this our week of wandering have I raid , " A murrain on the lad 's sharp nettle-tongue . Sure the fool that begot him hath never learned what sound medicine for Jackanapes hides in a hickory rod ! " ( He takes off his belt and swings it . ) Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood That 's  --  that 's no hickory rod . Will . Will Scarlett Thy shoulders will guess no mighty difference . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Thou'dst beat me , Will ? Will . Will Scarlett Ay will I , with good heart ; and so do thee a charity . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood A  --  a charity , Will ? Will . Will Scarlett A charity . For did I not teach thee that a man is not called a liar and a coward by every wandering Jackanapes he journeys with , some other will e'en teach thee , not with a belt , but with an arrow , drawn to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilt not . Will . Will Scarlett Who now is hunted hare ? Off with thy doublet ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Will , thou canst not ! Will . Will Scarlett Thy shoulders shall guess that . Off with thy doublet ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Strips off her doublet and stands in the soft , white shirt beneath . ) To it then . I 'm ready ( Will lifts his arm for a swinging blow with the belt : she looks at him fearlessly . After a pause his arm slowly drops , he puts on his belt with unsteady hands ; he passes his hand across his forehead . ) Will . Will Scarlett Beshrew thine eyes ! There 's magic in them ! Nay , I swear it on the rood ; there 's magic in them . How else when I would have given thee the sound trouncing thou dost so soundly need , doth my arm drop strengthless ? Boy , is't true ? Hast meddled with the magic ? Nay , I 'll ne'er betray it to the priests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Puts on her doublet again . ) With white magic , mayhap , Will ; but ne'er with black magic , on my man 's word . Will . Will Scarlett White magic ? What doth white magic do ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Why , many things , my Will , and all of them good . As this , Will . Harkye ! Thou wouldst not let me go to seek the Rhenish we drink farewell in , therefore , by my white magic , go I to this arras , and say to my white spirit , " What ho ! Wine for us of the best . Ay , and crusty loaf , and cheese to men 's liking . " ( A table is pushed between the curtains , having on it the things demanded . ) And lo ! my kind spirit waits not , but serves us on the word . ( She pulls the table into the room and wheels it forward . ) Will . Will Scarlett ( In mortal terror . ) Saint George ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bid it away ! I have no silver arrow , and witches care naught for good English arrow wood . Bid it away ! Nay , then , I 'll e'en do what an archer may . ( With trembling hands he begins to fit an arrow to the string . ) Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Who has been in uncontrollable fits of laughter . ) Down with thy bow ! Thou very Prince of thick wits ! Down with thy bow . Art thou gone dream-struck ? Dost not see ? Will naught but very magic lighten thy blind eyes ? Peer out through yonder curtains , then , and tell me what thou seest ! Will . Will Scarlett ( With the most elaborate caution , he peers through the drapery , through which the table has been pushed . ) Let me sniff shrewdly , first . Is there brimstone in the air ? What see I ? An old dame  --  or so she seemeth ; but , alack-a-day ! She may be the devil , for aught my wildered sense can swear . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Well may she laugh . ' T is a rare sight to see the doughtiest archer in all green Sherwood , fleeing in terror from  --  from what ? A well-laid table ! Will . Will Scarlett Nay , if ' t was laid in Tophet , I 'll ne'er sup at it . Read me the riddle ... I 'll guess no more . And the riddle I 'll read , or I bide here till the sun wakes the sheriff . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Ay ' now that 's right bravely said , Will Scarlett . Sit ye down . I 'll read whatever page of my poor riddle thou'lt turn me to . Sit ye down . Eat , man , eat . Will . Will Scarlett ( Cautiously approaching the table . ) I 'll but sip the flagon . E'en the Devil can but half spoil good Rhenish . ( He drinks . ) And in such Rhenish  --  good lack  --  I 'd all but pledge the Devil ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Perching on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Thy catechism , Will ! My faith 's pledged to its answering . Will . Will Scarlett Whence come these ? ( Indicates things on table . ) Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood From the larder of the worshipful Sir John Werewood  --  now in ... Palestine . ( With an effect of having been about to say , " in Paradise . " ) Will . Will Scarlett Who stole them hence ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Nay , " steal " is no pretty word , amongst thieves ! No steal : a good gift from Sir John 's good-heart housekeeper , she who hath cared me through many a care of my calf-time . Will . Will Scarlett And ' t was even she who opened to thee , but now , and let thee pass , uncaught ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Even she . Will . Will Scarlett My wool-wits clear . And this was thy magic ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Laughing . ) Nay , I told thee ' t was white magic . Will . Will Scarlett One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou in the wood ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood The wood ? Will . Will Scarlett Ay , Jackanapes . The wood where a se'nnight since I found thee in the nightfall , nursing thy twisted foot and wailing as ' t were a deer in a springe : " Alack-a-day ! it darkens ; I 've lost my road and lamed my tired foot . I pray o ' thee , good archer , whereaway lies Werewood ? " Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood And thou didst answer , Greatheart , " A many leagues from here lies Werewood . Lame duck that thou art , come , lean on a comrade 's shoulder  --  we 'll fare together . " Will . Will Scarlett Ay , an ' we 've fared it , over rough ways and smooth , all the way through ; and now the way 's ended . But thou dost not fairly meet my catechism : How came thou in that wood ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood They sent me to a place I liked not  --  Will . Will Scarlett Too free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Jacqueline Werewood Too many prayers . Will . Will Scarlett Ay , praying 's clear not in thy talent  --  Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Nor in thine , eh , Master Scarlett  --  eh ? Will . Will Scarlett Nay , but an outlaw may say a prayer  --  so ' t is an outlaw 's prayer . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Be outlaws churchmen , then ? Will . Will Scarlett Nay , ' t is not in a church my prayers come  --  the priests are in the way . ' T is when I stand i ' the greenwood  --  and the trees talk i ' the night wind , and the stars are big , and at my foot is a comrade 's grave , that died in a good fight  --  ' t is then the heart cries up to find what 's i ' the wind 's voice and the star 's silence ; and to find where live the men who died for men . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood May such a prayer be said for me in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , lad ? Ay , and ' t was said with good heart . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood With all my heart , such as my heart is , ' t was said . Will . Will Scarlett Thou sayest it ? ( He rises eagerly . ) Nay then , lad , why shouldst not make it sooth ? To die i ' the greenwood , must a man live i ' the greenwood . Wilt cast thy life there ? Think , ... there 's no life freer  --  no life in the which a man 's so true a man . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood I trust that , for I have known an outlaw . But , Will , dear Will , the life of a true man i ' the greenwood is not for me . Will . Will Scarlett And wherefore not , lad ? I ' the name o ' the saints , wherefore not ? My faith upon it , thou'rt fatherless . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Ay , unfathered and unmothered . Will . Will Scarlett And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncomfort thou didst flee from . ' T was a brave flight , that flight . The lad who flees from slavery fights for liberty , when the man 's beard comes . Thou fleest from no duty who fleest to the greenwood with me . Lad , my heart is moved as ' t were by magic indeed . I knew not till thou spakest that word , how ill it were for me to leave thee . Lad , I have had no full-heart comrade since I was myself a very lad . I know not by what strong moving I am moved to plead thee . Come to the free life  --  to the wood 's life , to the man 's life . I have been thy field-mate but a star 's hour , yet art thou heart-mate to me , as none has been since my brother died a lad , here on my breast . Lad , be my very brother . I 'll make thee man . I 'll guard thee as guards a man . Lad , the stars set , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacqueline Werewood I may not , Will , ... brave heart , I may not . Will . Will Scarlett And wherefore " may not " ? Dost hope for preferment , in turning hearth-dog here ? What means preferment ? To wait upon a great man 's nod ; to pay thy manhood , that thou mayest eat rich and lie soft ; to live a lackey , and fare , up yonder , as they fare who have sold soul 's right for body 's safety . Nay , in the greenwood there 's naught between a man 's soul and the stars of God . And , therefore , man stands  --  at man 's whole height . ... Lad : Come ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood I may not , Will . Nay , despise me not  --  an ' thou knewest all , thou wouldst say , " Stay : ' t is honor . " ... Will ! Look not at me , as one who scorns a coward . ... Will ! Thou shalt not go in scorning . At the way 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together  --  thou shalt not go in scorning ! Bide here but one small moment , Will : In one small moment I will show thee without words why ' t is I may not fare with thee . Glad would I fare with thee , staunch heart ; but for  --  Nay , wait but for this one small moment , Will . Thou thyself shalt say  --  shalt bid me  --  ( She holds out her hands to him , in a piteous appeal , as she goes from the room . ) Will . Will Scarlett ( Looking after him , in bewilderment . ) What means the lad ? " I may not , in honor , "  --  " thou'lt say I may not , an ' thou seest , "  --  See what ? What next of magic ? All things fade in mine eyes to a dancing dream . What is't to me , Will Scarlett , archer and outlaw , so a lad cometh wi ' me or no ? ... A lad I ne'er set eyes on , till a se'nnight gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there lies his magic . His eyes are as the deer a man tames to his hand . They 're as the stars a man lifts prayer to . They 're  --  Nay  --  I 'm fay-struck . I 'll away . He will not fare with me , what matters why ? I 'll away ! ( Starts toward door , hesitates , returns . ) Nay , but I pledged to him a stirrup-cup , at the way 's end . I 'll drink it wi ' him ; he shall not say again , " Hunted hare ! " and " Liar ! " Ay , " Liar , " said he , and walks afoot with a whole head ! Tell it not in Sherwood forest , lest all true men forswear my company ! How low burns the fire ! It feels the dawn chill . ... Nay , for my comrades ' sake I must be afoot . I 'll wait no longer . ( As he turns to go out , Lady J. enters , in her woman 's attire . ) Will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm trapped ! A fool must e'en woo his destiny ! I 've no one word to offer  --  the cord 's about my throat . Madam , I pray you take no fear of me . Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Nay , Will Scarlett , why should thy field-mate have fear of thee ? Will . Will Scarlett My field-mate ?  --  Thou ?  --  Nay , ... By our Lady o ' grace ! ... Lad ! ' T is thou ? ' T is truly thou ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood In verity , Will Scarlett , it is I. But no lad , Will . Will . Will Scarlett God 's death !  --  a maid ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Canst thou forgive me , Will , that I 'm no lad ? That I took lad 's good help of thee , who am no lad ? Will . Will Scarlett No lad ? A maid ? Nay , then the magic 's clear . ... White magic  --  aye , indeed , white magic  --  the magic of a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to tell thee , Will ; but thou saidst , who thought me lad , " I 'll company thee to the way 's end . " And , Will , I was so lone , so lame , so frighted , ... and thy strong shoulder was so good to lean on ... Will ,  --  Will . Will Scarlett Nay , ' t was best  --  ' t was a good way . I had not companied thee , this good way , had I known thee maid . Is the way ended ,  --  is't in very truth ended ,  --  this way we fare together ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Startled . ) How else , Will ? Greatheart , how else ? Will . Will Scarlett Nay , thus else : If I bade thee , a lad , bear me long company ,  --  be field-mate , and wood-mate , and heart-mate  --  a million times do I so cry thee now ! Mine as no lad could e'er be mine ! Mine by the right of man 's love , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourished by every hour we companied together under God 's free stars ; revealed to this my wildered soul , when but now I would have done thee pain in my just anger , and thine eyes struck mine arm strengthless . In that love 's name , come forth ! What are they to thee , from whom thou didst flee ? I will be all to thee  --  thou shalt lack naught . Comrade for life and death and love that 's deathless , come forth with me , and learn what like is life and love when man lives and loves with naught but the starset sky between him and his God ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood ( Breaks into a passion of sobbing . ) I may not , Will , I may not . ... Will , I am nor lad nor yet free maid . Will , I am Lady Werewood ! Will . Will Scarlett A wife !  --  My life 's love  --  and a wife ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood A wife who ne'er knew love , ... a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  Will , by my father 's dying command , I gave my hand into the hand of Sir John Werewood , my father 's oldest , closest of comrades . ... " ' Twill be safety for thee , maid ! "  --  my father gasped , and died . ... A priest had stood beside the couch ; they told me when they lifted me from my dead father 's breast , the word of that priest had sealed me wife . Will . Will Scarlett And thy husband ? Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood He stood in war-dress by my father 's death-couch . Within the hour he sought ship for Palestine . Will . Will Scarlett God ! How is he then thy husband ? A word spoke unknowing , by a maid-child , who knew not what word she spoke  --  a maid they penned after , by her lord 's command , in a convent prison , until that he cometh to teach her how life may be prison indeed ? Cold ? Old ? Thrice wedded ? How shall he call thee wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thou art mine  --  mine , who can teach thee true love-lessoning , and wait in reverence till thou learnest that lesson ! Come with me , now  --  now , mine own  --  mine heart 's heart , ... Come ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Sayest thou so , in very truth ? Thou , who art man and large , and true and wise ? ... Is it sooth that I who love thee  --  for even in this hour I do know I do love thee , Will , dear heart !  --  that I who love thee may fare forth with thee without blame , and God 's stars give us welcome ? ... I know not  --  my lore is but what priests teach  --  be thou my beadsman , Greatheart comrade . Say yet once more of free heart , " Come ! "  --  and I who love thee , follow thee over the rim of the world ! Will . Will Scarlett God sees ... and I dare not say it !  --  God !  --  ' T is the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may not go ? Will . Will Scarlett For that thou art wife , who knowest not what wife may be , thou mayest not go . ... Farewell ! Lady J. Lady Jacqueline Werewood Wilt leave me , Will ! ... Nay , my heart faints  --  how is it strangely with me ? Will . Will Scarlett Would God I might teach thee that sweet why . I may not , Sweet  --  Sweet !  --  This I do tell thee : Thou calledst in the dark wood , and God sent me to thy side . In any peril , any pain , let but thy soul call mine , and Hell 's fetter can not keep me from thee ! To my heart once  --  once  --  that thou mayest know forever what love is !
