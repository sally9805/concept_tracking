txt Mr. Low makes a candid appeal to the sense , the conscience , and the manliness of the Republicans of Greater New York . We have no doubt that as citizens they will respond to it , nor any doubt , if the organization of their party fairly represents them , that it will respond by the nomination of Mr. Low . Unless the Citizens ' Union shall ask him to retire  --  of which it has not the slightest idea " ? he says : " I am in the field to stay and to make as strong a fight as I can for the cause I have the honor to r. ? present . " That point being settled , the situation being thus cleared of the confusion artfully brought into it by the panticians , Mr. Low says : " I earnestly hope to see a united front in this campaign on the part of men of all torts of political belief , acting in whatev , er way may be most natural for them , - v. - ho are willing to join in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new charter , such an administration of its government as will make the welfare of the city at all times its first concern . " " The welfare of the city at all times the first concern . " That is the issue . On that why should not Republicans support the one actual or possible candidate who by the severe test of experience is proved to be sound and strong and trustworthy in his fidelity to the principle ? The great body of them are firmly opposed to Tammany Hall . They believe , as Mr. Low believes , that " that is a name indissolubly associated with our municipal dishonor , and it would be a stinging shame to us all if the greatest experiment in municipal government ever made in this country were to be made under its leadership . " Such humiliation can be avoided by the election of Mr. Low , and according to general belief , it can be avoided in no other way . The nomination of a separate Republican ticket would be courting the " stinging shame . " What possible decent excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precedent cited by Mr. Low in his Brooklyn experience were not conclusive , taking the facts as they are , what benefit , what gratification can any honest Republican find in a policy that would elect a Tammany Mayor ? Nor is such a plan without grave danger for Mr. PLATT , should he be rash enough to adopt it . He could not explain it to any man of common sense . He could not refute the charge that he preferred a Tammany Mayor , because he could deal with him , nor escape the infamy that guilt of such a charge involves . To lose the Greater New York , which he forced on his party in the Legislature , would be bad enough . To sell it for a mess of patronage would be EMI worse . And that is precisely what Mr. PLATT would be believed to be doing if he should insist on a separate Republican nomination . This is the situation as concerns Republicans . It is the same for Democrats . The Citizens ' Union and its candidate Appeal to men of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , but for union on a matter outside of or separate from party . Mr. Low so clearly and simply and completely represents this position that it is plain that the Union has made no mistake in its candidate .
