txt There was great anxiety for a time in Washington early today , upon the receipt of a short cablegram from Admiral Dewey creating the impression that hostilities had been renewed by the Filipinos . Later in the day this anxiety was somewhat allayed , nothing having come from Gen. Otis up to the close of office lours to confirm this inference . and such cablegrams as did come from him touched upon other matterst entirely , so it was assumed that there was no foundation hi fact fer the apprehension . Admiral Dewey 's cablegram was as follows : Manila . Feb. 6 . Secretary Navy , Washington : Insurgents 1-have attacked Manila . The Boston leaves to-day for Iloilo to relieve the Baltimore , which ' will return to Manila . Two men wounded yesterday on board Monadnock , one , seriously ; DEWEY . Secretary Alger was at the White House this afternoon With the President when the dispatch was received from Gen. Otis giving a list of casualties at the engagements yesterday and Saturday night . The Secretary said that he did not interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as showing that , the'fighting-fs now in progress . He thought it was filed early in the engagement , and had been delayed in trans-mission . If the battle had-.been in progress when Gen. , Otis filed his ' casualty dispatch this morning he felt sure he ? would have mentioned ' the fact . Mr. Alger said further that , contrary to the statements made in some of the neWSPa ' pers this morning , he had not sent Gen. Otis a word of instruction as to what he- should do . He is on the ground , " said the Secretary , " and it would be folly for-Us here to undertake to direct his movements . Many battles have been lost by such unwise interference , and we shall leave the matter to his and Admiral Dewey 's judgment . We have confidence in their discretion . "  - -  EFFECT OF RATIFICATION . As to the change m condition wrought " by the ratification of the treaty to-day there is a variance of views , and Adjt. ? Gen. Corbin and : Second Assistant Secretary Adee of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of being able to send full instructions for his future guidance to Gen : Otis immediately . The extreme view on one side . is that until the Spanish Government ratifies the treaty it is not of legal effect. ? According to that view , therefore , the United States Government is estopped from proceeding beyond their lines at Manila for ' the time .. By the other extreme view the .. United Str.tes.Government is free to do just as if pleases in the entire group ' of islands , and will , therefore , proceed . at once to complete the military occupancy of the islands . Perhaps there is ? justification for this last view in the fact that the Filipinos were Spanish subjects nominally when they broke the terms of the protocol and thereby released the United States from its observance . The medium view , and that which is likely to be followed , is that Gen. Otis is justified in doing anything that is necessary to . protect his army and all American and foreign interests in Manila , even though this obliged him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines in pursuit of the insurgents who may be seeking to reorganize and recoup from their late defeat with an intention of attacking again or even threatening the Americans . NO ORDERS SENT TO DEWEY . Secretary Long this evening said that no additional orders had been sent to Admiral Dewey , and he did not anticipate that any would be necessary just now . He had been acting on the theory that the President desired to follow the most liberal policy in dealing with the Filipinos . and there was no reason now to change that policy . The Solace started from Norfolk at 3 o'clock this afternoon with a supply of ammunition and other needed stores for Dewey 's fleet , via the Suez Canal , but it is not the intention to send further naval reinforcemen ts . It was learned upon inquiry at the War Department that all the American troops at Manila have an abundant supply of smokeless powder . The regulars have the Itrag-Jorgensen rifle , and about 5,000 of the same weapons are in the hands of the volunteers . It is - no secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest Agoncillo just as he fled , but probably they are not sorry that he got off safely and thus relieved them from the performance of a disagreeable task . The conduct of the'reInaining members of Me Philippine.junta is still ' under ClCiAe watch , and ' While the treatment to ' be accorded them has not been . determined , it is recognized that they are in a precarious position legally , and can secure immunity only by the exercise of the greatest discretion . CABLE GREATLY NEEDED . It is a matter of some regret to the War Department that there is no communication between Manila and Iloilo by cable . Naval officers who are in close touch with the situation say that the dispatch of the Boston to relieve the Baltimore is not ? an indication that all is quiet at Manila , but that the Admiral probably would want the Baltimore at the point of activity because of her superior shelling ability . The run from Manila to folio is 2i50 miles , so that it will take almost a week for the vessels to exchange stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these two chief cities in the archipelago for some time past , and the Panama , now at New York , is being fitted out as a cable ship to be dispatched to the islands . It was reported two weeks ago that she would be ready for sailing in a month , but it was said at the department to-day that it will be a month : anger before she can start . This delay is now . deeply regretted , as the need for cable work in the islands has been repeatedly urged , and as often delayed . There has been a renewed activity in the Commissary Department on account of the outbreak in the Philippines . It was said in the Commissary General 's office to-day that the troops in the Philippines have sup : . plies already on hand or afloat en route ' to last them till about the 1st of June . The aim of the department is to keep the supplies about three months ahead at all distant stations , so that there ' is nothing in the present situation to disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
