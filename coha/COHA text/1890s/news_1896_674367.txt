txt Ghosts of last December 's Venezuelan panic strutted through Wall Street yesterday . The stock market of a sudden went to pieces . Many conspicuous stocks fell as much as five points . NUE ' one stock of any prominence failed to yield . Average declines in active stocks were over 3 per cent . This smashing time was brought about by the news from Washington  --  the Senate committee 's vote for free Cuba . Wall Street was unprepared for such a development . People who had foreseen that there might be grave issues forced to the front in Congress had been pooh-poohed aside . They were called alarmists . Nobody in Wall Street gave them attention . Largely they were professional bear speculators , anyhow , and of course they were expected to talk blue . Even they indulged in predictions which were mild compared to what really came to pass in yesterday 's Senate committee 's vote . On every side there was reliance upon what . Wall Street has come to call " the business sense " of statesmen down at Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way : National political campaigning being over , politicians would not have further incentive for sensational plays to tile galleries ; they would be prudent , give respect to the buSi.  - -  ness interests of the country ; they would not only avoid disturbance , but would go far toward an extreme in trying to facilitate financial and commercial confidence and improvement . Wall Street has been so firmly persuaded that this was the situation that the short interest in the stock market has been kept down . Stocks have been vigorously hammered from day to day , and a good many questionable methods have been resorted to in trying to force declines ; this has shown the activity of the bear speculative party , but there has at no time been any exhibition of ? pronounced confidence upon the part of even the most aggressive bear campaigners . Thus , when yesterday 's news came from the United States Senate Chamber , it found the market more than usually open to attack . Bear Traders ' Were Active . Through all the bear assaults and manoeuvres that have given Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has at ' no time been any development of fright among investors . People who own stocks have been confronted with too many past scarecrows to be easily daunted now . They have withstood bugaboo after bugaboo ; they have seemed to become practically careless of any demoralizing games attempted against them . Yesterday 's market showed , however , that in some high quarters this independence of bear factors was now less to be relied upon . When special . dispatches rushed the Senate committee 's , vote . into the Stock Exchange district , every bear trader , of course , fell immediately upon the market , striking out right and left . Nearly two-thirds of the business day was over when the news arrived . Up till that . hour the market had been slowly creeping along at its recent average pace of something like 20,000 shares an hour ; ' but spontaneously everything like apathy vanished , and for the remainder of the Stock Exchange session there were slamming and ramming and jamming in almost a record-breaking way . Every stock that had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 points for both its issues , Cotton Oil went down almost twice as much , Tobacco. ! Trust slid in the same way , one of the Cordage stocks lost three points , and Leather preferred was smashed about as much  --  every trust stock on the list turntling , with Sugar Trust , as usual , most conspicuous in leadership . Over 75,000 shares of Sugar Trust were traded in . It opened above 112 and hung listlessly most of the day till the smashing news from Washington sent it tobogganing offhand to 108 . Effect on Railroad Stocks . In the railroad stocks not one was able to withstand the pressure of the day 's demoralizing developments . Many stocks were traded in over 10,000 shares apiece . St. Paul , Reading , and Burlington each crossed the 40,000 mark . Reading lost three points , Southern Railway preferred about the same , and so did Louisville and Nashville and Chicago Gas and other conspicuous shares , while in the Granger list , St. Paul , Rock Island , and Burlington shrunk 5 points or more apiece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been considered sensational in Wall Street . But they are fluctuations which go beyond anything that the stock market has known since the panic times of 1893 , save only the demoralization which sent Wall Street sprawling just one year age . At that time , on the first day of the break  --  the worst day of the Venezuelan panic  --  the affrage breaks were sharper than those ? of yesterday . Then Sugar dropped 7% , and other conspicuous declines were : Tobacco , 5 ; Chicago Gas , 5% ; General Electric , 814 ; Missouri Pacific , 4 ; Southern preferred , 41/4 : Tennessee ? Coal , 71/i ; Western Union , 3% ; Manhattan , 9 ; Lake Shore , 5 ; Burlington , 6 ; St. Paul , 6% , and Rock Island , 7 . Many stocks in the Venezuelan smash touched their low point in the first day 's break . Few Wall Street authorities would consent , either during yesterday 's break or after the market was closed , to discuss the outlook . Congressmen ' , were called many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professional Wall Street cared less , however , for either Congressional motives or criticisms of , these motives than It did for calculations . as to whether or not the break so suddenly developed , and so violent in some of its characteristics , was likely to go much further . A large majority of commission brokers felt that after this shaking up the market would get out of its apathy , and there was much talk of the probability of the reap'peara.nce of important financial interests hitherto holding aloof from the market . But even important commission brokers hesitated to permit themselves to - be so quoted . Of course , every bear speculator teemed with enthusiasm , making predictions of much further declines . In banking circles it was agreed that general business interests . are in snug shape , and , that , no prospective Spanish incident , will impose consequential penalties . Wall Street must stand the brunt of the Congressional sandbagging . CONDEMNS SENATORS ' ACTION . John H. Davis Says that It Is Both Mischievous and Malicious . Discussing yesterday 's demoralization of the stock market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis of the Stock Exchange said : " When a man sees such an exhibition as these representatives of the people are now engaged in giving , it is time for him to show his natural disgust . It is beyond understanding how men supposed to be intelligent can be so wholly regardless of their trust and their country as to do what these Senators have done ' in this Cuban matter . " Just at a time when the whole country was heaving a great sigh of relief and congratulating itself on the settlement of the problems that have been vexatious for years , its Legislature must needs go thousands of miles to seek further trouble with which to perplex our country . Just at a time when we needed rest the most ; just at a time when our industries and our enterprises needed a time free from impending disaster in which to recuperate from the shocks and struggles of past years ; just at a time when every condition and every influence was favorable to progress and prosperity , the Congress must blight hopes and stay improvement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation can be too strong for the members of this Senatorial committee . What they are doing is both mischievous and malicious . It is a , breach of trust  --  a violation of confidence . The Senators who passed that resolution to-day must know , if they be at all intelligent , that they have done something detrimental to the welfare of their country . One can not understand why they have acted in this way . Possibly it is a play for votes ? an appeal to the groundlings . But , really , a man is inclined to doubt Senatorial honesty  --  to suspect these men of ' having interests in the stock market  --  when he considers the damage they have done . " Every body of public-minded men in the country , every Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce , should denounce at once this Cuban resolution . To sacrifice the wants and needs of our own country in order to make warlike and silly threats against a foreign power is not what men are sent to Congress for . There should go up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaunted in the face of the people . " ? What Alexander E. Orr Says . Alexander E. Orr , President of the Chamber of Commerce , said he had no authority to make any statement relative to that body 's attitude toward the Cameron resolution . " Personally , " he said , " I think the action of the Senate Committee will have a bad effect On . business . That is bound to be the case if the resolution goes through Congress . The situation is especially to be deplored , being created in a time when the country had just made a great stride toward recovery from the depression caused by recent political events . It is bound to retard our long sought return to prosperity . " Wheat , Market in Sympathy . Produce Exchange members said at the close of trading hours yesterday that the wheat market would have been firmer and the prices higher but for the adoption of the Cameron Cuban resolutions , and that the wheat market was in sympathy with the stock market . There was no excitement beyond the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , which closed on Thursday at 86 cents bid , opened at 351/4 , sold to 86y8 , went as low as 85% , and sold at 851/8 cents asked . Corn and oats remained practically at Thursday 's closing quotations for May , 311/.2 and 241/4 cents , respectively .
