txt Some of the officers of the navy who have been regretting the apparent inability of the Secretary of the Navy to repress the injurious activity of Acting Admiral Walker in his effort to accumulate to himself a larger share than is desirable of the power and fame of the naval service , are Inclined to believe that Secretary Tracy has discovered a way by which he can employ the executive qualities of the Acting Admiral and the new ships of the navy , and at the same time separate Admiral Gherardi and Acting Admiral Walker . It is semi-officially announced that the NavyDepartment is to strengthen the United States fleet in Asiatic waters , and that the vessels to be sent out there are to oo-operate with the fleets of other nations in protecting the interests of all the foreign nations there represented . It is admitted that it will be necessary , in order to make the work of the United States vessels in China effective , to have them under the command of an officer of considerable force of character  --  one who is ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reputation for fertility In resources and for more than the average executive ability . Acting Admiral Walker has manifested a great desire to be actively employed . His chief merit , it has been insisted by his admirers , has been his executive ability , his skill in assigning ships and men to the places where they were most needed , and in getting work out of them . The situation in China , where there may not be any-0 hostile acts by the Chinese Government , but which calls for the exercise by the allied foreigners of the promptest action in ease of mob violence , would , it is asserted , develop Acting Admiral Walker 's abilities to the utmost , and at the same time would subject the personnel of our fleet in these waters to a degree of discipline to which , it is said by some officers of the service , the China fleet has been a stranger for many years . Admiral Belknap is now in command of the Asiatic station . His tour of three years in command of that station will end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be selected to succeed him and should go out in a vessel ordered to join the Asiatic fleet he could only get out there a little in advance of the expiration of Admiral Belknap 's tour . Admiral harmony , it Is understood , is to take the command when be gets out to China with the Lancaster , but there Is no doubt that if Walker falls in with the idea of taking the China fleet he will find ways to overcome so small an obstacle as the opposition of a superior officer . The probability is , however , that the Walker " pull " is more likely to be felt against any plan that Secretary Tracy may have for sending him out of the neighborhood in which no can make himself felt in the Navy Department , or too far away from Admiral Gherardi and the opportunity of making that gentleman miserable , It is just possible that Walker may feel it incumbent to remain about Washington , to be near the Congress when the time arrives for instructing that body how it may most effectively increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When that time comes it may be suggested without much fear of contradiction that the further away from Washington Commodore Walker may happen to be , the better it will be for any plan of extension the Committee on Naval Affairs may be asked to consider . If he should be in China or . better still for the service , in the South Atlantic , he would . be about as far away as it would be possible to send him and make him at all useful . It is inconceivable that he should venture to appear before the Naval Committee in person to ask that his " pull " be strengthened by act of Congress . ANTONIO ROSSA MURDERED . KILLED BY A MAN WHOM HE HAD ASSAULTED LAST MONTH . Antonio Reese , an Italian laborer , twentythree years old , who lived at 135 Mott Street , was stabbed last evening , while in front of 85 Mulberry Street , ** Pneorto , also an Italian laborer , and died soon after . The murderer fled immediately aftet the stabbing and made his escape , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fight which occurred between the men nearly a month ago . Pueorto and Rossa were among a gang of laborers employed in excavating a cellar at Beaver and Broad Streets . They wore working there on the 27th ult. , when the foreman of the job wanted all hands to resume work after the noonday recess at 12:45 o'clock . All the men but Pucorto refused to commence work until 1 o'clock , but Pucorto picked up his tools and went to work . This angered the other laborers , and they denounced Pueorto , and called him vile names . One of the men picked up a sledge hammer and threatened to beat his brains out , but Rossa pushed this man aside and struck Pueorto on the head with a shovel , inflicting a very severe wound . The injured Italian was taken to the Chambers Street Hospltal , where he was treated for nearly a week , and then went to his home . Rossa was arrested for felonious assault , and was committed to the Tombs to await the result of his injuries . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bail . On the 8th inst. the case was called for examination at the Tombs Police Court , but Pucorto declined to prosecute . and Bosse was discharged . It appears that Rosso , paid $100 to Pueorto to settle the matter " Since the settlement Pucorto has done no work , but has remained at home brooding over the assault and frequently threatening vengeance on Rossa . The money he had received did not appear to prove a salve to his wounded feelings , particularlg as Reese , whenever ho met him in the street , taunted him with his broken head . Rossa was on his way home from work at 0:30 o'clock last evening in company with Michael Cnstatina . He was carrying his shovel and dinner pall . Opposite Raffaelo Santo 's butcher shop . at 85 Mulberry Street , Pneorto sneaked up behind him and throwing his left arm over Rossa 's shoulder drew him backward . Then reaching forward with his right hand he plunged a sheath knife into Rossa 's abdomen to the hilt Reese dropped his shovel and dinnerpail , and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferret ! , at 84 Mulberry Street . He made his way into the back room , where he fell dead on tho floor . In the excitement Pueorto disappeared .
