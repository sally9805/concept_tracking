txt " The criminal , his social and legal status , and the philosophy of reformation , " were the subjects of a paper read before the New-York State Medical Association yesterday afternoon by Dr. William A. White of Broome County , at the Mott Memorial Rail The paper was at once an amplification , corollary , and complement of ex-President Austin Flint 's discourse of Friday night , while the questions were more broadly , not to say daringly , treated . Summed up , Dr. White 's views on criminality were that delinquent degenerates were the outcome of social maladies , and should be considered as patients , to be cured by environment ; that our jury system and legal procedure are faulty ; that reformation of criminals is possible , and that the best system of reclamation is exemplified in the Elmira . Reformatory and Superintendent Brockway , while retaliative punishment is condemned . " Degeneracy , " said Dr. White , in beginning his address , " is with specialists in psychology the leading topic- of the day . It may be said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has been championed by the Italian scholars , among them Lombroso , in La Donna Delinquente , ' and other works . " Degeneration , " he continued , " is a danger that threatens the social structure . All of our delinquent classes are largely composed of delinquents , and through their increase society is threatened with a sort of revolution . Society is an organism , and like all organisms subject to disease , and such a. disease is degeneracy , of Which crime is a symptom . " Discussing the causes of degeneracy , Dr. White said that it might be traced to widespread or local disaster , such as financial or manufacturing crises or disaster , or any unstable condition of affairs which would result in suffering , Ioss of prosperity , and lowering of moral tone , or anything that would be in the way of a sound mind in a. sound body . Individuals on whom such conditions fall most heavily may become degenerate . In a community whose resources were dissipated , the children ushered into the world in such unfavorable circumstances become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the speaker , " that the uneducated and neglected should become other than good citizens ? " Classifying criminality on grade from insane impulse to the wageworker forced to steal through lack of employment , and the woman breadwinner , swayed to immorality by starvation , Dr. White said that the habitual and professional criminals were the most interesting to the criminologist . These degenerates constitute our criminal hierarchy , and it is of primary importance to formulate signs and symptoms by which the social disease can be recognized and the grades of degeneracy differentiated Of the anatomy of degeneracy , Dr. White said that in the brain we should expect to find evidences of degeneracy and in the osseous structure abnormalities which should be unerring signs of degeneracy . In considering the question of criminal types , Dr. White said that the Italian students maintain that it can be determined if one can become a criminal . Lombroso holds that chirography will establish a criminal trend . Investigation may in the future accurately establish that degenerates possess signs that unerringly distinguish them from the ordinary man of probity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance of responsibility was constituted in three factors : the quality of the action , the forces compelling action , and the forces to inhibit action , or , as a mathematician would say , three independent variables . Citing several cases of criminals who were absolutely ignorant of right and wrong , Dr. White quoted the Penal Code to show that the criminal law takes no cognizance of the abnormality of these three factors in degeneracy , and said : " How far in the rear of the frontier of legal science our legal brothers are . " The question of responsibility , he maintained , is a medical science of expert testimony . He said that because of the shirking of jury duty by men of attainments and social position the ordinary juryman understands but a small part of technical evidence , while its manipulation is such as to mystify , disguise , or conceal . " This , " Dr. White exclaimed , " is a method of procedure bristling in faults , so that we should not wonder at miscarriage Of justice . But I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show where they are week " Placing the causes of crime in environment , Dr. White cited strikes as the crimes of crowds . Of the remedies , he said that a judicial body could only deal with results . Schools of law would have to give attention to sociology , and the public should be aroused to a deeper sense of obligation to citizen duty in jury service . This should not be shirked by the educated and intelligent . In dealing with the convicted criminal one should , Dr. White said , never lose sight of dae fact that he is dealing with a degenerate , an abnormal , who has done an anti-society act . And only one effort is to be employed . Scientists are convinced that here they have a social evil to deal with , and retaliation has no place in it . What to do with the releeeed criminals , the incorrigible  --  many believe that he C , ould be quietly deprived of life . But the . speaker was most emphatically opposed to capital punishment for any crime . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good the cause of evil must be removed . Society is responsible for crime . Capital punishment had no effect . A scientist investigated the lives of a number of criminals sent to death , and discovered that they had all seen executions . Coming to the prison problem , Dr. White sketched the old system of incarceration and the new , saying of the latter that our prisons are now marvels of cleanliness , good order , and humanity . With all this we are incompetent to deal with our prisoners . Statistics prove how far we fail . Prisons create what they are intended to prevent . They are hotbeds for the production of crime . They manufacture the phthislcal , the insane , and the criminal . In them the criminal enjoys the lethargy of a purely animal existence , and by and by the prison to him becomes a necessity . " The prison is the best school for crime that we possess , " an authority maintains , and we have in the prison a confirmed enemy of society . Contrasting Prisons with the best reformatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the criminal , as a degenerate , is out of harmony with his environment reformatories furnish an artificial environment whose scheme is one of regeneration beginning with hygiene , athletics , and dietetics as a basis for cerebral adaptation , and useful occupation as a curative adjunct " Criminals , " said Dr. White , " should be sent to reformatories as patients , to remain until cured and not for a fixed time , and criminals should know that this is the course and that liberty depends on themselves . " The environments of reformatories , the speaker Probably , " he continued , " Elmira Reformatory of all places of the kind in the world exhibits this form of reformation in its greatest development and greatest success . Elmira as an experience in criminologyis a success . " In conclusion , Dr. White repeated his assertion that the spirit of retaliation by punishment was no longer admissible . Degenerates should be treated as ailing persons , and kept in proper hospitals for regeneration until cured . Dr. White was warmly applauded w hen he finished , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John G. Truax . The latter said that he claimed recognition for the good work done by the Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents . In compliance with repeated demands , the retiring President of the association , Dr. Flint , made some remarks on Dr. White 's paper . The Juvenile Delinquent Society , he said , had done even more than the Elmira Reformatory for degenerates . The question of juvenile delinquents was one of the greatest importance . It has been said , he continued , that education was a great antidote to crime , and on the other band that education did not prevent crime . Some are educated beyond their class . Poor graduates with honors earn pittances , and there are those so educated as to be ashamed of those who gave them birth . Such as they would not shrink from crime , although educated .

At the close of the annual meeting , Dr. Flint introduced his successor , Dr. Colvin , who spoke happily in recognition of the distinction conferred on him . One of the papers read yesterday was " A Brief Contribution on the Therapeutics of Diabetes , " by Dr. J. B. White of this city , who said that the disease should be classed among the neuroses.                  @ @ @
