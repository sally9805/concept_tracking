txt NATIVE of temperate regions never thinks of crabs as terrestrial animals , but one of the most novel and noteworthy features of tropical island life is the abundance of crabs everywhere on land , even to the tops of the mountains . A fig-tree near my door was covered with fruit , some of it nearly ripe , but every day when I visited it I found all the ripening fruit gone . One morning before daybreak I found the thieves at work-half a dozen big crabs up among the branches , making their way slowly and cautiously , but reaching every part of the tree , clinging by the sharp tips of their legs . Even the hermit-crabs , loaded down by their massive shells , climb trees with agility , and infest the houses like mice , and in the stillness of night the loud crash of a hermit-crab falling in a heavy shell from the pantry shelf to the floor often rouses the household . If you steal quietly into the bushes anywhere in the Bahamas and rest for a few minutes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if snakes were crawling through them but there are few snakes in the islands , and the noise is made by the hermitcrabs which have dropped to the ground and hidden at your approach . When everything is quiet they come and climb the bushes again , and they may be picked off the stems and branches by hundreds in beautiful sea-shells as varied as the collection of a conchologist . The hermit-crabs are busy night and day , but most of the land-crabs of the tropics are nocturnal , or at least most active at night , and they are usually wary and timid in habit ; on the alert at all times , and taking alarm and hiding when disturbed . They must have many enemies , for the empty sea-shells which have served as houses for hermit-crabs VOL . XIV. -9 may be gathered in abundance many miles from the water ; some of them are possibly shells which have been outgrown and abandoned , but most of them are the empty homes of murdered crabs . On a little coral island where I once spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump crabs . He assured us that they were a great delicacy , but our cook rejected them , with the assertion that she was sure we would not care for them . When questioned she gave no reason , except that white folks never ate them ; but she seemed so sure that they would not suit us that we determined to wait for more knowledge , although our larder was nearly empty , as it always is in the tropics . A few days later , passing the little cemetery just before dark , we found the ground tunnelled by great burrows like those of prairie-dogs , and one or two of these plump crabs on the mound of earth at the mouth of each burrow . Land-crabs are by no means confined to oceanic islands , although they form one of the most characteristic features of island life . They are undoubtedly insular in their origin , although they have wandered from the islands to the shores of the continents . They are interesting as an illustration of the way in which the land was originally populated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrestrial animals were marine , but at present the continents are well stocked , and every available place is so well filled , by thoroughly terrestrial forms , that a new-coiner from the ocean can not gain a footing . Long before its structure and habits become modified and adapted for a life on land , it is exterminated by competition with improved forms , or else destroyed by enemies which it has not yet learned to escape . On an island the case is different . Most oceanic islands are modern geologically , and while plants and birds and // insects have means for reaching and populating new lands , most of the common terrestrial mammals are unable to make a long sea - voyage by natural means , and the places which they fill in the continents are therefore vacant in oceanic islands , where they have been seized upon by the crabs , which have acquired habits much like t1*ose of our rats and squirrels . They still retain enough of their old nature to carry them back to the water at the breeding season , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ordinary crabs . They inherit a constitution which will lead them back on to the land when they have completed their larval life , although this lasts long enough for the ocean-currents to carry some of them away from time to time to lands far distant from their birthplace . Even if these lands be already stocked with terrestrial animals the crabs are able to hold their own , for they are not mere upstarts , but the children of parents whose ancestors have slowly learned the way to live on land in a country where the coast has been clear . A recent emigrant from the ocean would have little chance on the shore of a continent , but an animal which has slowly found out the road to terrestrial life on an oceanic island transmits all its powers to its children , and if they are thrown on to a continent they are under no great disadvantage . Our laboratory in Jamaica was on the side of a rocky limestone hill , honeycombed in all directions by cracks and fissures and large caves , all inhabited by big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs , to forage around our home . They would climb the steep stone terrace , and the high steps to our door , where they would stand peeping inquisitively through the crack of the door , and waiting and watching until the house was quiet . Whenever we looked up from our work in the evening we were sure to see at least one gentleman crab , and his wife beside him , standing on tiptoe and cocking their long stalked eyes , on the watch for a chance to slip in and explore the house . As soon as we were well settled at our work they would creep stealthily in and wander everywhere , although they were especially fond of climbing up the mosquito - nets to the canopies over our beds . A crab hunt was the last event of our day , and it was not without excitement , for while the animals are generally peaceful and well behaved , they have big formidable claws , and they always fight when cornered . They can not be driven out , for while they are timid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , but run sideways along the walls , tumbling over each other in their eagerness , until they reach a hiding-place behind our trunks or under the furniture , when they resist all attempts to dislodge them , clinging to everything within reach and waving their big claws in the most threatening way . I soon learned that the way to clear the house is to sweep them with a broom into the middle of the floor before they have time to hide , and then , keeping them well away from the furniture and door-casings , to hurry them along until they are opposite the open door , and to shoot them out with a push which sends them over the steps and clear of everything , down the hill , for if they are simply pushed out they hang by the tips of their claws over the wall and out of sight , ready to come back as soon as the way is clear . It seldom rains in this part of Jamaica , but we had one hard rain , and after it was over the crabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitudes . They came up our steps in armies , and they would climb over each other in their eagerness to look in at*the door . At night , when I escorted my family home to our own quarters , after our dinner in the laboratory , I was forced to go ahead with a lantern to kick the crabs out of the path . I could not avoid stepping on some of them , and the injured ones were at once attacked and eaten by the others . All the negroes from miles around came with bags , or carts , or boats , or donkeys to gather them for food ; and we found them a most acceptable addition to our own somewhat monotonous bill of fare . In two days fully a thousand bushels were gathered on an area of // a few acres around our laboratory without any perceptible d*rease iu the supply . The books speak of the sudden appearance of these crabs as a migration , and our neighbors stated that they were on the march over our hill to a harbor several miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle the question by observations on individual crabs , but our studies brought us into conflict with the crab-gatherers , who caught most of them around our house . We tried to prevent crab-catching on our premises , but while the Jamaican negro accepts his inferior position without protest , he is very tenacious of what he regards as his established rights , and there was such an indignation meeting that I was afraid we should be mobbed . I was forced to give way , but I satisfied myself that all the crabs had holes near by and knew the way home , and that there was no true migration ; although it is well known that other species do migrate from the interior down to the sea-shore at the breeding season . The crabs were generally in pairs , and I think the rain had excited their breeding instincts and made them restless . They were possessed by a most intense passion for climbing , and they climbed everywhere , apparently from pure inquisitiveness-up the trees , over the high stone wall on which our house stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window-shutters , and stairs , and at night we heard them pattering over the corrugated iron roof . On the night when the excitement was at its highest my students were awakened by a crash , and rushing out they found the veranda , which is so large and cool that we have made it our laboratory , in the possession of an army of crabs . Our reagent shelves were covered to the top , and the floor was covered with broken bottle* of alcohol , corrosive sublimate , and acids . My students put on their shoes and kicked their way through the crabs , kicking them over the wall and down the steps , and after half an hour of hard work they cleared the house , but I was forced to hire a man to clear away the dead and wounded next day , and the destruction of our reagent was a serious loss . The natives of Jamaica claim that their coffee is the best in the world , and that which grows on the sides of the high mountains is the best in Jamaica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which commands the highest prices in the English market . We are told , however , that the quintessence of all is the rat coffee , or the seeds from berries which have been gnawed by rats , for these animals are very fond of the aromatic pulp of the cherry-like fruit which incloses the seeds , and as their fastidious taste leads them to select the best , children are employed to gather among the bushes the berries which they have gnawed , and this coffee is set apart as the finest and most delicious of all . Years ago rats were very abundant on the island , and they were so destructive in the sugar estates that the Government undertook to destroy them , and after many fruitless experiments with various rat-killing animals , finally found an efficient rat exterminator in the mungoos of India . Rats are scarce now , but they have too many resources and expedients to submit tamely , and in some parts of the island they have taken to the trees as a refuge , and have acquired something of the habits of squirrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes spelled , the moongus , is a small , prolific , and most aggressive mammal , with weasel-like habits , and something of the general appearance of a large rat . It is now found in abundance in all parts of the island , and in our walks and drives we often saw it running across the road like a cat . It is absolutely without fear , and its movements are so rapid that it does not hesitate to attack any animal , however large , and it is highly valued in India as a destroyer of all sorts of vermin . In Jamaica it has not confined itself to the rats , for it has exterminated a number of interesting birds and reptiles , and the land fauna has become very scanty since its introduction . There were never any poisonous snakes in the island , but a few years ago several species of boas and other large snakes of great interest to naturalists were very common . Now they are almost gone , and we did not see or hear of a single specimen , although my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kills the full-grown snakes whenever it finds them , and it seeks out and devours their eggs . We had no opportunity to see it attack a snake , but it is a perfect picture of savage ferocity when it attacks a rat , although the battle is over in an instant . In India , where it is kept as a domestic animal on account of its value as a serpent-killer , it is said to attack the largest and most venomous snakes without hesitation , with such intense rage and eagerness for battle that the snake is overwhelmed by the audacity and unrelenting fury of its onset . All the poisonous snakes Rtand in awe of it , and even the cobra seeks to escape , but finding that no escape is possible , it erects its crest and makes futile efforts to strike its persecutor , but the mungoos darts about just out of reach , and seems to delight in dodging out of the way just in time . At each opportunity it darts in and bites the back of the snake 's neck , repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so highly esteemed by the ancient Egyptians for its value in checking the increase of the crocodile that it was regarded as a sacred animaL It is always impossible to foresee the effect of any interference with the economy of nature , and the influence of this relentless and aggressive savage has been felt by all the terrestrial animals of Jamaica . There is no native carnivorous mammal , and in fact at the time of the discovery of the island the only terrestrial mammal , besides the Indian and his pet lap-dog , was the agouti , and the birds and reptiles had no experience or inherited instincts to aid them when they were suddenly confronted by an enemy which had been developed by the fierce competition of the densely populated continent of Asia . They were like peaceful islanders invaded by soldiers trained by long practice in the art of war . A few have learned to protect themselves , and the ground-dove now builds its nest on a great branching cactus , so thorny that even the mungoos can not climb it , but many interesting species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West India islands bright little lizards are found everywhere , and they are so familiar and harmless that no prejudice against reptiles resists their attraction very bug . After learning that they are great destroyers of flies , mosquitoes , and other insect pests , most visitors to the tropics soon become interested in them and find a great pleasure in watching them . They are usually so abundant on most of the islands that you can scarcely look up without seeing one or two species on the veranda , or the bushes , or rocks . The embryologist who wishes to study the development of reptiles can find their eggs in any desired quantity after he has learned where to look , but they are hidden with great care . In one of the smaller Bahama islands the children brought to our laboratory a few little eggs about the size of peas . They proved to be the eggs of a small lizard which a member of the party wished to study , and as we had not been able to find any ourselves we proposed to buy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady procession of children set in , each with an egg , and even after we had bought up all the copper in the treasury of the island Sunday-school our stock of half-pence was exhausted , so we followed the children , as it was clear that they knew of an egg mine near by . Back of the huts on the beach were great piles of the empty shells of the beautiful pink-lipped conch , which is the chief food staple of the islanders . On these shell-heaps we found the children twisting the shells like reversed Archimedean screws and rolling the little eggs out of their hiding-places in the central whorls ; and we afterward found all we needed for ourselves . In the towns of Jamaica the little lizards are still pretty common , but they are comparatively scarce in the country , for the mun*oos keeps them in check , as it does the insectiverous birds . The result is an excellent illustration of the interdependence of all forms of life , for the introduction of the mungoos to destroy the rats has brought about an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insectivorous lizards and birds has given an opportunity for the injurious insects to multiply , and whole sections of the island which formerly produced choice beef and mutton have // become almost useless for grazing purposes , for the ticks now swarm in millions on the grass and worry the domestic animals into starvation . They are a plague so serious that the Government has offered a large sum of money as a prize for the discovery of some way to destroy them . Everywhere in the West Indies one sees on stone walls and trees and rocks , as well as in the houses , dark brown streaks , which look as if drops of paint or varnish had trickled down and then hardened , but on touching them they are found to be hollow ridges of an earthy substance which crumbles under a blow . These lines are the covered roads of the termites , or white ants , leading from their feeding grounds to their nests . These are not at all like the great conical nests of the African termites which the pictures in the school geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trees , and the brown nests , which are not often much larger than a flour barrel , look like great warty knots on the trunks . The white ants are very abundant , but as the nests and galleries are VOL . XJV. - 1O almost indestructible by rain , they last for years after they have been abandoned , and they are therefore much more common than the living colonies . The ants feed upon dry or decaying wood , and the absence of fallen treetrunks or branches in the forests of the tropics is no doubt due in great part to their influence . The destruction to the wood-work of houses and furniture is all the greater , as they work in the dark , entering the wood at some hidden corner , and leaving the surface unbroken so that their presence is not suspected until the wood has been reduced to a surface layer so thin that when it breaks it collapses completely and crumbles like dust . The workers and soldiers are wingless , but when young the males and females have wings , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the foundation for new colonies . I once rented as a laboratory a furnished house which had as part of its equipment what appeared to be a massive carved oak dinner-table . While we were at dinner a swarm of these winged termites came out of the Jamaica Crabs Climbing a Wall . // table and flew away , and we then found that the carving was only a film of varnish so thin that we could crush it to powder in our hands . I once had the good fortune to witness the first attack on a piece of furniture . A member of my party was working with his microscope at a little table which touched the inner wall of our house at one corner , and as I was sitting down to look at something which he had asked me to examine under his microscope I saw an army of termite soldiers come out of a crack in the floor and form two parallel ranks facing each other , about a third of an inch apart , along a line which had clearly been laid down before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched it . The soldiers stationed themselves with great regulaiity at equal intervals , and they took their positions like machines without any hesitation or confusion , and in far less time than it takes to tell it each one stood in his proper place as stiff and immovable as a stone statue . Instantly a living stream of the blind workers flowed up between the lines of soldiers on to the lower surface of the top of the table , where we found other ranks of soldiers guiding the stream to three or four points where the attack on the table was to begin . The workers then began at once to gnaw away the wood and to build up walls of a dark brown substance on each side of the lines of march , which were then arched over and converted into dark passages . The soldiers kept their places for two days , changing guard at intervals , until all the paths were roofed in , but as fast as the tunnel was finished the soldier on duty at that point slipped in and disappeared , until on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along an unfinished half inch , and I watched them go in just before the last gap was closed . In a few days the lower side of the table-top was covered with dark passages , and we could hear the work going on inside the wood , although the proprietor of the table still kept up his embryological studies with the microscope on top . Whenever daylight is let into one of the tubes by breaking a hole in it the stream of workers breaks and disap pears , but in a few seconds the soldiers come out and mount guard , and the stream of workers flows on again , and the break is soon mended . In the dark the workers are able to carry on their labors alone , but they seem unable to accomplish anything in the light , or even to keep to the path without a guard of soldiers . Among the interesting natural objects of tropical America the gigantic silk-cotton tree is one of the most prominent features in the landscape . It does not contain as many cubic feet of timber as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest of living things , and its sturdy individuality is so impressive that even a half savage negro feels its grandeur , and it is said that in the old days of Jamaica the slaves never dared to cut down a cotton-tree until its pardon had been asked and its anger appeased by a plentiful libation of rum poured over its roots . It is widely distributed , but is seldom seen to more advantage than on the grazing pens in the high valleys of Jamaica , where it is a most imposing giant when its smooth straight trunk is seen towering like a great lighthouse from some commanding hill , with its majestic crown of spreading branches outlined against the sky . Every traveller describes it , but it is not easy to seize upon the exact source of the interest which it always excites , for this is not its size nor its beauty , nor anything in the tree itself , except the fact that it is one of the best examples of the essential difference between tropical vegetation and that of temperate regions . Everyone feels this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetable life of the tropics which give a distinctive tone to the whole , and I feel confident that this feature is the intensity of the struggle for existence and the obvious and impressive character of the devices and contrivances which enable the plants to escape their enemies or to defeat their competitors . A trained botanist sees evidence of the same struggle among the plants of temperate regions , but its existence is not at all obvious to a superficial ob // server , and except for the destruction caused by untimely frost or hail , or by prolonged drought , our trees and plants at home seem to live out their days in peace . They toil not , neither do they spin , and the productive power of the earth never seems overtaxed . In the tropics everything is different , and interest is continually excited by the discovery of new devices for enabling each plant to hold its own or to seize upon unoccupied ground . The purpose of these adaptations is so definite and obvious that tropical botany is as lively and attractive as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short stay among tropical forests and gardens makes of every visitor an enthusiastic botanist . Every inch of ground is fought for , down to the edge of the water , and even into the ocean , and he who has the rare good luck in these days of steamships and seaports to make his first visit to the tropics , as I did , in a sailing vessel , and to row ashore from her moorings to an unsettled coast , will be impressed before he sets foot on shore by the absence of the belt of bare rock or sand which fringes the coast of temperate regions . The boat is among the bushes before it reaches land , and one must either find a path or cut a way to the shore through the impenetrable thicket . The intensity of the contest for every inch of standing room is shown by the diversity of the forests , for no one tree predominates , and one sees nothing like our own chestnut woods , or oak , or maple , or birch forests . Each tree is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most singular places . It is not unusual to find roots which have penetrated cracks in the roof of a cave , hanging like ropes to the floor , where they penetrate the ground and gather nourishment for the big trunk on the hill-side thirty or forty feet above , while ferns and climbing vines grow inside the caves in dim twilight . The fight between the plants is so fierce and incessant that no species has much chance , unless it has some specialty , some peculiar adaptation , some distinctive habit of life , some contrivance for distributing its seeds in new IN THE WEST INDIES . 107 places , some poisonous property , or something which sets it apart in a place of its own . Of all this which gives to tropical vegetation its peculiar interest , the silk cotton-tree is one of the most conspicuous and intelligible illustrations . Its true home is in dense forests of tall trees , where it holds its own against all its competitors for standing room by the simple expedient of pushing up into the empty air above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossy dark green leaves in the clear sky . It is like an animal in the definite purpose of its habits , and like an animal , too , in its method of development , for it has a metamorphosis , and it passes through a series of well-marked stages of development on its way to maturity . A young tree is usually only a big tree in miniature , and the element which gives to zoology its greatest interest  --  the re Sweeping Out the Crabs . // capitulation by the individual animal during its development to maturity of a series of ancestral stages in the evolu sites , and vet the tree does seem to be protected , either by the spines or by some property in its bark , from the tion of the race-is lacking in the sister science . But the young silk-cotton tree is quite different from the old one , and it passes through a series of stages which may possibly show the way in which its peculiar structure has been gradually acquired . Its seeds , as light as thistle - down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when its great pods burst the whole country is whitened . Seedlings are found everywhere , and small trees are abundant and much like ordinary trees in appearance , except that the trunk and branches are covered by a thorny armor of sharp spines . As it grows older these disappear , first from the trunk and later from the branches , after they have served their purpose of protecting the young tree . They seem to be a better defence against animal enemies than against vegetable para mosses and creepers and epiphytic plants which cover the trunks4of other trees , for these are seldom found on the trunk of the young silk-cotton , which is beautifully clean and white . When struck it rings like an iron pipe , for while the surface is very dense and hard , the central portion is soft and pulpy : a disposition of the woody substance which secures great strength , while permitting rapid growth . When the tree is some four or five feet in diameter wooden brackets begin to grow out from the trunk into the right angles under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread . At the same time the trunk becomes ventricose near the ground , and soon great buttresses arise in the angles between the trunk and the roots , which run close to the surface of the ground for a very great distance . We found that we Silk-cotton Tree in Jamaica-low-branched form . // could trace them for two hundred and fifty feet from the trunk of a tree of medium size before they penetrated to the deeper soiL It is said that the Spanish conquerors stabled their horses between the buttresses , and the author of " Tom Cnngle 's Log " tells how he was taken as a prisoner to a guard-house with a rude veranda of bamboos and palm - leaves between two of the immense spurs of a mighty cotton-tree that stretched many yards from the parent stem . Above these buttresses the trunk is smooth and cylindrical , and in wellgrown specimens is some ten or twelve feet in diameter and eighty or a hundred feet high . The glossy green leaves are deciduous , for it is one of the few tropical trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through eighteen months instead of twelve , and it is fixed by conditions of nutrition rather than the change of seasons . Just before it flowers the branches are bare , but after the fruit has set the new leaves burst forth , like the opening buds of our springtime , and nourish the great pods until they have swelled to their full size . Then the leaves fall and the tropical sun beats down upon the pods until they are fully ripe , when they suddenly burst all over the tree and swell into great snowy bundles of cotton . That these changes are independent of the change of seasons is shown by the fact that one great branch may become established in a cycle of its own , and may be green while the rest of the tree is bare or covered with great yellow flowers . Specimens vary in shape , and solitary trees in open meadows often branch near the ground , but in a well - grown typical tree the trunk runs straight up , without branches , like a massive cylindrical tower , well above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms . At the top it carries a crown of branches stretching out horizontally to an incredible distance . There is always room at the top , and one tree which I measured covered a circle sixty-one yards in diameter , or about half an acre in area . The silk-cotton is free from the crowding which has caused the upward tendencv of the greater branches of all ordinary trees , and although each one of its Silk-cotton Tree in Sloom. // main branches is as big as a good-sized oak , they all run straight out at right angles to the trunk . Their enormous size and weight demand a peculiar arrangement of the material , so they have become soft and light internally , while the surface is tough and firm . Practically they are tubes , like the steel spars of a man - of - war . Even this is not enough , and they rest on brackets where they join the great columnar trunk . The spreading crown is exposed to all the force of the hurricane , and while the trunk may be too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mighty spread of its snake - like roots , which run out so far that the diameter of the tree at the surface of the ground is some three or four times its height . No wind can upset such a tree , but with the great leverage of the long trunk it might snap just above the ground if it were not braced and guarded by the great buttresses . Every part of the tree helps to fit it for its peculiar habit , and once established it would seem to be pretty safe , but competition is so fierce that the silk-cotton is seldom able to live out its life and to die of old age . The thorns on the young tree and the smooth surface of the old one afford a good defence against attack from below , and few climbing plants or creepers try to ascend it ; but it is vulnerable above , and a host of plants has become adapted for reaching and clinging to its branches . The invisible spores of ferns and the microscopic seeds of orchids float in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branches like dust , and growing and dying there generation after generation build up a thick bed of rich fine soil , which becomes converted into an a*rial garden which would drive an orchid-fancier wild with envy and delight a botanist with its rich beauty . Those familiar with cultivated orchids will be able to form some picture of the top of a silk-cotton tree if they are told that great plants of Schomburgia stand in rows along the tops of the branches , sending their grand spikes of blossoms straight up to a height of five or six feet . Epidendrum fragrans and epidertdrwm cochleaturn also grow on the upper surface , and in such abundance that enough to load a hay-wagon might be forked off from a single tree . Along the sides of the branches hang the long narrow leaves and beautiful green and white flowers of Brassi cola cordata , while spikes two or three yards long , each one carrying hundreds of the brilliant orange flowers of Oneidiurn luridwrn , hang pendent below the branches . Top and sides and bottom are covered by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are carried by the birds great thickets of bromeliads and climbing arums spring up , and ropes of ( Jereus triangularis hang like great cables in loops covered with magnificent white blossoms . Beautiful and interesting as it is , no one except a naturalist would care to explore the top of a silk-cotton tree , for it swarms with ants , and wasps , and spiders , and scorpions , and biting and stinging things innumerable ; but a party of botanists and zoologists might live and work there , and find abundant supplies for their laboratory without leaving the tree-top . We found in Jamaica one little animal so interesting that it deserves a word or two to point out its position in a long chain of adaptations . The silk-cotton tree has become adapted for a life in the clear sky above the forest . The wild pineapple has become adapted for life on its branches , and it has learned to store up in the axils of its trough-shaped leaves all the rain it can catch , and to hold it in store for the dry season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in it , with many other interesting things , we found a remarkable tree-frog , with a most wonderful adaptation for life in the sky far from ponds or ditches . The presence of a tree-frog on the tree-top is a matter of course , but this one lays its eggs in the water of the wild pines , and instead of hatching into tadpoles , after the manner of frogs , they hatch into little frogs . While in the egg they have a tadpole 's tail , but as this is no longer needed for swimming it has been put to a new use as an embryonic breathing organ . We also found in the wild pines a little crab , which in course of ages has wandered up from the ocean to this strange new home . Sooner or later an evil fate comes to // the silk-cotton tree in the shape of some ungrateful bird , which carries up a wild fig to eat among its hospitable branches and carelessly lets fall a seed or two . A little fig-seed seems a small matter to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , and it finally lays in ruins the giant which has withstood the hurricanes for centuries . The history of the parasitic fig-tree is another striking example of the lively and interesting character of the habits of tropical plants , for it is as obviously adapted as any animal for making its place in the world . After it has grown for a while in the soil on the branch it drops a root which goes straight down , like a fish-line , perhaps for a hundred feet or more , until it strikes the ground , and gathers strength for another effort . Soon a tangle of roots of all sizes hangs like a net around the trunk , and as these grow they twine and twist until the tree is firmly locked in a knotted coil , from which there is no escape . It is as helpless as a rabbit in the folds of an anaconda , and it is slowly but surely strangled and killed . At last its top is snapped off from the rotting trunk and falls in a shapeless ugly ruin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood . 5iIk-cotton I ree-tall Torm.
