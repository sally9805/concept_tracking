txt The Marquis de Apeztequia , leader of the Conservative Party ( or Assimilists , as they are called , ) in Cuba , who is said to have brought about the recall of Weyler by the ? Spanish Government , arrived in this city yesterday on the French Line steamship La Champagne . He came from Madrid , and is on his way back to Cuba . The Marquis speaks English with an almost imperceptible accent . He was born in Cuba , but from 1850 to 1832 lived in this city at 1 Washington Square . He is visiting at the home of his mother-in-law , Mrs. Vincent , 18 East Ninety-second Street , and will leave for Havana the latter part of this week . Questioned about the situation in ' Cuba he said : " As I have not been in Cuba for nearly a year , I have little knowledge of how matters stand there at present , but my opinion is that the situation is much better than it was when I left Havana last January . One of my objects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated in that country . Another was to say something in regard to the course Gen. Weyler was pursuing in his efforts to put down the insurrection . Gen. Weyler did not deserve the abuse nor all the criticism he has received , but I did not agree with him as to his methodo . He did not associate the ener ? gies of the island with his military force . He had a. strong belief in the power of his army , and depended upon that power alone . Do I believe he was barbarous in his methods ? Oh , no ! I would not say he was a cruel man , or was intentionally responsible for cruelties . But a General , in waging such a war , finds it difficult  --  perhaps impossible  --  to avoid the perpetration of cruelties by his army when these cruelties are practiced so extensively by the other side . He had never attained to much prominence before he was sent to Cuba to relieve Martinez Campos . It was the best opportunity he had ever had to distinguish himself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important a one as it would be now . He had never risen to such a. high place in the Spanish Army . In fact , before he was sent to suppress this insurrection he was not considered such a , very big man in Spain . Blanco Likely to be Successful . " Gen. Blanco is a good soldier , and I think and hope he will carry out a better policy than that of his predecessor . I believe under his direction the war will be brought to a close this Winter , excepting perhaps as far as a few straggling bands of little ccnsequence are concerned . The revolutionists are nearer to laying down their arms than some people imagine . They are by no means the great majority of the people of Cuba , in spite of such an impression in some quarters . If they were , Spain might never be able to win her cause , for it would be a most difficult thing to accomplish on an island 1,400 miles away . But as it is , the enemy has grown weaker and weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is able to continue the struggle for Years . We have spent a great deal of money , it is true , and perhaps we have come to the end of certain resources , but we are by no means at the end of our tether . " The Marquis was , told of Hannis Taylor 's statement in his speech at Ithaca last Friday night that the hour had come for this country to recognize Cuba 's independence . " I am astonished , " said the Marquis . " I thought Mr. Taylor was a friend of ours . His recent article in one of your magazines hardly showed a gracious spirit . It was written , it seemed to me , with purely partisan motives . It was an argument for the Democratic Party . He sought to show that the co , trse this country , should take in Cuban affairs had been mapped out by Mr. Cleveland , and that Mr. had nothing to do but to follow his example . I knew Mr. Taylor in Spain . The impression he made then was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his lips . " The policy of autonomy , " continued the Marquis , " I do not believe in . I and the party I lead in Cuba were against it . In fact , we were thrown down In this matter . I believe the Sagasta laws will not have the desired effect . " The granting of autonomy is not the best way to bring about the pacification of Cuba . No Hostility to the United States . " There is no hostility to the United States in Spain . Of course , we feel that the sympathies of the majority of your people are against us , and we can hardly be pleased thereat , but the Governments in both your country and ours are trying to make the people feel that there is no reason for hostility . Of course , war may yet come between the two countries , but it is to be hoped that it will not . It would be a most unfortunate event . You are far richer than we , and you are a powerful country ; but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a decided doubt about the result . I can say with pride , because I am a Spaniard , that the people of Spain are a brave people , and when their pride is hurt they will fight to the last ditch . They would set material interests aside . They would spend their last peseta . Besides , our country is a strong one , and the war would not be so entirely one-sided as is imagined by some people . The probability is that it would bring about complications that would draw other countries into it . Whether a declaration by this country in favor of Cuba ' , s independence would inflame our people to declare war I can not say . The slightest thing coming at the same time with such a declaration might decide the question . " I have not come directly from Madrid , so the news I have from there is a little old . I staid awhile in Paris to visit relatives . I am going back to Cuba to resume the leadership of my party there . About this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion the insurrectionists will lose ground from now until the end of the war , which . as I have said , will probably come this Winter . I think the improvement in favor of Spain will be largely brought about by the change in the Captain Generalship. "
