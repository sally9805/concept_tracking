The Learned Phrenologist sat in his Office surrounded by his Whiskers . Now and then he put a Forefinger to his Brow and glanced at the Mirror to make sure that he still resembled William Cullen Bryant . Near him , on a Table , was a Pallid Head made of Plaster-of-Paris and stickily ornamented with small Labels . On the wall was a Chart showing that the Orangoutang does not have Daniel Webster 's facial angle . " Is the Graft played out ? " asked the Learned Phrenologist , as he waited . " Is Science up against it or What ? " Then he heard the fall of Heavy Feet and resumed his Imitation . The Door opened and there came into the Room a tall , rangy Person with a Head in the shape of a Rocky Ford Cantaloupe . Aroused from his Meditation , the Learned Phrenologist looked up at the Stranger as through a Glass , darkly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy Mark collapsed into the Boarding-House Chair and the Man with more Whiskers than Darwin ever saw stood behind Him and ran his Fingers over his Head , Tarantula-Wise . Illustration : THE LEARNED PHRENOLOGIST " Well , well ! " said the Learned Phrenologist " Enough Benevolence here to do a family of Eight . Courage ? I guess yes ! Dewey 's got the same kind of a Lump right over the Left Ear . Love of Home and Friends  --  like the ridge behind a Bunker ! Firmness  --  out of sight ! Reverence  --  well , when it comes to Reverence , you 're certainly There with the Goods ! Conscientiousness , Hope , and Ideality  --  the Limit ! And as for Metaphysical Penetration  --  oh , Say , the Metaphysical Penetration , right where you part the Hair  --  oh , Laura ! Say , you 've got Charles Eliot Norton whipped to a Custard . I 've got my Hand on it now . You can feel it yourself , ca n't you ? " " I can feel Something , " replied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUMAN BEING " Wit , Compassion and Poetic Talent  --  right here where I 've got my Thumb  --  a Cinch ! I think you 'll run as high as 98 per cent on all the Intellectual Faculties . In your Case we have a Rare Combination of Executive Ability , or the Power to Command , and those Qualities of Benevolence and Ideality which contribute to the fostering of Permanent Religious Sentiment . I do n't know what your present Occupation is , but you ought to be President of a Theological Seminary . Kindly slip me Three Dollars before you Pass Out . " The Tall Man separated himself from Two Days ' Pay and then went out on the Street and pushed People off the Sidewalk , He thought so well of Himself . Thereafter , as before , he drove a Truck , but he was always glad to know that he could have been President of a Theological Seminary . Moral : A good Jolly is worth Whatever you Pay for it . THE FABLE OF THE SLIM GIRL WHO TRIED TO KEEP A DATE THAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim Girl with a Forehead which was Shiny and Protuberant , like a Bartlett Pear . When asked to put Something in an Autograph Album she invariably wrote the Following , in a tall , dislocated Back-Hand : " Life is Real ; life is Earnest , And the Grave is not its Goal . " That 's the kind of a Girl she was . In her own Town she had the Name of being a Cold Proposition , but that was because the Primitive Yokels of a One-Night Stand could not Attune Themselves to the Views of one who was troubled with Ideals . Her Soul Panted for the Higher Life . Alas , the Rube Town in which she Hung Forth was given over to Croquet , Mush and Milk Sociables , a lodge of Elks and two married Preachers who doctored for the Tonsilitis . So what could the Poor Girl do ? In all the Country around there was not a Man who came up to her Plans and Specifications for a Husband . Neither was there any Man who had any time for Her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One  --  the Ideal . He was a big and pensive Literary Man , wearing a Prince Albert coat , a neat Derby Hat and godlike Whiskers . When He came he would enfold Her in his Arms and whisper Emerson 's Essays to her . Illustration : COLD PROPOSITION But the Party failed to show up . Often enough she put on her Chip Hat and her Black Lisle Gloves and Sauntered down to look at the Gang sitting in front of the Occidental Hotel , hoping that the Real Thing would be there . But she always saw the same old line of Four-Flush Drummers from Chicago and St. Louis , smoking Horrid Cigars and talking about the Percentages of the League Teams . She knew that these Gross Creatures were not prone to chase mere Intellectual Splendor , so she made no effort to Flag them . Illustration : FOUR-FLUSH DRUMMER When she was Thirty-Four years of age and was able to recite " Lucile " without looking at the Book she was Married to a Janitor of the name of Ernest . He had been kicked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he read in the Sunday Papers . His pay was Twenty-Three a month , which was high , if you knew Ernest . His Wife wore a red Mother Hubbard all during the Remainder of her Life . This is invariably a Sign of Blasted Hopes . MORAL : Never Live in a Jay Town . THE FABLE OF THE NEW YORK PERSON WHO GAVE THE STAGE FRIGHT TO FOSTORIA , OHIO A New York man went to visit a Cousin in the Far West . The name of the Town was Fostoria , Ohio . When he came into Town he had his Watch-Chain on the outside of his Coat , and his Pink Spats were the first ever seen in Fostoria . " Have you a Manicure Parlor in this Beastly Hole ? " asked the New York Man , as they walked up from the Train . " What 's that ? " asked the Cousin , stepping on his own Feet . " Great Heavens ! " exclaimed the New York Man , and was silent for several Moments . At Dinner he called for Artichokes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , very well , " in a Tone of Chastened Resignation . After Dinner he took the Family into the Parlor , and told the Members how much they would Enjoy going to Weber and Fields ' . Seeing a Book on the Table , he sauntered up to It and said , " Ah , one of Dick Davis ' Things . " Later in the Evening he visited the only Club House in Town . The Local Editor of the Evening Paper was playing Pin-Pool with the Superintendent of the Trolley Line . When the New York Man came into the Room , they began to Tremble and fell down on their Shots . Illustration : NEW YORK MAN The Manager of the Hub and Spoke Factory then asked the New York Man to have a Drink . The New York Man wondered if a Small Bottle was already cold . They said Yes , but it was a Lie . The Boy had to go out for it . He found One that had been in the Window of the Turf Exchange since the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New York Man drank it , remarking that it was hardly as Dry as he usually got it at Martin 's . The Club Members looked at Him and said Nothing . They thought he meant Bradley-Martin 's . Next Day the New York Man was Interviewed by the Local Editor . He said the West had a Great Future . In the Evening he attended the Annual Dinner of the Bicycle Club , and went Home early because the Man sitting next to him put Ice in his Claret . Illustration : SNAKE CHARMER In due time he returned to New York , and Fostoria took off its White Shirt . Some Weeks after that , the Cousin of the New York Man had an Opportunity to visit the Metropolis . He rode on an Extra Ticket with a Stockman who was shipping three Car-Load of Horses , and got a Free Ticket for every Car-Load . When the Cousin arrived at New York he went to the address , and found the New York Man at Dinner . There was a Sheaf of Celery on the Table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At his right was a Large Woman in a Flowered Wrapper  --  she had been Weeping . At his left was a Snake-Charmer from Huber 's Museum . The New York Man asked the Cousin to wait Outside , and then explained that he was stopping there Temporarily . That Evening they went to Proctor 's , and stood during the Performance . MORAL : A New York Man never begins to Cut Ice until he is west of Rahway . THE FABLE OF THE KID WHO SHIFTED HIS IDEAL An A.D.T . Kid carrying a Death Message marked " Rush " stopped in front of a Show Window containing a Picture of James J. Jeffries and began to weep bitterly . A kind-hearted Suburbanite happened to be passing along on his Way to the 5:42 Train . He was carrying a Dog Collar , a Sickle , a Basket of Egg Plums and a Bicycle Tire . The Suburbanite saw the A.D.T . Kid in Tears and it struck him that here was a Bully Chance to act out the Kind-Hearted Pedestrian who is always played up strong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you weep ? " he asked , peering at the Boy through his concavo-convex Nose Glasses . " Oh , gee ! I was just Thinking , " replied the Urchin , brokenly . " I was just Thinking what chance have I got to grow up and be the Main Stem , like Mr. Jeffries . " Illustration : THE KID " What a perverted Ambition ! " exclaimed the Suburbanite . " Why do you set up Mr. Jeffries as an Ideal ? Why do you not strive to be like Me ? Is it not worth a Life of Endeavor to command the Love and Respect of a Moral Settlement on the Outskirts ? All the Conductors on our Division speak pleasantly to Me , and the Gateman has come to know my Name . Last year I had my Half-Tone in the Village Weekly for the mere Cost of the Engraving . When we opened Locust avenue from the Cemetery west to Alexander 's Dairy , was I not a Member of the Committee appointed to present the Petition to the Councilmen ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Member of the League of American Wheelmen and now I am a Candidate for Director of our new four-hole Golf Club . Also I play Whist on the Train with a Man who once lived in the same House with T. DeWitt Talmage . " Hearing these words the A.D.T . Kid ceased weeping and cheerfully proceeded up an Alley , where he played " Wood Tag . " MORAL : As the Twig is Bent the Tree is Inclined . THE FABLE OF THE BASE BALL FAN WHO TOOK THE ONLY KNOWN CURE Once upon a Time a Base Ball Fan lay on his Death-Bed . He had been a Rooter from the days of Underhand Pitching . It was simply Pie for him to tell in what year Anse began to play with the Rockfords and what Kelly 's Batting Average was the Year he sold for Ten Thousand . If you asked him who played Center for Boston in 1886 he could tell you quick  --  right off the Reel . And he was a walking Directory of all the Glass Arms in the Universe . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Umpire and then yelled " Robber " until his Pipes gave out . For many Summers he would come Home , one Evening after Another , with his Collar melted , and tell his Wife that the Giants made the Colts look like a lot of Colonial Dames playing Bean Bag in a Weedy Lot back of an Orphan Asylum , and they ought to put a Trained Nurse on Third , and the Dummy at Right needed an Automobile , and the New Man could n't jump out of a Boat and hit the Water , and the Short-Stop would n't be able to pick up a Ball if it was handed to him on a Platter with Water Cress around it , and the Easy One to Third that ought to have been Sponge Cake was fielded like a One-Legged Man with St. Vitus dance trying to do the Nashville Salute . Illustration : THE FAN Of course she never knew what he was Talking about , but she put up with it , Year after Year , mixing Throat Gargle for him and reading the Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wear a Green Shade . At last he came to his Ninth Inning and there were Two Strikes called and no Balls , and his Friends knew it was All Day with him . They stood around and tried to forget that he was a Fan . His Wife wept softly and consoled herself with the Thought that possibly he would have amounted to Something if there had been no National Game . She forgave Everything and pleaded for one Final Message . His Lips moved . She leaned over and Listened . He wanted to know if there was Anything in the Morning Papers about the Condition of Bill Lange 's Knee . MORAL : There is a Specific Bacillus for every Classified Disease . THE FABLE OF THE GOOD FAIRY WITH THE LORGNETTE , AND WHY SHE GOT IT GOOD Once Upon a Time there was a Broad Girl who had nothing else to do and no Children to look after , so she thought she would be Benevolent . She had scared all the Red Corpuscles out of the 2 by 4 Midget who rotated about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her Husband . He was Soft for her , and so she got it Mapped out with Herself that she was a Superior Woman . She knew that when she switched the Current on to herself she Used up about 6,000 Ohms an hour , and the whole Neighborhood had to put on Blinders . She had read about nine Subscription Books with Cupid and Dove Tail-Pieces and she believed that she could get away with any Topic that was batted up to her and then slam it over to Second in time to head off the Runner . Her clothes were full of Pin-Holes where she had been hanging Medals on Herself , and she used to go in a Hand-Ball Court every Day and throw up Bouquets , letting them bounce back and hit Her . Illustration : THE MIDGET Also , She would square off in front of a Camera every Two Weeks , and the Man was Next , for he always removed the Mole when he was touching up the Negative . In the Photograph the Broad Girl resembled Pauline Hall , but outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she showed up on the Level , she looked like a Street just before they put on the Asphalt . But never you Fear , She thought She had Julia Arthur and Mary Mannering Seventeen up and One to play , so far as Good Looks were concerned ; and when it came to the Gray Matter  --  the Cerebrum , the Cerebellum , and the Medulla Oblongata  --  May Wright Sewall was back of the Flag and Pulled up Lame . The Down-Trodden Man , whom she had dragged to the Altar , sized Her all right , but he was afraid of his Life . He was n't Strong enough to push Her in front of a Cable Car , and he did n't have the Nerve to get a Divorce . So he stood for Everything ; but in the Summer , when She skated off into the Woods to hear a man with a Black Alpaca Coat lecture to the High Foreheads about the Subverted Ego , he used to go out with a few Friends and tell them his Troubles and weep into his Beer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a Nice Woman ; but he knew better . Annyhow , as Bobby Gaylor used to say , she became restless around the House , with nothing to do except her Husband , so she made up her mind to be Benevolent to beat the Band . She decided that she would allow the Glory of her Presence to burst upon the Poor and the Uncultured . It would be a Big Help to the Poor and Uncultured to see what a Real Razmataz Lady was like . She did n't Propose to put on Old Clothes , and go and live with Poor People , and be One of Them , and nurse their Sick , as they do in Settlements . Not on Your Previous Existence ! She was going to be Benevolent , and be Dead Swell at the Same Time . Accordingly , she would Lace Herself until she was the shape of a Bass Viol , and put on her Tailor-Made , and the Hat that made her Face seem longer , and then she would Gallop forth to do Things to the Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Smelling-Bottle in the Other . " Now , " she would say , feeling Behind to make sure that she was all strung up , " Now , to carry Sunshine into the Lowly Places . " Illustration : THE BROAD GIRL As soon as she struck the Plank Walks , and began stalking her prey , the small Children would crawl under the Beds , while Mother would dry her Arms on the Apron , and murmur , " Glory be ! " They knew how to stand off the Rent-Man and the Dog-Catcher ; but when 235 pounds of Sunshine came wafting up the Street , they felt that they were up against a New Game . The Benevolent Lady would go into a House numbered 1135A with a Marking Brush , and after she had sized up the front room through the Lorgnette , she would say : " My Good Woman , does your Husband drink ? " " Oh , yes , sir , " the grateful Woman would reply . " That is , when he 's working . He gets a Dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his Money ? " the Benevolent Lady would ask . " I think he plays the Stock Market , " would be the Reply . Then the Benevolent Lady would say : " When the Unfortunate Man comes Home this Evening you tell him that a Kind and Beautiful Lady called and asked him please to stop Drinking , except a Glass of Claret at Dinner , and to be sure and read Eight or Ten Pages from the Encyclopaedia Britannica each Night before retiring ; also tell him to be sure and save his Money . Is that your Child under the Bed ? " " That 's little William J. " " How Many have you ? " " Eight or Nine  --  I forget Which . " " Be sure and dress them in Sanitary Underwear ; you can get it for Four Dollars a Suit . Will you be good enough to have the Little Boy come from under the Bed , and spell ' Ibex ' for the Sweet Lady ? " " He 's afraid of you . " " Kindly explain to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the Offspring of an Obscure and Ignorant Workingman , while I am probably the Grandest Thing that ever Swept up the Boulevard . I must go now , but I will Return . Next time I come I hope to hear that your Husband has stopped Drinking and is very Happy . Tell the Small Person under the Bed that if he learns to spell ' Ibex ' by the time I call again I will let him look at my Rings . As for you , bear in mind that it is no Disgrace to be Poor ; it is simply Inconvenient ; that 's all . " Having delivered herself of these Helpful Remarks she would Duck , and the Uplifted Mother would put a Nickel in the Can and send Lizzie over to the Dutchman 's . In this manner the Benevolent Lady carried forward the Good Work , and Dazzled the whole Region between O'Hara 's Box Factory and the City Dump . It did n't Cost anything , and she derived much Joy from the Knowledge that Hundreds of People were Rubbering at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't she the Smooth Article ? " But one day a Scrappy Kid , whose Mother did n't have any Lorgnette or Diamond Ear-Bobs , spotted the Benevolent Lady . The Benevolent Lady had been in the House telling his Mother that it was a Glorious Privilege to wash for a Living . After the Benevolent Lady went away the Kid 's Mother sat down and had a Good Cry , and the Scrappy Kid thought it was up to him . He went out to the Alley and found a Tomato Can that was not working , and he waited . In a little while the Benevolent Lady came out of a Basement , in which she had been telling a Polish Family to look at her and be Happy . The Scrappy Kid let drive , and the Tomato Can struck the Benevolent Lady between the Shoulder Blades . She squawked and started to run , fell over a Garbage Box , and had to be picked up by a Policeman . She went Home in a Cab , and told her Husband that the Liquor League had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Drunkards . That settled it with her  --  she said she would n't try to be Benevolent any more  --  so she joined an Ibsen Club . The Scrappy Kid grew up to be a Corrupt Alderman , and gave his Mother plenty of Good Clothes , which she was always afraid to wear . MORAL : In uplifting , get underneath . THE FABLE OF THE UNINTENTIONAL HEROES OF CENTREVILLE In Centreville there lived two husky Young Fellows named Bill and Schuyler  --  commonly abbreviated to Schuy . They did not find any nourishing Excitement in a Grain Elevator , so they Enlisted to Free Cuba . The Government gave each of them a Slouch Hat and a prehistoric Firearm . They tied Red Handkerchiefs around their Necks and started for the Front , each with his Head out of the Car Window . They gave the Sioux Yell to everybody along the Track between Centreville and Tampa . While in Camp they played Double Pedie , smoked Corn-Cob Pipes , and cussed the Rations . They referred to the President of these United States as " Mac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Old Alger . " After more or less Delay they went aboard a Boat , and were landed in Cuba , where they began to Shoot at everything that looked Foreign . The hot Rain drenched them , and the tropical Sun steamed them ; they had Mud on their clothes , and had to sleep out . When they were unusually Tired and Hungry , they would sing Coon Songs and Roast the War Department . At last they were ordered Home . On the way back they did n't think of Anything except their two Lady Friends , who worked in the Centreville Steam Laundry . Illustration : SCHUY They rode into Town with a Machete under each Arm , and their Pockets full of Mauser Cartridges . The first Thing they saw when they alighted from the Train was a Brass Band . It began to play , " See the Conquering Hero Comes . " Then eight Little Girls in White began to strew Flowers in their Pathway . The Artillery company ripped out a Salute . Cap Gibbs , who won his Title by owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confronted them with a Red , White , and Blue Sash around him . He Barked in a loud Voice  --  it was something about Old Glory . Afterward the Daughters of the Revolution took them in Tow , and escorted them to Pythian Hall , where they were given Fried Chicken , Veal Loaf , Deviled Eggs , Crullers , Preserved Watermelon , Cottage Cheese , Sweet Pickles , Grape Jelly , Soda Biscuit , Stuffed Mangoes , Lemonade , Hickory-Nut Cake , Cookies , Cinnamon Roll , Lemon Pie , Ham , Macaroons , New York Ice Cream , Apple Butter , Charlotte Russe , Peppermint Wafers , and Coffee . While they were Feeding , the Sons of Veterans Quartet stood on the Rostrum with their Heads together , and sang : " Ten-ting to-night ! Ten-ting to-night , Ten-ting on the old-ah Camp-ground ! " At the first opportunity Bill motioned to Schuyler , and led him into the Anteroom , where they kept the Regalia , the Kindling Wood , and the Mop . " Say , Schuy , what the Sam Hill does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That 's what Everybody says . " " Do you Believe it ? " " No matter what I Believe ; I 'm goin ' to let ' em have their own Way . I may want to Run for Supervisor some Day . " MORAL : If it is your Play to be a Hero , do n't Renig . THE FABLE OF THE PARENTS WHO TINKERED WITH THE OFFSPRING A married Couple possessed two Boys named Joseph and Clarence . Joseph was much the older . His Parents brought him up on a Plan of their Own . They would not permit him to play with other Boys for fear that he would soil himself ; and learn to be Rude and Boisterous . So they kept Him in the House , and : his Mother read to him about Little Rollo , who never lied or cheated , and who grew up to be a Bank President , She seemed to think that a Bank President was above Reproach . Little Joseph was kept away from the Public Schools , and had to Play Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned Tatting and the Herring-Bone Stitch . When he was Ten Years of age he could play Chop-Sticks on the Piano ; his Ears were Translucent , and his Front Teeth showed like those of a Gray Squirrel . The other Boys used to make Faces at him over the Back Fence and call him " Sis . " In Due Time he went to College , where he proved to be a Lobster . The Boys held him under the Pump the first Night . When he walked across the Campus , they would whistle , " I do n't Want to Play in Your Yard . " He began to drink Manhattan Cocktails , and he smoked Hemp Cigarettes until he was Dotty . One Day he ran away with a Girl who waited on the Table at his Boarding House , and his Parents Cast him Off . At Present he has charge of the Cloak Room at a Dairy Lunch . Illustration : JOSEPH Seeing that the Home Training Experiment had been a Failure in the case of Joseph , the Parents decided to give Clarence a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Snares and Temptations of the World while he was Young , and thus be Prepared to side-step the Pitfalls when he was Older . They sent him to the Public Schools ; they allowed him to roam at large with other Kids , and stay out at Nights ; they kept Liquor on the Sideboard . Illustration : CLARENCE Clarence stood in with the Toughest Push in Town , and thus became acquainted with the Snares and Temptations of the World . He learned to Chew Tobacco and Spit through his Teeth , shoot Craps and Rush the Can . When his Father suggested that he enter some Business House , and become a Credit to the Family , he growled like a Boston Terrier , and told his Father to go Chase Himself . At present , he is working the Shells with a Circus . MORAL : It all depends . THE FABLE OF HOW HE NEVER TOUCHED GEORGE A comic Lover named George was sitting on the Front Porch with a good Side Hold on your old friend Mabel . They were looking into each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nursery Talk . It was the kind of Conversation calculated to Jar a Person . George murmured that Mabel was George 's own Baby-Daby and she Allowed that he was a Tooney-Wooney little Bad Boy to hold his Itsy-Bitsy Bun of a Mabel so tight she could hardly breave . It was a sort of Dialogue that Susan B. Anthony would love to sit up Nights to Read . While they were Clinched , Mabel 's Father , a large , Self-Made Man , came down the Stairway and out to the Veranda . This is where the Fable begins to Differentiate . Although the Girl 's name was Mabel and the Young Man 's name was George , and the Father was a Self-Made Man , the Father did not Kick the Young Man . He asked him if he had Anything to Smoke . George gave him an Imported Panetella and said He did n't believe it was going to Rain . Mabel 's Father said it looked Black in the West , but he Reckoned it might blow around , like as not . Mabel said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Illustration : MABEL 'S FATHER Mabel 's Father told Mabel she could show George where the Ice-Box wuz in case he Expressed a Hankerin ' , and then he went down street to examine some Fishing Tackle just purchased by a Friend of his in the Hay and Feed Business . Just as Father struck the Cement Walk George changed to the Strangle Hold . MORAL : The Exception proves the Rule . THE FABLE OF THE PREACHER WHO FLEW HIS KITE , BUT NOT BECAUSE HE WISHED TO DO SO A certain Preacher became wise to the Fact that he was not making a Hit with his Congregation . The Parishioners did not seem inclined to seek him out after services and tell him he was a Pansy . He suspected that they were Rapping him on the Quiet . The Preacher knew there must be Something wrong with his Talk . He had been trying to Expound in a clear and straightforward Manner , omitting Foreign Quotations , setting up for illustration of his Points such Historical Characters as were familiar to his Hearers , putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather flying low along the Intellectual Plane of the Aggregation that chipped in to pay his Salary . But the Pew-Holders were not tickled . They could Understand everything he said , and they began to think he was Common . So he studied the Situation and decided that if he wanted to Win them and make everybody believe he was a Nobby and Boss Minister he would have to hand out a little Guff . He fixed it up Good and Plenty . Illustration : GUFF On the following Sunday Morning he got up in the Lookout and read a Text that did n't mean anything , read from either Direction , and then he sized up his Flock with a Dreamy Eye and said : " We can not more adequately voice the Poetry and Mysticism of our Text than in those familiar Lines of the great Icelandic Poet , Ikon Navrojk : " To hold is not to have  --  Under the seared Firmament , Where Chaos sweeps , and Vast Futurity Sneers at these puny Aspirations  --  There is the full Reprisal . " When the Preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked downward , breathing heavily through his Nose , like Camille in the Third Act . A Stout Woman in the Front Row put on her Eye-Glasses and leaned forward so as not to miss Anything . A Venerable Harness Dealer over at the Right nodded his Head solemnly . He seemed to recognize the Quotation . Members of the Congregation glanced at one another as if to say : " This is certainly Hot Stuff ! " Illustration : GOOD AND PLENTY The Preacher wiped his Brow and said he had no Doubt that every one within the Sound of his Voice remembered what Quarolius had said , following the same Line of Thought . It was Quarolius who disputed the Contention of the great Persian Theologian Ramtazuk , that the Soul in its reaching out after the Unknowable was guided by the Spiritual Genesis of Motive rather than by mere Impulse of Mentality . The Preacher did n't know what all This meant , and he did n't care , but you can rest easy that the Pew-Holders were On in a minute . He talked it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxane so Dizzy that she nearly falls off the Piazza . Illustration : VENERABLE HARNESS DEALER The Parishioners bit their Lower Lips and hungered for more First-Class Language . They had paid their Money for Tall Talk and were prepared to solve any and all Styles of Delivery . They held on to the Cushions and seemed to be having a Nice Time . The Preacher quoted copiously from the Great Poet Amebius . He recited 18 lines of Greek and then said : " How true this is ! " And not a Parishioner batted an Eye . It was Amebius whose Immortal Lines he recited in order to prove the Extreme Error of the Position assumed in the Controversy by the Famous Italian , Polenta . He had them Going , and there was n't a Thing to it . When he would get tired of faking Philosophy he would quote from a Celebrated Poet of Ecuador or Tasmania or some other Seaport Town . Compared with this Verse , all of which was of the same School as the Icelandic Masterpiece , the most obscure and clouded Passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Street Candy Store just after the Colored Boy gets through using the Chamois . After that he became Eloquent , and began to get rid of long Boston Words that had n't been used before that Season . He grabbed a rhetorical Roman Candle in each Hand and you could n't see him for the Sparks . After which he sunk his Voice to a Whisper and talked about the Birds and the Flowers . Then , although there was no Cue for him to Weep , he shed a few real Tears . And there was n't a dry Glove in the Church . After he sat down he could tell by the Scared Look of the People in Front that he had made a Ten-Strike . Did they give him the Joyous Palm that Day ? Sure ! The Stout Lady could not control her Feelings when she told how much the Sermon had helped her . The venerable Harness Dealer said he wished to indorse the Able and Scholarly Criticism of Polenta . In fact , every one said the Sermon was Superfine and Dandy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it wished to retain such a Whale it might have to Boost his Salary .

But no one had the Face to step up and confess his Ignorance of these Celebrities . The Pew-Holders did n't even admit among themselves that the Preacher had rung in some New Ones .

MORAL : Give the People what they Think they want . THE FABLE OF HANDSOME JETHRO , WHO WAS SIMPLY CUT OUT TO BE A MERCHANT An Illinois Squab came home from Business College with a Zebra Collar and a pair of Tan Shoes big enough for a Coal Miner . When he alighted from the depot one of Ezry Folloson 's Dray Horses fell over , stricken with the Cramp Colic . The usual Drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Train got in and out all right backed away from the Educated Youth and Chewed their Tobacco in Shame and Abashment . They knew that they did not belong on the same Platform with One who had been up yender in Chicago for goin ' on Twelve weeks finding out how to be a Business Man . By Heck ! An elderly Man approached the Youth who had lately got next to the Rules of Commerce . The elderly Man was a Yap . He wore a Hickory Shirt , a discouraged Straw Hat , a pair of Barn-Door Pants clinging to one lonely Gallus and woolen Socks that had settled down over his Plow Shoes . He was shy several Teeth and on his Chin was a Tassel shaped like a Whisk-Broom . If you had thrown a Pebble into this Clump of Whiskers probably you would have scared up a Field Mouse and a couple of Meadow Larks . " Home agin , Jethro , be ye ? " asked the Parent .

The Business Man went Home , and the Parent followed at a Respectful Distance , now and then remarking to Himself : " Well , I 'll jest swan to Guinney ! " Brother Lyford came in from the East Eighty to get his Dinner , and there was Jethro in the Hammock reading a Great Work by Archibald Clavering Gunter . " Git into some Overhauls an ' come an ' he'p Me this Afternoon , " said Lyford . " Oh , rats ! Not on your Tintype ! I 'm too strong to work , " replied Jethro , who had learned Oodles of slang up in Chicago , do n't you forget it . Illustration : PAW So he would n't Stand for the Harvest Field that afternoon . In the Evening when Paw ast him to Milk he let out an Awful Beller . Next Morning he made a Horrible Beef because he could n't get Loaf Sugar for his Coffee . Shortly after Breakfast his Paw lured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good Holt on the Adam 's Apple and choked the Offspring until his Tongue stuck out like a Pistil . " You dosh-burned little Pin-Head o ' Misery , you ! " exclaimed the Old Man . " Goll bing me if I think you 're wuth the Powder to blow you up . You peel them Duds an ' git to Work or else mosey right off o ' this Farm . " The Son 's Feelings were so outraged by this Brutal Treatment that he left the Farm that Day and accepted a position in a Five and Ten-Cent Store , selling Kitchen Utensils that were made of Tin-Foil and Wooden Ware that had been painted in Water Colors . He felt that he was particularly adapted for a Business Career , and , anyway , he did n't propose to go out on No Man 's Farm and sweat down his Collar . After Ten Years of Unremitting Application and Studious Frugality the Business Man had acquired in Real Estate , Personal Property , Stocks , Bonds , Negotiable Paper , and other Collateral , the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that .

MORAL : Drink Deep , or Cut Out the Pierian Spring Altogether . THE FABLE OF PADUCAH 'S FAVORITE COMEDIANS AND THE MILDEWED STUNT Once Upon a Time there was a Specialty Team doing Seventeen Minutes . The Props used in the Act included a Hatchet , a Brick , a Seltzer Bottle , two inflated Bladders and a Slap-Stick . The Name of the Team was Zoroaster and Zendavesta . These two Troupers began their Professional Career with a Road Circus , working on Canvas in the Morning , and then doing a Refined Knockabout in the Grand Concert or Afterpiece taking place in the Main Arena immediately after the big Show is over . When each of them could Kick Himself in the Eye and Slattery had pickled his Face so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too good to show under a Round Top , so they became Artists . They wanted a Swell Name for the Team , so the Side-Show Announcer , who was something of a Kidder and had attended a Unitarian College , gave them Zoroaster and Zendavesta . They were Stuck on it , and had a Job Printer do some Cards for them . By utilizing two of Pat Rooney 's Songs and stealing a few Gags , they put together Seventeen Minutes and began to play Dates and Combinations . Zoroaster bought a Cane with a Silver Dog 's Head on it , and Zendavesta had a Watch Charm that pulled the Buttonholes out of his Vest . Illustration : ZOROASTER After every Show , as soon as they Washed Up , they went and stood in front of the Theater , so as to give the Hired Girls a Treat , or else they stood around in the Sawdust and told their Fellow-Workers in the Realm of Dramatic Art how they killed ' em in Decatur and had ' em hollerin ' in Lowell , Mass. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occasionally they would put a Card in the Clipper , saying that they were the Best in the Business , Bar None , and Good Dressers on and off the Stage .

Lillian Russell was jealous of them and they used to know Francis Wilson when he done a Song and Dance . They had a Scrap Book with a Clipping from a Paducah Paper , which said that they were better than Nat Goodwin . When some Critic who had been bought up by Rival Artists wrote that Zoroaster and Zendavesta ought to be on an Ice Wagon instead of on the Stage , they would get out the Scrap Book and read that Paducah Notice and be thankful that all Critics was n't Cheap Knockers and that there was one Paper Guy in the United States that reckanized a Neat Turn when he seen it . But Zoroaster and Zendavesta did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a Burgoo Picnic the Day the Actors came to Town , and did n't get back until Midnight , so he wrote his Notice of the Night Owls ' performance from a Programme brought to him by the Head Usher at the Opera House , who was also Galley Boy at the Office . Zoroaster and Zendavesta played the same Sketch for Seventeen Years and made only two important Changes in all that Time . During the Seventh Season Zoroaster changed his Whiskers from Green to Blue . At the beginning of the Fourteenth Year of the Act they bought a new Slap-Stick and put a Card in the Clipper warning the Public to beware of Imitators . Illustration : ZENDAVESTA All during the Seventeen Years Zoroaster and Zendavesta continued to walk Chesty and tell People how Good they were . They never could Understand why the Public stood for Mansfield when it could get Zoroaster and Zendavesta . The Property Man gave it as his Opinion that Mansfield conned the Critics . Zendavesta said there was only one Critic on the Square , and he was at Paducah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their Paducah Scrap Book over to a Manager , and he Booked them . Zoroaster assured the Manager that Him and his Partner done a Refined Act , suitable for Women and Children , with a strong Finish , which had been the Talk of all Galveston . The Manager put them in between the Trained Ponies and a Legit with a Bad Cold . When a Legit loses his Voice he goes into Vodeville . Zoroaster and Zendavesta came on very Cocky , and for the 7,800th Time Zoroaster asked Zendavesta : " Who wuz it I seen you comin ' up the Street with ? " Then , for the 7,800th Time , by way of Mirth-Provoking Rejoinder , Zendavesta kicked Zoroaster in the Stomach , after which the Slap-Stick was introduced as a Sub-Motive . The Manager gave a Sign and the Stage Hands Closed in on the Best Team in the Business , Bar None . Of course Zoroaster and Zendavesta were very sore at having their Act killed . They said it was no way to treat Artists . The Manager told them they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Themselves set back into the Supper Show . Then They saw through the whole Conspiracy . The Manager was Mansfield 's Friend and Mansfield was out with his Hammer . At Present they are doing Two Supper Turns to the Piano Player and a Day Watchman . They are still the Best in the Business , but are being used Dead Wrong . However , they derive some Comfort from reading the Paducah Notice . MORAL : A Dramatic Editor should never go to a Burgoo Picnic  --  especially in Kentucky . THE FABLE OF FLORA AND ADOLPH AND A HOME GONE WRONG One morning a Modern Solomon , who had been chosen to preside as Judge in a Divorce Mill , climbed to his Perch and unbuttoned his Vest for the Wearisome Grind . He noticed that the first Case looming up on the Docket was that of Flora Botts vs . Adolph Botts . The Applicant , Mrs. Botts , and Adolph , the Other Half of the Domestic Sketch , were already inside the Railing , each attempting to look the other out of Countenance . " Break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if you were at Home . Now , what has Adolph been doing ? " It seemed that she alleged Cruelty , Neglect , Inhuman Treatment , Violent Temper , Threats , etc. , etc . " We have no Chills-and-Fever Music to lend Effect to the Sad Narrative you are about to Spring , " said the Judge , looking down at the Plaintiff , who belonged to the Peroxide Tribe . " Furthermore , we will take it for granted that when you first met Defendant your Innocence and Youth made it a Walkaway for his Soft Approaches , and that you had every Reason to believe that he was a Perfect Gentleman . Having disposed of these Preliminaries , let us have the Plot of the Piece . " So she told her Story in a Tremulous , Viola Allen kind of Voice , while her Lawyer wept . Illustration : MODERN SOLOMON He was ready to Weep for anyone who would hand him $8 . Afterthought  --  make it $7.50 . It was a Dark Tale of how Botts , the Viperish Defendant , had Sneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of Callers , and nagged her with Sarcastic Comments until her Tender Sensibilities had been worn to a Frazzle . Then the Defendant went on the Stand and entered a General Denial . He had been all that a Rattling Good Husband could be , but she had been a regular Rudyard Kipling Vampire . She had continued to make his Life one lingering Day-After of Regret . His Record for Patience and Long-Suffering had made Job 's Performance look like an Amateur 's Half-Try . Illustration : THE VIPER " There is more in this Case than appears on the Surface , " said the Modern Solomon . " In order to fix the Blame we shall have to dig up the First Cause . I will ask Chemical Flora to tell us the Story of her Past Life . " " My Parents were Poor , but Refined , " said Mrs. Botts . " They gave me Every Advantage .

" That 's just it . When I 'd offer to get up in Company and speak Something he 'd ask me please not to Recite , and if I had to make a Show of myself , for God 's Sake not to tackle anything Humorous , with a Conservatory Dialect to it .

" " Did this Friend think Well of your Libretto ? " asked the Wise Judge . " Yes , sir ; he said it was the Best Thing that had been done since ' Erminie . ' In fact , everybody liked my Book . " " Except your Wife , " suggested the Court . " That 's it , exactly . I wanted Sympathy and Encouragement and she gave me the Metallic Laugh . There is one Patter Song in my Opera that Every One who comes to my House has been Crazy to hear . Whenever I started to Sing it she would talk in a loud Voice . She never seemed to Appreciate my Stuff . I think the Bleach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced ? " asked the Court , with Humane Hesitancy . " No , the Eastern Managers were all tied up with Harry B.

" " Well , Mr. Botts , in View of all the Evidence , I have decided to give you a Decree of Divorce from Flo of the Wheaten Tresses , " said the Modern Solomon . " But look here ! " exclaimed the Defendant , " I have n't applied for any Divorce . " " You do n't have to . I give it to you anyway . As for you , Mrs. Botts , I will give you a Decree also . The Alimony will be $25 per . " " Thanks . " " I do n't think you grasp the Decision . When I say that the Alimony is $25 per , I mean that Mrs. Botts will be required to pay that Amount to Adolph every week . " " Shameful ! " " Do n't be too hasty . I further Decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Week . " " That simply makes it a Stand-Off , " remarked Mr. Botts , who was puzzled . " My idea of the Case , neatly expressed , " said the Modern Solomon . " Each of you is Divorced from the Other , and if Either of you ever Marries again , He or She will be jerked before this Tribunal and sentenced to Ten Years of Hard Labor in some Penal Institution .

THE FABLE OF THE COPPER AND THE JOVIAL UNDERGRADS One Night three Well-Bred Young Men , who were entertained at the Best Houses wherever they went , started out to Wreck a College town . They licked two Hackmen , set fire to an Awning , pulled down many Signs , and sent a Brick through the Front Window of a Tailor Shop .

So he spoke harshly , and told them to Leave Off breaking the Man 's Fence . His Tone and Manner irritated the University Men , who were not accustomed to Rudeness from Menials . One Student , who wore a Sweater , and whose people butt into the Society Column with Sickening Regularity , started to Tackle Low ; he had Bushy Hair and a Thick Neck , and his strong Specialty was to swing on Policemen and Cabbies .

The Copper could hardly Believe it until they led him to a Street Lamp , and showed him their Engraved Cards and Junior Society Badges ; then he Realized that they were All Right . The third Well-Bred Young Man , whose Male Parent got his Coin by wrecking a Building Association in Chicago , then announced that they were Gentlemen , and could Pay for everything they broke . Thus it will be seen that they were Rollicking College Boys and not Common Rowdies . The Copper , perceiving that he had come very near getting Gay with our First Families , Apologized for Cutting In . The Well-Bred Young Men forgave him , and then took his Club away from him , just to Demonstrate that there were no Hard Feelings . On the way back to the Seat of Learning they captured a Night Watchman , and put him down a Man-Hole . MORAL : Always select the Right Sort of Parents before you start in to be Rough .

While he was in the Legislature he discovered that these United States were an Asylum for the Down-Trodden and oppressed of the Whole World , and frequently called Attention to the Fact . When some one asked him if he was cutting up any Easy Money or would it be safe for a Man with a Watch to go to Sleep in the same Room with him , he would take a Drink of Water and begin to plead for Cuba .

Besides , she lived in a Flat and the Janitor would not permit her to keep a Dog . About Ten Days after they were Married he came Home at 4 A.M. in a Sea-Going Hack and he was Saturated .

As they did the St. Andrews Full Swing for eighty Yards apiece and then Followed Through with the usual Explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reflected that they were much inferior to his Father . His Father was too Serious a Man to get out in Mardi Gras Clothes and hammer a Ball from one Red Flag to another . His Father worked in a Lumber Yard . He was an Earnest Citizen , who seldom Smiled , and he knew all about the Silver Question and how J. Pierpont Morgan done up a Free People on the Bond Issue . Illustration : MEDITATIVE CADDY The Caddy wondered why it was that his Father , a really Great Man , had to shove Lumber all day and could seldom get one Dollar to rub against another , while these superficial Johnnies who played Golf all the Time had Money to Throw at the Birds . The more he Thought the more his Head ached . MORAL : Do n't try to Account for Anything . THE FABLE OF THE MARTYR WHO LIKED THE JOB Once in a Country Town there was a Man with a Weak Back . He could put a Grindstone into a Farm Wagon if any one wanted to bet him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something caught him right in the Spine and he had to go into the House and lie down . So his Wife took Boarders and did the Cooking herself . He was willing to divide the Labor , however ; so he did the Marketing . Only , when he had bought the Victuals , he would squat on a Shoe-Box with the Basket between his Legs and say that he could n't see what Congress wuz thinkin ' of . He had certain Theories in regard to the Alaskan Boundary and he was against any Anglo-American Alliance becuz Uncle Sam could take care of himself at any Turn in the Road , comin ' right down to it , and the American People wuz superior to any other Naytionality in every Way , Shape , Manner and Form , as fur as that 's concerned . Then his Wife would have to send Word for him to come on with the Groceries so she could get Dinner . Nearly Everybody Sympathized with her , because she had to put up with such a big Hulk of a no-account Husband . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A MARTYR One Day the Husband was Sunstruck , being too Lazy to move into the Shade , and next Day he Passed Away without an Effort . The Widow gave him the best Funeral of the Year and then put all the Money she could rake and scrape into a Marble Shaft marked " At Rest . " A good many People said she was Better Off without him , and it was certainly a Good Riddance of Bad Rubbish . They hoped that if she ever Married again she 'd pick out Somebody that wuz n't afraid to Work , and had Gumption enough to pound Sand into a Rat-Hole . There was General Satisfaction when she became the Wife of Mr. Gladden , who owned the General Store . He built a new House , hired a Girl and had the Washing sent out . She could go into the Store and pick out Anything she wanted , and he took her riding in his new Runabout every Evening . Consequently , she was very Miserable , thinking of the Jewel she had lost .

THE FABLE OF THE BOHEMIAN WHO HAD HARD LUCK Once upon a Time there was a Brilliant but Unappreciated Chap who was such a Thorough Bohemian that Strangers usually mistook him for a Tramp . Would he brush his Clothes ? Not he . When he wore a Collar he was Ashamed of himself . He had Pipe-Ashes on his Coat and Vest . He seldom Combed his Hair , and never Shaved . Every Evening he ate an Imitation Dinner , at a forty-cent Table d'Hote , with a Bottle of Writing Fluid thrown in . He had formed a little Salon of Geniuses , who also were out of Work , and they loved to Loll around on their Shoulder-Blades and Laugh Bitterly at the World . The main Bohemian was an Author . After being Turned Down by numerous Publishers , he had decided to write for Posterity . Posterity had n't heard anything about it , and could n't get out an Injunction . He knew his Works were good , because all the Free and Untrammeled Souls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a Little Thing of his Own about Wandering in the Fields with Lesbia , and then he would turn to a Friend , whose Face was all covered with Human Ivy , and ask him , point blank : " Is it , or is it not , Better than the Dooley Stuff ? " Illustration : THOROUGH BOHEMIAN " There is no Comparison , " would be the Reply , coming through the Foliage . Wandering in the Fields with Lesbia ! Lesbia would have done Well . If he had Wandered in the Fields at any Time he would have been Pinched on Suspicion that he was out for Turnips . The sure-enough Bohemian was a Scathing Critic . If Brander Matthews only knew some of the Things said about him , there would be Tear Marks on his Pillow . And Howells , too . Bah ! My , but he was Caustic . The way he burned up Magazine Writers , it 's a Wonder they did n't get after him for Arson . One day , while standing on the Front Stoop at his Boarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to a Touch , a Flower Pot fell from a Window Ledge above him , and hit him on the Head . He was put into an Ambulance and taken to a Hospital , where the Surgeons clipped his Hair short , in order to take Three Stitches . While he was still Unconscious , and therefore unable to Resist , they Scrubbed him with Castile Soap , gave him a good Shave , and put him into a snowy-white Gown . His Friends heard of the Accident , and went to the Hospital to offer Condolence . When they found him he was so Clean and Commonplace that they lost all Respect for him . MORAL : Get a good Make-Up and the Part plays itself . THE FABLE OF THE COMING CHAMPION WHO WAS DELAYED In a certain Athletic Club which rented two rooms over a Tin-Shop there was one Boy who could put it All Over the other Members . He knew how to Jab and Counter and Upper-Cut and Bore in with the Left and Play for the Wind . He had Lumps on his Arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Club told him he had the makings of a World-Beater . He used to coax Grocery Clerks and Grammar-School Children to put on the Gloves with him , and then he would go around them , like a Cooper around a Barrel , and Trim them right and proper . His friends would stand and watch him make Monkeys of these anaemic Amateurs , and gradually the Conviction grew within them that he could Lick anybody of his Weight . The Boy believed them when they told him he ought to go after the Top-Notchers . He gave up his Job in the Planing Mill and became a Pugilist . The Proprietor of a Cigar Store acted as his Manager , and began to pay his Board . This Manager was Foxy . He told the Boy that before tackling the Championship Class it would be better to go out and beat a lot of Fourth-Raters , thereby building up a Reputation and at the same time getting here and there a Mess of the Long Green . Illustrations : MANAGER In the same Town there was an Undertaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought out the Manager and made a Match in behalf of an Unknown . The boy went into Training in a Stable . He had a yellow Punching Bag , a Sponge , a Bath-Robe and several Towels . Two Paper-Hangers who were out of Work acted as his Trainers . They rubbed him with Witch Hazel all day , and in the Evening the Boy stood around in a Sweater and Talked out of the corner of his Mouth . He said he was Trained to the Minute , as Hard as Nails and Fit as a Fiddle , and he would make Mr. Unknown jump out of the Ring . As the Day of the Battle approached it came out that the Unknown was a Scrapper who had been fairly Successful at one Time , but had ceased to be a Live One several Years before . He was imported especially for this Contest with the Coming Champion . Illustration : THE COMING CHAMPION When he arrived in Town it was evident that he lacked Condition . He had been dieting himself on Pie and Beer , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell by looking at him that his Abdomen was not hard enough to withstand those crushing Body Blows such as the Boy was in the Habit of Landing  --  on the Punching Bag . Accordingly the Word went around that the imported Pug was too Fat and had bad Wind . It began to resemble a Cinch . The Manager went out and bet more Money , and the Coming Champion was Nervous for fear that he would kill the Has-Been if he connected too strong on the Point of the Jaw . He thought it would be better to wear him down with Short-Arm blows and make him Quit . He had read that it was Dangerous to punish a Physical Wreck , who might have Heart Trouble or something like that . The Boy was a Professional Pugilist , but he had Humane Instincts . When the Boy came to the Train which was to carry the Participants and the Spectators to the Battle-Field he was attended by four Comrades , who had Ice , Beef Tea , Brandy , Alcohol , Blankets and other Paraphernalia . They made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had him lie down , so that he might conserve all his Strength and step into the Ring as fresh as possible . The so-called Unknown had no one to Handle him . He sat Alone in the Men 's Car , with a queer Telescope Valise on his Knees , and he smoked a Cigarette , which was in direct Violation of all the Rules of Training . At last the Company arrived at the Secluded Spot , and a Ring was staked out . The Coming Champion was received with Loud Cheers . He wore a new Pair of Gymnasium Shoes , spotless Trunks , and around his Waist was an American Flag , presented by his Admirers in the Athletic Club . In a few Moments the Imported Scrapper came into the Ring , attended by the Sporty Undertaker . He wore an old Pair of Bike Shoes and faded Work Trousers , chopped off at the Knees , while his Belt was a Shawl-Strap . He was chewing Gum . Illustration : AND SEE ! After he put on the Gloves he looked over at the Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming Champion ) seemed to be a Nice Young Fellow . After which he Yawned slightly , and wanted to know what Time they would get a Train back to Town . The Bell rang , and there in the Center of the Ring stood the Tottering Has-Been and the Coming Champion . The Has-Been was crouched , with his Head drawn in , turtle-fashion , his Legs spraddled , and oh , the hard , vicious Expression on that Face , as he Fiddled Short and looked intently at the Coming Champion 's Feet . This was a very confusing and unprofessional Thing to do , as the Boy had not been accustomed to boxing with People who looked at his Feet . He wondered if there was anything the matter with his Gymnasium Shoes . In a Moment or two he saw that the Physical Wreck was afraid to Lead , so he did some nimble Foot Work , and his Gloves began to describe Parabolas  --  then all at once somebody turned off the Sunshine . They threw Cold Water on him , held a Bottle of Ammonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last his Eye-Lids fluttered , and he turned a dim and filmy Gaze on his faithful Seconds gathered about him . " Oh , how the Birds sing ! " he murmured . " And see ! The Aurora Borealis is trying to climb over Pain 's Fire-Works . " " Cheer up ! " said the Manager . " He took a Mean Advantage of you and Hit you when you was n't Looking . " " Ah , yes , it all comes back to me . Did I win ? " " Not quite , " replied the Manager , who feared to tell him the whole Truth . " You say he Hit me ? " asked the Coming Champion . " Yes . " " With a Casting ? " " We could n't tell . He was in such a Hurry . " All this Time the Victor was sitting on the Station Platform with the Undertaker . He was Remarking that it seemed to be a very Purty Country thereabouts , and he 'd often wished he could close in on enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land somewhere , inasmuch as he regarded a Farmer as the most independent Man on Earth . Next week there was a familiar Name back on the Time-Card at the Planing Mill . MORAL : In all the Learned Professions , Many are Called but Few are Chosen . THE FABLE OF THE LAWYER WHO BROUGHT IN A MINORITY REPORT At a Bazaar , the purpose of which was to Hold Up the Public for the Benefit of a Worthy Cause , there were many Schemes to induce Visitors to let go of their Assets . One of the most likely Grafts perpetrated by the astute Management was a Voting Contest to Determine who was the Most Beautiful and Popular Young Lady in the City . It cost Ten Cents to cast one Vote . The Winner of the Contest was to receive a beautiful Vase , with Roses on it . A prominent Young Lawyer , who was Eloquent , Good Looking , and a Leader in Society , had been selected to make the Presentation Speech after the Votes had been counted . In a little while the Contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewer 's Daughter or the Contractor 's Daughter was the Most Beautiful and Popular Young Lady in the City . The Brewer and his Friends pushed Ten Dollar Bills into the Ballot Box , while the Contractor , just before the Polls closed , slipped in a Check for One Hundred Dollars . When the Votes were counted , the Management of the Bazaar was pleased to learn that the Sixty-Cent Vase had Netted over Seven Hundred Dollars . It was Announced that the Contractor 's Daughter was exactly Nine Dollars and Twenty Cents more Beautiful and Popular than the Brewer 's Daughter . Illustration : THE MINORITY REPORT Thereupon the Committee requested that the Eloquent Young Lawyer step to the Rostrum and make the Presentation Speech . There was no Response ; the Young Lawyer had Disappeared . One of the Members of the Committee started on a Search for him , and found him in a dusky Corner of the Japanese Tea Garden , under the Paper Lanterns , making a Proposal of Marriage to a Poor Girl who had not received one Vote . MORAL : Never believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND THE WILLING PERFORMER A very attractive Debutante knew two Young Men who called on her every Thursday Evening , and brought their Mandolins along . They were Conventional Young Men , of the Kind that you see wearing Spring Overcoats in the Clothing Advertisements . One was named Fred , and the other was Eustace . The Mothers of the Neighborhood often remarked , " What Perfect Manners Fred and Eustace have ! " Merely as an aside it may be added that Fred and Eustace were more Popular with the Mothers than they were with the Younger Set , although no one could say a Word against either of them . Only it was rumored in Keen Society that they did n't Belong . The Fact that they went Calling in a Crowd , and took their Mandolins along , may give the Acute Reader some Idea of the Life that Fred and Eustace held out to the Young Women of their Acquaintance . The Debutante 's name was Myrtle . Her Parents were very Watchful , and did not encourage her to receive Callers , except such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eustace were a few of those who escaped the Black List . Myrtle always appeared to be glad to see them , and they regarded her as a Darned Swell Girl . Illustration : MYRTLE Fred 's Cousin came from St. Paul on a Visit ; and one Day , in the Street , he saw Myrtle , and noticed that Fred tipped his Hat , and gave her a Stage Smile . " Oh , Queen of Sheba ! " exclaimed the Cousin from St. Paul , whose name was Gus , as he stood stock still , and watched Myrtle 's Reversible Plaid disappear around a Corner . " She 's a Bird , Do you know her well ? " " I know her Quite Well , " replied Fred , coldly . " She is a Charming Girl . " " She is all of that . You 're a great Describer . And now what Night are you going to take me around to Call on her ? " Fred very naturally Hemmed and Hawed . It must be remembered that Myrtle was a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proprieties , and it was not to be supposed that she would crave the Society of slangy old Gus , who had an abounding Nerve , and furthermore was as Fresh as the Mountain Air . He was the Kind of Fellow who would see a Girl twice , and then , upon meeting her the Third Time , he would go up and straighten her Cravat for her , and call her by her First Name . Put him into a Strange Company  --  en route to a Picnic  --  and by the time the Baskets were unpacked he would have a Blonde all to himself , and she would have traded her Fan for his College Pin . If a Fair-Looker on the Street happened to glance at him Hard he would run up and seize her by the Hand , and convince her that they had Met . And he always Got Away with it , too . In a Department Store , while waiting for the Cash Boy to come back with the Change , he would find out the Girl 's Name , her Favorite Flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering a Parlor Car at St. Paul he would select a Chair next to the Most Promising One in Sight , and ask her if she cared to have the Shade lowered . Before the Train cleared the Yards he would have the Porter bringing a Foot-Stool for the Lady . At Hastings he would be asking her if she wanted Something to Read . At Red Wing he would be telling her that she resembled Maxine Elliott , and showing her his Watch , left to him by his Grandfather , a Prominent Virginian . Illustration : FRED AND EUSTACE At La Crosse he would be reading the Menu Card to her , and telling her how different it is when you have Some One to join you in a Bite . At Milwaukee he would go out and buy a Bouquet for her , and when they rode into Chicago they would be looking out of the same Window , and he would be arranging for her Baggage with the Transfer Man . After that they would be Old Friends . Now , Fred and Eustace had been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were not disposed to Introduce him into One of the most Exclusive Homes in the City . They had known Myrtle for many Years ; but they did not dare to Address her by her First Name , and they were Positive that if Gus attempted any of his usual Tactics with her she would be Offended ; and , naturally enough , they would be Blamed for bringing him to the House . But Gus insisted . He said he had seen Myrtle , and she Suited him from the Ground up , and he proposed to have Friendly Doings with her . At last they told him they would take him if he promised to Behave . Fred warned him that Myrtle would frown down any Attempt to be Familiar on Short Acquaintance , and Eustace said that as long as he had known Myrtle he had never Presumed to be Free and Forward with her . He had simply played the Mandolin . That was as Far Along as he had ever got . Gus told them not to Worry about him . All he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willing Performer , but as yet he never had been Disqualified for Crowding . Fred and Eustace took this to mean that he would not Overplay his Attentions , so they escorted him to the House . As soon as he had been Presented , Gus showed her where to sit on the Sofa , then he placed himself about Six Inches away and began to Buzz , looking her straight in the Eye . He said that when he first saw her he Mistook her for Miss Prentice , who was said to be the Most Beautiful Girl in St. Paul , only , when he came closer , he saw that it could n't be Miss Prentice , because Miss Prentice did n't have such Lovely Hair . Then he asked her the Month of her Birth and told her Fortune , thereby coming nearer to Holding her Hand within Eight Minutes than Eustace had come in a Lifetime . Illustration : THE WILLING PERFORMER " Play something , Boys , " he Ordered , just as if he had paid them Money to come along and make Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a Sousa March . He asked Myrtle if she had seen the New Moon . She replied that she had not , so they went Outside . When Fred and Eustace finished the first Piece , Gus appeared at the open Window , and asked them to play " The Georgia Camp-Meeting , " which had always been one of his Favorites . So they played that , and when they had Concluded there came a Voice from the Outer Darkness , and it was the Voice of Myrtle . She said : " I 'll tell you what to Play ; play the Intermezzo . " Fred and Eustace exchanged Glances . They began to Perceive that they had been backed into a Siding . With a few Potted Palms in front of them , and two Cards from the Union , they would have been just the same as a Hired Orchestra . But they played the Intermezzo and felt Peevish . Then they went to the Window and looked out . Gus and Myrtle were sitting in the Hammock , which had quite a Pitch toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the Hammock . He did not have his Arm around Myrtle , but he had it Extended in a Line parallel with her Back . What he had done would n't Justify a Girl in saying , " Sir ! " but it started a Real Scandal with Fred and Eustace . They saw that the only Way to Get Even with her was to go Home without saying " Good Night " So they slipped out the Side Door , shivering with Indignation . After that , for several Weeks , Gus kept Myrtle so Busy that she had no Time to think of considering other Candidates . He sent Books to her Mother , and allowed the Old Gentleman to take Chips away from him at Poker . They were Married in the Autumn , and Father-in-Law took Gus into the Firm , saying that he had needed a good Pusher for a Long Time . At the Wedding the two Mandolin Players were permitted to act as Ushers . MORAL : To get a fair Trial of Speed , use a Pace-Maker .
