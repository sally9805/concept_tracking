txt The fluctuations of prices on the Stock Exchange , whether down or up , are so largely influenced by what may be termed professional operations that they are of little value in regard to the general course of trade unless periods of considerable length are compared . Such comI parisons , as our readers are aware , have steadily given substantially encouraging results , and these are reinforced by the reports of clearings in which the growth over last year is decided and over the preceding year very large indeed . The anxiety , which at one time was quite marked , as to a probable scarcity of money , or , more accurately , restriction of credit due to a decline of loanable funds , has practically , disappeared under the influence of increased imports of gold and the efforts of the Secretary of the Treasury to relieve the market of the strain due to absorption of money in the Treasury . In this latter regard , while the Secretary is sure to do all that he can , since no one can know better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , he labors under considerable disadvantage . The system by which the Treasury is compelled to conduct its collections and disbursements on the lines pursued by a country storekeeper beyond the reach of a bank is absurd . Since the 1st of July the United States Government has collected $111,367,821 and paid out $165 , - 012,193 , an excess of expenditures of $53,644,372 , and yet the Treasury holds to-day an available cash balance , including the gold reserve , of $316,380,617 . Of this amount only $75,000,000 is deposited in the National banks , and these deposits are made under conditions that to some extent impair their usefulness from a business point of view . In other words , an amount of money more than one-third of the total deposits of the Clearing House banks of New York is to all practical intents locked up , while the business of the Government is actually impeded by the methods thus rendered necessary . It is not merely the accumulation of so large a sum in the Treasury that is hurtful . If this sum were reasonably stable the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the inconvenience to the lowest possible level . But the amount is not stable . It changes with the.needs of the Government , with the yield of the revenue , and even with the views of the Secretary of the Treasury for the time being . The embarrassment thus produced may also be aggravated by the course of business , as , for instance , when large importations increase the revenue and the amount locked up in the Treasury at the same time that they create requirements for more money . The worst feature of this antiquated and rural policy , which is absolutely without parallel in any civilized country of modern times , is the necessary uncertainty as to how much the Treasury will need , how much it can get , how it will use it , and how far it will interfere with the vast business operations of the whole country . The recent loan under the arbitrary and injurious conditions enforced by Congress was an example of the . evils wrought by our Treasury system . As we have said , Mr. GAGE can be depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he can not entirely avoid it until the system itself is reformed and the Government is allowed to conduct its business on business principles . The increased imports of gold , which C. have been so important an element in recent business calculations , are the more noteworthy because they follow a year of very large imports . Since tile recent movement began some $12,000,000 have been brought in , but in the year ending with June 30 the excess of imports was $105,000,000 , and the previous year it was $45,000,000 . What this net importation of $150,000,000 in two years . means can be understood better by recalling the fact that we must go back
