txt IT IS not quite easy to see why money which is not invested in real estate , or in other visible forms , should have recently come to be called " irresponsible wealth . " If that phrase is to be understood as referring to the owners , it has no significance , unless the property in question is supposed to be secret , so that its possessors live and move in a community which does not know that they are rich . This is so difficult as to be almost impossible . While it is true that investments in securities , and especially in negotiable securities that pass readily from hand to hand without necessarily disclosing what hands , are more withdrawn than realty can be from the public eye , and can more readily escape taxation , a man can not hold a large amount of them without the world becoming well aware of it . Unless he is very secretive , much away from the sight of men , and not incapable of a timely deception , he will hardly find it easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the inquisitive eyes of his neighbors . Least of all in a country where there is no secret which is not regarded as the lawful property of the public , for whose benefit thousands of detectives are constantly at work . Every man in America lives in a glass house , whether he throws stones at other people or not . Millionaiies are usually well known , as the billionaires to come soon will be . Very few of them are " born to blush unseen , " and there are perhaps those among them who are not much accustomed to blush at all . But if great wealth is enjoyed by comparatively few , the cheaper luxury of advising them what to do with it is within the reach of us all . On no subject does it seem so easy for those who are not rich to advise as on that of charity . The generosity of mankind in the disposition of other people 's money is creditable to human nature . It seems such an easy thing to give , and so // noble to do good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare , and who compare their own narrow incomes with great ones , quite naturally come to believe that the rich are but scanty in their benefactions , and to fancy that , if they were themselves wealthy , they would scatter their thousands with a grand benevolence , and always in the right direction . Where property is not visible , its amount is generally exaggerated in the public estimation , as partially-concealed forces are apt to be . Its proprietor has credit usually for more millions than he possesses , though doubtless in rare instances for less . The spectators overestimate his resources , and very much underestimate the increased demands of all sorts which follow the growth of wealth with a constant footstep . And they are often not at all aware , in the case of many rich men , of the amount that is really given away , or better than given away , through a thousand channels , quietly and without display . Especially do those who criticise the charities of others fail to remember , or perhaps to know , how extremely difficult it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion may probably be controverted . We all have our favorite objects , each one of which appears to some of us the very best among the multitude of enterprises set on foot for the good of mankind . We see and are ready to admit that many of the projects that other people advocate , are mistaken , unworthy , ill-managed , and likely to be unfruitful . We perceive clearly enough that a good share of them are put in motion rather for the support of their agents amA runners than for the attainment of the objects they propose to seek . But that is never the character of our own schemes , nor the purpose of the worthy persons who are carrying them on . Give liberally to the churches , cries one ( meaning , of course , those of his own creed ) , for what can be so important to man as his eternal welfare ?

Build monuments , shouts the fourth , to the illustrious dead , that shall be a perpetual stimulus to heroic exertion , and durable emblems of a nation 's gratitude . And among the numberless institutions and proposals that within the lines of each of these important forms of beneficence , vie and // clash with each other in ceaseless and discordant appeal , we all have our particular favorites , on which , as it seems to us , whatever may be said about other schemes , too much money could hardly be lavished by the wealthy . Every one has within his own observation , also , many cases of individual and meritorious necessity , which it would be so gratifying to provide for , and which would so well repay liberality in the consciousness of doing good . There can be no question of the importance and usefulness of all these principal objects . Some of their numerous agencies are conspicuous before the world , admirable in their work , their management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might be found upon investigation to be equally worthy of support . Of private appeals to the benevolent , it goes without saying that very many are well founded . Still the fact remains that , aside from a few institutions of unquestionable character , it is extremely difficult to select judiciously among the increasing multitude of demands . Their united clamor affects very differently those to whom it is addressed and those who help to make it ; as the volume of sound from a large orchestra is one thing to the listener , and quite another to the individual performer , intent upon his own instrument , impressed with its importance , and giving little heed to any other . To discriminate among institutions and organizations , and to investigate properly private cases , requires an expenditure of time and labor that few men are able to bestow . Attempts at the relief of the poor , especially , are attended with great embarrassment . The term " the poor ' * is very comprehensive , very uncertain , and to unreflecting minds very satisfactory . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they to be discovered and reached , and wisely as well as humanely relieved , have been found , by those who have undertaken the business , not easy to answer . There is , of course , a class of helpless , born so , or overcome by misfortunes beyond their control . They are always and necessarily the proper objects of charity . But the great mass of the destitute in this country are brought to that condition by vice , idleness , and crime . They will not work in any resolute way , nor learn how to work to advantage , though to beg they are never ashamed . Their miserable earnings , so far as they have any , and whatever else they can lay hands on , are largely consumed in the saloons , and go to the support of the political potentates of their // municipalities . Their principal usefulness is in the breeding of paupers and criminals , and in holding the balance of power in popular elections . Their necessities may well enough be left to the public charity , supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When those who are thus poor by their own fault are deducted from the general mass that we call the poor , the number that remains is comparatively small . And often those most needy and most worthy , deterred by selfrespect from seeking alms , and struggling in vain to support themselves , are the last to be discovered and to profit by the benefactioi.is of the charitable . Occasionally such an instance transpires through the newspapers , and always attracts relief , but only when it reaches extremity . After the Piccadilly riots in London , three or four years ago , the suggesticn was made in the public prints that want might be the real cause of the outbreak . The immediate response was the establishment of a fund in the hands of the Lord Mayor , to which very large sums were contributed by the wealthy , with reckless generosity . rllhe existence of this provision at once attracted to London crowds of professional paupers and sharpers from all directions . And thou h every effort was made by the committee in charge to dispense the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large share of it found its way into unworthy hands , and was a positive mischief instead of a relief , the subject of plunder rather than the means of charity . These remarks are not intended to discourage the relief of the poor , enough of whom meritorious as well as needy are always with ns , but only to suggest how much easier it is to cry without reflection , " Give to thc poor , " than it is to give discreetly and usefully when the matter is taken in hand . There are excellent organizations for the purpose , no doubt , to which contributions may be well intrusted . But even here , as there are poor and poor , so there are societies and societies . Quis custodiet ipsos cuslodes ? is a question that will never cease to be material in the dispensation of beneficence of any sort . Every day 's observation shows how much money is given away , in many directions and for many purposes , with the best of motives but with the worst of judgment , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , commenced by Mr. Carnegie , // and continued in the magazines on both sides of the Atlantic , has drawn out some very eminent men , Cardinal Manning and Mr. Gladstone among the number . The proposition with which Mr. Carnegie sets out , that it is better for a rich man to dispense his charities in his lifetime than to leave them to be administered under his will , is undeniable . Coming from one who is not merely admonishing a class to which he does not belong concerning duties that are not his own , but who by generous example illustrates what by precept he enjoins , his suggestions deserve and will receive attention . The facilities afforded in many places , iii the administration of what is called justice , for the prolonged contest of wills upon no just grounds whatever , to the waste of estates , the slander of the dead , and often the distress of surviving relatives , until an unrighteous compromise is finally extorted , are a constant warning to those who have wealth to dispose of , to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . It is only in theory that a man has a right to make his own will , if he has much to leave behind him . And the difficulties which under the most favorable circumstances attend the administration of considerable post-mortuary charities , tend strongly to support Mr. Carnegie 's views . Mr. Gladstone 's proposal , set forth in an interesting article , for bringing to pass what he appears to think is needed  --  a larger measure of giving on the part of the rich-does not seem likely to be acceptable to those whom it addresses . His suggestion is that rich men should enter into a sort of compact with each other to give away annually a certain proportion of their respective incomes . Even if it is necessary to devise schemes to stimulate the generosity of the wealthy , this one will hardly commend itself as practicable . It is not reasonable to suppose that any considerable number of men of large income would enter into such a society , binding themselves , by an honorary engagement even stronger in its obligation than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue annually , whether satisfactory opportunities or really worthy objects present themselves or not . It would be snrrendering not only their property , but the freedom of volition which men do not like to part with , and which gives charity all its merit . Were such an obligation assumed , the life of the parties to it would speedily become a burden . It would be impossible to receive or answer , much less to investigate and consider , // the thousands of applications of every conceivable description that would pour in from all quarters , many of them dishonest , many more unwise or impracticable ; and even those that are both honest and expedient , only to be found so through careful examination , and then to be discriminated from a multitude of others , equally meritorious and equally importunate . Whoever was induced to enlist into such an army of benevolence , would soon be compelled either to obtain his discharge or to desert and fly . The duty of charity , incumbent upon all according to their ability , and increasing in its demands as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally conceded . It may well be inculcated , as all other duties are , by preaching , and still better by example . The world has not outgrown the necessity for either . However difficult it may be to discriminate , good opportunities will always present themselves to him who is willing to attend to them . But it must be conceded , after all , that , more perhaps than any other in the world , this duty and the selection of its objects must be left to the conscience and the judgment of the individual . Every man should be allowed to judge for himself in respect to it , without undue importunity beforehand or unfair criticism afterwards . If property has any rights , one of the most obvious is that its owner shall be the exclusive judge of how much , when , how , and where he shall give away . Whatever he does , if he is able to give largely , he will disappoint many . However careful , he will sometimes go wrong . He will give where he ought to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give in one way when it would be better to give in another . If he gives often to individuals , he will make many an enemy among those who accept his bounty . It is only the better class of minds that are capable of gratitude , or can endure the sense of obligation , though quite willing to be under obligation . The other sort , while prompt to accept assistance , will always find excuse for denying to the giver either thanks or acknowledgrnent . One of the very best methods of charity open to a man of liberal means is to spend his income . But this way of doing good with money is not appreciated as it should be . The paupers and the destitute are by no means the only class who need help . The gret*t n*ss of those who earn their own living in some form or // other of honest industry or business , whose self-respect rejects under any circumstances the idea of accepting charity , far more of asking for it , are the most deserving and much the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment and patronage which come from those who are able to pay . There is no charity so wholesome as helping those who help themselves . Instead of pauperizing and humiliating its recipients , it elevates them in their own esteem and in that of those among whom they live . Instead of teaching them to lean upon others , it enables them to take care of themselves honorably and manfully , and to " look the whole world in the face . " There are thousands who are apparently in no need of assistance , and who hide their troubles from the public eye , who do not find it easy to make the two ends of the year meet , who have always to practise much self-denial , and even to undergo privation when embarrassed by hard times , illness , or misfortune . There is a keeping-up of appearances which is praiseworthy and pathetic , as well as one that is pretentious and ridiculous . There are those too , and they are many , who are beginning the world . If there is anywhere a just object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slender in car- *u but strong in hope , to make an honest living , and to find a worthy and respected path in life . These are they who are reached and blessed , not by institutions nor by benefactions lauded among men , but by the increase and encouragement of the flow of trade and business out of which they live , which , like the stream on its way to the sea , slakes the thirst and refreshes the weariness of thousands . And they can be reached and helped in no other way . The man who dispenses his money freely in the channels of employment is often doing more good with it and less harm , whether he knows it or not , than if he were giving it away . The very pleasures and luxuries of the rich , for which they are so commonly criticised , minister necessarily to the livelihood of a multitude of deserving and hard-working people . The country house , the yacht , the opera-box , the club , the elegance of furniture , of costume , of equipage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are superfluities , no doubt . A man can do without them , as most men must . But to what an army do they give bread ! The idea that they had better be relinquished , and the cost taken from the workers and given to those who do not work , is a false one . The preciotis ointment // which the woman was reproached for lavishing needlessly on the object of her adoration , because it might have been sold for much and given to the poor , was not on that account rejected ; perhaps because it was remembered that its price had been already bestowed upon the not undeserving poor whose industries had combined to produce it . But if what Mr. Carnegie calls " the Gospel of Wealth " is to be preached , or what others term the responsibilities of wealth are to be measured , we should begin with its obligations rather than with its beneficence . While it may freely be conceded to tbe rich that they should be their own judges of the amount and direction of their charities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce , and ought to insist upon . If-there are no duties to be discharged , there are offences to be avoided which are possible to no other class . We can not compel them to be generous , and we have no warrant to attempt it ; but we are entitled to require that they should be just . Selfishness is a vice , but rapacity is a crime . To them applies with extreme force the *nt maxim of the common law-sic utere tuo , ut nom alienuns tae** s . They are bound , first and above all , to refrain from such a use of the vast power of wealth as results either in the plunder *f less fortunate men or the demoralization of society at large . Estates already great enough are being made to accumulate with accelerating rapidity by methods which involve both these offences , and are becoming oppressive in the last degree . Great combinations of capital are organized to enhance unreasonably the price of various necessaries of life , and to extinguish that fair competition in their production which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus laid upon all who have their living to earn , in order to swell unduly the profits of concerns already plethoric with wealth . And when courts of justice interfere against these conspiracies and declare them illegal , fresh devices are resorted to in order to evade the law and to continue the plunder of the public . In the financial centres , also , there are going on , all the while , fraudulent schemes which impoverish those whose small investments are the fruit of their industry and the provision for their families , to the enrichment of men who through large wealth are able to control transactions . The surplus that in ordinary employments is slowly accumulated , rarely large enough to be // called wealth , must be invested somewhere and somehow , in order to produce any return . Its disposition is anxiously and carefully made , in thousands of instances , in apparently trustworthy securities , and upon such light as can be obtained , in the hope that from 4 to 6 per cent . per annum may fairly be realized with safety to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these securities belong is acquired by great operators , often through adroit manipulation , not with a view to the honest discharge of the fiduciary relation thus assumed , nor for the protection of the property of others thus intrusted to their charge , but for the purpose of enriching themselves at the expense of their trust . Gradually , by one scheme and another , and by various expedients of management and mismanagement , the property of the corporation is ahsorbed or turned into indebtedness . The stockholders are plundered , while the wealth of the managers rises into the millions . This is no fancy picture or casual instance . It is a regular course of business , of which the examples are not far to seek . It is true that many corporations are most uprightly and honorably conducted . Malversation is the exception , not the rule . But the exceptions are so numerous as to have become a great and flagrant evil . These methods of what is called business prey upon individuals . There is a much greater iniquity of wealth which attacks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the employment of vast sums of money for the purchase of high places of political trust and the control of the results of important elections . Places that should be of the highest dignity , as they certainly are of the largest influence , are pretty well known to be obtained by direct bribery of the electors in whose gift they are . Posts of much distinction are more than suspected to be the consideration of enormous contributions to electioneering funds . Great sums are generally believed to be raised to carry elections by those who are accumulating excessive fortunes through a system of revenue which not only casts the burden of taxation upon the industry of the country , instead of its property , but , far beyond the legitimate requirements of government , burdens the many for the benefit of the few . And these sums , which could not possibly be requisite for any proper election expenses , are well understood to be employed in the ( lirect purchase of votes in the market , to a decisive extent . // The political power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a plutocracy , composed not of the best class of the rich , but of the worst , to be used not for the general welfare , but for the still further aggrandizement of those who have bought it , and for the elevation to high places of meu who are not fit to be there . These are plain words . But it is time plain words began to be spoken on this subject . Here is not the place to pursue it . Thoughtful men can consider it for themselves , and can satisfy themselves how far the general understanding is supported by the facts . They who believe that the business of government can be thus demoralized , and the general mass thus oppressed , with fortunate and peaceful results , have read the history of mankind to small purpose . The longer the storm broods before it breaks , the more dangerous it becomes . Already clouds much larger than a man 's hand have risen above the horizon .

We are in danger , not of revolution or bloodshed , but of the not less destructive power of frantic and ruinous legislation , controlled by demagogues , and involving in its consequences the just as well as the unjust . These are the abuses and the mischiefs of wealth , not its necessary results . If from them we can be protected , we need have little concern about its charities . It is certainly not a just ground of reproach against the rich men of this nation , as a body , that they have been niggardly either in benevolence or in public spirit . We have only to look about us to see ample proof to the contrary . What country is so abundant in the institutions of religion , of education , of all known forms of human charity ? Where else are to be seen so many and . on the whole , such excellent examples of wise and thoughtful beneficence ?

There * charity of thought and speech that is duo to them , as well // as a charity of benevolence that is due from them . One is quite as apt to be neglected as the other . We often hear of those who are said to be poor but honest . It is but just to bear in mind that there are many who are rich but honest , and generous to boot . In that class of society , as in all others , there are men of widely different character . There are those for whom mankind is no better ; who use money only to make more money , and would carry it all with them when they die , if they could . They are " the cankers of a calm world . " It is for their sins that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are and have been many Americans whose large estates , honorably inherited or honestly acquired , are like springs in a dry land , freely flowing for the general relief ; whose public benefactions are judicious , liberal , and often princely , and whose private charities are as generous as they are unostentatious . The race is not yet extinct in this country of those who " do good by stealth and blush to find it fame . " The idea that prevails in some quarters that large forfunes are in themselves detrimental or opposed to sound public policy is a mistake . So far from being dangerous or justly obnoxious , great estates in good hands are a most important advantage to the community . The world at this day could hardly do without them . If there was no such class , much of the grandest work of our time must come to a halt . The springs of charity would in a large measure dry up .

There are ways enough to use and enjoy wealth wisely , beneficially , at least harmlessly , as it must be used in the long run if it is to be tolerated , not to say protected . The choice among them belongs to the individual . But there are ways in which it leads to destruction , and devours its own offspring-ways of oppression , of extortion , of corruption . It is upon these that public opinion and public law ought to set their foot , not mildly , but decisively.
