txt The Constitution of Tennessee , Article IV. , Section 1 , prescribes that " Every male person of the age of twenty-one years , being a citizen of the United States , and a resident of this State for twelve months , and of the county wherein he may offer his vote for six months next preceding the day of election , shall be entitled to vote for members of the Legislature and other civil officers for the county and district in which he resides , and there shall be no qualification of the right of suffrage , except that each voter shall give to the Judges of Election , when he offers his vote , satisfactory evidence that he has paid the poll taxes assessed against him , for such preceding period as the Legislature shall prescribe , and at such time as may be prescribed by law . " There is no other qualification for voters in the Constitution . At an extra session of the Legislature , held in 1890 , was passed an act to en-. force this provision over the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to swear to its loss , and his affidavit was taken as sufficient evidence of payment ; but this was repealed 1891 , and actual proffer of the receipt . itself required . The same extra session enacted that in each county having 50 , - 000 or more population , by the census of 1890 , three Registration Commissioners should be appointed by the Governor , not more than two of whom should be of the same political party . Power was given to these Commissioners to appoint Registers of Voters , Judges and Clerks of Elections  --  power , in a word , to control the registration and polling machinery in the four counties of Knox , Hamilton , Davidson , and Shelby , those counties containing the cities of Knoxville , Chattanooga , Nashville , and Memphis , and having a total population of 833,953 , as returned by the census enumerators of 1890 . All elections in those counties , general and special , were placed under the control of the Governor 's Commissioners . The registration law of 1890 , prescribed for the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voter , the issuance to him by the Registers of a certificate showing the fact of his registration , and the law provided that he could not vote unless he presented his certificate to the officer holding the election . It was pointed , out that the registration certificate would be a source of corruption , as those passports to the polls would be bought up by candidates in order to shorten ' the possible vote for their rivals , but the objectors to the certificate were bluntly told by members of the committee having the bill in charge that the certificate clause must stand . " It was put in to enable white men to buy off nigger voters cheaply . " Concurrent with the registration and ? poll tax payment laws was passed a modified form of the Australian ballot law , and applied to the four counties named ' above . An agreed or test case was taken before the Supreme Court , and that court decided , Chief Justice TURNEY delivering the opinion , that the educational feature of the Australian ballot law ? did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 1 , of the Constitution , which says no limitations shall be put on the right : to vote except such as are expressly enumerated in that section . The Legislature of 1897 extended the power of the Governor over all the elections in the State . His Commissioners , ' three in each county , appoint all registration and election officers , receive and return the poll records , do everything of an official character in and about general and special elections in Tennessee . It is the opinion of those best qualified by intelligence , judicial temper , and careful observation to judge of ' the matter that these laws have tended to promote , rather than to suppress , fraud in the elections in Tennessee . The non-partisan feature in the election boards . and officers  --  not more than a majority may be of one party ? is , by one means or other , turned into a farce . An ignorant and corruptible member of " the other party " is appointed an Election Judge or Clerk ; if the member representing the opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , he is ignored . In short , the scheme is " politics " and nothing else . It is a code to keep a faction in power , in control of the offices and spoils of the State , the cities , and the counties , and not to keep pure and honest the State and local elections . Elections under the old plan , when the people 's own election officers managed the elections , were becoming uncomfortably close for the " party in power , " hence the laws to abbreviate the vote of " the opposition . " The defeat of TIIR , NEY ( Dem. ) by EVAxs ( Rep. ) for Governor , in 1894 , and the light plurality given TAYLOR ( Dem. ) over TILLNIAN ( Rep. ) for Governor , in 1896 , produced the sweeping statute of 1897 , putting all elections in the State in control of the Governor , through his Commissioners , who would surely be his " friends , " and the friends of his friends . It is election by machine , especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no party are powerless to do anything about it more effective than criticism , denunciation , and protest . The election certificate feature is a source of small profit to Many negroes and poor white men who can not read , and therefore can not mark a ticket They register , and duly sell their certificates to a committee or candidate , prices ranging from $1 to $3 each . This is not calculated to " . purify " the population , whatever effect it might have on the elections
