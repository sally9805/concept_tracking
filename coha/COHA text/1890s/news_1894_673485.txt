txt After proceeding several hours in a humdrum sort of way , discimsing the Fortifications and Pension Appropriation bills , an adjournment was reached laS the House to-day at the close of the most sensational Inc:dent of the session . Mr. Meredith ( Dens , Vas ) had instanced the ease of a pensioner , who , he believed , perjured himself to get on the roll , - whereupon Mr. Funk of Illinois declared that Mr. Meredith was not a good citizen if he did not denounce the perjurer to the authorities . Mr. Meredith took this to mean a reflection on his veracity , and , rushing over to Mr. Funk 's seat , shook his fist in the latter 's face , while Mr. Funk , disclaiming any intention to attack the truthfulness of Mr. Meredith 's statement , with his fist also uplifted , reiterated his charge of dereliction of duty , and announced his readiness to bark it up there or elsewhere . The men were prevented from coming together , but the incident caused much excitement and a great uproar . Speaker Orisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . During the day the House authorized a Sub-Committee of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds to visit Chicago and investigate the public building question , passed a bill regulating the settlements and sale of lands in abandoned military reservations of more than 5,000 acres area , referred to the Committee on the Judiciary a resolution offered by Mr. Livingston ( Dem. , Ga. , ) as to the failure by the Sergeant at Arms to enforce the law directing the withholding of the per diem of members absent for other reasons than sickness ; passed the Fortifications Appropriation bill , and spent over two hours on the General Pension bill . Mr. Boatner La. , ) endeavored to secure consideration for the resolution agreed upon by the Committee on the Judiciary directing an investigation of the injunction issued by Judge Jenkins forbidding the employes of the Northern Pacific Railroad to strike against the schedule of wages promulgated by the receivss , but Mr. Kilgore ( Dem. , Texas , ) objected , and demanded the regular order . The House resolved itself into Committee of the Whole and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill amounts to 62,219,654 , being $5,218,759 less than the estimates , and $9.599 more than the total of the last Fortifications bill . Debate was confined to brief statements by Mr. Livingston ( Dem. , Ga. , ) and Mr. Bingham , ( Rep. , Penn . ) The latter said that , waiving , until a more important bill shall be presented , discussion on the question whether the legislation of the Fifty-first Congress or threatened tariff legislation by this Congress , is the cause of the present financial distress , for himself and his Republican associates on the committee he desired to inform the House that the general features of the proposed bill had their approval . Ender the five-minute rule , several minor amendments recommended by the committee were agreed to and the bill was reported to the House , the amendments agreed to , and the bill was passed . The House again went into Committee of the Whole on the Pension Appropriation bill . This bill carries an appropriation of 6151.581,570 for the year 1894-5 , against estimates of $162,631,570 , and an appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Dem Mass Chairman of the sub-committee in charge of the bill , made a statement to show why the proposed reduction had been made in the bill from the amount of estimates . Mr. O'Neill was questioned by Mr. Hudson ( Populist , Kan. , ) and Mr. Johnson ( Rep. , Inds ) as to the policy of the Pension Bureau . He answered that as a member of the committee he did not understand or believe that the Commissioner of Pensions desired or had made any attempt to reduce the allowance of pensions because of the depleted condition of - the Treasury . The force of clerks was generally the same as under Gen Raum , and was working only under instructions to enforce the law as they found it . The unexpended balance of appropriation that was expected to remain at the close of the present fiscal year would not be caused , Mr. O'Neill said , by the suspension of pensions , for most of the suspensions had been revoked and the pensioners had been paid the full amount due them . Mr. Grout ( Rep- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted pension claims at a rate only one-fourth as fast as Commissioner Raum , who rejected but one claim out of four , while Commissioner Lochren rejected two claims to every one allowed . In the discussion which followed , Mr. Meredith ( Dem. , Vas ) said he came from a State that paid five times as much as the Green Mountain State , from which the last speaker came , for pensions , but which got no benefit therefrom . Mr. Johnson , ( Rep. , Ind . ) ? That 's because you were on the wrong side , was n't it ? Mr. Meredith  --  Maybe so . But I want to remind the gentleman that the difference between a patriot and a rebel is that success makes one and defeat makes the other . Mr. Livingston , ( Dem. , Ga . ) ? That was the case in ' 76 , anyhow . Continuing , Mr. Meredith said he and the people he represented believed the pension roll should be a roll of honor , and not contain the names of persons who are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds and thousands on the roll to-day . Mr. Grout asked for proof , and Mr. Meredith stated that he could give it , and that no gentleman had the courage to deny it when he stated upon his responsibility as a Representative that from his own knowledge and observation he knew it to be true that hundreds and thousands of fraudulent pensioners were on the roll . Mr. Hopkins ( Rep. , Ills ) asked if it was not the action of the gentleman 's State and others south of him that caused the existence of the pension roll . Mr. Meredith ? No , Sir ; it was due to the gentlemen who forced the issue upon us when we wanted peace . We have no complaint against the men who are entitled to a place on the pension list It is against those who began fighting immediately after the war and kept it up that we complain . Numerous interruptions were made in the course of Mr. Meredith 's remarks by Republicans to question him as to the action of the Democrats upon pension nights in refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quorum , in violation of practice for many years . He answered by charging that if the Republicans would attend these Friday night sessions there would be a quorum , as the Constitution required , for the transaction of business . Mr. Livingston called attention to the fact that the Republicans had refrained from voting so as to break a quorum last week when the Democrats were trying to provide money for paying pensions . Mr. Reed  --  Why did n't you count us ? We were here to be counted . Mr. Meredith  --  Let me say to the gentleman from Maine that had I been in the chair I would have counted you the first one . Republican applause . Mr. Reed  --  One man of sense on the Democratic side . Mr. Meredith stated that his Intention had been simply to denounce and refute the sentiments expressed on the other side , that the Democratic Party occupied the position of nullifiers of the pension law , and he characterized the statement as gratuitous and untrue , and known to he so . As he was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. H. , ) requested him to Intske known the proof of his statement that ti , c ? pension roll contained hundreds of fraudulent names . To this he replied that a certain pensioner in his personal knowledge was strong and healthful , and that he lie lieved this pensioner had foresworn him self in order to gain the benefit cf th. law . This case was , in his opinion , the type of mar others . Mr. Baker remarked that the gentleman had given no proof to the country or to the House of his statement  --  nothing but assertions . Mr. Funk ( Rep. , Ill. , ) suggested that if the gentleman from Virginia believed what he said to be true and did not denounce the pensioner to the proper authorities , he was not a good citizen . The tenor of this remark was evidently understood by Mr. Meredith to be a reElection upon his veracity , for , with arms uplifted and menacing tone , he left the place where he had been speaking and approached the desk of the gentleman from Illinois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If the gentleman means to insinuate , " he shouted , " that I am not telling the truth ? " The Republican members crowded around the two principal participants in the scene , and Mr. Payne ( Rep. , Y. , ) stood between them . Mr. Funk responded , as nearly as could be made out in the hubbub and confusion : " I did not say that the gentleman was telling an untruth , but that , if it were true , he was not a good citizen if he did not present the case to the authorities . And , " he shouted , Shaking his fist in the face of Mr. Meredith , who still had his arm uplifted , " I stand by that here and elsewhere . " The uproar was now at its height . The shouting of the gentlemen could not be understood at the desk , but- in a moment or two Speaker Crisp seized the gavel and called upon the Sereant at Arms to restore order . Col. Snow ran in to the midst of the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own side , and stood , demanding recognition of the Chair until ordered by the Speaker to take his seat . When order was restored , he was permitted to proceed . He said he was not excited , and that nothing that he had recently witnessed over there ( indicating by a motion of his head the Republican side ) was calculated to excite him . There was a way , however , in which he could be excited , but he opined that no gentleman on the other side would take that way upon the floor of the House , and he therefore would dismiss the recent incident . In response to the gentleman from Illinois , ( Mr. Funk , ) he desired to say that he was not required to act as a spy or informer , and that he would refuse to act in that . capacity . On motion of Mr. O'Neill , the committee rose at the conclusion of Mr. Meredith 's remarks . At the evening session , in Committee of the Whole , fourteen pension bills were acted on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House adjourned .
