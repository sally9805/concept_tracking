THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A REVOLUTIONIST . ST . PETERSBURG ; JOURNEY TO WESTERN EUROPE . VII . FOR the last few years the health of my father had been going from bad to worse , and when my brother Alexander and I came to see him , in the spring of 1871 , we were told by the doctors that with the first frosts of autumn he would be gone . He had continued to live in the old style , in the St*iraya Kon4shennaya , but everything had changed around him in this formerly aristocratic quarter . The rich serf-owners , who once were so prominent there , had gone . After having spent in a most reckless way the redemption money which they had received at the emancipation of the serfs , and after having mortgaged and remortgaged their estates in the new land banks which preyed upon their helplessness , they had withdrawn at last to the country or to provincial towns , there to sink into oblivion . Their houses had been taken by " the intruders , " - rich merchants , railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one of the old families which remained a young life struggled to assert its rights upon the ruins of the old one . A couple of retired generals , who cursed the new ways , and relieved their griefs by predicting for Russia a certain and speedy ruin under the new order , or some relative occasionally dropping in , were all the company my father had in his house . Out of our many relatives , numbering nearly a score of families at Moscow alone in my childhood , two families only had remained in the capital , and these had joined the current of the new life , the mothers discussing with their girls and boys su*h matters as schools for the people and women 's universities . My father looked upon them with contempt . My stepmother and my younger sister , Pauline , who had not changed , did their best to comfort him ; but they themselves felt strange in their unwonted surrouiidings . My father had always been unkind and most unjust toward my brother Alexander , but Alexander was utterly incapable of holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick-room , with the deep , kind look of his large blue eyes and with a smile revealing his infinite kindness , and when he immediately discovered what could be done to render the sufferer more comfortable in his sick-chair , and did it as naturally as if he had left the sick-room only an hour before , my father was simply bewildered ; he stared at him without being able to understand . Our visit brought life into the dull , gloomy house ; nursing became more bright ; my stepmother , Pauline , the servants themselves , grew more animated , and my father felt the change . One thing worried him , however . He had expected to see us come as repentant sons , imploring his support . But when he tried to direct conversation ilito that channel , we stopped him with such a cheerful " Do n't bother about that ; we go on very nicely , " that he was still more bewildered . He looked for a scene in the old style , - his sons*begging pardon - and money ; perhaps he even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he regarded us with a greater esteem . We were all three affected at parting . He seemed almost to dread returning to his gloomy loneliness amidst the wreckage of a system he had lived to maintain . But Alexander had to go back to his service , and I was leaving for Finland . When I was called home again , I hurried to Moscow , to find the burial cere // mony just beginning , in that same old red church where my father had been baptized , and where the last prayers had been said over his mother . As the funeral procession passed along the streets , of which every house was so familiar to me in my childhood , I noticed that the houses had changed little , but I knew that in all of them a new life had begun . Less than twelve months later , in a house within a stone 's throw of my father 's , I received Stepnim*k , clothed as a peasant , he having escaped from a country village where he had been arrested for socialist propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , we held one of our secret meetings at the house of Nathalie Armfeld , the Kara " convict " whom George Kennan has so touchingly described in his book on Siberia . VIII . The next year , early in the spring , I made my first journey to Western Europe . In crossing the Russian frontier , I experienced , even more intensely than I was prepared to do , what every Russian feels on leaving his mother country . So long as the train runs on Russian ground , through the thinly populated northwestern provinces , one has the feeling of crossing a desert . Hundreds of miles are covered with low growths which hardly deserve the name of forests . Here and there the eye discovers a small , miserably poor village buried in the snow , or an impracticable , muddy , narrow , and winding village road . But everything - scenery and surroundings - changes all of a sudden , as soon as the train enters Prussia , with its clean-looking villages and farms , its gardens , and its paved roads ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one penetrates further into Germany . Even dull Berlin seemed animated , a , fter our Russian towns . And the contrast of climate ! Two days before , I had left St. Petersburg thickly covered with snow , and now , in middle Germany , I walked without an overcoat along the railway platform , in warm sunshine , admiring the budding flowers . Then came the Rhine , and later Switzerland bathed in the rays of a bright sun , with its small , clean hotels , where breakfast was served out of doors , in view of the snow-clad mountains . I never had realized before so vividly what Russia 's northern position meant , and how the history of the Russian nation had been influenced by the fact that the main centres of its life had to develop in high latitudes , as far as the shores of the Gulf of Finland . Only then I fully understood the uncontrollable attraction which southern lands have exercised on the Russian people , the colossal efforts which they have made to reach the Black Sea , and the steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that time Ztlrich was full of Russian students , both women and men . The famous Oberstrasse , near the Polytechnic , was a corner of Russia , where the Russian language prevailed over all others . The students lived as most Russian students do , especially the women ; that is , upon almost nothing . Tea and bread , some milk , and a thin slice of meat cooked over a spirit lamp , amidst animated discussions upon the latest news of the socialistic world or the last book read , - that was their regular fare . Those who had more money than was needed for such a mode of living gave it all for the " common affairs , " - the library , the Russian review which was going to be published , the support of the Swiss labor papers . As to their dress , the most parsimonious economy reigned in that direction . Pushkin has written in a well-known verse , " What hat may not suit a girl of sixteen ? " Our girls at Zurich seemed defiantly to throw this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can there be a simplicity in dress which does not become a // girl , when she is young , intelligent , and full of energy . With all this , the busy little community worked harder than any other students have ever worked since there were universities in existence , and the ZUrich professors were never tired of showing the progress accomplished by the womeii at the university as an example to the male students . The International Workingmen 's Association was then at the height of its development . Great hopes had been awakened in the years 1840-48 in the hearts of European workers . Only now we begin to realize what a formidable amount of socialist literature was circulated in those years by socialists of all denominations , Christian socialists , state socialists , Fourierists , Saint-Simonists , Owenites , and so on ; and only now we begin to understand the depth of this movement , and to discover how much of what our generation has considered the product of contemporary thought was already developed and said - often with great penetration - during those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic " a quite different thing from the democratic organization of capitalist rule which now goes under that name . When they spoke of the United States of Europe , they understood the brotherhood of workers , the weapons of war transformed into tools , and these tools used by all members of society for the benefit of all ; not only the reign of equality as regards criminal law , but particularly economic equality . The nationalists saw in their dreams the Young Italy , the Young Germany , and the Young Hungary taking the lead in far-reaching agrarian and economic reforms . The defeat of the June insurrection at Paris , of Hungary by the armies of Nicholas I. , and of Italy by the French and the Austrians , and the fearful reaction which followed everywhere in Euof a Revolutionist. rope , totally destroyed that movement . Its literature , its achievements , its very principles of economic revolution and universal brotherhood , were simply forgotten , lost , during the next twenty years . However , the understanding which was reached by some English workers and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1866 became quite unexpectedly the starting point for a formidable movement , which soon spread all over Europe , and included several million workers . The hopes which had been dormant for twenty years were awakened once more , when the workers were called upon to unite , " without distinction of creed , sex , nationality , race , or color , " to proclaim that " the emancipation of the workers must be their own work , " and to throw the weight of a strong , united , international organization into the evolution of mankind , - not in the nanje of love and charity , but in the name of justice , of the force that belongs to a body of men moved by a reasoned consciousness of their own aims and aspirations . Two strikes at Paris , in 1868 and 1869 , more or less helped by small contributions sent from England , Germany , and Spain , insignificant though they were in themselves , became the origin of an immense movement in which the solidarity of the workers of all nations was proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea of an international union of all trades , and of a struggle against capital with the aid of international support , carried away the most indifferent of the workers . The movement spread like wildfire in France , Italy , and Spain , bringing to the front such a tiumber of intelligent , active , and devoted workers , and attracting to it such a number of men , young and old , from the wealthier educated classes , that a force never before suspected to exist grew stronger every day . If the movement had not been arrested in its growth // by the ill-omened Franco-German war , great things would probably have happened in Europe , deeply modifying the aspects of our civilization , and undoubtedly accelerating human progress ; but the crushing victory of the Germans brought about abnormal conditions in Europe , and stopped for a quarter of a century the normal development of France . All sorts of partial solutions of the great social question had currency at that time among the workers : co*peration , productive associations supported by the state , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitum . Each of these solutions was brought before the " sections " of the association , and then before the local , regional , national , and international congresses , and eagerly discussed-Every annual congress of the association marked a new step in advance , in the development of ideas about the great social problem which stands before our generation and calls for a solution . The amount of intelligent things which were said at these congresses , and of scientifically correct , deeply thought over ideas which were circulated , - all being the results of the collective thought of the workers , - has never yet been sufficiently appreciated ; but there is no exaggeration in saying that all schemes of social reconstruction which are now in vogue under the name of " scientific socialism " or " anarchism " have their origin in the discussions and reports of the congress of the International Association-The few educated men who joined the movement have only put into a theoretical shape the criticisms and the aspirations which were expressed in the sections , and subsequently in the congresses , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the association , but had not stopped it . In all the industrial centres of Switzerland numerous and animated sections of the International existed , and thousands of workers flocked to their meetings , at which war was declared upon the existing system of private ownership of land and factories , and the near end of the capitalist system was proclaimed . Local congresses were held in various parts of the country , and at each of these gatherings the most arduous and difficult problemns of the present social organization were discussed , with a knowledge of the matter and a depth of conception which alarmed the middle classes even more than did the numbers of adherents who joined the sections , or groups , of the International . The jealousies and prejudices which had hitherto existed in Switzerland between the privileged trades ( the watchmakers and the jewelers ) and the rougher trades ( weavers , and so on ) , and which had prevented joint action in labor disputes , were disappearing . The workers asserted with increasing emphasis that , of all the divisions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that between the owners of capital and those who not only come into the world penniless , but are doomed to remain producers of wealth for the favored few . Italy , especially middle and northern Italy , was honeycombed with groups and sections of the International ; and in these the Italian unity so long struggled for was declared a mere illusion . The workers were called upon to make their own revolution , - to take the land for the peasants and the factories for the workers themselves , and to abolish the oppressive centralized organization of the state , whose historical mission always was to protect and to maintain the exploitation of man by man . In Spain , similar organizations covered Catalonia , Valencia , and Andalusia ; they were supported by , and united with , the powerful labor unions of Barcelona . The International had no less than eighty thousand regularly payiI*g Spanish members ; it embodied all the active and thinking elements of the population ; and by its distinct refusal to meddle with the // political intrigues during 1871-72 it had drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses . The proceedings of its provincial and national congresses , and the manifestoes which they issued , were models of a severe logical criticisni of the existing conditions , as well as admirably lucid statements of the workers ' ideals . In Belgium , Holland , and even in Portugal , the same movement was spreading , and it had already brought into the association the great mass and the best elements of the Belgian coal miners and weavers . In England , the always conservative trade unions hal also joined the movement , at least in principle , and were ready to support their Continental brethren in direct struggles against capital , especially in strikes . In Germany , the socialists had concluded a union with the rather numerous followers of Lassalle , and the first foundations of a social democratic party had been laid . Austria and Hungary followed in the same track ; and although no international organization was possible at that time in France , after the defeat of the Commune and the reaction which followed ( Draconic laws having been enacted against the adherents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this period of reaction would not last , and that France would soon join the association again and take the lead in it . While I was in Switzerland , wanting to know all about the Workingmnen 's Association , I joined the local section . I also asked my Russian friends where I could learn more about the great movement which was going on in other countries . " Read , " was their reply , and they brought me large numbers of books and collections of newspapers for the last two years . I spent days and nights in reading , and received a deep impressiomi which nothing will efface ; the flood of new thoughts awakened is associated in my mind with a tiny clean room in the Oberstrasse , commanding from a window a view of the blue lake , with the mountains beyond it , where the Swiss fought for their independence , and the high spires of the old town , - that scene of so many religious struggles . Socialistic literature has never been rich in books . It is written for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its main force lies in its small pamphlets and its newspapers . Moreover , he who seeks for information about socialism finds in books little of what he requires most . They contain the theories or the scientific arguments in favor of socialist aspirations , but they give no idea how the workers accept socialist ideals , and how the latter could be put into practice . There remains nothing but to take collections of papers and read them all through , - the news as well as the leaders , perhaps even more than the leaders . Quite a new world of social relations and methods of thought and action is revealed by this reading , which gives an insight into what can not be found anywhere else , - namely , the depth and the moral force of the movement , the degree to which men are imbued with the new theories , their readiness to carry them out in their daily life and to suffer for them . All discussions about the impracticability of socialism and the necessary slowness of evolution are of little value , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the human beings of whose evolution we are speaking . What estimate of a sum can be made without knowing its components ? The more I read , the more I saw that there was before me a new world , unknown to me , and totally unknown to the learned makers of sociological theories , - a world that I could know only by living in the Workingmen 's Association and by meeting the workers in their every-day life . I decided , accordingly , to spend a couple of months in such a life . My Russian friends encouraged // me , and after a few days ' stay at Zurich I left for Geneva , which was then a great centre of the international movement . The place where the Geneva sections used to meet was the spacious Masonic Temple Unique . More than two thousand men could come together in its large hail , at the general meetings , while every evening all sorts of committee and section meetings took place in the side rooms , or classes in history , physics , engineering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the workers by the few , very few , middle-class men who had joined the movement , and mainly by French refugees of the Paris Commune . It was a people 's university as well as a people 's forum . One of the chief leaders of the movement at the Temple Unique was a Russian , Nicholas Gotin , - a bright , intelligent , and active man ; and the real soul of it was a Russian lady , who was known far and wide amongst the workers as Madame Olga . She was the working force in *ll the committees . Both Ootin and Madame Olga received me cordially , made me acquainted with all the men of mark in the sections of the different trades , and invited me to be present at the committee meetings . So I went , but I preferred being with the workers themselves . Taking . a glass of sour wine at one of the tables in the hall , I used to sit there every evening amid the workers , and soon became friendly with several of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France after the insurrection of the Commune . He had children , just about the age of the two whom my brother had so suddenly lost a few months before , and through the children I was speedily on good terms with the family and their friends . I could thus follow the movement from the inside , and know the workers ' view of it . The workers had built all their hopes on the international movement . Young and old flocked to the Temple Unique after their long day 's work , to get hold of the scraps of education which they could obtain there , or to listen to the speakers who promised them a grand future , based upon the common possession of all that man requires for the production of well-being , and upon a brotherhood of men , without distinction of caste , race , or nationality . All hoped that a great social revolution , peaceful or not , would soon come and totally change the economic conditions . No one desired class war , but all said that if the ruling classes rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , if only it should bring with it wellbeing and liberty to the downtrodden masses . One must have lived among the workers at that time to realize the effect which the sudden growth of the association had upon their minds , - the trust they put in it , the love with which they spoke of it , the sacrifices they made for it . Every day , week after week and year after year , thousands of workers made sacrifices in order to support the life of each group , to secure the appearance of the papers , to defray the expenses of the congresses , to support the comrades who had suffered for the association , - nay , even to be present at the meetings and the manifestations . Another thing that impressed me deeply was the elevating influence which the International exercised . Most of the Paris Internationalists were almost total abstainers from drink , and all had abandoned smoking . " Why should I nurture in myself that weakness ? " they said . Outsiders never realize the sacrifices which are made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join openly a section of the International Association , and to face the discontent of the master and a probable dismissal at the first opportunity , with the long months out of work which // usually followed . Even a few pence given for the common cause represent a burden on the meagre budget of the European worker , and many pence had to be disbursed every week . Frequent attendance at the meetings means a sacrifice , too . For us it may be a pleasure to spend a couple of hours at a meeting , but for men whose working day begins at five in the morning those hours have to be stolen from necessary rest . I felt this devotion as a standing reproach . I saw how eager the workers were to gain instruction , and despairingly few were those who volunteered to aid them . J saw how much the toiling masses needed to be helped by men possessed of education and leisure , in their endeavors to spread and to develop the organization ; but how few and rare were those who came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helplessness ! More and more I began to feel that I was bound to cast in my lot with them . Stepni*k says , in his Career of a Nihilist , that every revolutionist has had a moment in his life when some circumstance , maybe unimportant in itself , has brought him to pronounce his oath of giving himself to the cause of revolution . I know that moment ; I lived through it after one of the meetings at the Temple Unique , when I felt more acutely than ever before how cowardly are the educated men who hesitate to put their education , their knowledge , their energy , at the service of those who are so much in need of that education and that energy . " Here are men , " I said to myself , " who are conscious of their servitude , who work to get rid of it ; but where are the helpers ? Where are those who come to serve the masses , not to utilize them for their own ambitions ? " Gradually , some doubts began to creep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was carried on at the Temple Unique . One night , a wellknown Geneva lawyer , Monsieur A. , came to the meeting , and stated that if he had not hitherto joined the association , it was because he had first to settle his own business affairs ; having now succeeded in that direction , he came to join the labor movement . I felt shocked at this cynical avowal , and when I commuriicated my reflections to my stonemason friend he explained to me that this gentleman , having been defeated at the previous election , when he sought the support of the radical party , now hoped to be elected by the support of the labor vote . " We accept their services for the present , " my friend concluded , " but when the revolution comes , our first move will be to throw all of them overboard . " Then came a great meeting , hastily convoked , to protest , as it was said , against the calumnies of the Journal do Gen*ve . This organ of the moneyed classes of Geneva had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple Unique , and that the building trades were going once more to make a general strike , such as they had made in 1869 . The leaders at the Temple Unique called the meeting . Thousands of workers filled the hall , and Gotin asked them to pass a resolution , the wording of which seemed to me very strange , and concluded a hurried speech in support of it with the words , " If you agree , citizens , with this resolution , I will send it to the press . " He was going to leave the platform , when somebody in the hall suggested that discussion would not be out of place ; and then representatives of all branches of the building trades stood up in succession , saying that the wages had lately been so low that they could hardly live upon them ; that with the opening of the spring there was plenty of work in view , of which they intended to take advantage to increase their wages ; and if an increase were refused they would begin a general strike . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gotin for his behavior . " As a leader , " I told him , " you were bound to know that a general strike was really spoken of . " In my innocence I did not suspect the real motives of the leaders , and it was Ootin himself who made me understand that a strike at that time would be disastrous for the election of the lawyer , Monsieur A. I could not reconcile this wire-pulling by the leaders with the burning speeches I had heard them pronounce from the platform . I felt disheartened , and spoke to Ootin of my intention to make myself acquainted with the other section of the International Association at Geneva , which was known as time Bakijuists . The name " anarchist " was not much in use then . Gotin gave me at once a word of introduction to another Russian , Nicholas Joukovsky , who belonged to that section , and , looking straight into my face , he added , with a sigh , " Well , you wo n't return to us ; you will remain with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went first to Neuch*tel , and then spent a week or so among the watchmakers in the Jura Mountains . I thus made my first acquaintance with that famous Jura Federation which for the next few years played an important part in the development of socialism , introducing into it the no-government , or anarchist , tendency . At that time , the Jura Federation was becoming a rebel against the authority of the general council of the International Workingmen 's Association . The association was essentially a workingmen s movement ; it had its origin in a union concluded between workers across the Channel for mutual support in labor struggles , and its first public steps were internationally supported strikes . The workers understood it as a labor movement , not as a political party , and in east Belgium , for instance , they had introduced into the statutes , a clause in virtue of which no one could be a member of a section unless employed in a manual trade ; even foremen were excluded . The workers were federalist in principle . Each nation , each separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left free to develop on its own lines . But the middle-class revolutionists of the old school who had entered the Iiiternational , imbued as they were with the notions of the centralized , pyramidal secret organizations of earlier times , had introduced the same notions into the Workingmen 's Association . Beside the federal and national councils , a general council was nominated at Loudon , to act as a sort of intermediary between the councils of the different nations . Marx and Engels were the leading spirits of the London general council . It soon appeared , however , that the mere fact of having such a central body became a source of substantial inconvenience . The general council was not satisfied with playing the part of a correspondcnce bureau ; it strove to govern the movement , to approve or to censure the action of the local federations and sections , and even of individual members . When the Commune insurrection began in Paris , - and " the leaders had only to follow , " and could not say whereto they would be led within the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurrection from London . It required daily reports about the events , gave orders , favored this and hampered that , and thus put in evidence the disadvantage of having a governing body , even within the association . It set people thinking about the uselessness of any government , democratic though its origin may be . This was the first spark of anarchism . The separation between leaders and workers which I had noticed at Geneva did not exist in the Jura Mountains . There were a number of men who were more intelligent , and especially more // active , than the others ; but that was all . James Guillaume , one of the most intelligent and broadly educated men I ever met , was a proofreader and the manager of a small printing office . He was then translating a novel from German into French , and was paid eight francs - one dollar and sixty cents - for sixteen pages ! In a little valley in the Jura hills there is a succession of small towns and villages , whose French-speaking population was entirely employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchmaking . Whole families used to work in small workshops ; in one of them I found another leader , Adhemar Schwitzguebel , with whom , also , I afterward became very closely connected . He sat among a dozen young men who were engraving lids of gold and silver watches . I was asked to take a seat on a bench , or table , and soon we were all engaged in a lively conversation upon socialism , government or no government , and the coming congresses . In the evening a heavy snowstorm raged ; it blinded us and froze the blood in our veins , as we struggled to the next village . But , notwithstanding the storm , about fifty watchmakers , chiefly old people , came from the neighboring villages and towns , - some of them as much as seven miles distant , - to join a small informal meeting that was called for that evening . The very organization of the watch trade , which permits men to know one another thoroughly and to work in their own houses , where they are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this population is higher than that of workers who spend all their life from early childhood in the factories . There is more independence and more originality among them . But the absence of a division between the leaders and the masses in the Jura Federation was also the reason why there was no question upon which every member of a Revolutionist. of the federation would not strive to form his own independent opinion . Here I saw that the workers were not a mass that was being led and made subservient to the political ends of a few men ; their leaders were simply their more active brethren , - initiators rather than leaders . The clearness of insight , the soundness of judgment , the capacity for disentangling complex social questions , which I noticed amongst these workers , especially the middle-aged ones , deeply impressed me ; and I am firmly persuaded that if the Jura Federation has played a prominent part in the development of socialism , it is not only on account of the importance of the no - government and federalist ideas of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression which was given to these ideas by the good sense of the Jura watchmakers . Without their aid , these conceptions might have remained mere abstractions for a long time .. The theoretical aspects of anarchism , as they were then beginning to be expressed in the Jura Federation ; the criticisms of state socialism - the fear of an economic despotism , far more dangerous than the merely political despotism - which I heard formulated there ; and the revolutionary character of the agitation , appealed strongly to my mind . But the equalitarian relations which I found in the Jura Mountains , the independence of thought and expression which I saw developing in the workers , and their unlimited devotion to the cause appealed far more strongly to my feelings ; and when I came away from the mountains , after a week 's stay with the watchmakers , my views upon socialism were settled . I was an anarchist . A subsequent journey to Belgium , where I could compare once more the centralized political agitation at Brussels with the economic and independent agitation that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my views . . These clothiers were one of // the most sympathetic population* that I ever knew of in Europe . x . During my journey I had bought a number of books and collections of socialist newspapers . In Russia , the books were " unconditionally prohibited " by censorship ; and some of the collections of newspapers and reports of international congresses could not be bought for any amount of money , even in Belgium . " Shall I part with them , while my brother and my friends would be so happy to see them at St. Petersburg ? " I asked myself ; and I decided that by all means I must take them into Russia . I returned to St. Petersburg via Vienna and Warsaw . Jews , it was said , lived by smuggling on the Polish frontier , and if I could succeed in discovering one of them , my books surely would be carried in safety over the border . However , to stop at a small railway station to bunt for smugglers , while all other passengers continued on their journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a side branch of the railway and went to Cracow . " The capital of old Poland is near to the frontier , " I thought , " and I shall find there some Jew who will lead me to the men I seek . " I reached the once renowned and brilliant city in the evening , and early next morning went out from the hotel on my search . What was my bewilderment when at every street corner , and wherever I turned my eyes in the otherwise deserted market place , I saw a Jew , wearing the traditional long dress and locks of his forefathers , and watching for some Polish nobleman or tradesman who might send him on an errand and pay him a few coppers for the service . I wanted to find one Jew ; and now there were too many of them . Whom should I approach ? I made the round of the town , and then , in my despair , I decided to accost the Jew who stood at the entrance gate of my hotel , - an immense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former days , every hall was filled with elegant crowds of gayly dressed dancers , butt which now performed the most prosaic function of giving shelter and food to a few occasional travelers . I explained to the man my desire of smuggling in a rather heavy bundle of books and newspapers . " Very easily done , sir , " he replied . " I will just bring to you the representative of the Universal Company for the International Exchange of Rags and Bones . They carry on the largest smuggling business in the world , and he is sure to oblige you . " Half an hour later he really returned with the representative of the company , - a most elegant young man , who spoke in perfection Russian , German , and Polish . He looked at my bundle , weighed it with his hands , and asked what sort of books were in it . " All severely prohibited by Russian censorship : that is why they must be smuggled in . " " Our business , " he said in reply , " is costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by weight , according to our silk tariff , I should have to name you a quite extravagant price . And then , to tell the truth , I do n't much like meddling with books . The slightest mishap , and they ' would make of it a political affair , and then it would cost the Universal Rags and Bones Company a tremendous sum of money to get clear of it . " I probably looked very sad , for the elegant young man who represented the Universal Rags and Bones Company immediately added : " Do n't be troubled . He the hotel commissionnaire will arrange it for you in some other way . " " Oh yes . There are scores of ways to arrange such a trifle , to oblige the gentleman , " jovially remarked the commissionnaire , as he left me . In an hour 's time he came back with another young man . This one took the bundle , put it by the side of the door , and said : " It s all right . If you leave // to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Russia , " and he explained to me how it would be managed . " How much will it cost ? " I asked . " How much are you disposed to pay ? " was the reply . I emptied my purse on the table , and said : " That much for my journey . The remainder is yours . I will travel third class ! " Wai , wai , wai ! " exclaimed both men at once . " What are you saying , sir ? Such a gentleman travel third class ! Never ! No , no , no , that wo n't do . . . . Five dollars will do for us , and then one dollar or so for the commissionnaire , if you are agreeable to it , - just as much as you like . We are not highway robbers , but honest tradesmen . " And they bluntly refused to take more money . I had often heard of the honesty of the Jewish smugglers on the frontier ; but I had never expected to have such a proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many books from abroad , or still later , when so many revolutionists arid refugees crossed the frontier in entering or leaving Russia , there was not a case in which the smugglers betrayed any one , or took advantage of circumstances to exact an exorbitant price for their services . Next day I left Cracow ; and at the designated Russian station a porter approached my compartment , and , speaking loudly , so as to be heard by the gendarme who was walking along the platform , said to me , " Here is the bag your highness left the other day , " and handed me my precious parcel . I was so happy to have it that I did not even stop at Warsaw , but continued my journey directly to St. Petersburg , to show my trophies to my brother . XI . Serfdom was abolished in Russia . But quite a network of habits and customs of domestic slavery , of utter disregard of human individuality , of despotism on the part of the fathers , and of hypocritical submission on that of the wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the two hundred and fifty years that serfdom had existed . Everywhere in Europe , at the beginning of this century , there was a great deal of domestic despotism , - the writings of Thackeray and Dickens bear ample testimony to it ; but nowhere else had that tyranny attained such a luxurious dovelopment as in Russia . All Russian li1*e , in the family , in the relations between commander and subordinate , military chief and soldier , employer and employee , bore the stamp of it . Quite a world of customs and manners of thinking , of prejudices and moral cowardice , of habits bred by a lazy existence , had grown up ; and even the best men of the time paid a large tribute to these products of the serfdom period . Law could have no grip upon these things . Only a vigorous social movement , which would attack the very roots of the evil , could reform the habits and customs of every-day life ; and in Russia this movement - this revolt of the individual - took a far more powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than anywhere in Western Europe or America . " Nihilism* ' was the name that Turgu6neff gave it in his epoch-making novel , Fathers and Sons . The movement is wholly misunderstood in Western Europe . In the press , for example , nihilism is continually confused with terrorism . The revolutionary disturbance which broke out in Russia toward the close of the reign of Alexander II. , and ended in the tragical death of the Tsar , is constantly described as nihilism . No greater mistake , however , could be made . To confuse nihilism with terrorism is as wrong as to confuse a philosophical movement like stoicism or positivism with a political movement like , let us say , repub // licanism . Terrorism was called into existence by certain special conditions of the political struggle at a given historical moment . It has lived , and has died . But nihilism has impressed its stamp upon the whole of the life of the educated classes of Russia , and that stamp will be retained for many years to come . It is nihilism , divested of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a young movement of that sort , - which gives now to the life of a great portion of the educated classes of Russia a certain peculiar character which we Russians regret not to find in the life of Western Europe . It is nihilism , again , iii its various manifestations , which gives to many of our writers that remarkable sincerity , that habit of " thinking aloud , " which astounds Western European readers . First of all , the nihilist declared war upon what may be described as " the conventional lies of civilized mankind . " Absolute sincerity was his distinctive feature , and in the name of that sincerity he gave up , and asked others to give up , those superstitions , prejudices , habits , and customs which their own reason could not justify . He refused to bend before any authority except that of reason , and in the analysis of every social institution or habit he revolted against any sort of more or less masked sophism . He broke , of course , with the superstitions of his fathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agnostic , a Spencerian evolutionist , or a scientific materialist ; and while he never attacked the simple , sincere religious belief which is a psychological necessity of feeling , he bitterly fought against the hypocrisy that leads people to assume the outward mask of a religion which they repeatedly throw aside as useless ballast . The life of civilized people is full of little conventional lies . Persons who hate each other , meeting in the street , make their faces radiant with a happy smile ; the nihilist remained unmoved , and smiled only for those whom lie was really glad to meet . All those forms of outward politeness which are mere hypocrisy were equally repugnant to him , and he assumed a certain external roughness as a protest against the smooth amiability of his fathers . He saw them wildly talking as idealist sentimentalists , and at the same time acting as real barbarians toward their wives , their children , and their serfs ; and he rose in revolt against that sort of sentimentalism which , after all , so nicely accommodated itself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the same sweeping negation . Continual talk about beauty , the ideal , art for art 's sake , iesthetics , and the like , so willingly indulged in while every object of art was bought with money exacted from starving peasants , inspired him with disgust , and all the criticisms which Tolstoy now makes against art were expressed forty years ago in the sweeping S assertion , " A pair of boots is more important than all your refined talk about Shakespeare . " Marriage without love , and familiarity without friendship , were equally repudiated . The nihilist girl , compelled by her parents to be a doll in a Doll 's House , and to marry for property 's sake , preferred to abandon her house and her silk dresses , put on a black woolen dress of the plainest description , crop off her hair , and go to a high school , in order to win there her personal independence . The nihilist carried his love of sincerity even into the minutest details of every-day life . He discarded the conventional forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terse way , even with a certain affectation of outward roughness . Two great Russian novelists , Turgu6-neff and Gonchar6ff , have tried to represent this new type in their novels . Gonchar6ff , in Precipice , taking a real but // unrepresentative individual of this class made a caricature of nihilism . Turgu*neff was too good an artist , and had himself conceived too much admiration for the new type , to let himself be drawn into caricature painting ; but even his nihilist , Baz*roff , did not satisfy us . We found him too harsh , especially in his relations with his old parents , and , above all , we reproached him with his seeming neglect of his duties as a citizen . Russian youth could not be satisfied with the merely negative attitude of Turgu6neff 's hero . Nihilism , with its affirmation of the rights of the individual and its negation of all hypocrisy , was but a first step toward a higher type of men and women , who are equally free , but live for a great cause . In the nihilists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less artistic novel , What is to be Done ? they saw better portraits of themselves . " It is bitter , the bread that has been made by slaves , " our poet Nekr*soff wrote . Tffe young generation actually refused to eat that bread , and to enjoy the riches that had been accumulated in their fathers ' houses by means of servile labor , whether the laborers were actual serfs or slaves of the present industrial system . in nearly every wealthy family a bitter struggle was going on between the fathers , who wanted to maintain the old traditions , and the sons and daughters , who defended their right to dispose of their life according to their own ideals , and refused to follow the career prescribed to them by their elders . Young men left the military service , the counter , the shop , and flocked to the university towns . Girls , bred in the most aristocratic families , rushed penniless to St. Petersburg and Moscow , eager to learn a profession which would free them from the domestic yoke , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband . After hard and bitter struggles , many of them won that personal freedom . Now they wanted to utilize it , not for their own personal enjoyment , but for carrying to the people the knowledge that had emancipated them . In every town of Russia , in every quarter of St. Petersburg , small groups were formed for self-improvement and selfeducation ; the works of the philosophers , the writings of the economists , the historical researches of the young Russian historical school , were carefully read in these circles , and the reading was followed by endless discussions . The aim of all that reading and discussion was to solve the great question which rose be All Russia read with astonishment , in 4 fore them . In what way could they be the indictment which was produce at useful to the masses ? Gradually , they the court against Karak6zoff and his friends , that these young men , owners of considerable fortunes , used to live three or four in the same room , never spending more than five dollars apiece a month for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fortunes for starting coöperative associations , cotperative workshops ( where they themselves worked ) , and the like . Five years later , thousands and thousands of the Russian youth  --  the best part of it - were doing the same . Their watchword was , " Vnar6d ! " ( To the people be the people . ) During the years 1860-65 , came to the idea that the only way was to settle amongst the people , and to live the people 's life . Young men went into the villages as doctors , doctors ' helpers , teachers , village scribes , even as agricultural laborers , blacksmiths , woodcutters , and so on , and tried to live there in close contact with the peasants . Girls passed teachers ' examinations , learned midwifery or nursing , and went by the hundred into the villages , devoting themselves entirely to the poorest part of the population . When I returned from Switzerland I found this movement in full swing . // XII . I hastened , of course , to share with my friends my impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the university I had no friends , properly speaking ; I was older than most of my companions , and a difference of a few years is an obstacle to complete comradeship , at that age . It must also be said that since the new rules of admission to the university had been introduced in 1861 , the best of the independent and rich young men were sifted in the gymnasia , and did not gain admittance to the university . Consequently , the majority of my comrades were good boys , laborious , but taking no interest in anything besides the examinations . I was friendly with only one of them : let me call him Dmitri Kelnitz . He was born in South Russia , and although his name was German he hardly spoke German , and his face was South Russian rather than Teutoaic . He was very intelligent , had read a great deal , and had seriously thought over what he had read . He loved science and deeply respected it , but , like many of us , lie soon came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to join the camp of the Philistines , and that there was plenty of other and more urgent work that he could do . He attended the university lectures for two years , and then abandoned them , giving himself entirely to social work . He lived anyhow ; I even doubt if he had a permanent lodging . Sometimes he would come to me and ask , " Have you some paper ? ' * and having taken a supply of it , he would sit perhaps at the corner of a table for an hour or two , diligently making a translation . The little that he earned in this way was more than sufficient to satisfy all his limited wants . Then he would hurry to a distant part of the town to see a comrade or to help a needy friend ; or he would cross St. Petersburg on foot , to a remote suburb , in order to obtain free admission to a college for some boy in whom the comrades were interested . He was undoubtedly a gifted man . In Western Europe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position of political or socialist leadership . No thought of such a tIming ever entered the brain of Kelnitz . To lead men was by no means his ambition , and there was no work too insignificant for him to do . This trait , however , was not distinctive of him alone ; all those who had lived some years in the students ' circles of those times were possessed of it in a high degree . Soon after my return Kelnitz invited me to join a circle which was known amongst the youth as " the Circle of* Tchaykovsky . " Under this name it played an important part in the history of the social movement in Russia , and under this name it will go down to history . " Its members , " Kelnitz said to me , " have hitherto been mostly constitutionalists ; but they are excellent men , with minds open to any honest idea ; they have plenty of friends all over Russia , and you will see later on what you can do . " I already knew Tchaykovsky , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won my heart at our first meeting , and our friendship has remained unshaken for twenty-seven years . The beginning of this circle was a very small group of young men and women , - one of whom was Sophie Per6vskaya , - who had united for purposes of self-education and self-improvement . I Tchaykovsky was of their number . In 1869 Nech*1ieff had tried to start in Russia a secret revolutionary organiza-. tion , and to secure this end lie resorted to the ways of old conspirators , without recoiling even before deceit when he wanted to force his associates to follow his lead . Such methods could have no success in Russia , and very soon his society broke down . All the members were arrested , and some of time best and purest of the Russian youth went to // Siberia before they had done anything . The circle of self-education of which I am speaking was constituted in opposition to the methods of Nechilieff . The few friends had judged , quite correctly , that a morally developed individuality must be the foundation of every organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme of action it may adopt in the course of future events . This was why the Circle of Tchaykovsky , gradually widening its programme , spread so extensively in Russia , achieved such important results , and Inter on , when circumstances and the ferocious prosecutions of the government created a revolutionary struggle , produced that remarkable set of men'and women who fell in the terrible contest they waged against autocracy . At that time , however , - that is , in 1872 , - the circle had nothing revolutionary in it . If it had remained a mere circle of self-improvement , it would soon have petrified , like a monastery . But the members found a suitable work . They began to spread good books . They bought the works of Lassalle , Bervi ( on the condition of the laboring classes in Russia ) , Marx , and so on , - whole editions , - and distributed them among students in the provinces . In a few years , there was not a town of importance in " thirty-eight provinces of the Russian Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have a group of comrades engaged in the spreading of that sort of literature . Gradually , following the general drift of the times , and stimulated by the news which came from Western Europe about the rapid growth of the labor movement , the circle became more and more a centre of socialistic propaganda among the educated youth , and a natural intermediary between numbers of provincial circles ; / and then , one day , the ice between stu dents and workers was broken , and direct relations were established with working people at St. Petersburg and in some of the provinces . It was at that juncture that I joined the circle , in the spring of 1872 . All secret societies are fiercely prosecuted in Russia , and the Western reader will perhaps expect from me a description of my initiation and of the oath of allegiance which I took . I must disappoint him , because there was nothing of the sort , and could not be ; we should have been the first to laugh at such ceremonies , and Kelnitz would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks , which would have killed any ritual . There was not even a statute . The circle accepted as members only persons who were well ( known and had been tested in various circumstances , and of wham it was felt that they could be trusted absolutely . Before a new member was received , his character w* discussed with the frankness and seriousness which were characteristic of the nihilist . The slightest token of insincerity or conceit would have barred the way to admission . The circle did not care to make a show of numbers , and had no tendency to concentjate in its hands all the activity that was going on amongst the youth , or to include in one organization the scores of different circles which existed in the capitals and the provinces . With most of them friendly relations were maintained ; they were helped , and they helped us , when necessity arose , but no assault was made on their autonomy . The circle preferred to remain a closely united group of friends ; and never did I meet elsewhere such a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons whose acquaintance I made at the first meeting of the Circle of Tchaykovsky . I still feel proud of having been received into that family .
