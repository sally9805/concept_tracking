txt As a result of informal talks among State Democrats of prominence who have been in this city of late there is a crop of rumors as to the possibilities at the next State Convention . A Secretary of State , Controller , Treasurer , Attorney General , Engineer , and Sur , veyor , and an Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals are to be elected next November . Such talk of candidates as has come to the suitface indicates a disposition to select those who will command the support of both elements in the party . Something was said in The New-York Times 's dispatches from Albany last Sunday morning of a possible conference of Democrats , which would discuss , among other topics , this question of all hands getting together . The gossip to-day indicates that it may be an easy task , comparatively , to do this , if the selection of candidates can be considered sufficient to harmonize the Snappers and Anti-Snappers . Three men have been spoken of as furnishing proper timber for the Attorney Generalship . One is John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assemblyman , and is closely allied politically with Senator Hill , having once - been his law partner . The others both come from Watertown . They are John W. Hogan and Daniel G. Griffin . Mr. Griffin has been active in politics , having served on the State Committee , and at one time being Chairman of the Executive Committee . Although allied with the regular organization he is counted one of the strong supporters of President Cleveland , and as such is thought to be acceptable to the Anti-Snappers . Two possibilities have been named for the Controllership , both of whom are men who stand well with the party at large . They are ex-Congressman W. J. Coombs of Brooklyn and T. E. Ashe of Fonda , Montgomery County . Mr. Ashe is a son-in-law of James Shannahan , who was appointed by Mr. Cleveland , when Governor , as Superintendent of Public Works . Mr. Ashe himself has held minor State positions , and is now in the National Secret Service . For Secretary of State no names have been made public , but some Democrats have thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resident of New-York City . The Republican office holders are wondering what Mr. Platt proposes to do with them . While the surface indications are that Secretary of State Palmer is to be renominated this is not considered a foregone conclusion by some of his friends . He was supposed to be the choice of the veteran soldiers , and with a large element of the veterans he is popular beyond question . Whether Mr. Platt will be able to find some man who will at the same time be as popular with the veterans , and be a more expert politician , is the question which is agitating Gen. Palmer 's friends . OBSERVANCE OF FLAG DAY . Sons of the American Revolution Request that the Stars and Stripes Be Displayed in Schools and BLiewhere .
