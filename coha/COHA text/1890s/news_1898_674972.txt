txt There is a very serious aspect to the announcement that Gen. LAMBERT of the French Army accuses Col. SCHWARZKOPFEN , the former Military Attach ? of the German Embassy in Paris , of reviving the Dreyfus case . The cable does not tell us what facts or arguments the French officer adduces to make good his charge . No facts are publicly known which tend to bear it out . The . , German General Staff and the German Government have main-tained , so far as is known , an attitude of complete and discreet reticence about the whole business . qwq Public is , transacted'in-priyacy . One of these rumors is that the Kaiser offered to the courtmartial which condemned DREYFUS his personal assurance that no military representative of Germany had had any dealings with DRAYFLTS . This rumor is evidently not ecmaistent with the other rumor that it was not Germany but Russia with which " the traitor " ' dealt , whoever the traitor may have been , But if the court-martial did receive , and declined to accept , the German Emperor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Germany was concerned , the fact would make plausible the Plea that to reopen the case or to publish the proceedings would " compromise the national defense . " But Gen. LAMBERT 'S accusation is far more mischievous than would be a mere refusal to revise the case . Ile very distinctly " compromises the national defense " in so far as that defense would be compromised by picking a quarrel with Germany . There is , on the face of the matter , no reason whatever why the name of a- former Military Attach ? of Germany in Paris should be brought intO the discussion . There is not the slightest presumption in favor of the charge , and even if the charge were true and established , it would be politically most inadvisable to bring it forward . Why then is it brought forward ? The answer to this question is equally obvious and discreditable . The charge is brought forward for the purpose of throwing the French people off the true scent . The true scent leads straight to the headquarters of the French Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bad way . The reputation of the General Staff and of the , Ministry of War is already gone . The object of those who have been accomplices in the proceedings by which DREYFUS has been unjustly condemned , unjustly whether or not he is in fact guilty , must be to divert attention from their own conduct . It can not be denied that an accusation against the German Army is about as promising a diversion as could be devised . It is an accusation easy to make , difficult to disprove , and calculated to excite the French people , with their predisposition to believe anything and everything that is injurious to Germany . But at the same time it is so very perilous an enterprise to excite the French people against Germany that a - resort to . it seems to be a shift of extreme desperation . Any Frenchman who takes action calculated to make active the French enmity toward Germany incurs a responsibility that is really frightful .                   @ @
