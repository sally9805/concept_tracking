txt Edward Lauterbach came to this city this morning bringing a copy of the police bill he has drawn . He submitted it to Gov . Black , and endeavored to show that it ought to have the support of the Chief Executive . Gov . Black did not indicate that he would favor the measure at all , and there is an impression that he let it be known at the outset that he was opposed to the bill on general principles . If he favors it in any degree it will be because its advocates have shown that it is practically a necessity to relieve the " situation " in the present Police Board , and to bring all of the Greater New York under a single Bureau of Elections at the first election in the consolidated city . Payn Was Present . The conference between Mr. Lauterbach and the Governor took place in the private rooms of the Executive Chamber at 12:30 o'clock . Insurance Commissioner Louis F. Payn was with them . The bill was read and all its features were gone over as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . After it was over , it was said that to say that Gov . Black would actively oppose the bill would be stating the case too strongly . It was an open question with him what attitude to take with his first impression against it . Much Opposition Developed . It has become apparent during the four or five days in which the bill has been discussed in the newspapers that opposition to it is developing among the legislators . The leaders say they know nothing about it as an organization measure , and they show greater indifference than to most measures which are known to have organization backing . This has gone so far that doubts have been expressed if the bill be even introduced , although Mr. Lauterbach said he certainly expected it would be presented early next week . Mr. Lauterbach took the bill back to New York with him this afternoon . Mr. Lauterbach Non-Committal . Just before he went to the train he told a correspondent of THE NEw YORK TIMES that he had gone over the ground quite fully with the Governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same subject . " Do you think Gov . Black will favor the bill ? " was asked . " That I can not say , " he replied . " It would hardly be expected that he would do so before the bill had been introduced . " " Do you find any opposition to it here ? " " I have made no canvass , " he said . " Do you think the Wray bill , giving to Mayor Strong a general power of removal , Will be seriously considered ? " " We have tried one Power of Removal ? bill , " said Mr. Lauterbach , " and so far as good Republicans in New York are concerned , I know of no desire to continue the experiment . " Features of the Bill . Mr. Lauterbach said he would not make public the text of the bill until it is introduced . It is said it is nearly the same as the police section in the Greater New York charter , except that the Governor is to appoint the Commissioners instead of the Mayor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill believe that his objection to the measure lies in this particular point . COMMENTS ON BOTH SIDES . . Opinions Which Come from Brooklyn and Controller Fitch . Pending action at Albany on the bill proposed to legislate the present Pollee Commissioners out of office , and substitute therefor a board modeled after the plan of the old Metropolitan police , there is still much discussion , not only as to the policy of the measure , but also its constitutionality . Some opinions follow : Controller Ashbel P. Fitch . Controller Fitch refused to express an opinion as to the constitutionality of the proposed legislation , as he had not seen the bill which Mr. Lauterbach has drawn up . " My opinion as to the present Police Board and its President , " he added , " Is too well known to need repetition . As to whether the proposed change would be better or worse than the existing situation I do not care to say . I prefer to let my pugnacious friend Roosevelt fight his battles without suggestion from me. " enough then , he ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter is the Republicans are working to control the Police Department in the interest of their organization , with the idea of using it at the coming elections . I believe they will learn their mistake too late . I agree with THE NEW Yon z TIMES that such legislation will destroy the party that advocates it . I am not in favor of the metropolitan system at all . The cities are quite competent to govern themselves , and should be allowed to do so . I am in favor of consolidation , and believe the provisions of the charter should be carried out . " Edward F. Linton . Edward F. Lenton of Brooklyn , one of the original Commissioners on Consolidation , is an ardent supporter of Mr. Platt . He said yesterday that he is in favor of ' any scheme for the better government of the city that commends itself to Mr. Platt , and added : " If only one-half of the stories I have read of the present New York Board of Police Commissioners be true , the sooner they are legislated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn . Few of the Brooklyn officials cared to give opinions on the proposed measure . Mayor Wurster said there was no doubt if the Police Board would cease wrangling the efficiency of the force would be improved , and no legislation would be necessary . President Berri , of the Brooklyn Bridge Commission , said he was too busy looking after bridge affairs to investigate the troubles of the New York police force , and Police Commissioner Welles queried : " Did you ever hear of a man being hanged for talking too little ? No ? Neither did I. " Edward M. Grout . " Of course , " said Edward M. Grout of Brooklyn , " I do not know who is in the right in the New York Police Board squabble , and it really does not affect the real matter at issue . It appears to me , however , that the Mayor ought to be able to settle the trouble without admitting that he is powerless to administer his office . The proposition to have the present board legislated out of office , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolitan system , is simply outrageous . We have had too much city government from Albany already . Each city should govern itself , and either elect or appoint its own officials . " Mayor Strong 's course should be plain . Let him decide to his own satisfaction which of his Commissioners is not doing his duty , remove him promptly , and if the Governor declines to approve the rdemoval , let the responsibility be with the Governor . It is said that what Mr. Platt desires to be done will be done . That depends . Mr. Platt is a clever , far-seeing man , and it is not at all likely that he will persist in any course for long when he encounters the steady opposition of outraged public sentiment . " Bernard J. York . Bernard J. York , Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Kings County Democracy , is opposed to State control of the city departments . " I think the proposed scheme an outrage , " he said . " The Republicans are using a temporary difficulty in the New York Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a change is needed in the board , and it can be made no other way consistent with the principles of home rule , get rid of the board as now composed , and let Mayor Strong appoint 4 new one . If he was good
