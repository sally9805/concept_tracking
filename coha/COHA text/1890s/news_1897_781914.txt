txt Before the Senate has finished the , consideration of the Tariff bill in Committee of the Whole , and in anticipation of any effort that mtay be made in the later stages of consideration to exclude new matter , the Finance Committee may be directed to weigh the proposition to protect the American producer of news that is a strictly American production , advanced by labor and American ingenuity beyond the condition of raw material . Real news is now protected , in an adequate measure , by the copyright law . But the news that seems to be simply manufactured is absolutely without any protection whatever . Whether the police may not interfere with the carrying out of such a law Ias seems to be necesq sary to encourage this industry , which is a recurring infant , is a question . A certain appearance of legitimacy may be given to manufactured news by extending protection to it , and if the Senate can be convinced that news can be manufactured of such quality and in such quantity as to reverse the popular notion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manufactured news may hope for protection equal in extent to that lavished upon the American Refineries Company . Washington news of a certain sort will at once become entitled to the benefits ? of a law to protect the contrivers of information from that city . Speaker REED , who has just been made conspicuous by a hatched-up.scheme , contrived by a newspaper reporter , to be afterward " exclusively " reported for " his " paper , will have to be reasoned with perhaps , and must be approached with strong arguments before he will consent to a rule to " jam " through protection which he does not need against dangers that he does not fear , but Mr. 33mTor .. u-r may be able to overcome his opposition by representations to the Czar about the desirability of securing a " symmetrical " tariff law .
