txt THE propriety of the existence of some power to pardon persons convicted of crime is recognized in every well-regulated government . This essential attribute is based upon the conceded imperfection of human action in the punishment of offenders . The Marquis Beccaria said that the power of pardon does not exist under a perfect administration of the laws , and that the admission of the power is a tacit acknowledgment of the infirmity of the course of justice . Story speaks of this power as " a benign prerogative . " Montesquien regarded it as " the most glorious attribute of sovereignty . " Chancellor Kent says that " a power to pardon seems , indeed , indispensable uuder the most correct administration of the law by human tribunals ; since , otherwise , men would sometimes fall a prey to the vindictiveness of accusers , the inaccuracy of testimony , and the fallibility of jurors and courts . " Hamilton , as early as 1788 , said in The Federalist that " the criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt , justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel . " Jeremy Bentham , speaking of the exercise of this prerogative in England , expressed the sentiment that " the power of pardoning is often said to be one of the brightest jewels in the royal crown ; it is burdensome as it is bright , not only to those who submit to the crown , but still more so to him also who wears it . " This important function of government seems to be securely established , because public selitiment rebels at the idea that the determination of a criminal court should be absolutely and forever irrevocable . It may be regarded as the true province of a government tlrnt it should provide for mercy a well as for justico // 61 - for reformation as well as for punishment . A learned modern law-writer , treating of this subject , has asserted that " the idea of justice , stern , certain , and unappeasable , is inconsistent with the better impulses of our nature , repugnant to the teachings of our religion , and in conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our prisons from penitentiaries to reformatories . " In monarchical countries the power of pardon is vested in the crown . There the king is usually the prosecutor of all offences against the criminal laws of the realm , and in his name all actions are brought ; therefore it is appropriate in theory that he should have the power to remit any punishment inflicted for the vindication of public justice . In this country all power is in the people and criminal offences are deemed committed against the public , but nevertheless the constitution of the United States provides that the President " shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . " In the States the power is usually vested in the Governor , either alone or by and with the advice of his council or a board or court of pardons . In at least twenty-eight States the power is reposed in the Governor alone . In at least seven States the power is conferred upon the Governor acting with a board , court , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Legislature . In two States the Governor and Senate may exercise the power . I am not advised as to the other States . In the State of New York it is provided in its constitution that " the Governor shall have the power to grant reprieves , commutations , and pardons , after conviction , for all offences except treason- and cases of impeachment , upon such conditions and with such restrictions and limitations as he may think proper , subject to such regulations as may be provided by law relative to the manner of applying for pardons . " This authority , upon its face , would seem to be more essential and beneficial than that conferred upon the President . While a cursory perusal might lead to that conclusion , a more careful examination , however , proves otherwise . While it is true that the clause conferring authority upon the President does not expressly mention " commutations ' * and is silent upon the matter of " conditions , restrictions , and limitations , " which the Governor is expressly at liberty to impose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same powers , because it has been adjudicated that the general power of pardon includes the lesser power of coinmutation , and that it also carries with it the implied authority to impose any conditions which the President may desire to impose . The recital of these two powers , therefore , in the New York constitution , may now be regarded as unnecessary verbiage . Besides , the Governor 's power to pardon is restricted to cases " after conviction , " while the President 's power , being general and unlimited , may be exercised at any time after the commission of the offence , whether before or after an actual conviction . It will be observed that the Governor can not pardon for the offence of treason or in cases of impeachment , while the President may exercise his prerogative in every case except impeachment cases . The right to grant a pardon for the offence of treason was wisely conferred upon the President . For obvious public reasons it is essential and appropriate that the Chief Executive of the nation should always be in a position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion or insurrection , or subsequent thereto . No other official can so well understand the situation , or appreciate the motives of public policy which induce and require action in such emergencies . There is no legal distinction between a pardon and an amnesty . Amnesty , however , is said to be " a compact rather than a grant , and is addressed to a population instead of an individual . " A pardon includes amnesty . There is no restriction to the " conditions* ' which an Executive may attach to a pardon , except that the courts have held that they must be reasonable . It is , of course , implied that he can not impose impossible conditions . The most usual conditions are as follows : first , where the crime was committed in a state of intoxication , the convict is frequently required to abstain from the use of intoxicating liquors for a certain period of time . generally five years-sometimes for life , especially in cases of homicide ; second , where it appears that the public interests will be peculiarly subserved or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often required to leave the State or country either permanently or for a stated time . It may be safely asserted that experience has demonstrated that the conditions exacted have been generally fulfilled in good faith . It is believed that the requirement in regard to abstaining from the use of liquors has been productive of much benefit . Many instances // can be recalled where the convict has been thoroughly reformed and where he not only remained sober during the allotted period , but ever afterwards . In some cases convicts thus released have become conspicuously earnest in their zeal for the temperance cause , and have afforded practical testimony as to the wisdom of such a condition . It can not be denied that drunkcnness is a fruitful source of crime , and any restriction which tends to lesseii the evil should in proper cases be freely imposed and rigorously enforced , not only for the good of the convict , but also for the protection of society . The utility of the other condition is not so obvious , and it has seldom been imposed in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is good policy for the Executive of each State to seek to make some other State the asylum for its criminals or to unload them upon other countries . It would seem to be preferable that each State and country should keep within its own borders its own pardoned criminals , maintaining over them such surveillance as prudence may dictate . A general policy of expulsion towards the recipients of executive clemency in one State is likely to induce a similar course in another State by way of retaliation , and a system is thereby inaugurated of compelling unfortunate convicts to find a refuge in places other than their own homes . Unless there are extraordinary circumstances to justify exceptions , it is believed that , as a general rule , a condition requiring a convict to leave the State where he was convicted should not be attached to a pardon . Not long since a peculiar and interesting case was presented to me , as Governor of New York , where insistence upon such a condition seemed desirable . A bright young man , scarcely twenty years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents , who were reputable and well-to-do people , to finish his education . Being somewhat wild , he fell among evil companions in New York city and was soon led astray . He stole some money and was sent to prison . In consideration of his youth , his previous good character , and other circumstances , I pardoned him , upon condition that he return immediately to Liberia with the messenger whom his par . ents had sent to accompany him home . It was regarded as appropriate in this case that such a condition should be insisted upon , not especially for the protection of the State , but in the hope of effecting a reformation by restoring him to the custody of his parents // in his own country . He returned to Liberia , and the information which reaches me is that he is now leading a correct life . In whom the power of pardon should be vested is a question upon which there is much difference of opinion . The framers of the federal constitution and of most of our State constitutions came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the prerogative properly belonged to the Chief Executive . There has been a tendency of late years towards the establishment of a council or board in which should be reposed at least some advisory functions pertaining to pardons . It has been strongly urged that the power is a judicial function , and that its lodgement in the Executive or in the Legislature is an anomaly in our institutions . It has also been argued that the power is too important a one to be reposed in a single official , especially a Chief Executive who is usually overburdened with administrative duties , and who must find it impossible to devote the necessary time for the proper consideration of the numerous cases which are constantly before him . On the other hand , it is said that there ought not to be a division of responsibility in such matters . It is suggested that , while the responsibility is fearful to contemplate , its very magnitude induces scrupulousness and caution . It is contended that a tribunal of four men can better evade , shift , and shirk responsibility than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be moved by extraneous influences than is a council or board . Hamilton , who was well versed in the science of government , reached the conclusion that " one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of the government than a body of men . " The force of that conclusion is much augmented if it be conceded that the one man is conscientious , independent , and resolute . It must be admitted that there have been some scandals connected with the discharge of this power by councils or boards in certain States , while there has been no serious allegation that the power has ever been abused by an Executive . Whether favoritism , prejudice , and sympathy , in the execution of this high function , can better be avoided by a body of officials than by a single official is a question not free from difficulty , and there are plausible , if not reasonably satisfactory , arguments on both sides . It is probably true that the trend of public opinion is against the " one // man power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law-writers join in the opposition . It is very likely the popular side . But after an experience of seven years in the administration of this great trust , I feel constrained to say that it is my deliberate conviction that our fathers were wise when they provided that the pardoning power should be lodged in the Chief Executive alone , and , in my opinion , it ought not now to be transferred . I am aware of the criticism which a single official evokes in the fearless performance of his duty ; of his liability to err ; of the vast responsibility which he assumes , involving frequently the momentous question of life or death ; of the antagonisms which he necessarily creates ; of the severe strain and labor which a conscientious and intelligent discharge of his duties involves ; and yet , even in the light of these considerations , I am still inclined to believe that the public interests are , as a general rule , better subserved where the responsibility is not divided . I realize the fact that other Executives , emerging from several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different view of the matter . I have great respect for their opinions , but I am compelled to differ with them . I recall the instance where a most distinguished and able Governor of a Western State , at the close of his official term , issued a pamphlet earnestly and vigorously arguing against the possession of the pardoning power by the Executive of the State , and advising the creation of a board to assume that function . Under the constitution of his State he was deprived of the veto power , neither could he approve bills , and he had no voice in the legislation enacted , while his principal duties , aside from the exercise of the pardoning power , consisted in the appointment of notaries public ; and yet he seemed to have been so impressed with the responsibility assumed that he actually advocated a transfer to another tribunal of about the only important duty which invested the office of Governor with dignity and character . In other States , where Governors are busily occupied with important legislative and other duties , the suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pardon cases is not without weight ; but with the assistance of a competent and faithful pardon clerk , who is usually , and always should be , provided , it would seem as though a painstaking and diligent Executive should be able to exercise the high prerogative re // posed in him in a reasonably satisfactory manner , and with honor and credit to the commonwealth . It has been asserted that the exercise of clemency is a semijudicial act , and that inasmuch as Executives have , as a general rule , no authority to summon witnesses or to take testimony in a formal way , their examination of pardon cases must necessarily be imperfect and to a large degree ex parte and unsatisfactory , and that , therefore , additional reasons are furnished why such functions should be discharged by a court expressly created for that purpose . There is some force to this contention , because cases are constantly arising where a searching oral examination of witnesses is indispensable to a proper determination of the merits of the application . But this objection does not apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my instance , the Legislature passed an act ( chap . 213 of the laws of 1887 ) , providing for the subpoi*naing of witnesses and the production of books and papers in any matter arising before the Governor upon an application for executive clemency , and also authorizing the Governor to appoint a referee to take any testimony which may be offered . I regard such a statute as a valuable contribution to the facilities required for a proper and just administration of the criminal laws . What are the precise grounds upon which clemency should proceed ? It is easier to ask than to answer this question . It may be assumed that clemency should be based upon public considerations . General and consistent rules should be observed as far as possible , although each case must largely depend upon its own particular circumstances . It is seldom that there are any two cases exactly alike ; and this fact opens up a large field of discretion to be wisely exercised . It is clear that the constitutional provisions to which I have referred are so broad that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is doubtful whether even the courts have the authority to compel an Executive simply to decide a pardon case . He may , by reason of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the application , regard his duty as best discharged by holding the case without final determination at all . It is difficult to discover how his course in that respect can be reviewed by any judicial or other tribunal . He should always act from the highest motives of public policy and regardless of personal consequences ; without trepidation , fear , or favor ; unaffected by political or other improper influences ; // unawed by public clamor or prejudice ; with courage , integrity , and good judgment . There may be occasions when he should interfere as an act of political justice , where some corrupt and unworthy judge , unmindful of his duty , has undertaken to serve the ends of partisanship by the improper exercise of arbitrary powers in cases involving political consequences . Such instances are rare , however . There is a vagueness and indefiniteness surrounding the pardoning power which renders it a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thoroughly appreciated by the public . It is governed by no fixed or arbitrary rules . It is controlled by no higher authority . The popular idea is that it may be exercised at the mere caprice of the Executive , and that he is not obliged to expose his reasons . But the constitution of New York , as well as the constitutions of several other States , requires that the Governor " shall annually communicate to the Legislature each case of reprieve , commutation , or pardon granted , stating the name of the convict , the crime of which he was convicted , the sentence and its date , and the date of the commutation , pardon , or reprieve , " and a long-established custom seems to demand that the reasons upon which his decision is predicated shall accompany his report . There can , therefore , very properly be no secrecy concerning his action . It is a public and not a private proceeding . The Legislature and the people , while unable to reverse his action , may judge of its merits themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of grace . " No one is entitled to it as a matter of strict right . Mere sympathy should not dictate its allowance , but considerations of mercy alone are sometimes sufficient . Shakespeare 's Portia , " a young and learned doctor to our court , " is made to say that the quality of mercy " becomes The throned monarch better than his crown . How far mere mercy may be the controlling motive for granting a pardon is a question addressed solely to the conscience of the Executivo . There can be no just cause of complaint " when mercy seasons justice , " if the act proceeds not from a mere whim , but is approved by an honest and sound discretion . It has been tersely said " that the very notion of mercy implies the accuracy of the claims of justice . " // There are a few general rules or principles which may be laid down as safe to follow in these cases . 1st . The Executive should not interfere to correct mere errors of law which may be remedied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thefinal determination of a criminal case . 3rd . The findings upon disputed questions of fact decided by a jury should usually be regarded as conclusive. 4th . Newly-discovered evidence of the innocence of the prisoner may be accepted , provided relief based upon it can not be had in court . 5th . Cases should not be considered where the term of imprisonment does not exceed a year , except upon the allegation of entire innocence . ( This rule is necessary to relieve the Executive from the multiplicity of small cases arising under sentences from the minor courts. ) 6th . The prisoner 's conduct while in prison must have been good . It may be interesting for the public to know the routine course which is generally taken when an application for a pardon is entertained . A petition must be presented from the convict , or in his behalf , setting forth the nature and circumstances of the conviction and the grounds upon which executive interposition is asked ; and upon its filing a letter is sent to the district attorney who prosecuted the case and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement of the facts of which they have official knowledge , and for their opinion of the merits of the application for pardon . Another letter is sent to the warden of the prison where the convict is confined , asking for a report in reference to the conduct of the prisoner since his incarceration ; and when replies are received from these three sources , the case is ready for examination by the Executive . Naturally the opinions of the judge and district attorney are entitled to considerable weight in the consideration of the case , although they are by no means conclusive . Sometimes the facts upon which clemency is sought have arisen since the trial , and these officials have no knowledge concerning them . Where both concur in reconunending the pardon , it is ordinarily , though not always , granted . If their opinions differ , the case usually receives further and more careful consideration . If the case is otherwise // meritorious , but the conduct of the prisoner while confined has been bad , the application is denied . This seemingly harsh course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison . The cases which are very difficult satisfactorily to decide are those where the prisoner is concededly more or less guilty , but where the punishment which has been imposed seems to be excessive . Some contend that a merely excessive sentence presents no proper ground for executive interference . It is urged , not without some force , that it is not the province of the Executive to revise the sentences of the courts simply because the opinion of the Executive may differ from the opinion of the judge as to the punishment needed . The judge who sees the witnesses and hears all the evidence is certainly more competent , usually , than a stranger to determine what the proper sentence should be . Yet , while all this is true , it is evident that a judge unconsciously is often unduly influenced by the prejudiced atmosphere of a courtroom and the unreasonable clamor of a community , and hastily inflicts a sentence which in his cooler moments he would not deliberately approve ; and injustice would clearly result if a general rule should be observed which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me give an illustration . A young man scarcely twenty-one years of age , living in a rural county in the western part of the State of New York , left his home to find work upon a farm , his parents moving at about the same time to Buffalo . Unable to find steady work , he roamed about the country , and unfortunately fell into the company of a hardened criminal , who persuaded him to accompany him , when one day they entered a dwelling-house , the family being absent , and secured something to eat , and the young man stole a dollar and two cents . They were subsequently arrested , and they both pleaded guilty to burglary , the young man refusing to give his true name for fear his parents would hear of his disgrace . His companion being shown to be an experienced burglar , indignation in the county ran high against the two . Without making any particular inquiry as to the previous history of the young man , the judge sentenced him to twenty-six years ' imprisoninent in the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents did not learn of his misfortune until about June , 1891 , he being all the mean time in prison . His parents then // presented an application for a commutation of his sentence , which was entertained . The district attorney wrote that since the conviction he had " investigated the case more thoroughly , " and had " come to the conclusion that the sentence was somewhat excessive . " The judge attempted no justification , and simply wrote : " I think , on the whole , it would be a wise thing to extend to him executive clemency . " It was shown that the young man had never been arrested before and that his previous character was excellent . I promptly commuted his sentence , and he was immediately released from prison . His sentence was an outrageous one and wholly indefensible . He should have been sent to the Elmira Reformatory , and not to prison . The case fittingly illustrates the necessity for executive interposition in instances where excessive sentences have been thoughtlessly or unfairly imposed . The fatal illness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it is made a very common ground of application for the commutation of sentences , and presents many difficulties . There is a sort of prevailing notion among the people , or some classes of them , that any prisoner ought not to be allowed to die in prison , but that he should be released whenever his illness is believed to be fatal . Such people argue that the public interests can not suffer if the prisoner should be allowed to die outside of prison walls , and that the dictates of humanity require that himself and his friends should be spared the alleged disgrace of such an ending of his life . They seem to forget that both he and they have been , in reality , as much disgraced by the original sentence and imprisonment as they can possibly be by the simple death of the convict in prison ; yet the fact can not be disguised that , either from superstition , prejudice , or whim , the popular idea is that to such a prisoner ought not to be refused the poor privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The denial of such a request does seem cruel and apparently heartless ; yet in seven cases out of ten it is proba. bly true that the accommodations of the prison hospital and the skilled attention which the prisoner receives are far better than would be afforded him among his own friends . It seems quite impossible to establish an arbitrary rule in this class of disagreeable cases . Where the sick prisoner is serving out a life-sentence , the request for release upon the sole ground // of his fatal illness may be more easily denied than when the sentence is for a term of years , because a life-sentence contemplates the death of the convict while in prison , but a fatal illness during a short term is an unexpected event . A practical difficulty arises sometimes when the prisoner is ill and the physicians think he can not recover and his friends arc urging the necessity of sneedy action . The Governor must act promptly and upon the information before him , and is liable to err . An instance is on record in the State of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick convict upon the sole ground that he was likely to die , and , though the medical representations were abundant that his illness would prove fatal , he subsequently recovered and is alive to-day . It might be a questionable exercise of power , or at least a violation of propriety , to make it a condition of granting a pardon that the convict should die or else be returned to prison . Public sentiment would probably revolt at such an obnoxious and unusual condition . In July , 1888 , I commuted to imprisonment for life the deathsentence of an Italian woman named Chiara Cignarale , who had been cons icted of murdering her husband , and among the grounds for my action which were stated at the time , in my " Public Papers** of that year , appears the following " . . . it is certified to me by eminent physicians , in whom I must place confidence , that the prisoner is and has been for some time seriously ill , and that in all probability she can not survive over a year at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One of the most celebrated physicians in the country wrote : " In my opinion , it is impossible for her to live longer than a year at the utmost . " Yet she is alive to-day , and is understood to be enjoying fair health in the New York Penitentiary . Where a sentence is for a short term and a prisoner is so dangerously ill that his recovery is believed to be impossible , the exercise of clemency may be justified in the interest of humanity , although there may be no other grounds upon which to support it . Yet even this safe rule subjects the Executive to the constant importunities of friends who , unnecessarily alarmed at the illness of a prisoner , besiege the Executive for immediate favorable action . The desirability of some general rule of action in these cases // is very apparent . Their proper disposition occasions more anxiety and annoyance to the Executive , and demands greater circumspection , than almost any other class of cases . Whether executive clemency should be freely or sparingly exercised has given rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governors Seymour , Tilden , Robinson , Fenton , Cornell , and Cleveland , of my own State , upon this point , and the impression which I derived from such interviews with all of them , except Governor Cornell , was that , if they had any criticism to express in regard to their own action , it was that they had not exercised the pardoning power freely enough . A* I understood it , they would have preferred to give pardon cases more consideration , but were unable to do so because of numerous other important duties which constantly engaged their attention . Another source of embarrassment to an Executive arises where a jury finds a prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree and at the same time recommends him to the mercy of the court . Such a recommendation is without legal effect and can not be conRidered by the court in mitigation of the sentence which the law imperatively requires shall be imposed . But it is made the basis of an appeal to the Executive for clemency , and must be respectfully considered . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few it has been regarded as of sufficient weight , in connection , however , with other facts , to require executive interference . It is believed that such recommendations should not be encouraged . They enable a jury to escape or evade the just responsibilities which attach to their position . They secure verdicts which otherwise would not be rendered . They unduly stimulate appeals to clemency and arouse expectations which ordinarily can not be realized . Neither should courts , in my judgment , anticipate or prejudice executive action in their determination of criminal cases . I have known of one or two cases where convictions for murder in the first degree have been affirmed , and yet the court has seen fit to suggest that the case was a proper one for executive interposition . The exercise of the pardoning power should be so regulated as to subserve the best interests of the State and at the same time to secure , if possible , the reformation of the offender . Clemency may often be wisely extended where a deserving convict has not long to serve and steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One great reason why there are so many second-term convicts in our prisons arises from the fact that upon a discharge from his first term the convict can find nothing to do , and easily returns to a career of crime . There is , naturally , a prejudice among the people against the employment of persons who have served a term in prison ; but what are the poor convicts to do and what is to become of them if no employment shall be opened to them ? They must starve , beg , or steal , if they can not find work . This thought leads to the suggestion that benevolence and philanthropy can find no better field for their exercise than in securing employment for discharged convicts who are deserving . An effective society organized for such a beneficent purpose could accomplish much good , and , in my opinion , it is one of the needs of the hour . I commend the suggestion to the consideration of those who have the means and disposition to inaugurate so desirable a movement , which can be productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
