txt chapters of adventure , written nearly fifty years ago , have remained till now in manuscript in the care of my grandmother , the author 's eldest daughter , Mrs. J. M. Sanders . They form a part of the unpublished memoirs of Peter Adolph Grotjan , who arrived in this country in 1796 from his native town , the Free City of Hamburg , in time to hear President Washington deliver his farewell message to Congress . His father , who had studied law at the University of Jena , and was afterward ambassador from Hamburg to the Empress Maria Theresa at Vienna , became for twenty-five years a judge of the Hamburg Criminal Court ; but he himself received a commercial training in the counting-house of his uncle . Of the motives that impelled him to select this country for the seat of his career , he writes as follows in his memoirs : " The independence and dawning prosperity of the United States and its republican government was a subject of discussion in all the well-informed circles of Europe , but particularly in Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the democracy of the United - * States than any other government in Europe . Being well acquainted with the history of the American Revolution , the achievements of Washington , the VOL . XV. - 21 characters of Jefferson , Patrick Henry , Samuel and John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , and the intrepid Hancock as revolutionary leaders , while the fame of Rush and Rittenhouse as learned and scientific men had long reached our shores-these interesting subjects engaged our private conversations for hours , and became the cause of my determination to settle myself in business in Philadelphia , as soon as I became of age and had the disposition of my share of the inheritance from my grandmother . " So , at twenty-two years of age this young German republican established himself as an importing merchant at Philadelphia , which was then not only the national capital and seat of Congress , but also the leading commercial city of the Union . There he prospered for seven years , finding time also to interest himself actively in American politics and to become an ardent supporter of Thomas Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his making the voyages to the West Indies chronicled in these chapters . ALFRED A. WHEELER . I. FIRST VOYAGE TO CUBA . CAPTAIN WOODBRIDGE GRAFTON , from Salem , Mass. , was a middle-aged man apparently between forty and fifty , who had a wife and children at Salem , and 205 // appeared to be in Philadelphia on settlement of business . He seemed to be unhappy , but kept his business and troubles entirely to himself . He was a great politician and Democrat of the Jefferson school , and notwithstanding his eccentricities we formed by degrees a sort of political intimacy . One afternoon , late in the fall of 1804 , he visfted me at my office , and without any further preliminary , said : " Grotjan , I want your assistance . Will you render it to me ? " I told him that I would , if it lay in my power . He then stated that he had been in Philadelphia nearly one year , to close a settlement with a French house of the name of Foussatt Brothers , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars  --  a balance due him after five years ' shipping transactions between them ; that the want of this money had caused his ruin in Salem ; that he was determined never to go home unless he could do so with honor . He stated that his claims had been left to arbitration , and that he was required to lay his accounts before arbitrators on the afternoon of the third day after his application to me . He further informed me that , although he had been very careful in preserving all papers , documents , and vouchers , he had never intrusted them to the care of any person , and was himself utterly incapable of putting them in such order that his claim might be supported and understood by arbitrators . He said , ultimately : " Will you and can you do this for me , in time to be ready for the arbitration ? Otherwise I must entirely despair of my success . " He appeared greatly moved . I told him at once that I was willing to assist him night and day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to form a judgment of the time it would require to prepare such a statement as would insure his success . He left me and returned with two bandanna handkerchiefs full of papers . In short , we fell to work about five o'clock that afternoon , and I never quitted my place , except to take food , for forty-six hours . The result of it was that , on the appointed evening , the arbitrators examined the accounts in the presence of the defendant , and after deducting some claims , properly explained and opposed by defendant , Grafton obtained an award of ten thousand seven hundred dollars , and in less than two months afterward fully adjusted himself with Foussatt Brothers . It was during the course of this winter that Captain Grafton made the proposition to me to enter with him in the Santiago de Cuba trade . He had taken from Foussatt Brothers , in part payment , a schooner of about two hundred tons , called the Nancy . This vessel he would in part freight himself on his own account , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as captain and myself as supercargo . To this I agreed , and we were soon prepared for our first voyage to Santiago de Cuba . With my own resources and the consignments I got from my friends , I had about sixteen thousand dollars , and Captain Grafton for his account about five thousand dollars worth of property on board , all of which and the vessel were duly insured . We left Philadelphia early in the spring of 1805 . We had fifteen French passengers , both male and female . Our mate , Mr. Perrotoc , and cabin-boy , Leseure , were also of French origin . Among the passengers I only mention the names of Pierre Bougonnier and Mr. David , as they are connected with my future adventures . We had a tedious passage down the bay , and when we arrived at Cape Henlopen , the wind although fair blew such a gale that we could not land our pilot , but were obliged to retain him on board . Under such circumstances , the law and usage is that a pilot so carried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , to mate 's wages and rank . We kept him ten days on our voyage before we found an opportunity to send him home . The rest of our voyage was prosperous but tedious , as we lost much time in the calm latitudes , and the voyage lasted twenty - four days . On arrival we were obliged to come to an anchor under the guns of the fort , the Morro , in the inner part of the mouth of the harbor and six miles from Santiago de Cuba . This large fortification is built on three terraces of a // high mountain , from the water-level upward of five hundred feet high , and is so constructed that , at the most important places on the sea-coast and harbor , it can bring one hundred guns to bear upon one point . If the natural advantages of this fort were combined with skill and energy , it would be totally impregnable from the sea-side . It is , however , deemed sufficient by the Governor-General for it to be garrisoned by a corps of invalids only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed on board of our vessel , and having been recommended to Prudence Casamayor , the most eminent merchant at Santiago , I despatched notice to him , as my consignee , to come and take charge of the goods and prepare such papers as were necessary in regard to the custom-house and the duties to be paid . I will here only observe that the measure of consigning your goods to the care of a merchant resident is indispensable . If any foreign merchant or supercargo should undertake to transact his own business , he would make a ruinous job of it . In the first place , the goods would be appraised at much higher than their cost , and on all the ad valorem duty goods an impost of twenty-eight per cent . would be exacted , and every possible delay in obtaining his goods and making his sales would besides be thrown in his way , in order to give his competitors , who consigned themselves to resident merchants , an opportunity to skim the cream of the market . In these Spanish West Indian ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid by the mother country , that an understanding existed between them and the resident merchants , not directly but through the medium of the padres , by which they were enabled , with profits to the parties , to pass goods through the custom - house at little more than two-thirds of the legal duties . During my stay at Santiago the yellow fever was very fatal to Americans and other new-comers , but having been seasoned in the IJnited States during the years 1797 , 98 , and 99 , and not being in any way alarmed , I escaped its baneful influence . A young gentleman from Philadelphia , with whom I had had a slight acquaintance , arrived at this time at Santiago as supercargo . As soon as he understood that the fever was prevalent , he got much alarmed and asked me what course I advised him to pursue . I told him , if possible , to divest his mind of all fear , to be moderately but constantly occupied with exercises not very laborious , to taste no ardent spirits or heating wines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks called tisannes , to eat moderately , take warm baths two or three times a week , go to bed early , and take a walk and a dish of coffee at sunrise ; and if he could not divest himself of fear , to visit the highlands in the interior for a week or two . I have reason to believe that my advice , as is generally the case , was not followed , because it did not suit him ; for in two days after this interview I learned that he had taken the malignant fever , and was very ill . I visited him instantly , but found his condition without hope . In one short day afterward he died in my arms , after a very severe , delirious struggle , during which it took all my strength to hold him . We were alone in the room , the colored servant , his only attendant , having gone for the doctor . When the struggle at last subsided , he sank exhausted upon the bed and asked for a glass of water . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a corpse . I made many valuable acquaintances , and among the rest that of Mr. Maurice Rogers , a supercargo from Philadelphia , and subsequently American consul , as will appear in the sequel of my adventures . He was my room-mate at Madame Latapee 's boarding-house , and although a great business man , was sufficiently fond of high life , frolic , and excitement . I myself abstained from all species of gambling , though the greatest variety of games of chance were openly practised every hour of the day and night , Sundays not excepted , and participated in by all ranks of society , from the grandee and priest to the common soldier and pirate . Still I was one evening for a few moments engaged in gambling . The circumstance occurred as follows : I wanted to retire // for the night , but found my room door locked . Inquiring of Madame Latapee , she told me that Monsieur Rogers had probably locked the door , but that I was likely to find him at the gardens of Messrs . Davis &amp; Parage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him engaged with many others around a large table in a game at dice . He was evidently in luck , for he had a large quantity of silver and gold before him . I asked him for the key , but he whispered , " Stop a minute , Grotjan , and take a chance on my side , for I am in luck . " I of course declined , stating that I carried no money about me ; but all my refusal was in vain . He pushed out ten dollars for my account aud before I could say anything the dice decided in favor of our party . He would not let me draw the stakes , but suffered them to remain , and in two more trials the ten dollars had swelled up to eighty , and I loaded myself with seventy dollars in specie and went home with the key of my room . My friend Rogers , as I understood the next morning , had subsequently a run of ill-luck , but finally saved about one hundred and fifty dollars ' profit out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him . I had much opportunity to make observations on the direful consequences of the propensity and rage for gaIning , and will relate a few appalling instances to which I was a witness . A gentleman from Baltimore , by the name of Smith , had in charge as supercargo the sale of nearly forty thousand dollars worth of property . Being fond of good living and dissipated society , he soon became the favorite of the bravest , or rather the most notorious , captains of French privateers then tolerated and even courted in the Spanish West Indian ports , and also with such Spaniards and Americans as were fond of drinking and gaming . For several weeks there was nothing talked of except the lucky American supercargo , who had proved himself the gainer of more than fourteen thousand dollars by gaming . Being in the habit of daily intercourse with him , I obtruded on him some of my advice . I urged him to quit suddenly , let the consequences be what they would , and secure a handsome little fortune ; but I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foresight , that he informed me he had discovered a method of managing his stakes and regulating his bets by which he could not fail of being the winner , and produced his great success in evidence of his assertions . After this he became so entirely engaged in gaming that I hardly ever saw or conversed with him . It took me nearly two months before I disposed of my cargo , but long before I was ready to sail the career of Mr. Smith was run . He had lost not alone all his ill-gotten gains , but dissipated the greater part of forty thousand dollars intrusted to his care . Debility , both of body and mind , made him an object of pity , and an American captain then in port gave him a free passage to the United States , which , however , he never reached , as the vessel totally disappeared and was never afterwards heard of . The cause of its disappearance was surmised from the following circumstances : Captain Gould , the master of this beautiful Baltimore clipper , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most exalted opinion of the swiftness and performance of his vesseL Being a little too fond of boasting , I often heard him say at dinner , when in conversation with French captains of privateers , and especially with the notorious Captain Love , who frequently tantalized him by depreciating the virtues of his craft , " Give nie one hour 's start , and I do not care a for all the French privateers in the port . " When Captain Gould started , he was shortly afterward followed by a privateer vessel , and was never afterward heard of . The second circumstance that I remember , although not ending so tragically , will exhibit in a powerful manner the immoral consequences of gaming . One evening , about ten o'clock , when engaged in a game of whist in the American Club , near the water side at the gardens of Davis &amp; Parage , several Americans , among whom were Mr. Church , from New York , and Mr. Smith , from Baltimore , came rushing in in great disorder , asking for assistance and stating they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had on the gaming-table , by a general scramble during which the lights had been extinguished . Their table being within a short distance from our room , the intrepid Captain Gould , seizing a large bludgeon , sallied forth to the rescue . He returned in about ten minutes , considerably bruised , but with his pockets and a handkerchief full of gold and silver . These gaming-tables , I should say , have a strong rim all around them , about four inches high , to prevent the money from falling from the table . It can , therefore , not be swept off , but must be picked up . Captain Gould briefly stated that he rushed in the dark headlong to the table , made room for himself to right and left with his bludgeon , threw himself on the large circular table , and with one hand raked under his body whatever he could find , and with the other , brandishing the club , guarded his head and back as well as he could . With as much indifference as if he had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and told the persons concerned to divide it among themselves as far as it would go , according to their respective losses , refusing to take any part for himself . As soon as this tumult had subsided , I went in company with Captain Gould and others to the scene of action . We found everything silent and dark . The table was situated in the garden and under the shelter of a large tree . We observed several figures in cloaks gliding to and fro , but nobody spoke to us . The proprietors did not attempt to produce a light that night for fear of the interference of the police , and by this means the affair was gradually buried in oblivion . I understood the origin of this affray to have been as follows : Gaming had been carried on that night to an unusual extent , and the stakes frequently exceeded two and three thousand dollars , the fate of each stake being decided as usual in a few minutes . Some of the principal gamblers , Spaniards and French privateersmen , had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a scheme to retrieve their losses . At an unexpected moment the chandeliers were demolished with bludgeons and all other lights extinguished , and a general rush was made to grapple for the great amount of money on the tables . One Spaniard only was seriously wounded , but no other consequences arose from this affray . On our arrival in port we had found a very large English merchant vessel at anchor , and alongside of it a small French privateer commanded by the notorious Captain Love , whose prize she was . It will be remembered that at the period I write of ( 1805 ) Great Britain was at war with Spain and France , and the two latter were allies . This British ship was laden with innscovado sugars and regularly condemned as a good prize . My consignee , Mr. Casamayor , had purchased the cargo at very easy prices , and was therefore able to let me have a great bargain in exchange for the goods he had sold for my account . We ultimately completed our return cargo , but I was *forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as some unsettled accounts in my favor . However , the reputation of my debtors for integrity was good , and as we had a full cargo of sugar , tobacco , cigars , and other produce , and intended to return immediately , I did not attach much importance to the delay . We accordingly set sail for Philadelphia and took the leeward or western passage , doubling Cape Antonio opposite Yucatan . I will here mention an opportunity I had for the first time in my life to witness the effects of a water-spout . One afternoon , about four o'clock , when we had passed the Isle of Pines , the sky gradually darkened all around us , with heavy and threatening clouds , although above the sky was clear and a dead calm prevailed . Every measure of precaution was taken by our old and experienced Captain Grafton . The dead-lights were fastened , sails shortened and secured , and in short , the vessel was put in such trim as to prepare her for the impending storm , from whatsoever quarter it might break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm and uncertainty , when we were suddenly satisfied that the north had gained the victory . We // perceived to the right of us the dark clouds in motion at a great distance , and under them a peculiarly formed pyramid which seemed to connect the clouds and the ocean . During the space of nearly half an hour it approached nearer and nearer toward us , , in a direction precisely in a line across our vesseL This was a water-spout of the largest class , and caused much apprehension for our safety . I even heard our oldest sailor , Hugh , who was at the helm , make use of the following expression , while the tobacco-juice was trickling from the corners of his mouth : " I have seen many a waterspout , but I 'll be if I ever saw one coming so straight on board as this . " During this half - hour we still remained in a perfect calm , the waterspout bringing the wind along with it . We did not spend our time in idle conjecture , but endeavored if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that a sudden concussion of the air would break the connection of water between the cloud and the sea , and so disperse the descending column before it reached a solid obstacle . I had a large fowling-piece on board , which I determined to load and discharge repeatedly in the direction of the water-spout at the proper time . Unfortunately , however , my powder was in my large trunk , stowed away between decks in such a manner that every effort to get at it failed , and I lost the opportunity to test the efficacy of this experiment . At length the moment of our trial drew near . The water-spout passed across us a few yards ahead of our bows , and was rent asunder by our jib-boom , so that the great weight of the water fell on the surface of the sea . Nevertheless , the concussion and turmoil created by the bursting so close upon us was so great , that our vessel went spinning around for some minutes like a block in a boiling kettle , and we were completely immersed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as the tumult subsided , we did not see a vestige of our flying or standing jibs , or jib-booms . All that was left was the broken tackle suspended from the bowsprit . This circumstance plainly indicated what our fate would have been if the water-spout had struck us amidships . However , such is the character of seafaring men that danger , as soon as past , is forgotten , and creates no other sensation than that arising from the additional labor or the loss of property sustained . From this period the weather was pleasant until we came in the neighborhood of Havana , when early in the morning we descried a suspiciouslooking vessel to windward standing toward us . It was in vain to try to avoid it , as its speed was at least three times swifter than ours . We , therefore , stood on our course until the firing of a small cannon admonished us to heave to . Several of our crew recognized the vessel to be an English privateer from Nassau , of the Bahama Islands , commanded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This circumstance made me feel rather unpleasant , particularly as we had part of the cargo of an English prize-ship on board . We were boarded by Captain Johnson , an officer , and six men , and our crew ordered on board the privateer . I laid before him our ship 's papers and bills of lading , and he told me , plainly , that he thought he must take us into port . In appearance this formidable man was between sixty and seventy years of age , of a tall and gaunt figure , a grizzly white beard , and the remnants of his hair stood almost erect . He wore no uniform and his dress was slovenly , being bare-legged , without a waistcoat and wearing a woollen cap . Altogether he had the perfect appearance of Robinson Crusoe . However unprepossessing his figure was , and whatever had been said of his sternness and cruelty , I soon found him to be a sensible , experienced man . He stayed with us all day , but before evening I succeeded in effecting our release and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He accordingly departed and sent back our crew , to the no small delight of everyone , as it came rather unexpectedly . We accordingly stood that night toward Matanzas . The next morning at daybreak , to our great surprise and alarm , we again saw the privateer standing for us , firing a // signal to heave to . Everyone thought that now our doom was fixed , that Johnson had repented over night for his lenity and was now determined to bring us in for adjudication . I freely confess that I was myself impressed with that opinion . Johnson came very near and sailed around us , during which time he requested the favor of sending a passenger on board for us to take to the Tjnited States . Being thus relieved the second time from our awful apprehensions , we politely consented and his boat brought one of his officers , an American by birth , who had been a considerable time in the British service . We learned from him that a difference had occurred between him and Johnson , that he had demanded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced the second visit . Nothing of consequence occurred during the rest of our voyage , and we arrived safely in Philadelphia . This being the month of August , it was rumored that the yellow fever had made its appearance in several parts of the city near the Delaware River . There may have been some cause for the report , but although the alarm and panic was not great , it had a rather disadvantageous influence on the sale of our cargo . Notwithstanding the prices obtained were below the market value , our purchase had been so advantageous that we had every reason to be satisfied with the result . II . SEIZED BY A BRITISH rEIGATE . WE lost no time in purchasing a suitable cargo for a second voyage , and the consignments I received this time were valuable . The property then in my hands , together with what I had left at Santiago , amounted to upward of twenty thousand dollars . We Started again early in September , 1805 , but the wind blowing a gale , we met with an accident which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight of Reedy Island Piers , we found a large fleet of outward bound vessels at anchor waiting for the abatement of the gale . Our pilot , however , thought his skill sufficient to steer us through the fleet and he accordingly stood on ; but when about the middle of the fleet our yard-arms became entangled with those of a ship , and although no other damage was done except the loss of some rigging , he concluded to come to at one of the piers . To do this it was necessary to jibe , in order to bring the vessel 's head to the wind to check her speed . At this critical moment the schooner , not obeying the helm , missed stays and ran headforemost into the stern of a large , black painted brig , which was moored alongside the pier . I was on deck and forward when the concussion happened . Our bowsprit went over the taifrail and our bows stove in the stern of the brig , making a hole nearly as large as a barn-door . Our catheads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I luckily did not fall from the shock of the concussion , but had just time to retreat , precipitately , before the broken timbers and splinters came upon me . Even previous to the concussion a scene of swearing and ranting commenced , between the parties in danger , which beggars all description , and it continued for an hour after the accident . Our vessel , it appeared , had sustained no damage in her hull , but the upper works around her bow being entirely carried away , it became necessary to send her back for repairs , which it was believed would only take a day or two . In consequence of the fever in the city , I concluded to stay at Newcastle and await her return . I had boarded for several days at the hotel , when a circumstance occurred which was very disagreeable to me in the commencement , but ended in my complete triumph . I occupied a small room separated from a larger one by a board partition . This larger room had hitherto been unoccupied . Opposite my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dressed and shaved myself , and immediately alongside of this glass was a large knot-hole about two inches in diameter , which afforded involuntarily a view of the interior of the adjoining // room . One evening , or rather late at night , a number of travellers had arrived long after I had gone to rest , and without my knowing anything about it . On the next morning , while I was shaving and dressing before the glass , I suddenly saw a lady rising from a bed , who could not help instantly seeing the whole of my face . I immediately withdrew , placing the glass in the window and completing my toilet . When arrived at the breakfast-table , I found there a large company of ladies and gentlemen . Before breakfast was over , to my utter dismay I heard a very handsome married lady address apparently her husband in the following words : " I would give much to find out the name of an impudent fellow who looked into my room while I was dressing myself . " And it appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended glance at me . Although taken by surprise and as it were a stranger among strangers , my resolution was instantly fixed . I got up , and with as much calmness as I could command , respectfully addressed the lady and told her that I was the person she had alluded to with so much severity , but that I was utterly incapable of committing a voluntary act of such unpardonable rudeness . I stated to her and the company minutely the circumstances before related , begged permission to call the landlord to confirm my ignorance of their arrival , and proposed , or rather insisted , on the appointment of a committee to visit my rooms , to justify my assertion that the circumstance was purely accidental and involuntary . As my appeal for justice was very earnest , my requests were complied with , and an entirely satisfactory report was made . I have never since seen any of the parties . After having patiently waited almost a week for the return of the Nancy , I proceeded on board a packet to look for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream , fully repaired , and we started the second time soon after my arrivaL Nothing unpleasant occurred during this voyage . On the contrary , we were much diverted , when one morning , after a short but strong northern gale , we found our rigging covered with many hundreds of little yellow birds , blown off from the coast during the night , and so exhausted that the terror of men gave way before their helpless condition . We had them on board for two weeks . They became so domesticated as to sport about every part of the vessel , lighting upon our heads , shoulders , and hands , while reading , or eating , and drinking . But as soon as the eastern end of the Island of Cuba became visible , they left us in small parties until they all disappeared . On our arrival we consigned ourselves to Mr. Broussard , and I had the pleasure to find that Mr. Maurice Rogers , my former room-mate , had returned from the United States as American consul resident at Santiago de Cuba . Of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me many advantages ; and the result of this second voyage would have been very prosperous , if it had not been interrupted , as will shortly hereafter appear . In the meantime we disposed of our cargo by degrees , taking our own time to do so to the best advantage ; and as the produce of the Islands did not at that time find a favorable market in the United States , we converted our receipts chiefly into gold dust and gold bars , to the amount of about thirty thousand dollars . I also wanted to purchase a hundred boxes of Spanish cigars and on inquiry for the best of that article , received the direction of a French merchant who resided in the Spanish quarter of Santiago . When I came near the house as described to me , my ear was struck with the sweetest music I ever heard , proceeding from a female voice of great compass and sweetness accompanied by a harp . I arrested my progress and listened for a considerable time before I entered ; but when I did so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , both in person and attire , sitting gracefully before the instrument and exercising her talents unconscious of any listener . We were both surprised and manifested a momentary confusion . I had almost forgotten the errand on which I came and she had arisen , apparently waiting to hear what I had to say . I excused my-V // self in the first place politely for the interruption , and then informed her of * my errand by handing her the address of the gentleman I wanted to see . She informed me that that person , Mr. Chevalier , was in France , but had left with her directions relative to the sale of the cigars . I will merely observe that the purchase was made to mutual satisfaction , and that I had both the honor and the pleasure , for a long time afterward , to esteem this lady as a friend and acquaintance , and often shared the pleasure of hearing her delightful performance on the harp , of which she was so perfect a master that I have never heard her exceeded . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the assistance of our consul , Maurice Rogers , enabled to have all our shipping papers adjusted in the most critical , mercantile order . Thus we started , beating to windward , endeavoring to make good an eastern ro*ite through one of the passages , which was by far the shortest and most secure voyage . After beating ineffectually for five days and finding that we lost ground instead of gaining on our way , Captain Grafton concluded to turn about and tAke the western passage around Cape Antonio . On the following day , and when not far from the Isle of Pines , an English frigate hove in view , and we were brought to and boarded . After the examination and finding by the bills of lading that we had gold bars and gold dust on board , the report spread on board the British frigate that we were laden with the precious metal from stem to stern . We had , however , enough on board to awaken the cupidity of the commander and officers with the idea of a considerable share of prizemoney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some plausible means for condemnation . Accordingly we were taken possession of , our crew removed on board the frigate , a midshipman , William Young , as prize-master and four hands placed on board of us , and we were ordered to Kingston , % . Jamaica , for adjudication . After having stood for some hours on our course to the island , the frigate left us to pur*ue her cruise , and that night and the following day we had many opportunities to have retaken the vessel , had we felt so disposed or been placed in a different situation regarding the property . The midshipman was a young stripling without experience and of a timid disposition . Two of the seamen were old and feeble , and the other two over-fond of drink . We , however , declined any attempt of this kind as entirely uncalled for , as our half of the cargo was duly insured , and as the other half belonged to merchants in Philadelphia and was , we had every reason to believe , also covered with insurance . We arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained at anchor for nearly a week before we were ordered to proceed to Kingston , where we ultiinately arrived on the 31st , still in charge of our prize-master and his crew . Before relating subsequent events , it will be necessary here to state that , in consequence of the frequent piracies committed on these coasts , Captain Grafton and myself , on leaving Santiago , concluded effectually to hide our valuable property unbeknown to any other person on board . This we effected in the following manner : Late on the evening of our departure we locked ourselves in the cabin and carefully removed some boards from the counter near the stern-post and back of the head of Captain Grafton 's berth . The place thus obtained between the timbers was small , but large enough to hold ten times the bulk of our treasure . In it I closely stowed the leather and canvas packages containing the gold dust , bullion , and coin , and skilfully re-secured the panels so that not a trace of their removal could be observed , and that none but ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the vessel had been taken to pieces . After mooring in the roadstead opposite Kingston , we were permitted to go ashore accompanied by the prizemaster , in order to enter our protest and abandon the vessel and cargo to the underwriters , for whose account I now began to act . On this occasion I became acquainted with Mr. Kraft and his family , a German gentleman who some years previously had married the // Widow Frazier , from Barbadoes , with a considerable fortune , and who now owned or had on lease a long strip of land called the Palisadoes , separating the sea from the roadstead , from Port Royal to a point several miles above Kingston , where it united with the main island and thus formed a splendid harbor at least ten or twelve miles long . From this place he sold sand and stone ballast to vessels departing without a cargo , raised an immense quantity of goats for the market , and in short carried on a profitabie business . To this gentleman I confided our secret . I concluded that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible hold on to the property until the case was decided in the Court of Adjudication , which I had no doubt would be favorable to us . With this view I obtained the promise from Mr. Kraft , that if I could bring the property on shore unobserved , he would keep it concealed until the case was decided or such circumstances should occur as to induce me to give it up . Captain Grafton and myself lost no time in executing our plan , and on the next afternoon , when Midshipman Young had gone on shore , I released our precious prisoners and temporarily secreted them at the bottom of our berths . Young was intimately acquainted with Kraft and family , and it was so contrived between Kraft and myself that he should come on board in the evening with Young and invite us three to his house to take supper with him . They accordingly arrived soon after dark and the invitation was cheerfully accepted by Young , Grafton , and myself . Shortly before our departure our steward , under the pretence of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deck . During this interval , the gold having been divided in three parcels , we loaded ourselves therewith as well as possible , and had as much to carry-upward of thirty pounds each-as we could stagger under without betraying ourselves . We were favored by the darkness of the night , and the total want of suspicion on the part of Young . The most difficult part I experienced was getting over the side and into the boat . I carried two heavy lumps of bullion under my hat , and being obliged to use both my hands , what with the heaviness attached to my body , I experienced during that brief time great difficulty in keeping my head so erect and steady as not to shift the balance of my upper cargo , which otherwise would inevitably have found the centre of gravity in the deep . However , all went well and we arrived safely at my friend 's house . Young was assigned over to the company of the ladies and we retired to finish our project , which was soon done , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by me . We spent the evening in high good-humor , and gave Young plenty to drink . Having so completely succeeded , my inclination for sport and innocent mischief was on the alert . The gold and the money having vanished from on board , I contrived a plan which should provoke a search without leading to the suspicion of the truth . I had among my writing materials a box containing fancy sand of a pale blue color and strongly mixed with small particles of gold tinsel . To awaken the suspicions of Young , who was a simple but good-natured fellow , and had probably never seen gold dust , I strewed small quantities of this tinselled sand on the cabin floor and a little on the benches in front of our berths , just sufficient to leave the shining particles visible . The stratagem took admirably . Young , who conceived that he had on all occasions been very vigilant to discover the place of deposit , no sooner saw by the light of the lamps some of these glittering particles , than he immediately conceived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust , and that now was the time to discover its whereabouts and prevent its secret landing . I watched all his motions narrowly and could almost read his thoughts . His first endeavor was to keep this discovery a profound secret from us until he had taken some effective measures . He therefore appeared to the common observer not to have taken much notice of the circumstances beyond his first examination , but I saw him , when he thought himself // unobserved , wet his fingers and occasionally take up a few of the particles * and look at them with much attention . He also grew thoughtful and silent , and I have reason to believe watched us all night . In the morning , immediately after breakfast , he was dressed in uniform and went on shore , leaving word with the guard not to suffer any person to go on shore until his return . About noon he returned accompanied by two officers and a private gentleman I did not know , and it was intimated to us that they had some private business to transact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay on deck . What passed below I did not know at that time , but after a lapse of a short time they returned on deck with an ironical smile on their countenances , which I interpreted , " Midshipman Young has made a fool of himself and of us ! " Subsequently I had an opportunity to joke Young on the subject , and he confessed that after they had entered the cabin and examined the particles shown them , they instantly discovered his mistake . The presence of the tinselled sand they believed to be accidental , and the event served for a long time among the officers as a standing jest against poor Young . However , soon afterward a formal demand was made of Grafton and me , through the judge advocate , for the surrender of the property on board according to the bills of lading . To this we responded , that , as they had taken and kept possession both of the vessel and cargo , and we had protested and abandoned , we had nothing further to say at present , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the concerned . Thus matters remained for several weeks . In the meantime I had taken advice of a counsellor and his attorney , to whom I disclosed the whole affair . He said that he did not believe that I would be permitted to keep possession of the property until after the trial ; and that on refusal of another demand to disclose the whereabouts or surrender the property , we would both endanger our liberty and prejudice our cause . He , however , advised me to hold on until a second demand was made , of which he would give me due notice and thereby endeavor to turn that circumstance in our favor . I defended this property through all the various stages of a British West Indian court of adjudication for more than one hundred days , at an expense exceeding sixteen hundred dollars , and the result was that the vessel was liberated but the cargo condemned , under pretence that it was Spanish property covered under American claims . It is only necessary to say that I entered an appeal from the decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industriously to render to the underwriters and parties concerned a clear and correct account of all our proceedings , capture , protest , and appeal , which resulted in the offer of the insurance company to pay us eighty per cent. , and surrender to our use the appeal papers for the balance . This we accepted and settled with them claims to the amount of about ten thousand dollars . As we were not in actual partnership , I concluded it would be best for our interests to make Captain Grafton the appeal claimant in England , and in order to avail ourselves of the most influential assistance I applied to Messrs . Savage &amp; Dugan , to be our agents for the appeal , whose correspondents in London I knew to be Baring Brothers &amp; Company . They accepted the charge on condition that one thousand dollars were paid to them in hand to defray the expenses . As this was deemed reasonable , we made a contract in which they acknowledged the receipt of the money and engaged to use all vigilance in the prosecution of our claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel , though under adjudication , remained in our possession , and we lived on board to avoid the enormous expense of boarding on shore at the rate of from twelve to sixteen dollars a week for each . We made , however , many valuable acquaintances , of which the family of Mr. Kraft and the Fraziers were the most intimate . With them we spent the greater part of our time , and their kindness and friendship were not bestowed on us alone , but were experienced by many American captains and supercargoes // who either traded at that port or were there under similar circumstances to ourselves . As an instance of the greatest kindness of Mrs. Kraft , I will mention the case of Captain Wallington , of Philadelphia . On our first visit to the house Mrs. Kraft took Captain Grafton and me aside , and inquired whether we were afraid of the yellow fever . On assuring her that we were not , and that we had both , in the United States and Cuba , visited our countrymen under that affliction , she seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question for our own sake , as she had then in her own house and under her immediate care an American captain of the name of Wallington , with whom the family had been for some time acquainted , and in whose fate she took so deep an interest that she could not bear to abandon him to the mercy of others in this extremity . But she added , " I fear that it will soon be all over with him , as he is given up by the doctors , and his coffin is now standing under the shed . " I asked to see him , and we visited the patient , but found him so low that no conversation could take place between us . Notwithstanding all the unfavorable symptoms he recovered , and the doctor bore testimony that it was chiefly owing to the unremitting care and nursing of Mrs. Kraft . This lady was a matron somewhat above fifty , and her family consisted of her husband , two daughters and two sons by her first husband , Mr. Frazier , and one daughter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting and agreeable family , and I have spent many a happy hour in their society . As it was the will of fate to bring us together at several subsequent periods , I shall soon have occasion to introduce them again . Our business was at length terminated , and we sailed in ballast for Philadelphia . Our present voyage was likely to have proved a very short one , as on the thirteenth day we entered the Gulf Stream and were not very far from Cape Hatteras ; but my fate had not yet ceased tormenting and thwarting me , and I was once more to be put in imminent danger and protracted hopes . On the night of the change of the moon the weather became stormy and it blew hard from the north . On the following morning the gale increased with such violence from the coast that we were obliged to bear away before the wind under double - reefed jib , and our course was directly opposite to the one we should have taken . In this situation we remained for nearly two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galley and cabin tightly shut . We all remained on deck , and as it was very difficult to keep the vessel before the wind in consequence of cross seas , I volunteered my services to assist the helmsman to pull the tiller-rope whenever the word was given to bring the vessel 's head to sea . As I had to take my station on the weather side and the vessel was constantly careening to leeward , I had to lash myself around the breast and under the armpits , to enable me to pull the rope when required . This duty I performed for six hours , when I was exhausted and relieved . The gale appeared constantly to increase , and at last blew our sails into ribbons and we scudded for a while under bare poles . It became indispensably necessary to heave the vessel to , which under our present circumstances was extremely perilous ; for if she missed stays , the next mountain wave would strike her broadside and bury her in the deep before she could rise . A council was held upon the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to watch for the approach of a long sea and veer her . This at length succeeded and we brought her head to windward . She rode the sea like a duck and we felt for a while comparatively relieved . We could again , amidst the tumult of the elements , enter the cabin and take some Grafton having the watch on deck , we were suddenly aroused at midnight by the report that the vessel had sprung a leak and that the water was rushing into her hold in large volumes . On awaking I felt great pain and swelling on the outer part of my breast , occasioned by the pressure of the rope with which I had been lashed . It was with the utmost // difficulty I could arouse the cabin-boy to procure a light , which consumed several minutes . During this interval , which appeared to me probably much longer than it really was , I plainly heard at brief and momentary intervals the gushing of water into the hold . As soon as light was procured I found our mate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clever man , lying on his knees and fervently praying for his wife and children . My first object was to ascertain the cause and extent of our alarm . With this view , lantern in hand , I removed the sliding panel back of our cabin stairs and introduced a light into the hold , when , to my momentary relief , I found that the vessel had not sprung a leak , but that the rushing of waters proceeded from the large square holes of our water-casks , which had started from their moorings between the cable tiers during a heavy lurch and unrestrained rolled about the ballast at every heave of the vessel , fast discharging all our fresh water . This loss I considered almost as serious as a leak in the vesseL On a rapid consultation with Captain Grafton , it was resolved that he and two men should take care of the vessel on deck , and that the mate , myself , two miieh , and the boy should endeavor to secure the casks if possible and save as much fresh water as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard that no human voice , even through a speakingtrumpet , could reach the ear at one yard 's distance to windward . Our minds were , however , so perfectly absorbed in the difficult and dangerous task before us , that during the succeeding hour I , at least , was entirely unconscious of the state of the weather . After a labor of several hours we succeeded at last , at the most imminent danger of being crushed and mangled between the rolling casks , in securing them , but saved only about sixty gallons of water , which obliged us to be put on short allowance during the remainder of our passage . We were compelled for two days more to ride the stormy waves without making any progress , and unable to take any observations of the sun to ascertain our latitude . We were , however , lucky enough to weather the storm , and on the seventh day after the gale had subsided , reached Philadelphia in safety.                  @ @ @
