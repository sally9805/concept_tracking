txt The case of Dr. SriiDY , which has been under investigation before the Committee of the House on the Civil Sery ice , shows some of the most-characteristic features of the spoils system . The charge against the Commissioners is that they secured the appointment of SLIMY in the Pension Bureau , after be had been discharged for cause from the Post Office in Milwaukee , Wis . The facts , as thej have been brought out , showed that SHIDY , being a clerk and Secretary of the Civil Service Board in the Milwaukee Post Office under Postmaster PAUL , was cognizant of some and of other violations of the law . When he was called u.pon to testify as to these by Mr. ROOSEVELT , he expressed great regret and remorse as to his action , and told the truth as he knew it , for which he was promptly discharged by PAUL . Mr. ROOSEVELT , believing that the man , though weak , had suffered not for what wrong he had done , but for having tardily done right , advised him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secured his appointment under Mr. PORTER , the Census Superintendent , after telling Mr. PORTER all the facts . When SHIDY was called before the House committee he not only testified to what he had done , but he stated that under the same conditions ho would do the same things again . He said that he felt an obligation to his immediate superior greater than to the public , because the former had appointed him . Here is the very essence of the spoils system , under which appointments are regarded , not as public employments , but as private favors . The duty of the appointee is felt by him to be , not to the people who pay his salary , but to the person or party that gets him the place . Nothing could be more demoralizing or more unworthy of a citizen of a free community , and yet it is the feeling that prevails throughout the service where the spoils rule obtains . The Commissioners in this case have acted humanely and from the best of motives , but SHIDY is simply a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived in him .
