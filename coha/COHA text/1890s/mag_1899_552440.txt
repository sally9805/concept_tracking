REVOLUTION . By Park *Iolland. * Edited by H. C. Mitchell . S to our early family history I know very little . Our ancestors were from London , England . They came early to this country , where they settled in what is now Watertown , Mass . My grandfather moved from there to Shrewsbury , where your father and I were born . Our mother , a second wife of our father , was Bathsheba Ivory , from some town near Boston . Of her parentage I know nothing , as we were left orphans when quite young . My father moved from Shrewsbury in 1752 , when I was six months old , to Petersham , and bought there a small farm ; on which , until his death , we all lived , a happy family of four sons and two daughters . Your father Ivory was , I think , twelve or more years older than I. He was out in the French and Indian war of 1756 . I recollect , as distinctly as if it were but yesterday , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were at church when news came that the enemy were near . The services were immediately ended , each man seizing his gun , which he had left at the door , and hastening home to be ready to march in the morning . T well remember , also , that one of our neighbors came to borrow a darning needle of my mother to mend her husband 's stockings ; which I very much wondered at , it being Sunday , not exactly seeing how the expected approach of the French and * This chapter of reminiscences , written by Mr. Holland , at Orono , Maine , when he was about eighty years of age , was addressed so his nephew , Major Jonas Holland , of 5chenectady , N. v. The original is in the possession of the writer 's granddaughter , Miss Josephine P. Holland , of Foxhoro , Mass . In preparing is at her request for publication , I have made no changes of consequence ; simply dividing it into-convenient paragraphs and here and there breaking up long sentences or transposing words or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians could lessen the sin of working on that holy day . I was their probably four or five years old . Our mother died some years before father . I recollect little about her , except that she was kind and affectionate to us . We were all obliged to work constantly , from the time we were large enough to pick up little sticks and stones from the mowing field until we could hold the plough and handle the rake . My father , in addition to farming , wrought at the blacksmith 's trade occasionally , and I remember how pleased we were when he was so much engaged that he could not mark off our day 's work ; for then mother did it for us , and there was always much less than usual . Our opportunity for obtaining an education was very limited indeed . The Psalter and a few old books were all that were used in the few months ' school we attended . Our books of amusement were likewise very few . 2Esop 's Fables and occasionally some ballads brought us by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were read with great pleasure ; and not read merely , but often committed to memory . I recollect , even now , afewlines of one that related to the elder Pitt 's exertions in behalf of the oppressed colonies . I will give them as a sample : " Sir William once more pulls off his gloves , - To weed in his garden so dearly he loves ; To weed in his garden and throw out the stones Which threaten the breaking of Liberty 's bones . Hurrah ! my brave boys ! Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " I have little worth writing about myself until 1775 . My mother died , I think , when I was about ten years of 313 // age , and my father when I was sixteen . I resided on the home farm assisting my older brothers and sisters until I was twenty-one , when I commenced work on a small farm of my own . Your father and I lived in the same neighborhood , and 1775 found us warm Whigs , or revolutionists , as we were then called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enter actual service until 1776 , when the state of Massachusetts was requested by Congress to raise a brigade of troops and march them immediately to New York . Without loss of time , in company with thirty of our neighbors and friends , we left our peaceful and retired homes , many of us for the first time in our lives ; marched to Brookfield , where we joined the regiment commanded by Colonel Holman ; and thence to New Haven , where we embarked for New York . We arrived there about the first of July , and remained in the city until a few days after the battle of Long Island . It was then agreed in council that the American troops should leave the city ; which was done sometime in September . The British , having notice of our intention , sent a number of armed vessels up both the North and the East River , with the intention of cutting off our retreat . Though they did not effect their purpose , they very much retarded our progress . However , with much difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island , and encamped . The next day we found that the enemy had landed a considerable force and were coming to give us battle . Having somewhat recruited , we lost no time in preparing to meet them , more mad than afraid . A battle soon commenced in earnest . Their front giving way , we rushed on and soon came up with the main body . A pretty severe em gagement ensued ; which ended in considerable loss on both sides , and the retreat of the British on board their vessels near Harlem Village . The principal part of our army now marched on to White Plains , where , under the command of Washington , we intrenched ourselves as well as we were able with our limited means , and made a short stand . We soon heard that the British forces were arming to meet us , with reinforcements from Frog 's Neck or East Chester . A large detachment of our troops was immediately ordered to meet them . We had proceeded but a mile , when , from a high ridge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten or fifteen thousand strong , with heavy field artillery , lay in full view in the valley below . Here we halted , just within reach of their guns . The air was soon filled with balls , grapeshot and shells . Smallwood 's regiment of Virginia troops lay in an opening in the ridge , and , on acount of their exposed position , were cut to pieces in a horrible manner . Those of us who were posted on the highest part of the ridge suffered comparatively little , as they generally fired over us . The shells , however , annoyed us considerably . After a short time the cannonading ceased , and all at once their infantry appeared in solid columns in front of us . A warm fire of musketry on both sides took place , but after firing ten or twelve rounds , we discovered that they had flanked us both on the right and on the left . We were now ordered to retreat , and the order was quickly obeyed . While descending the ridge the fire of the enemy did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally fired over us . The loss on both sides amounted to several hundred , and neither party could claim much advantage . In our rapid retreat down the hill a ball from the enemy broke the leg of a soldier just in advance of us ; who , when we overtook him , begged us in mercy not to leave him to fall into the hands of the British , but dispatch him at once , if we could contrive no way to take him off the field . The whizzing of balls told us , in language not to be mistaken , that what we did must be done quickly . The planning // of a litter being out of the question , I asked White , a neighbor of mine , to help raise him up , and take one arm while I took the other . Thus , with his broken leg dangling , we bore him safely down the hill , across a stream , and through the valley to a barn nearly , or quite , half a mile distant , which was fast filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from our former lives of peace and retirement , to scenes like this , our hearts sickened within us on beholding so much suffering . The American army endured enough , as is well known , from many causes , but at this time from none more than the lack of skilful surgeons . Those we had were , many of them , young men from retired parts of the country , who had rarely seen a limb taken off in their lives , and of course they were ignorant . Many a brave fellow was losing a useful limb , and some their lives , through such mismanagement . We stood silently by our soldier , sad enough , to hear his fate decided . When his turn to be examined came , he was told that he must lose a leg or die . He promptly replied , " I choose to die whole , then ; but not till you have bandaged and splintered my leg as best you can. * , Here we left him without knowing even his name ; but my acquaintance with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a SergeantMajor Gates belonging to a Connecticut regiment came to me and expressed much pleasure at meeting me . I told him that if I ever had the happiness of knowing him , I had now forgotten him . " XVell , " said he , " I shall never forget you ! " with . much feeling . " Do you not remember a soldier whom you helped carry from White Plains with a broken leg ? " I told him I did . " I am that fellow , " he added , " with two legs as good as yours . They have done ' me and my country some service , and I mean that they shall do us more. ** Of the five from my native town who were out in these two battles , two were killed . One , Perry , breathed his last on Harlem Heights ; the other , whose name I do not remember , the dru.mmer of the regiment , fell dead at White Plains . We had a Sprout from Middleboro , a droll fellow enough , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor dark prospects could for a moment reduce . Previously , I think it was , to the above mentioned battles , Sprout and Shepard were sent with a small detachment to Frog 's Neck , where , in a skirmish , Shepard was shot through the neck . Though he bled profusely , the wound was not dangerous . Sprout , on seeing him fall , ran quickly to his assistance , exclaiming , apparently with much by , " Promotion ! promotion , now , surely ! " at which Shepard , bad as he felt , could hardly help laughing . " Do not be too sure , " he replied , meanwhile coolly undoing his neckerchief and stopping his wound himself . They were both promoted , sure enough ; and General Shepard and Colonel Sprout , long my intimate friends , have left their names in their country 's history . We tarried but a few days at Vhite Plains when General Washington with the army , except a small detachment , crossed the river to New Jersey . I was sent with the detachment left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was ordered up the river to guard some military stores and property of inhabitants of New York City at Tarrytown . Here we remained till sometime in November ; when , our time of enlistment having expired , we were discharged and returned home . Sometime in the following winter of 1776-7 Congress proposed the raising of a permanent army , to be engaged for three years or during the war . Massachusetts was requested to raise fifteen regiments . The business progressed rather slowly ; however , it was concluded before spring , and your father , who had been nominated a lieutenant , received enlisting orders . // He offered me a sergeant-major 's berth , if I would enlist ; and , though heartily sick of a soldier 's life , I did not hesitate , but , with twenty-four or five of my townsmen , enlisted for the war , well knowing the importance it would prove to the cause of liberty to have a permanent army . About the first of May we marched to Leicester , where we were enrolled by the muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inoculated for the smallpox . About nine hundred entered the hospital , eight hundred of whom recovered . We had but two physicians , one of whom was Dr. Eustis , afterward governor . The name of the other I do not remember . We had but one regular nurse . Of course we suffered from want of attention . Our only food was water gruel , placed in the cook room a few feet from our barracks , where we went when we pleased , reached our hands through the window , and with a tin porringer took from a half-hogshead what we saw fit . Our salts were similarly arranged . Neither of them , as everybody knows , is very palatable , even when taken in small quantities from clean vessels . Some of the soldiers , who were feeble and delicate , died rather than take what was necessary of either ; and our physicians , from having so much to do , were unable to see that their rules were obeyed ; though no two men could make greater exertions than they did for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann who , on finding how we were to fare , was soon among the missing . How the fellow escaped none could conjecture , as we were strictly guarded ; but all cursed his memory as a deserter to the enemy . After we had recovered , as we were preparing to wash up , who should make his appearance but our deserter , Mr. joplin , as large as life and in good health ! It appeared that he did not like our treatment ; so he crept through a water-course till past the guard , went to the village and bought a supply of pork and beans , built him a hut in the bushes , and there alone and unaided battled with the smallpox . He had come off victorious and was now ready for the British . From the l ) arracks we marched to Worcester , where we remained till news came , the first of July , that Ticonderoga had been evacuated and our northern army was retreating to Fort Edward . On receipt of this information we were despatched x*th all possible speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our luggage an ( l sick , taking with us only what was absolutely necessary , and proceeded as rapidly as possible to Fort Edward . From here we immediately sent a strong detachment , to reinforce our retreating army under command of General Schuyler ; who joined General St. Clair at Hubbardton , not far from Skeenesboro . The next day they were attacked by the enemy and quite a number on both sides killed . The British , however , were said to have lost many more than we . Colonel Francis , one of our officers , I think from Salem , fell here . Your father and I were not in this skirmish , having been left at Fort Edward . General Schuyler , on his return down the river , destroyed the bridges and obstructed the roads in such a manner that the enemy were prevented from pursuing us closely . We remained at Fort Edward but a few days , while preparing for a further retreat down the river . Our next halt was at Fort Miller , where we left quite a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of our officers , Lieutenant Sawyer and Sergeant Rogers , thought they would visit some of their friends at Fort Miller . They had proceeded but about forty rods , when a dozen Indians came out of the woods and , in plain sight of us , killed them both and scalped them before we could reach the spot . When we arrived , there lay the bodies of our friends , who left us but a moment before in high glee and full of life and hope . A // more horrid sight is rarely seen , even by a soldier , than was now presented to our view . Not an Indian was to be found . We bore the bodies of our friends back and buried them . A soldier , who was a stone-cutter by trade , told General Putnam that , if so ordered , he would place a stone at their graves . The General sternly replied , that they knew it was dangerous and against the wishes of their commanders to leave even for a short distance , an ( l that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much needed should have no stone to tell where they were laid by his or ( lers . It was but a day or two 1 ) efore we left Fort Edward that Miss McCrea was murdered . I often saw her . She was a beautiful girl , and her horrible death excited a great deal of feeling among us . She was probably killed by the same wretches who slew our friends . Our prospects were now dark enough . There were foes in every direction ; and , what was worst of all , we knew not when we were in greatest danger . To add to our perplexities , we were fast losing confidence in our commander , General Schuyler , though why this was the case it would be difficult to tell . He certainly did everything a man in his situation could do . But the situation of a retreating army is never a pleasant one ; and , as often remarked , a commander is often blamed for misfortunes over which he could have had no control , and likewise praised for victories for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bravery or judgment . VVhile we remained at Fort Miller , getting our boats , provisions , etc. , ready , a sentinel from our town , who stood at the door of a market , was fired upon from the woods by an Indian and shot through the neck . The first we knew , the wounded man fell , as we supposed , dead ; and , before we could look around us , our enemy was out of sight . Captain Gates called to our physician , Dr. Howe , to know why he did not do something for the wounded man , who lay there bleeding . Howe replied that it was of no use , as he could live but a few minutes longer ; to which Gates replied , " That is nothing to you . Go and dress his wounds as if you thought he would live forever . " Howe then very deliberately rolled some rags into the form of a stopple , filled the wound , which was through the neck , and had the man carrie ( l in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he lived to see the reward of his suffering , his country free . We continued our retreat down the river and encamped on Van Schoick 's Island at the mouth of the Mohawk . About this time took place the battle of Bennington and the defeat of St. Leger , which sent a thrill of hope and joy through every rank of the American army . Strong reinforcements of militia daily joining us , with a commander in whom we had perfect confidence ( though perhaps no better than our former one ) , also added to our spirits and courage fresh energy . We turned our march up the river to meet General Burgoyne with a determination not to yield , gathering from the looks of our commanders , rather than their words , that we were playing an almost desperate game ; that , if Burgoyne fought his way through , and joined the British army , as we knew was his intention , all would be lost . We arrived at Bemis Heights , within a few miles of the British camp at Saratoga . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the enemy , finding themselves in a very critical situation , determined to force our lines in a desperate attempt to reach Albany . They accordingly marched out about noon and gave us battle . The engagement continued with vigor till sunset , when each army retired to camp , leaving the dead and some of the wounded on the field . The next morning , by mutual agreement , each army took away its own dead . Both sides claimed the victory , but // neither had much ground for boasting . The action was a severe one on both sides , and the loss probably about equal ; except that the officers suffered more on the British than on our side . Both armies lay pretty quiet till October 7 . During this time the militia marched to Fort Edward and posted themselves at sundry I ) laces along the river in such a manner as to prevent Burgoyne from retreating farther toward the lake ; destroying all the boats and bridges , obstructing roads , etc . Burgoyne , being informed of the situation , determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut his way through our army , and reach Albany . The battle commenced with spirit on both sides , and continued till nearly night ; when the British hastily retreated to their camp , which was well fortified , leaving their dead and wounded , with considerable ammunition , and several fieldpieces , on the field . The next morning we prepared for another attack . When all was ready , we found the breastworks and the camp of the enemy empty , their baggage wagons wholly or partly burned , their heavy fieldpieces many of them left , the carriages being destroyed . We pursued them till we found that they had made a stand near Saratoga Old Fort , when we returned to our camp in high spirits . We continued sending out daily strong scouts to watch the enemy 's motions . We found them rather inactive . We also sent a strong party across the river to the eastern bank , and thence up the stream to a point opposite the enemy 's camp . They captured a collection of boats ( with their guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . The fog , which had before , like the cloud over Israel , saved many of us , here did us ample service ; as the crmmander of the guards , when ordered to surrender , did not doubt that the whole American army was present . judge of the poor fellow 's feelings when he found he had given himself and men up , without an effort , to a party of not half his numbers , so near his own fort ! The capture of the stores taken from the enemy , which they could not replace , probably hastened Burgoyne 's surrender . During one of these scouting excursions occurred the only act of cowardice I knew of in the army . In the confusion of one of the skirmishes , one of our lieutenants was found secreted safely behind a pile of logs . A complaint , or an account of his position , was immediately sent to General Gates without his knowledge or that of his friends . As they well knew that he would be tried , they advised him to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , get his discharge and be off ; which he accordingly did . He found Gates very kind . The General told him he wished no man to remain in the army who was so anxious to resign , and wrote the discharge himself . The lieutenant returned to camp well pleased and thanked his friends for their counsel . He was hastehing his departure with all possible speed , when one of the number asked him what was written on the other side of his discharge . Turning it over he beheld , to his horror , an account of his cowardice with all the particulars , which had been handed the General the night before . Worse than the roar of guns was the roar of laughter which the poor fellow now had to contend with ; some advising him , with Yankee ingenuity , to tear it in two and paste a paper on the back to preserve his discharge . I need not add that he was soon off . On the seventeenth of October , a day never forgotten by any one present , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners of war . It was a glorious day to us . The Tories throughout the country had tauntingly told us for months before , that , when Burgoyne 's army reached Albany , they would teach us to play Yankee Doodle** in a way we should never forget . When // all was arranged for the surrender , our army formed into lines , that we might have a fine view . When the music was ordered to strike up , it began with " Yankee Doodle . " General Gates could not refrain from smiling as he ordered a British march to be played . The fate of Burgoyne 's army is well known . Of our march to Albany I shall say little , except that it was the hardest I had then performed . The roads were very muddy , and , having given all our provisions to the enemy , we could not procure half enough for our support on the way . Some of our sofdiers were so hungry they actually picked up and ate some of the hard , mouldy pea-bread which they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aids , Clarke , a young British officer whom history has buried on or near the battlefield , was carried with us to Albany , where he lived some time . I can not be mistaken , for I recollect that our physician , who had charge of him , was a Free Mason ; and I think that he himself was able to meet with us at the lodge . I saw him often , and our officers called on him frequently . One of Burgoyne 's nurses , whose husband was killed on the seventeenth , attended him till he died and , I think , was buried in the old churchyard at Albany . When I was a very little child , one of our neighbors in Petersham ( who afterwards , being a strong Tory , moved to Canada ) had an adopted son about the age of your father , to whom the latter was strongly attached . The two passed every moment they could together , exchanging work , etc . The first thing in my long life that I recollect is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at table , young Atherton told me that , if I would not cry , he would give me a copper . It was the first cent I ever possessed . He left our part of the country some time before the Revolution . At the surrender of Burgoyne , your father came to me with a very fine-looking British officer , and asked if I recollected him . I did not . It was Atherton , the friend of his boyhood . Finding that he would be ordered to Europe , as he did not wish to go , my brother assisted him in concealing himself till the army had marched . He remained a citizen of the states . Our brigade was quartered principally at Albany . The events of the winter , the burning of Cherry Valley and other settlements , I presume you are well acquainted with . About the first of April our regiment went on board vessels and down the river to West Point ; where we pitched our tents , and , with the assistance of the Connecticut troops , commenced fortifying the Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named after our colonel . Your father and myself , who were then both subaltern officers , with fifty men , struck the first stroke toward the building of this fort . While we were fortifying Fort Putnam , the Connecticut troops were building two forts to the south of us , Webb and Willis ; so called for two colonels in the Connecticut line . In the course of the season , by the extraordinary exertions of officers and soldiers , they were completed and well supplied with cannon , mortars , etc . The same season we stretched across the river an iron chain , weighing , it was said , upwards of fortythree tons . It was made fast at the ends near strong batteries , and apparently rendered the passage of the Point by the enemy impossible . The attempt to pass was never made till the treachery of Arnold induced them to send a number of armed vessels up the river as far as Stony Point . In constructing the chain and placing it we had the help of an old ironmonger , of whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us by the name of " Old Hurrah . " He was one of the strongest and most energetic men I ever knew ; and he would get done double the labor that // any other man could . While erecting the batteries , etc. , we could hear his voice over all other noises ringing out , " Hurrah ! hurrah ! my boys ! Every shovelful helps build the fort . " Every one near him was obliged to move , and quickly too . Few men did their country more service than this one , who took his iron back at the close of the war . The story of the escape of Arnold and the death of Andrd is familiar to all . The Continental troops to which your father and I belonged were ordered to New Jersey , where they were stationed when Major Andre was executed . On the evening of this memorable day , being very sick with a fever , I was carried out of the camp , some twenty miles into the country . The army marched on toward Philadelphia , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained where I had been carried more than thirty days , during which the fever raged continuously and I wholly lost my reason and recollection . I remained very weak and low for a long time . The old Dutchman with whom I was quartered , kind-hearted though he was , at last told my nurse that he could keep me no longer . Tired of my useless , feeble life , I did not care much what became of me ; so I told the Dutchman to tackle his cart , and carry me toward the camp as far as he could in one day , and there leave me with any one who would take me in . I was then unable to walk a step without assistance , and the old man 's daughter and my nurse , one on each side , were necessary to support me in the rude vehicle as we went jolting on . Night drew on , and the old man 's better feelings prevailed , as he saw no prospect of finding a comfortable shelter for me . He then offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I would go home with him ; but the daughter cried and the old man begged in vain . Go back I would not . While each was trying to persuade the other , we met an officer whom I knew in search of places for the sick . I told him he must help me , and dismissed the Dutchman . It was now quite dark . I asked my friend and my nurse each of them to take an arm , and so help me on to where we saw a light through the trees a few rods from us . We reached the house after a fashion , and found the family Scotch Highlanders who had been there several years . The old man was a warm Tory , and his son as warm a Whig . They kindl*y took me in , and their pity for me for a while banished all party feeling . I was placed in a comfortable bed beside the old man , who prayed long and earnestly for the destruction of the rebels before he slept . The son was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should remain with them as long as I pleased . And so I did ; gaining slowly till winter , when our troops went into winter quarters , our brigade moving to West Point . I was carried to a place on the North River , where I spent the winter . As I was still feeble , and my courage was failing , I concluded to resign and go home ; but our colonel would not hear a word about it . He said that , if I would remain , I should be appointed paymaster of the regiment ; and that my duties would then be easier , so that by spring he thought I would fully recover my health . Your father , too , said that he would not consent to my leaving him . He said we had commenced together , and we would tough it out to the end , let that be what it might . I consented to remain , and was appointed paymaster and clothier , while your father was made quartermaster . I at length , before spring , became perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Jersey , arose from want of proper food and attendance . The army was obliged to use green corn and fruit instead of bread . But our sickness and sufferings were nothing to what some portions of our arti* endured . I shall never forget the condition of several hundred , if I remember rightly , of Hazen 's regiment , // sent on from Valley Forge while xve were at West Point . Those that came to winter with us arrived just as we had used the last of our clothing to make ourselves comfortable for the season . They came in the morning , hungry and ragged . A more wretched set of men were rarely seen . Before night each of our soldiers had hunted up his old stockings , shoes , and other clothing , patched and mended them , and thus made the destitute comfortable . In the spring of 1781 , I think it was , our troops marched down to White Plains and formed an encampment . While here we were amused by an order that was said to come from General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abhorrence of the sin of profanity , we easily guessed where it originated . Our parade ground was being cleared with great difficulty . The order was , that the first one who was heard to utter an oath should dig up by the roots one of the pitch-pine stumps which were being removed . This was no easy matter . Not long after a soldier was seen sweating and toiling away at one of these stumps , exclaiming that he was paying too dearly ; that it would be the last stump that he would dig . Speaking of Washington 's dislike of profane habits reminds me of a scene at his own table , on an occasion when twenty or more officers had l ) een invited to dine with him . His habit was , to take a single glass of wine after dinner and retire , leaving us to ourselves ; as he , at this time of care and anxiety . rarely made any conversation except on business . We had finished our dinner , and Washington had taken his wine in his hand , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , who had long been in the habit of using profane language , being much engaged , forgot where he was and swore an oath . Then we heard a rap on the table , and Washington , setting down his untasted wine , arose and said : " Gentlemen , when I invited you here , it was my intention to invite gentlemen only . I am sorry to add , that I made a mistake . " Then he left the room . A dead silence reigned for some time , which was broken by the offender himself calling us all to witness , that the oath he had uttered should be his last . He added that he would rather have been shot through the heart than to have deserved the reproof from Washington . Such was our love and reverence for the great and good man that the most profane left off the habit , and it was done away among us before the close of the war . While we were at White Plains , Count Rochambeau , with the French troops , encamped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a part of the American army , they marched with all speed to Yorktown . The capture of Cornwallis and its consequences are known to every American ; though very few can now realize the joy and gratitude which that event caused every heart to feel . In 1782 the principal part of the Northern Army moved to Newburg , and there , having built ourselves huts , we remained till peace was declared . At Newburg we passed the pleasantest part of our army life , though we had many pleasant days , as well as sad ones , at West Point . Our great ball on the birth of the Dauphin of France we thought a very fine affair . The bower built for a hall , neatly turfed and covered with evergreens , was about twenty feet wide and a quarter of a mile long . The ball was opened by General Washington and Mrs. Knox . The music was said to be very good . Of the song , or chorus , I recollect but little . It began as follows : " A Dauphin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Long life to Gallia 's nob.le ? king , Columbia 's great ally ! " Cannon from every hill-top sent forth their answering notes . To show the lack of the common necessaries of life , I mention the fact , that , on this occa // sion , orders came with the invitations , for each one bidden to bring his plate , knife and fork ; all of which articles were very scarce . I have known our foreign friends , who were accustomed to dine off silver , for months together to eat from a clean chip instead of a plate . Colonel Lutterlow , a German , I think , by birth , an officer of distinction in his own country , put up with our fare with the utmost cheerfulness . I knew him well , and loved and respected him before he left us . After the close of the war he invited several of us to dine with him . After the toasts , when we had drunk all we wished , and more , perhaps , than was necessary , he rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I offer this , which I wish you all to remember . Here 's to our noble selves ! Yes , I repeat ; you must respect yourselves . " This was the last we saw of him , as he returned to his country immediately . He was very intelligent , and very much of a gentleman . The lack of the common conveniences was sometimes curiously supplied by our soldiers by the manufacture of wooden spoons , bowls , plates , etc . I recollect the manufacture of a dripping-pan which pleased us very much . Some person in Massachusetts had a very large ox , which he fatted very carefully and presented to Washington for his own table . The General divided it among the officers then at West Point , so that a piece or two fell to each mess . Ours was a fine roasting piece , which we were hesitating to have made into soup , our usual method of cooking beef , when a soldier by the name of Skelden said that he would contrive a way to roast it by hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford to lose the gravy ; whereupon he ran out a little distance and returned with a smooth flat stone , which he quickly cleaned .
