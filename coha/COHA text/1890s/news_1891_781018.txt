txt THE TIMES this morning said that Bill Brown 's look-step directors from Sing Sing would return home forthwith , satisfied that their work had been well done in capturing the primaries for their leader , it being understood that a deal had been made in the Third Ward , and that no contest would take place . Brown was too shrewd , however to trust to chance , and gave orders that the vacation must be continued until the victory had been assured . It was well for Brown that this was done , for the opposing faction , after the combination had been effected , got up an opposition ticket , substituting anti-Brown names on the ballot . Accordingly , when the primary was called at noon to-day , two tickets were in the field . The Brown forces were on hand . Last night they were divided between two wards . To-day they were concentrated , and it gave the public an opportunity to look over the small army that Brown had provided with temporary support at State expense . There were more Brown paupers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heelers curried the day . They captured the organization and frightened others into either depositing Brown tickets or leaving the polls . The Brown ticket was elected and Elliott Brown left here this afternoon for home . The Journal of to-night says , in regard to the result of the fight in the city : " It is plain that the Warden controls the Demooratio organization of this city . That he has acquired and will hold this oonirol in the interest of Gov . Hill there is no reason to doubt . No anti-Hill man need apply for political favors in this region . Doubtless the State committeeman for the district will be an out-and-out Hillman . That is the meaning of the result for this year and next . The delegates to the Democratic State Conventions this year and next will be iron-clad Hill men . The Democratic candidates for State Senator and Assemblymen in Orange and Sullivan Counties will be men of the Governor 's selection . To suppose that , under Boss Brown 's management , they would be anything else , would be to suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who put him in the position where he could grant a ' vacation ' to the visiting statesmen whose activities have made Newburg hula for the last week .
