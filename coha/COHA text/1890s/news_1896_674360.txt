txt A conference of the Republican members , of the Ways and Means Committee will be held to-morrow night , probably at the rooms of Mr. Dingley , the Chairman , to decide what action shall be taken with reference to the preparation of a tariff bill . The consideration of this question also involves the necessity of an extra session . If it be decided to prepare a finished tariff measure , it is expected that arrangements will be made for a series of hearings to the representatives of the manufacturing interests , which may extend over a period of a month or more . It is believed that if the work tariff bill be delayed until of January , sufficient time before the 4th of March measure . Appearances would indicate that Republican members generally favor an extra session . Some of the New England Republicans deprecate the suggestion , their argument being that an extra session would tend to unsettle business , and that it is better to pass the Dingley bill , with such additions as may be possible , and postpone the further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced is that the present tariff law , in some particulars , is as strongly protective and-satisfactory as the old law . The cotton and iron and steel schedules , for instance , are said to be all that is needed to afford the fullest protection to the manufacturers . The protection given to wool and lumber in the Dingley bill will , if is claimed by some of the Republicans , be more satisfactory to those interests if the measure be enacted into a law within the next three months than to postpone the protection thus given for a year or more in order to secure higher rates of duty . The pottery schedule is regarded by the Republicans as having suffered more than any other schedule in the Wilson bill , and if it be the intention of the Republicans to pass the Dingley measure through the Senate , an effort will be made to enlarge its scope by the incorporation of additional duties on such importations . All these matters will be fully  --  discussed at Thursday night 's conference .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
