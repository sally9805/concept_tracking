txt A Washington dispatch to The Leader says : " Many conferences are being held in the apartments at the Arlington Hotel of Senator Hanna and Henry C. Payne , respectively the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the National Committee ; Senator Platt of New York , Senator Spooner of Wisconsin , - Senator Scott of West Virgina , Senator Platt of Connecticut , artio live there , while other well-known members of the Senate nightly throng the lobby . Two of the questions that are receiving the attention of these men are , first who shall be 's running mate next year ? Second , shall the ticket be nominated by acclamation ? It may be stated almost without qualification that the Republican National ticket next year will be and Root . That the President will be renominated there has been no doubt for a long time . As to the nominee for Vice President the sentiment in favor of Elihu Root , the Secretary of War , which became apparent several months ago , has assumed proportions which , in the opinion of men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his being given . second place on the ticket . Careful , conservative men such as Mr. Payne is known to be do not hesitate at this time to predict Mr. Root 's nomination . " If I were prophesying on the ticket I would say it will be and Root , " said Mr. Payne this evening . ' Although I am a Western man , I can see reasons which admit of no argument for the Vice Presidential nomination going to an Eastern man . It seems to be conceded generally that New York ought to produce him . Mr. Root would give the strength , firmness , and prestige to the ticket which another man would not do and which are needed . He has made a splendid record for himself as the head of the War Department and is in every way fitted for place which Mr. Hobart graced . " That Mr. Root IS willing to go on the ticket with Mr. there is not the slightest doubt . It may be said even that the Secretary is ambitious to procure the Vice Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has aspiratios of that character . He is perhaps better equipped for the place than almost any other New York man who has been mentioned in this connection . It is believed that he would be acceptable to Senator Platt , v.o.o , by the way , was largely instrumental in having him appointed Secretary Alger 's successor in the Cabinet . When Mr. Plat was " Usked to-night whom he favored for the Vice Presidential nomination he said : " Any good New York man would suit me . " " How about Mr. Root ? " " Mr. Root would be satisfactory , " was Mr. Platt 's reply . " will be nominated by acclamation . " As to the matter of nominating the entire ticket by acclamation , there is reason to believe that the next Republican National Convention will establish such a precedent . Senator Hanna has conceived the idea , and it is remarkable how favorably it is being received . The Senator has confided his proposition to a few friends . and they are enthusiastic over it . Mr. Hanna believes that inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running mate should be accorded the same distinction . " It seems to me , " he said to-night , " that a contest in the convention for the Vice Presidency should be avoided for the reason chiefly that President will be named for first place without oppositipn . The nomination for second place uncler the circumstances should be made . in my opiniorr , ? with the same absence of friction and contest . If we could go before the country with a ticket chosen in such a way the effect upon the party throughout the United States and upon the people of all parties would be most marked . The action of the convention would be received with eclat , and the Republicans would start in at the very beginning perfectly harmonious and with a solid impregnable front . It would be a sure augury of the victory that will follow in November . " Vice Chairman Payne agrees heartily with Mr. Hanna 's plan . The more he considers it the more pleased he becomes with it . He said to-night that he would be happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would do so . In all probability the Republican Convention will be held the second week of June . Mr. Payne said this evening that it would assemble very likely on the 12th of that month , which will be on Tuesday .
