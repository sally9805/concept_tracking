txt Details of the fresh trouble between the French colonists , at Cayenne , and the Brazilians , in the trans-Amazonian Provinces of Brazil , which may lead to further diplomatic trouble before the arbitration agreement is reached have been received here . A French mining expedition into the Caehipour district , in the disputed territory , from which it was agreed that all troops be withdrawn pending the settlement , was met by a force of Brazilian rangers and made prisoners , after a fight , in which one or two of the French citizens were shot . The party was under the leadership of a Frenchman named Tilbert . It consisted of a number of Cayennese creoles and colored mine laborers from Martinique and the English islands of St. Lucia and Dominica . There were twenty . of them , all told , including a woman . They ascended the Cachipour River without any interference , until arriving at the Degrad Fifine landing , where they commenced erecting " carbets , " or what are known in the west as " wikeyups .

' Fired upon from the bush , without challenge , Tilbert naturally supposed that he was being attacked by brigands , and , as this was to be looked for , the fire was returned . But it at once became apparent that they had to deal with a large body of soldiers , and not a few wandering brigands . Tilbert then ordered his men to stop firing . But the soldiers continued to fire , and many of the party plunged into the river and attempted to get away in their boats . These were fired upon in the water , and one or two killed , while some others escaped and made their way down the river . Tilbert and the rest of his men were made prisoners .

So far the prisoners have not been ill-treated , but at the same time they are being kept hard at work securing gold for their captors and without any prospect of reward . Fearing some reprisal from the French , Perez sent to Para to ask for reinforcements , but , according to the advices the Governor of Cayenne has . decided to take no action in the way of reprisal , but has sent on a protest against the disturbance of the statu quo to Para , and laid the matter before the Government at Paris . Meanwhile all private mining operations in the disputed territory have been suspended , as they were only being carried on on the understanding that the political statu quo would be respected on both sides .
