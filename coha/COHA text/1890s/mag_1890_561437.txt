txt THE " duel " between Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Blame was for commercial freedom on one side and commercial restriction on the other . Each side was represented by its best man , and the subject was discussed with great ability . Mr. Gladstone opens the discussion and goes straight to the heart of the controversy . He shows what commerce is , what it does , and what it has accomplished for Great Britain since its emancipation . He shows that it has increased the aggregate wealth of the nation , given better employment and higher wages to workmen , and supplied them with more , cheaper , and better food than they had ever had before . The question is not , as he says , whether the rate of wages is lower in Great Britain than in America , or whether the American workman is better off than the workman in England . It is not a question between countries , but between systems . If the rate of wages alone is to be taken as the test of the wisdom of commercial restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no verdict , because the United States has restriction and a higher rate of wages NoTE. - The discussion on Free Trade and Protection , begun in the January number of THE REVIEW by Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Blame , has attracted marked attention . Mr. Gladstone espoused the cause of free trade with great earnestness , and , with his consent , Mr. Blame 's elaborate reply in behalf of protection was published simultaneously . The Hon. Roger Q. Mills replies to Mr. Blame in the present number , and Senator Morrill , framer of the Morrill Bill , will continue the discussioa* in the March number. - EDIToR N. A. R. // than England , and England has freedom and a higher rate of wages than France , Germany , Austria , or any other country in Europe that has restriction . It is evident from this that some other factor is exercising a potent influence either in depressing or raising wages . Freedom of commercial exchange may be one of the forces , but there are others cooperating with it . Mr. Gladstone shows that since England adopted the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased from 50 to 100 per cent. , and that from 1843 to 1883 the income from capital increased 210 per cent. , while the income of the working classes increased 160 per cent . The wealth of both capitalist and workmen might increase in either country and under either sys* tem . And that is what has occurred in both countries , and in all countries where there are civilization and stable government . In a country like ours , blessed with the richest soils , the best of climates , good government , mountains filled with coal and ores of every kind , with ample means of cheap and rapid transportation , with the forces of production constantly increasing through the invention of labor-saving machinery , both wealth and wages would increase under either system . And it is no test of the wisdom of either to show that wealth and wages have increased under it . It must be shown that wealth and wages would increase *fas1er under one system than under the other , and to do that we must see what it is that creates wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the greatest wealth is created when the greatest sum of products is produced in a given time ; and that is done when the laborer works in harmony with the forces of nature and the auxiliaries which the inventive genius of man has supplied . If a laborer who is digging coal at *1 per ton , and who turns out one ton per day , should invent a machine by which in the same time he turns out five tons of coal , his daily wages would rise , whether the tariff was high or low , or no tariff at all ; and if throughout the whole industrial system such an increase should occur by labor-saving methods , then wages would rise throughout the whole , regardless of the tariff . But the question is , Would they not rise higher without than with the tariff ? If the workman , when he turns out his coal , is prohibited from selling any part of it to anybody , his surplus will be worthless . After supplying his own wants , the remainder will be without value to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell to persons living within the same county , his market , though limited , would give some value to his surplus . Then if the law should be changed and he should be permitted to sell to all persons within the same State , his coal would increase in value . If then he was permitted to sell to all persons in the United States , it would take additional value just as the number of consumers increased , which would increase the demand and consequently the price . If he is permitted to sell to any one anywhere in the world , his product would find its highest value . Thus we see that just in proportion as the numbers of those who consume his coal increase does its value increase . Wealth , therefore , and wages are increased by the removal of all impediments between producers and consumers ; and the converse of the proposition is equally true , that wealth and wages are decreased by every impediment interposed between the producer and consumer . A farmer in Brazil will make more at labor expended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climate are equivalent to so much capital gratuitously supplied to him . But coffee does not supply all his wants . He must have clothing , and he can obtain it more cheaply by raising coffee than by manufacturing cloth ; but to enjoy that advantage he must have an open way through which to send his coffee and bring his cloth . Here is where commerce becomes a necessity . If the Brazilian can not have his surplus coffee transported to the manufacturer , he must sell in the home market , where every one has a surplus as well as he , and where there is no demand and the value of his labor is greatly reduced . The same is the case with the manufacturer . If he is not permitted to send his cloth to those who want it , and is compelled to sell it at home , where the market is oversupplied , he will find its value greatly reduced . Yet this is the policy of commercial restriction which Mr. Gladstone assails and Mr. Blame defends , and this is the policy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . As Mr. Gladstone says , commerce is based " upon the unequal distribution among men and regions of aptitudes to produce " the things that satisfy human want . The desire for gain is the motive that actuates the distribution . Men only send away their surplus to sell when they can profit by the sale in the distant market . That profit is obtained when the price is higher // away from home than it is at home , and it is higher in the distant market than it is in the home market because it could be prodnced , if at all , only at a higher cost . In the market from which a thing is exported it is produced at the lowest cost , and it will be produced at the highest profit if the way of transportation is open to those who want it and can either not prodnce it at all or at a higher cost . And the profit of the producer will be much or little in proportion to the freedom or obstruction in the way from the producer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reaching market , and then has to sell at the market price . If the market price of wheat is one dollar per bushel at Liverpool , and it costs the Russian farmer fifty cents per bushel to produce his wheat and the American forty cents , the American will have ten cents per bushel advantage in the competition . Then if it costs the Russian twenty cents per bushel to reach the market and the American ten , the American has the advantage of twenty cents per bushel in the contest , and would make that much more profit , and , if he had wheat enough to supply the whole demand , would soon drive his rival out ; and if wheatgrowing was a considerable part of Russian industry , the loss of a market for it would be a great disturbance in its material progress . Hence it is necessary that the way from producer to consumer should be free from obstructions and capable of being passed with the least delay and the smallest expense . And " the legislator ought never to interfere , or only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , with this natural law of distribution . " When the government interferes and raquires the producer to pay a tax for the privilege of selling in its markets , it necessarily raises the price which its citizens must pay . If the object of the tax is to restrict or prohibit the importation of the article in order to give the market to the home producer which he could not hold without it , oft account of the greater cost required to produce the competing article , it imposes a double tax on the consumers of both the domestic and foreign articles . One tax is paid to the government on the imported article ; another is paid to the owner of the domestic product . But this is not all th' injury done by the tax ; perhaps it is not the greatest . When a purchaser is required by law to pay more for a domestic product than he would otherwise have to // pay , one of two things must occur : either that amount of wealth is annihilated , or it is transferred from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man who did not . If it is annihilated , it ceases to be a fund for the purchase of material , for the payment of . wages , or for the procurement of the things that satisfy our wants . If it is transferred , it is taken without compensation from one citizen and given to another , and the distributed wealth of millions is concentrated in the pockets of hundreds , where it is less able to purchase materials , pay wages , or satisfy wants . How , then , can import taxes increase wealth and wages ? How can any law foster , encourage , or stimulate the production of wealth or wages , when it requires the laborer to work two days to procure that which he could without it obtain in one day ? One day 's labor under such a law is lost , and that which it Would have earned is lost . Accumulated wealth is the fund which must employ and pay labor , and when it is increasing demand for employment is increasing , and when that is increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of increase of wealth is retarded , the ratio of increase in the demand for employment is retarded , and the rate of increase of wages is retarded also . So that taxation decreases , instead of increases , wealth and wages . The law that governs the production of wealth and wages is not affected by either latitude or longitude , and it is just the same in a large country as in a small one , and applies with equal force to a continent or an island , a crowded city or a rural district . Mr. Blame thinks that it might be wise statesmanship to permit the people of Great Britain to buy their bread at the lowest cost , but very unwise to permit the citizens of the United States to buy their sugar or their shoes on the same principle . He says the island of Great Britain lies far to the north ; that its southernmost point is thirty degrees above the tropics , and its northernmost point nine degrees below the arctic circle ; that the United States is forty times as large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied , more numerous , and of more valuable character than those of all Europe . Admit all that to be true ; it only proves that in the immense extent of our country , with its variety of soils , its diversity of climate , and its greatly increased capacity to produce the things that human wants require , we are more selfsustaining and less dependent upon others . Bat , after all , it pro- // TIlE NORTH AMERRYAN REVIEW . duces neither coffee , tea , nor spices . There are some things for which we must look to other countries and climes . But , what is more important still , this immense country , prolific in the production of so many things , will produce a surplus that will increase in proportion to the increase of its population . What does Mr. Blame propose to do with its accumulating surplus ? We must find markets for it somewhere . Admit that England has a " complex civilization , " that she lies far to the north , and is only one-fortieth of the size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export of cotton , wheat , and provisions ? If we can produce these cheaper than she can , and she can produce pig-iron and railroad bars cheaper than we can , why should we not make the exchange which is beneficial to both ? In commercial intercourse the question to be determined is ' one of profit , and neither size , civilization , nor geographical position has anything to do with it . Great Britain carries on her immense traffic with foreign countries because she thereby gives employment to her people , increases their wealth , and adds to their comfort and happiness . It is a source of great profit , and she is extracting every dollar from it she can . She is sending the products of her labor all over and around the world , and distributing them among all conditions of people , from the highest civilization in America to the darkest barbarism in the jungles of Africa ; and by her enormous commerce she is filling the pockets of her people with wealth . Why should we not do it ? Mr. Blame favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports ; but why should we hunt commerce with other people when we refuse to take it when we find it ? Does our continental position forbid us to send our products to foreign countries and to receive theirs in exchange ? If our civilization or geographical position demands that our exchanges shall be confined among ourselves , and that we shall neither import from nor export to foreign countries , what good is to be accomplished by subsidizing steamship lines ? That Mr. Gladstone might favor liberal appropriations to steamship lines is quite natural . English statesmen having first removed all legislative hindrances , having negotiated treaties with other countries by which tariff obstructions have been removed or greatly lessened , having sent out consuls and commercial agents to hunt for and protect English commerce , it was in line with established English policy to hunt new markets and make a way to reach // them with English products . But upon what ground can American statesmen favor granting subsidies to steamships to hunt for commerce which our continental position forbids us to receive ? It is claimed by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material wealth beyond all precedent in the commercial history of the world . But does it follow that her wealth came from her tax on bread that she swept away in 1846 ? The invention of labor-saving machinery and the utilization of coal and steam in production greatly increased her prosperity , but neither of them was the product of her tax on wheat . Her rapid development during that period was caused by multiplying her power of production , not by decreasing it , as her tariff did . Her growth in wealth for the period between 1860 and 1890 , or any twenty years of that time , under free trade , far outstrips the growth of the former period . Since she cast off the last of her shackles in 1860 ,  --  which we picked up and riveted upon the arms of oar people ,  --  she has left us sadly in the lurch . Having reduced the cost of ship-building and of the products of her labor , she has swept our vessels from the seas , and is now carrying her own products to market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having reversed our policy of commercial freedom , and loaded the materials of our manufacture with additional costs , we retired within our own boundaries , and left her the unchallenged mistress of the seas . Then , having all her raw material free of tax , and labor cheaper than any other country on earth except ours ( and we were out of the contest ) , she took the world 's markets , and holds them to-day against all comers , and will continue to do so until we unload our burden of taxation on materials , when we can and will produce cheaper than she 1can , and she must take a secondary place in the contest . There can be no surer test of the prosperity of a country than the increase of its foreign trade , and no surer test of the retardation of that prosperity than the decrease of that trade . By going back to 1816 , when the obstructive system may be said to have begun its career , we see that our total foreign trade amounted to *229,000,000 . ( See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) From 1800 to 1816 our foreign trade increased 41 per cent . During the next sixteen years , under the encouraging and fostering care of high tariffs , it decreased 23 per cent. ; and from 1820 to 1830 it was not so great as it was in the first ten years of the century , during // which " the highway of nations was almost without a flag floating on its surface except the flag of commercial marauders . " Yet ( luring that period , when all the earth seemed to be in arms on land and sea , our foreign commerce was greater than under the restricting tariffs in exister3e from 1816 to 1832 . Our foreign trade began to decline after 1816 , and had fallen to *109,000,000 iu 1821 . From that time it begau slowly to recover . It increased 30 per cent . from 1821 t3 1824 . The tariff of 1824 checked it again , and it had increased at less than 4 per cent . in 1828 ; and from 1828 to 1832 it increased 21 per cent . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reduction of the existing tariff 10 per cent . every two years ( not every year , as stated by Mr. Blame ) , our foreign trade began to increase more rapidly , and by 1836 it amounted to *292,000,000 , which was an increase in four years of 65 per cent . In 1841 it was *227,000,000 , which it had reached under the constantly-falling tariff of 1833 . In 1842 the restrictive system was again restored and our trade again fell off , but slowly recovered till 1846 , when it was $227,000,000 - again just what it had been in 1841 , and *2,000,000 less than it had been in 1816 . In 1846 a revenue tariff with low duties took the place of the high tariff of 1842 . The tariff of 1846 was further reduced in 1857 , and from 1846 to 1860 , under non-protective tariffs , our foreign trade increased over 200 per cent . After 1860 we returned again to restrictive tariffs with higher duties than ever , and for the next fourteen years ( from 1860 to 1874 ) our foreign trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the fourteen years of high tariffs ( from 1874 to 1888 ) it increased 23 per cent . instead of 200 per cent . It will be seen that whenever our foreign trade increases our agricultural products increase in price ; that distributes wealth through the great hive of agricultural labor ; that again demands the products of manufacture , and . that gives better employment and higher wages to labor , and that brings prosperity to the whole land . It was so under the falling tariff of 1833 , and it was so under the low-revenue tariffs from 1846 to 1860 . Mr. Blame charges that the depression and panic of 1837 were the product of the falling tariff of 1833 . It is a strange argument that reducing taxation produces depression , distress , and bankruptcy , and that imposing high taxes produces wealth and // prosperity , and the higher the tax the greater the prosperity . But such is the logic of the advocate of commercial restriction . John Quincy Adams said in 1832 " that the remission of taxes must , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He said of the committee for which he spoke : " They feel the delight with which any one permitted to enjoy the luxury of assenting to such a remission may indulge the benevolence of his disposition . " Mr. Adams , if alive to-day , would be branded by Pennsylvania iron-masters as an agent of the Cobden Club . Henry C. Carey , the advocate of high taxes as a potent instrument in the increase of wealth , started that argument about the panic of 1837 and that of 1857 . It has often been exploded , but it comes up smiling every time any one proposes " to enjoy the luxury " of reducing taxes . In 1842 the same charge was made in the Senate , and Mr. Clay , who was the author of the Compromise Bill , said that " it was not correct that the Compromise Act had occasioned the embarrassments of the country , " and that " it was a great mistake to say that any portion of the embarrassments of the country had resulted from it . " This " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was speculation in lands and the expansion of the currency that produced that panic , and that the reduction of the tariff had nothing to do with it . The circulation of the country had increased from *121,000,000 in 1833 to *222,000,000 in 1837 . The increased circulation , two thirds of which was paper , caused an upward tendency in prices . People who had money invested it in lands that were constantly rising in value , and not only invested all they had , but borrowed all they could and invested both money and credit . The paper balloon collapsed , and speculation and credits fell to the ground . Even if reducing taxes could bring on a panic , there had not been enough reduction at that time to affect anything . Eighty per cent . of the rates of the tariff of 1832 were still in force . Ten per cent . was reduced January 1 , 1834 , and 10 per cent . January 1 , 1836 . The average rate of duty on dutiable goods from 1833 to 1837 was 36 per cent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 32 per cent . If tariff rates averaging 32 per cent . gave prosperity to the country , as Mr. Blame says they did , how could the higher rate of 36 per cent . bring panic and bankruptcy ? In 1857 , Congress , finding a surplus in the treasury and the revenues increasing beyond all requirement for government ex // penditure , again reduced the taxes , and Mr. Blame says that reduction of taxation brought on the panic of that year . The panic of 1857 was produced by the same cause that produced the one of 1837 . From 1850 prices continued to rise till 1857 , when gold prices touched the highest point ever reached within the memory of men now living . Each year brought higher prices for all property . People plunged into speculation again , buying property , paying all the money they had and going in debt for more . Any one who will examine the list of annual prices in the report of the director of the mint for 1881 will see that that year shows the highest gold prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who will , without preconceived prejudice , read the history of that period will be forced to the conclusion that it was increase of circulation , and not decrease of taxation , that brought on tIle fever for speculation which ended in the bankruptcy of the speculators . The legitimate business of the country was scarcely touched . The country was full of metallic money . Agriculture , manufacture , and commerce had distributed it . and confidence was soon restored and business resumed its usual channels . The revenue tariff of 1846 was passed July 30 , to go into effect December 1 . Secretary Walker had predicted in his report that the passage of a revenue measure would increase imports and exports , and would enhance the price of our agricultural products that had to find a foreign market for their surplus . The results proved how well he had reckoned . Before the 1st of December came , the value of leading agricultural products rose in the New York markets 23 per cent. ; cotton rose 18* per cent. , wheat 17* per cent. , rye 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent. , and barley 24** per cent . Seven of the principal crops , as reported by the Secretary , had increased in value $115,000,000 , and he estimated that the increased value of the whole crop amounted to $350,000,000 . If . our present obstructive tariff were reduced to the average rate of that of 1846 , it would ad4 again at least 23 per cent . to the value of our crops , which is claimed by the statistician of the Agricultural Department to be four thousand millions of dollars ; and an increase of 23 per cent . would add to it more than $900,000,000 . But it is constantly charged that , if we lower our taxes , we will let in foreign goods and ruin our manufacturers . If this is true , // they would all have been ruined between 1846 and 1860 , for our imports and exports were constantly increasing from year to year . But domestic production kept pace with the times , and our manufactures grew with the growth of our agriculture and commerce . During the decade from 1850 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our manufacturing product 85 per cent . Neither agriculture , comnierce , nor manufactures have ever increased at an equal ratio during any decade through which we have passed either before or since . From 1860 to 1870 our manufacturing product only increased 80 per cent. , and from 1870 to 1880 only 59 per cent . Under the revenue tariffs from 1850 to 1860 the production of cotton goods increased 76 per cent. , woollen goods 42 per cent. , carpetings 45 per cent. , men 's clothing 45 per cent. , boots and shoes 70 per cent. , paper 108 per cent. , printing 168 per cent. , musical instruments 153 per cent. , coal-mining 182 per cent. , iron-mining 79 per cent. , steel 900 per cent. , farming implements 156 per cent. , bar , sheet , and railroad iron 100 per cent. , and the cash value of farms 103 per cent . Certainly these industries were not injured by enlarging the market . Manufacturers of wool were weighted down by the tax of 30 per cent . on wool and the same on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool costing less than twenty cents per pound on the free list . Then the woollen manufactures sprang forward and made their chief increase in three years of the ten . Does that look as though the English had taken our home market ? We were not only holding our own market , but we were beginning to take the markets of the world . Our exports of all merchandise increased 120 per cent. , cotton manufactures 130 per cent. , iron and steel 190 per cent. , hats 200 per cent. , boots and shoes 600 per cent. , wearing apparel 150 per cent. , earthen and stone ware 300 per cent. , glass 100 per cent. , and tin 200 per cent . Does not this look as though we were taking the English markets , instead of their taking ours , as Mr. Blame says they were doing ? We were not only taking her markets , but the markets of all other rivals , because we were making better and cheaper goods . Does any advocate of commercial restriction assert that during any ten years of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever increased our exports either of agricultural or manufacturing products at an equal ratio ? The same prosperous growth is shown in the enormous increase of the // national wealth , which from 1850 to 1860 was 126 per cent . It has never been approximated before or since . The marvellous growth of the country in all departments of national industry under the free-trade tariffs of 1846 and 1857 is not denied by Mr. Blame , but he says it was due to the discovery of gold in California , to the Crimean War , the Mexican War , the Irish famine , and other adventitious circumstances . He forgets that the prosperity had come and was firmly established before an ounce of gold had found its way from the mines of California to the channels of circulation . The Crimean War , occurring long after the tariff of 1846 had torn down the barriers and let in the prosperity , had no effect upon the country prior to 1853 , when it began . It probably increased the price of breadstuffs in 1854 and 1855 , but it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how it stimulated the production of cotton goods , hats , boots , shoes , glass goods , paper , leather , iron , or steel . It is difficult to comprehend how a war in Europe could add to the national wealth , except in stimulating the export of food and army stores . England and France certainly supplied their own arms and ordnance and quartermaster stores . Prices touched their highest point in 1857 , after the war had closed . But the assertion that our own war with Mexit*o , which began and terminated before 1850 , was the cause of the increased natioHal wealth from 1850 to 1860 , and the enormous increase in importation , exportation , and consumption , is beyond the bounds of conception . The total production of gold in the United States from 1850 to 1860 was $550,000,000 , while from 1860 to 1870 it was $576 ,  - -  000,000 , and from 1870 to 1880 it was $700,000,000 . Why did not the greater production of the two decades after 1860 give greater prosperity , if that gave the prosperity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neither nationai wealth , agriculture , manufactures , nor commerce approximated it . Leaving out the decade of the war , and comparing that from 1870 to 1880 , when there was the largest gold production , instead of enormous increase of prosperity , there never has been a period in the history of the country so black with disaster . For more than half the decade all the industries of the country were stretched upon their backs . The roads and highways were filled with tramps and beggars . Immigration was falling off year by year , and emi // gration increasing year by year . State after State was tottering on its foundation and calling on the general government for aid to keep it on its feet . The central city of the iron and steel industry was set on fire by starving workingmen who were out of employment , and there was not power enough in the State of Pennsylvania either to suppress the disorder or extinguish the flames . During a large part of that decade it was estimated that three millions of men were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks contributed so largely to the prosperity of the free-trade decade ought to have produced the same effect , and in a greater*degree , from 1870 to 1880 . The fact is that California gold had little to do with the material condition of the country at either period . The great body of it left the country as fast as it was taken from the mines . Our circulation in 1850 was $265,000 ,  - -  000 , and in 1860 it was $487,000,000 , but we had exported $400 ,  - -  000,000 . The increase in our circulation had come from increased prices for our exports and decreased prices for our imports . The Irish famine cost us as much in the decline in cotton as it made up in the advance in provisions , but , like the Mexican War , it was over before the free-trade decade began . The Crimean War came and went , and still the prosperity continued and at an increasing rate . The q*iestion still remains , What produced it if nnshackled commerce did not ? Mr. Blame says that the periods of depression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her commercial relations with us . In this statement he is not accurate . When England is most prosperous , she has the most money to bny what we have to sell and what her wants require her to buy , and these are mainly agricultural products . When she is most prosperous , she makes an active demand on our farmers for cotton , breadstuffs , and provisions . This active demand always raises the prices of all farm products all over the country , and distributes wealth among the masses of the people . Between 1879 and 1881 England 's prosperity enabled her to demand of our farmers , and pay for , a large amount of their products . The value of the articles we sent her in 1881 amounted to $477,000 ,  - -  000 , and that was more than half of our total exports to all countries . By her prosperity chiefly we increased our exports of agricultural products from $546,000,000 in 1879 to $730,000,000 in 1881 . This enormous increase was the result mostly of // England 's ability to buy from us and pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased the prices of these products , and distributed among our farmers a large amount of money . There was an average increase in the price of corn , wheat , rye , oats , barley , buckwheat , potatoes , hay , and cotton of 42 per cent . over the prices of 1879 . Now , if England 's prosperity enabled her to buy and consume $200,000,000 more of our agricultural products this year than she did last year , the increased demand would again increase the prices of these products , and if it amounted to 42 per cent. , as it did before , it would add $1,500,000,000 to the value of our crop , which , we have seen , is estimated at four billions . This large sum distributed among our farmers would soon be distributed among all classes . Nine dollars out of every ten would be spent for articles to be consumed by the purchaser . How would the domestic manufacturer share in the result of this prosperity of England ? We produce annually about $7,000,000,000 of manufactured products . We exported last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manufactures amounting to *422,000,000 ; so that our total home consumption reaches about $7,300,000,000 , of which over 94 per cent . is home production , and less than 6 per cent . foreign production . Now , when this large increased wealth  --  the result mainly of England 's prosperity and what is left of our trade with her-is to be expended in the purchase of inanufa*ctures , who is to reap the incalcuable benefits from its expenditure ? Ninety-four per cent . will go into the pockets of the home producers and home laborers , and 6 per cent . into those of the foreigner . This will create an active demand for home products , and an active demand for the raw materials and the labor to make them , and this again will increase the price of the materials and the wages of labor . So that , after all , not only is the prosperity of England communicated to our farmers , but through them it goes to the inanufacturers , to the laborers , and the producers of raw materials , and it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not side by side , and never will be . The merchant and the middleman have to supply the missing link , and when there is an increased product to be distributed there is an active demand made on them for their services , and they obtain constant employment and higher wages . // Mr. Blame 's mistake is the mistake of the system which lie is attempting with his splendid ability to support , and nowhere in this or any other country could it have chosen an abler champion . It is being assailed at every point , and it will require all of his tact and talent to cover its retreat and prevent it from degenerating into a rout as it leaves the field . The system falsely called protection maintains that commerce is a gambling device in which one party wins and the other loses . Therefore if EnglaAd makes anything in a trade with us she is benefited and we are injured . But the truth is both parties are benefited . We can produce much that she wants better and cheaper than she can , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we can ; and the exchange is beneficial to both . Our vast system of manufactures stands upon the same solid and immovable foundation as our agriculture . There are but few things in either that we can not produce cheaper than they can be produced elsewhere , and that article whose cost of production is the lowest holds the market against all competitors . Throughout our whole history we have been exporting a large part of our annual crops to others who could either not produce them at all or not as cheaply as they could obtain them by producing something else and exchanging their surplus for ours . No tariff levied upon agricultural products can help them . It can only hurt them , as it does by prohibiting the import of the things that would come to be exchanged for them . We have the soil and climate adapted to the cultivation of grain and cotton and to raising the stock which supplies the food for mankind . It yields a larger return for the labor expended than any other country . We have more intelligent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any other country . We use labor-saving machinery , and make our labor more productive than the labor of any other people . These advantages enable us to produce a greatet quantity in a given time , and at a lower cost , and hence we can hold our own market against the world . But it is not in the home market that our agricultural interest is imperilled . It is in the foreign market , and . the danger there does not come from rival products , for we can raise our products and pay the costs of transportation to market and then undersell with profit all rivals . The danger is in foreign and domestic tariffs that prohibit our entrance into the market . Some // years ago we exported breadstuffs and provisions largely to European markets on the continent . That trade is now almost destroyed by hostile tariffs in retaliation for our prohibitions against their manufactures . Our productive capacity is greater than our capacity to consume , and the excess is growing greater year by year , and if we are to be shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the home market , already largely oversupplied , with the prices constantly low and constantly tending to a lower level . The result is that agricultural production is discouraged , the output is decreased , and the farmers are kept straitened and with no prospects of bettering their condition . We have to-day twelve millions more people than we had in 1881 , and yet our exports of agriculture are 230 millions less than they were that year , when they should be 250 millions more , and would be if the markets were not shut against us. if we would open our markets to the products of other countries , ours would be demanded and taken in exchange for theirs . But as long as we refuse to take their surplus they can not take ours , because they have nothing else with which to pay . The solution of the difficulty will be found in the removal of the barriers which we have interposed against the admission of their products , and that will permit them to come and exchange with us , to the mutual advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing sadly in need of more extended markets . With the capital , machinery , and manual labor now organized and embarked in manufacturing , we can turn out a third more product than our people can consume , and we must either have more markets and more consumers , or less product , less employment , less wages , and less profits to capital . Situated as we are to-day , we are shut out from the world 's markets because the cost of our production is greater than that of our rivals . We only export a trifle of the vast product we manufacture-about 2 per cent . of the whole . With our productive machinery , with the inventive genius of our people constantly in advance of the world , with our cheap and skilled labor , we can produce , cheaper and better , more than half the products which the manufacturing people of Europe are distributing through the world , if we could obtain the materials at the same cost . Europe is exporting a thousand millions of textiles every year , most of // which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give better employment and better wages to our people ; but the flockmaster says it is the duty of the government to give him a bounty on his wool , the hemp-grower on his hemp , the coal-owner on his coal , and the manufacturer on his machinery ; and by the time all the bounties are paid the cost of the product is so high that it can not be sold anywhere but at home , and there the home consumer is bound to buy , and pay all these costs , or go without . If Congress would remove the duty from all materials that enter into manufacture , then we could buy them on equal terms with the foreigner , and , having advantage of him in the cheapness of our labor , we could soon start all our machinery and operate it in full time , and give full employment and better wages to our workmen . There is no good reason why we should not make and export the largest part of the metal goods th' t are now made in and exported from European shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by removal of all taxes on materials going into manufacture , we should soon recover our lost position as carrier of the world 's commerce . We should soon see our commercial marine in all parts of the world , and , instead of paying 150 millions to foreigners to carry our commerce we should pay it to our own people , and give employment to thousands of Americans in our carrying trade . But before we begin the contest with other nations we must get rid of the Pennsylvania idea that it is better to hang a man than make a seaman of him . Mr. Blame says that in 1860 the population of the United States and Great Britain was about the same , and that our wealth was then fourteen thousand millions and that of Great Britain was twenty-nine thousand millions , and that at the end of twenty years the United States had added nearly thirty thousand millions to her wealth and Great Britain nearly fifteen thousand millions to hers . With a small error in the statement of the wealth of the United States in 1860 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over sixteen thousand millions , instead of under fourteen , and the gain of the United States in twenty years was twentyseven thousand millions , instead of thirty . But does that prove that because the United States has commercial restriction , and Great Britain has not , the former has surpassed her rival in the race for wealth ? Let us apply the same test to France . She has commercial restriction , just as we have , and if that is the cause of // our superior growth over England , it ought to produce the same effect in France . France is an older country than Great Britain , is more populous , and has been for years . Great Britain got her artisans from France and the Low Countries during the religious persecutions of the Protestants on the continent , and that was the germ from which her manufactures sprang . And yet in 1882 , while France had thirty-seven million people and Great Britain thirty-five million , the wealth of Great Britain was $44,800,000 ,  - -  000 and that of France was $40,300,000,000 . Germany , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  000,000 of wealth . Both countries older than England and yet both behind her . There is no connection whatever between any of these facts and the issue joined . They are like the difference in the rate of wages between the United States and Great Britain . It has been claimed by Protectionists that our rate of wages is higher than Great Britain 's because we have high tariffs and she has not . On the other hand , Germany and France have lower rates of wages than Great Britain ; and they have high tariffs , and she has not . Protection seems to be a principle that can work both ways . Instead of claiming our marvellous growth as the logical result of commercial restriction because it has occurred subsequent to the adoption of that policy , it would be more satisfactory to show how wealth is made and trace it back to that source , if it be the rightful one . How is the dollar , the unit of the vast pile , made ? The answer must be , By labor . That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be made where labor produces the largest amount of products in a given time . These products will take their largest value where there is the largest demand for their consumption , and that is in the markets where the same articles can not be produced , or can not be produced as cheaply , or not in sufficient quantities to supply the demand . Hence the surplus must find its markets away from home , where it is wanted , and not at home , where it is not wanted . At home it has its lowest value , because it is not wanted ; away from home it finds its highest value , because it is wanted . But the person who wants must have the capacity to buy ; this he can only have by having the right to sell and have his surplus conveyed to his customer . This is commerce . Having the right to enter the market where his product is wanted , and to // sell it at the highest price he can obtain , he is that much more able to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties having access to markets where these products are wanted obtain the highest prices and accumulate the most wealth . Just in the proportion that the market is closed and the product driven back upon the producer , just so is the price decreased , and the ratio of accumulation of wealth retarded . This is what protection does . When protection puts taxes upon the goods of the foreignem* that prohibit them from coming here , he is rendered less able to take in exchange the surplus which we are ready and anxious to give . He takes less of our wheat , flour , cotton , and provisions ; a larger surplus is left in the home market ; the demand is decreased ; the price falls , and the growth of wealth is retarded . Protection , therefore , has lessened the height of the column , high as it is . Had it not been for restrictions and prohibitions on our trade , it would have been greater . Our enormous growth is due to our rich soil , to our splendid climate , and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great multiplication of machinery and its productive power , and to the genius aud skill of our workmen , as well as to the immense mineral wealth which we have , and which we are taking out of the earth and consuming at home and shipping to foreign countries . The superiority of our labor over that of Great Britain may be shown by one item . Mr. Hill , formerly statistician of the State Department , in an argument before the Tariff Commission in 1882 , said that in that year we , with 5,250,000 hands , produced double what Great Britain did with 5,140,000 hands . Gateley 's " World 's Progress* ' puts our product in 1882 at six thousand millions and Great Britain 's at four thousand millions . Even that would show that the same number of laborers here produce 50 per cent . more than they do in Great Britain . This accounts for our superior wealth . No people ever have increased or ever will increase in wealth by the help of taxation . No people can increase in wealth by being kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a man 's pocket does not put two in . How can taking a man 's money and giving it to another increase his wealth ? Without showing the least connection between his facts and his theory , Mr. Blame continues to make statements about the growth of the United States and compare it with the growth of // England . It is somewhat strange that it has not occurred to him to compare his own country with any of those on the Continent whose foreign trade is under the same restrictions . He will find we have excelled them more than we have England . Coining to particulars , he says that English steel rails were delivered in New York in 1862 at $103.44 in gold and in 1*64 at $88 per ton , and that up to 1870 English manufacturers held the market ; but what reduced the price from $103.44 to $88 he does not tell us . It was certainly not our competition , for during the three years prior to 1870 we produced less than twenty thousand tons . But in 1870 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we took the home market and held it until during the last summer the home and the foreign price were substantially the same . He might have made his statement still stronger and said that in 1875 , 1876 , 1877 , and 1878 the prices in the United States were lower than in Great Britain . But does that prove that the high taxes put on the rails have been beneficial to the people of the United States ? For the years prior to 1870 the tax was 45 per cent . and the prices ranged from $106 to $166 per ton ; so that the duty at the lowest was *47.70 per ton , and on the highest $74.70 per ton . If it was high duties that developed this industry , why did it not , prior to 1870 , reach the point claimed for it in 1889 . ? The steelrail industry is new , and it started in this country soon after it did in England . And as soon as our manufacturers could procure the patents and protect themselves against competition at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they went to work to amass a great fortune . The prices from 1875 to 1878 and the prices given by Mr. Blame show that we can produce rails as cheaply as they can be produced in England , and when the demand is dull and prices fall so that English rails can not be imported and pay the heavy duty and be sold , then our manufacturers have the market all to themselves and fix the price according to the demand . When the demand is great and the prices go up , as they did in 1871 , 72 , and 73 , then importation sets in , and the consumer pays the whole amount fixed by the tariff on both foreign and domestic product . Mr. Blame challenges the statement made by Mr. Cleveland in his message that " while comparatively a few use the imported articles , millions of our people , who never use and never saw any of the foreign products , purchase and use things of the same // kind made in this country , and pay therefor nearly or quite the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. des . " Mr. Blame thinks " Mr. Cleveland 's argument would have been strengthened if he had given a few examples-nay , if he had given one example  --  to sustain his charge . " I will do myself the pleasure of strengthening Mr. Cleveland 's argument , and will give him for Mr. Cleveland " a few examples " of the accuracy of that statement . I will take steel rails to start with . In 1870 we imported 44,000 tons of steel rails , for which we paid in the foreign market $52 per ton , and duty at $28 . The cost price in our market , duty paid , was $78 , exclusive of costs of freight , insurance , commissions , profits , etc . At the same time we produced 34,000 tons ; price at home $102.50 . In 1872 we imported 105,000 tons , for which we paid in the foreign market $58.17 per ton ; duty , $28 per ton ; together , $86.17 price laid down in New York , exclusive of freights and other charges . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1873 we imported 139,000 tons ; price in foreign country , $64.43 per ton ; duty , $28 ; making $92.43 per ton . At the same time we produced at home 111.5,000 tons ; home price , $120.50 per ton . In 1880 we imported 612,000 tons of pig-iron , worth in foreign markets $18.84 per ton ; duty , $7 per ton ; whole cost delivered in New York , without freight or other charges , $25.84 . Referring to t1*ie pricelist of the Iron and Steel Association , we find the average price for that year of pig-iron in Philadelphia was $28.50 . In 1881 we imported 295,666 tons of pig-iron , for which we paid in the foreign market $20.56 per ton ; $7 duty added made $27.56 delivered in New York . At the same time the average American price was $31.36 per ton . In 1882 we imported 118,062 tons , for which we paid in the foreign market $18.77 per ton ; $7 duty added made $25.77 delivered in New York . The American price for the same time was $31.36 per ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold his product for , a price high enough to cover foreign price , tariff , and all other charges added . These " few examples 's may be accepted as evidences of the cost to the home consumer of the articles which are dutiable and which are imported . It is no answer to this to say that for many articles chargeable with duty the price here is lower than in foreign countries . When it is , we do not import them . Whenever the price rises high enough to import and sell with duty // added , then the similar article produced at home gets " nearly or quite the same enhanced price . " The steel rails which Mr. Blame says were worth *35 per ton in England and the same in the United States are not affected by the tariff . When the demand is small and prices are low , our manufacturers fall below the top of the tariff wall and supply them at such prices above cost of production as they can obtain ; but when the demand is great and prices rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $17 per ton higher than the foreign price . Then both the foreign and the domestic rails carry to the consumer the full tariff rates . Mr. Blame asks if any one believes that steel rails could ever have been furnished as cheaply as English rails except by the steady competition of American producers with the English and among themselves . What competition was there among American manufacturers ? It was a monopoly . The manufacturers owned a patent , and there could be no competition . There was no competition against the English manufacturers , for the tariff prohibited them from competing except when prices were so high that the Englishman could send his rails here , pay duty and charges , and make profits , though $28 on the ton less than the American manufacturer was making . He cites another instance of the wisdom of the tariff in building up the carpet trade . He says that in 1860 nearly one-half of the carpets used in the United States were imported , and now out of sixty millions paid annually for carpets less than a million is paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There was no reason why we should buy any from abroad . " The woollen industry ever since 1824 has had a dead body bound on its shoulders in the tax on wool , and it will never show what it is capable of doing until wool and all other materials used in its manufacture are relieved from tariff taxation , and a revenue duty placed upon the finished product , If wool , like cotton , had been free of duty from 1850 to 1860 , it would have made the same growth as cotton manufactures ; but the 30-per cent . duty on wool greatly restricted the domestic production , and it made but little progress till after the tariff of 1857 , when all wool under twenty cents a pound was put on the free list . In the three years between that time and 1860 it made a very considerable growth . Mr. Blame begs the question when he says that // carpets are cheaper now than they were thirty years . ago . So is everything ; but taxing people did not reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he contends . The price of carpets has been reduced by the improved methods of manufacture , and the wages of the workman by the increased amount of work he does in a day . Mr. Blame wants to know what the thousands of laborers employed in steel-rail manufacture would do if the tariff were removed from steel rails ? The answer is ready : they would make steel rails . He himself shows that we can , and , when we have to do so , do , produce steel rails as cheaply as , they are produced in England . Now , if the duty were entirely removed , a ton of rails would be very much cheaper ; there would be a much greater demand for them and for the labor that makes them ; that increased demand would increase the wages of the men ; there would be more rails made , more railroads built , more men employed , and a reduction in transportation charges . The only change which would be made that would be damaging to anybody would be the reduction in the profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the statement of Mr. Gladstone that we produce cloth and iron at high prices , instead of cereals and cotton at low prices , and he proceeds to thank him profusely in the name of all the friends of high taxes . But it seems to me that the farmer will not become hilarious at the proposition of Mr. Blame to increase for him the cost of producing his cotton and his grains . The whole progress of our industrial system and its enormous growth have come through decreasing the cost of production by utilizing machinery and other agencies for increasing product . If the Western farmer could lower the present cost of producing a bushel of wheat , there would be a greater margin of profit between cost of production and market prices . If a Southern farmer could , by labor-saving machinery or otherwise , reduce the cost of making a bale of cotton one-half below what it is to-day , the South would advance with even greater *trides than she is now making . As Mr. Gladstone says , our manufacturers are producing iron and cloth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased cost when they buy and consume these products , and it is an unnecessarily burdensome and exhausting tax upon them . If the tax on coal and ores were taken off , iron could be produced // cheaper ; if the tax on wool and machinery and dyes were taken off , the cost of producing woollen goods would be reduced ; but , as it is , the price to the consumer is enhanced by these taxes , consumption is restricted , and many have to go without who would otherwise be enabled to buy . Mr. Blame seems to believe in scarcity , and that it would be better for our farmers not to raise so much grain because the foreign market is so filled that the prices are unduly lowered . What else would he have them raise ? Would he have them stop work ? The interest on their debts does not stop running when they stop working . Would it not be better to let the farmers go on working and raise all the wheat they can and send it to foreign markets , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to take it all at good prices , if our government will only let us take what they have to give in exchange and what we want and need ? England needs our food products , and when she takes them to the extent that we take from her what she has to give , then she must look to India , Russia , and other countries to make out her supply and take from them products that cost them more to produce than ours cost us . If we examine the Report on Foreign Oommerce for 1888 , we will see in a table prepared by our Bureau of Statistics that the export price of our wheat for a series of years has been lower than the export price of any other country on the globe . What we want is not to limit the product or to increase the cost of production , as Mr. Blame seems to think , but to increase the facilities of exchange . An increased recognition of the natural right of our farmers to buy and sell would be the true solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stated by Mr. Gladstone , that wages have increased in England since the removal of all shackles from her foreign commerce . But he attributes the advance to the emigration of her workmen to the United States . Both causes contributed to it . It is not a little surprising to witness the facility with which Protectionists shift their logic , He has been impressing us all through his very able article with the idea that it was protection that raised wages ; now he says it is demand and supply . Mr. Gladstone used the same argument for free trade which Mr. Blame had used for protection : in order to parry the blow Mr. Blame contends that it was not free trade that increased English wages , but scarcity of English labor . It is very // gratifying to find Mr. Blame admitting that wages are regulated by demand and supply , and that when English workmen emigrated to the United States , the labor supply was reduced , the demand for labor increased , and therefore the rate of wages was increased . Following it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for labor , and retarded the increase of the rate of wages . Oar rate of wages , just as that in England , is fixed by the amount of demand for work , the number of laborers ready to respond to that demand , and the skill and capacity of the laborer to do the work required by his employer . He is not protected by any tariff imposed on the products of his labor , and can not be . In common with the great body of the people , he is taxed to put money in the pockets of the man who owns the products , not the muscle or the brain . Protecting his product does not protect him against competition . There are no protective duties on foreign labor . It is on the free list . And so far as our labor is concerned , it has had to contend against free trade from the beginning of the government . The tariff protects the thing that labor makes , but that does not belong to him ; it belongs to his employer . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bituminous coal , but it does not inure to the benefit of the miner ; he gets forty or fifty cents a ton for his work , which he would get without the tariff , just as the anthracite miner does , whose competing article comes in free of duty . The tariff benefit goes into the pocket of the owner of the coal , and he may manifest a great deal of zeal for the welfare of his workmen , but he never gives them the seventy-five cents which Congress has imposed on the ton of coal for his benefit . There is a tax on iron ore of seventyfive cents , but the miner only gets from fifty to seventy-five cents per ton for his work , and he never gets the tariff benefits ; they go to the owner of the ore . It is the ore that is protected , not the muscle that digs it . There is a duty of $6.72 on a ton of pig-iron , but the workmen only get from $1.25 to $1.50 per ton for their labor , and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited from competing with them . The prohibition against competition is only against the pig-iron , and that does not belong to them . The manufacturer gets it and keeps it . There is a duty of $17 on a ton of steel rails , but the laborer only gets from $3.50 to $5 , and that he would get witheut // any tariff . The *17 goes to the owner of the steel rails , and he keeps it , and if his workmen can keep their souls and bodies together they will do well . Mr. Blame asks , How can the Free-Trader explain the fact that a great many articles manufactured in the United States find ready and large sale in Canada ? He says that we have to pay the same tariff duties and higher transportation charges to reach the Canadian market , and he appends a long list of manufactured articles which we export to and sell in Canada in competition with English rivals . Before proceeding to answer his question , I must thank him on behalf of all the tax-ridden people of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shred of the web of controversy left . He admits that we can mannfacture our goods , pay higher freight charges to foreign markets , and then hold our own against our rivals . If we can do that in the foreign market , we can certainly do it at home , when the foreigner pays all the freight charges to reach us and we pay none . Then what is the use of protective duties on these goods ? No tariff can protect any article against competition at the place where it is produced at the lowest cost , because no article can compete with it . There can be no importation and , of course , no competition . This admission must have dropped from his pen in " the heat of debate . " His friends will find it in all the roads they travel in the near future . The answer to his question is that we do produce these articles , and many more , more cheaply than they can be produced in any other country or by any other people on the globe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other people . It turns out more and better product in a day than any rival , and while it may receive double the wages of others it does treble the work , and in some cases ten times as much . These articles , it will be noticed , are of that class in which the labor is a large element in the cost , and just as any article becomes further removed from the raw-material condition , just so it becomes further removed from competition . It is our superior labor that gives us precedence , and if we take the tax off the raw material we will add woollens , cottons , iron and steel , and many other kinds of manufactures to our exports . The only item of woollen manufacture in this class is carpets . They are made of the cheapest wool , bearing the lowest duty . Now , if we can pay this low duty on // in carpet wools and pay higher transportation charges , and still hold the foreign market , could we not sell more carpets if we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce them at a lower cost if the tax on carpet wool were taken off ? And then if the heavy tax were taken off combing and clothing wools , could we not largely increase our exports of woollen goods ? And if we could increase our exports to Canada and hold her markets against our foreign rivals , could we not hold our home markets , when the foreigner would have to pay the cost of reaching us before he could compete ? I hardly know how to express my gratification at having this admission from so distinguished an advocate and so able a defender of commercial restriction . With the facts as he states them  --  and they are correct-there can be no justification for keeping any taxes on these articles . There may be a reason for it , but it is a reason that can not be defended . A duty on these goods can only serve the manufacturers in one way . When they form combinations and trusts , and make high rates to sell to our people and low rates to sell to foreigners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can sell to us at combination prices and to foreigners at competition prices . Many articles are exported and sold to foreigners at lower prices than they are to citizens at home . The tariff is a powerful offender that watches at the gate and guards and protects the robber while he is in the house spoiling the goods of the husbandman . Mr. Blame contends that protection not only increases the wealth of the protected manufacturer , into whose pocket the increased price goes , but the farmer also , out of whose pocket it goes ; and he very triumphantly refers to the census of 1860 and that of 1880 to show that national wealth has been growing all over the Union , in the agricultural States as well as in the manufacturing States . If he had gone back ten years and started at 1850 , he could have proved the same facts under the free-trade tariffs in existence for the ten years between 1850 and 1860 . So the fact of increase alone is not sufficient to determine the relative merits of the two opposing policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1860 with that from 1860 to 1870  --  the first under revenue tariffs , the other under protective tariffs . In 1850 the national wealth was $7,136,000,000 ; in 1860 it was $16,160,000-000 ; which shows a gain of 126 per cent .  --  a ratio of increase that // has never been approximated during any decade either before or since the war . In 1825-in the beginning of that period which Mr. Blame characterizes as one of the most prosperous that the country has ever had  --  the national wealth was *3,273,000,000 . In 1832 , at the end of that seven years of fatness , the national wealth reached *4,071,000,000 . ( I quote from the tables of the director of the mint for 1881 . ) This shows an increase of 25 per cent . in the seven years . Let us now compare the increase during the first seven years under the free-trade tariff of 1846 . In 1846 the national wealth was $6,302,000,000 , and in 1853 it was *9,708,000,000 , which was an increase of 54 per cent . At the end of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national wealth was *16,160,000,000 , which was an increase of 66 per cent . This was the last of the freetrade era in the United *Fates . Since then we have had thirty years of high tariffs , high taxes , and high obstructions to trade . Leaving 1860 , we leave the national wealth accumulating at a rate exceeding 13 per cent . per annum . Now let ns compare the growth of national wealth in periods of seven years since the adoption of the protective policy . I take periods of seven years in order to make comparisons with that remarkable period from 1825 to 1832 , which Mr. Clay thought then , and Mr. Blame thinks now , was the most prosperous the country has ever had . In 1867 , under the stimulating effect of high duties and restricted trade , the national wealth was *22 ,  - -  958,000,000 , which was an increase of only 42 per cent. , instead of 66 per cent . under the last seven years of free trade . But it may be said that this period embraced the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of consideration , let ns take the next seven years . In 1874 the national wealth was *32,420,000,000 , which was an increase of only 41 per cent . over 1867 . In 1880 the national wealth was *43,300,000,000 . For the three or four years preceding it was increasing at a ratio less than two billions a year . If we add two billions to the sum of *43,300,000,000 , it will make *45,300,000,000 for 1881 , the end of the last seven years for which we have any official report ; and that would show an increase of 30 per cent . From these comparisons it wonld seem that the great American system , like the great American crawfish , was advancing backwards and carrying the country with it . If these comparisons // afford any comfort or encouragement to the advocates of high taxes , I certainly do not envy them while they grow hilarious with the pleasure which their contemplation affords . Mr. Blame thinks he makes a strong point for protection when he shows that the New England States and New York and Pennsylvania ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1860 $5,123,000,000 of aggregate wealth , and had increased it to $16,228,000,000 in 1880 , which he says is 216 per cent. ; but let us go back to 1850 again , and see how they were prospering under free trade from 1850 to 1860 . In 1850 these same States had aggregate wealth amounting to $2,930,000,000 , and in 1860 they had $5,123,000,000 , which was an increase of 75 per cent . After 1860 they began their career under high protective war duties , and in 1870 had aggregate wealth amounting to $14,350,000,000 , which was an increase of 180 per cent . over 1860 , or 18 per cent . per annum ! I give it up . Protection did protect the manufacturers while the government , as well as the people , was buying at high prices to supply the consumption and waste occasioned by a gigantic war . But let us see how they fared after the war was over . In 1880 they had aggregate wealth amounting to $18,700,000,000 , or an increase over 1870 of less than 30 per cent. , or 3 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over these manufacturing States would be glad to return to the ratio of increase they enjoyed during the free-trade decade , which was 7*- per cent . per annum , instead of 3 per cent . per annum under protection . Next let us compare the growth of the agricultural States named by Mr. Blame under free trade and protection . In 1850 the States named by him , except Minnesota , Kansas , and Nebraska ( which were not States at that time ) , had aggregate wealth amounting to $990,000,000 , and in 1860 , under free trade , their wealth amounted to $3,370,000,000 . This was an increase at the rate of 240 per cent . Now , from 18E*0 to 1870 , under protection , their wealth had grown to $7,765,000,000 , which was an increase of 130 per cent. ; but that is a long way behind 240 per cent. , which they made in the free-trade decade . In 1880 the wealth of these same States was $11,650,000,000 , which was an increase of 50 per cent . They increased at 24 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . per annum under protection . Let us compare Massachusetts and Illinois , one a manufacturing State and the other an agricultural State , Mas8achusetts // had in 1850 $88,000,000 invested in manufactures and Illinois had $6,000,000 . Massachusetts had $573,000,000 of wealth ; Illinois had $156,000,000 . Massachusetts had 994,000 people and Illinois had 851,000 people . In the contest for wealth Massachusetts had the advantage in population of 143,000 people , of $417 ,  - -  000,000 more capital , and fourteen times as much manufacturing capacity . With such advantages she ought to have left Illinois out of sight hi the race ; but at the end of the contest in 1860 Illinois had caught up with and passed her rival , having accumulated $871 , OQO , 000 , while Massachusetts had gotten $815 ,  - -  000,000 . Illinois farmers , unshackled by restrictions on their farm products , had increased her wealth at 457 per cent. , and . Massachusetts manufacturers had increased hers at 42 per cent . They now start a new race under the fostering care of a protective tariff . This time Illinois starts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-million more people , but when the contest was ended in 1870 , she had a million more people and ten millions less money . Illinois had increased her wealth 143 per cent . under protective tariffs and 457 per cent . under free-trade tariffs , while Massachusetts made 42-per cent . increase under low tariffs and 161-per cent . increase under high tariffs . It seems from this that the protective tariff increased the profits of the manufacturer , but decreased the profits of the farmer . That was its history at the time . Now , with few exceptions , it is decreas - ing the profits of both . Mr. Blame comforts the South by telling them that under protection they have since 1860 increased their wealth 80 per cent. , or 4 per cent . per annum . If he will look back to the period between 1850 and 1860 , he will see that they gained wealth at a rate exceeding 10 per cent . per annum , instead of 4 per cent . under protective tariffs since then . The taxpayers of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of Chief-Justice Marshall 's utterance , that a power to tax is a power to destroy , are not very choice in selecting the words with which they characterize the few hundred beneficiaries whose arms are in their pockets up to the shoulders . They have sometimes distinguished these large proprietors by the mediaeval designation of " Robber Barons . " When they see the manufacturers of steel rails , by the aid of tariff taxes , taking out of their pockets in twelve years mQ*e than $150,000,000 and all the m*nufacturer* of ii*on *ud // steel in the same time taking over $600,000,000 , it is hardly to be supposed that they will use the most delicate terms to convey their ideas . One of these gentlemen , a native of the same country as Mr. Gladstone , has given to the public his opinions as to the best way to expend the large incomes which they enjoy . The idea of plain people is that the pocket of the taxpayer is the best place for them , and the place where they rightfully belong . Mr. Gladstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in speaking of the beneficiaries of protection , and Mr. Blame shows the liveliest appreciation of his delicacy of feeling . Mr. Gladstone is three thousand miles away . He has not been familiar with the results of American protective tariffs for the last thirty years . He has not seen the farmers of England , as we have those of America , brought deeper and deeper in debt year by year and forced to borrow back at high interest the money that was extorted from them by " legislative decrees . " He has not seen English manufacturers , as we have seen American manufacturers , closing down and discharging their laborers because consumers are not able to buy their high-cost goods . In his essay he simply discussed a principle , without characterizing the wrongdoers . If Mr. Blame could have heard " the Grand Old Man " fifty years ago , when , in the prime of his young manhood , he was supporting Villiers , iluskisson , Bright , Peel , and Cobden when they were assailing the avarice and greed of English landlords who clamored for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the months of the working men and women of England , he might have caught the sound of an occasional adjective as it fell from Mr. Gladstone 's lips . Mr. Blame must not think that strong language of the kind quoted by him is confined to the plain people of the United States . Sometimes it gets in the mouths of men in high stations . The Supreme Court of the United States , holding their places for life and uninfluenced by the prejudices that sometimes move the multitude , declared from the bench that " to lay with one hand the power of the government on the property of the citizen , and wiLh the other to bestow it upon favored individuals to aid private enterprises , and build up private fortunes , is none the less a robbery because it is done under the forms of law and is called taxation. * ' Eighty summers have passed cver the head of the great English statesman who has spoken for the emancipation of our // THE NORTH AMERIUAN REVIEW . labor and our trade .
