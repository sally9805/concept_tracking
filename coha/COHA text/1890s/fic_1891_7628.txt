Hayne , Paul Hamilton , 1830-1886 : THE STORY OF AN AMBUSCADE. from The story of an ambuscade ( 1891 ) Yes , children , I can see it still , that rude old fortress there , Crouched on a sparsely-wooded hill , beside the far frontier ; For thence brigands of Mexico and wild red warriors came , About them rose a fume of blood , a storm of clouded flame . Yet round the ramparts , sunset-flushed , our happy Colonel trod , As if their stones had caught a gleam from the golden streets of God ; For there his wife , his nobler life , in heavenly beauty smiled , And , folded in his loyal arms , he held aloft their child . One morn  --  I well remember it  --  a June morn , fresh and bland , The Colonel with a score of guards rode down the summer-land , His lady on her bright , bay horse  --  a matron-rose aglow  --  And little Lulu , laughing , perched across his saddle-bow . We passed  --  the Colonel 's comrade staunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coverts dim beneath the breezy sky ; A pleasant camping-place we reached amid tall locust trees , Made musical the livelong day by murmuring of the bees . When had I seen our pretty queen with joy so blithely stirred ! She flitted on from group to group like a gay April bird ; Suddenly I saw a dazzling streak of flame , I heard a deadly whirr , And vicious as a serpent 's tongue a keen shaft hissed by her . Then rose the war-whoop resonant , and with it flashed and flew An arrowy sleet so thick and fleet it blurred the startled blue ; A shrewd Apach ambuscade ! we scarce might fight or fly , But , trapped in utter impotence , could only turn to  --  die . ' T was like a night-mare dream to me  --  our Colonel 's lowering gaze , The quick surprise in startled eyes , the agonized amaze . His lady 's face an instant writhed in horror and despair ; The next , her soul had seemed to melt like white mist on the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sobbing breath ! But calm , and clear , through all the drear , fierce scene of blood and death , My leader 's solemn , last command smote like a tolling bell , As there , above his silent Love , he waved a stern farewell : " I charge you , Gilbert , save the child ! " My darling strove to speak , But fainted with her white rose face against my bronzd cheek ; When half-blinded by the smoke I almost fell across a ghastly corse , And mid the barbarous din I heard the neigh of a swift trampling horse . From out the smoke his forehead broke , his frightened eyes a-glare , What horse  --  ah ! what horse had met me there ? My own black Juan ! at a word he knew me  --  on his back I vaulted with my helpless charge and scoured the homeward track . Alas ! Apach sight is keen , we could not cheat our foes ; We matched the wind , but yet behind the sullen echoes rose ; And every hoof-stroke Juan made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians massed their forces on our rear . I , maddened , wheeled !  --  a tomahawk blow !  --  my life seemed smitten out , And all my scattered senses fled in dark disastrous rout ; My arms relaxed , I feebly felt the wounded maiden fall , Ere blackness of dense darkness bound me in its pall ! When next I woke to consciousness , in the old fort I lay , Whither , stunned , bleeding , bruised , from out the desperate fray , But clutching still unwittingly my Juan 's mane , they said  --  In reeling plight , beyond the fight , I rode less quick than dead . Another of our ambushed band  --  but one  --  survived the strife ; And he , ah me ! he cursed the fate whose grace had spared his life . " Would I had died , " our Colonel cried , " on that accursd morn ! The blast which blights the tender blade hath passed the bearded corn . " Henceforth , I track the Apach 's trails ; your hand , my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride afar , to search for him in every land ! " Ere long his fame grew terrible ! From streams to mountain caves The whole Apach realm became a desert place of graves ; He led his men by hill and glen , a warrior gaunt and grim , And still I vowed ' neath calm or cloud to hunt the wilds with him . At length , slowly and all solemnly  --  in truth , ' t was passing strange , Across his brooding spirit there fell a wondrous change . If yet he rode the savage wastes , ' t was not to burn or slay ; The bleak December of his mood seemed melting into May . His band dismissed , his martial rank without a sigh resigned , A new , mysterious influence swayed the actions of his mind . And once he murmured in deep sleep  --  or was it trancd rest ?  --  " Lead on ! ah , tender angel , lead towar 'd the brightening west ; There love abides between the tides in that far valley land . See ! the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grande ! " And still I followed through fair noons , or midnight shadows dim ; Had I not vowed to ride , to hunt , to search the world with him ? When on a fragrant eve of June , divinely soft and clear , We topped a height steeped in moonlight the far frontier . His horse was checked , and on his face the moonshine fell with weird gleam . He faintly spake , as scarce awake , " My dream ! my dream ! my dream ! " And on his upturned brow were beads of fiery-misted dew , Above the eyes his lightning heart was flashing keenly through . " The valley of my dream ! " he said ; " between two rocky hills  --  Mark , mark midway the snow-white tent , and hear the rush of rills ! The valley of my dream ! O Christ ! I thank thee for this sight . " And with the word , impetuously he hurried down the height . I spurred behind ; but each , ere long , subdued his stormy pace ; An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodward to the chase . Hark ! on the night from out the white and glittering tent-roof stole Such music as winds bewitchingly about the harshest soul . And as it thrilled , there passed from out the bright folds withdrawn , A creature like the herald-star that crowns the early dawn . He paused  --  and on my comrade 's eyes her startled glances turned , As if within their depths half-wakened memories burned . And down the range of years of change her deathless instinct sought Something that in this stranger recalled a vision in her thought ; A few quick rapturous words she spake ; ah ! charmed , remembered voice ! It touched her subtlest consciousness , it bade her soul rejoice ! " Father ! " that sacred name survived her scattered English speech , Even as a flawless relic smiles along a wreck-strewn beach ; With that fond utterance , all the mists of doubt and dreams depart , And the lost darling of his love weeps on her father 's heart !             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
