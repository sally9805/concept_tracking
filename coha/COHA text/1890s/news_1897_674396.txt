txt The kite-flying experiments of Lieut . H. D. Wise , on Governors Island , have at last been successful , and the Lieutenant is the first man in America to go aloft on a kite string . He made an ascent yesterday when the - wind was blowing fifteen miles an hour . Lieut . Wise 's kites have attracted attention for six months . They have been numerous , of varied patterns , and flown in twos , threes , fours , and sixes . The kites used yesterday were of the Hargrave type . They are parallelopiped frames , stiffened by wire braces , and wrapped about at either end by strong cotton cloth . The ends are open , and the space on the sides between the cloth bands is also open . Four of them were used , forming two tandems . The cloth spread about the ends forms the lifting surface . On the smallest kite the lifting surface was 20 square feet , and on the kite which - went on the same line with it , tandem , but 150 feet lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These two were raised first , till the lower one had been run out 150 feet , and then the other two were raised similarly and the two strings connected to a common one . Of the second two kites , one had a lifting surface of 40 square feet and the other 160 square feet . Before these second kites were sent up , the largest of the first two collapsed and it was necessary to pull it in and replace it with a duplicate . The Lieutenant was assisted by Corp . Lewis and five men in raising the first tandem , the quarter-inch manila rope used being passed around a windlass that had been secured to a tree . Four additional men were then required to hold them while the line was being connected with that of the second tandem . Each was made fast to an iron ring , to which the main line was then attached . and passed about the windlass . This line was of one-half-inch manila rope . On the ring was fixed also a pulley block with a line of half-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair hung from one end of this line , while the other end was held by two men on the ground . ghe main line was then played out till the iron ring was about 50 feet above the earth . The chair was held down to the ground and the check line run out through the pulley till it was taut . Failure and Then Success . The wind was then from the southeast and the kites were pulling about 400 pounds . Presently the wind 's velocity fell from fifteen to twelve miles an hour . Lieut . Wise got into the boatswain 's chair and directed the men who had hold of the cheek line to bkirif him U. AS they pulled the line through the block , however , it only sagged the main line . The kites were not able to lift him with the wind then blowing . Then the wind increased , the main line tautened , and the men again pulled on the check line , and the Lieutenant was swung off his feet . They pulled him up about twenty feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line sagged and tautened alternately , letting him up and down . As the check line passed through a device close by the chair , it was subject to the control of the Lieutenant sitting in the chair , as well as of those who held the end on the ground . The/lieutenant came down presently , and waited for a stiffer wind . It came presently and he was again hauled up all the way to the ring , which , with the sag his weight caused , was then forty-two feet above the ground , or a little higher than the eaves of the officers ' quarters . By playing out the main line from the windlass he could , of course , have gone higher , in which case the check rope would have been made fast at the chair and the ground end let go . In view of the collapse of the ninety-foot kit at the start , the Lieutenant was not inclined to take the risk , especially as he was not provided with a parachute . Only Two Other Such Ascents . Only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England by Capt . H. Baden Powell of the Scots Grays , who went up one hundred feet armed with a parachute , the other was by Lawrence Hargrove in Australia , who went up forty feet . Lieut . Wise , who is connected with the Ninth Infantry stationed on Governors Island , is making his experiments on his own responsibility . He believes that the kite can be made of value for military reconnoissance . He said last night : " I think that possibly these kites may be exceedingly useful . A number of able students , such as Prof. Langley of the ' Smithsonian Institution , Prof. Marvin of the Weather Bureau , and Civil Engineer Charut of Chicago , have been investigating the subject . I think that ultimately a kite will be perfected that will carry a man in a gale that would tear a captive balloon to pieces . The portability of these kites must contribute to their usefulness . They will , however , always labor under the difficulties of requiring a strong breeze . The four I used to-day weighed altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the covers of strong cotton cloth . They are of the cellular form . Each has four lifting surfaces and four guiding surfaces . The kite is my own modification of : the Hargrove kite . The modification is a structural one rather than one of principle , and I do not claim much credit for it . " Lieut . Wise said that he had worked hard and given much study to the methods of those who had been pioneers in this line of effort . " I have never made any experiments , " he said , " till I have worked them out in theory . I have had a great deal of bad luck , however , and the number of kites that have broken has sometimes been discouraging . The largest cost about $12 . I have now about sixty kites of many kinds . I use different forms for different purposes . "
