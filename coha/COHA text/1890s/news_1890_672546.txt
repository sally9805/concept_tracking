txt No freight trains were run on the Northampton Division of the Consolidated Railroad to-day because the brakemen of that division were out on a strike for shorter working days or pay for all the time they put in over ten hours a day . The strike was secretly planned , and was carried into effect without giving any notice to the company of the existing grievances or intended action . When the early freight trains , at 2 and 3 o'clock this morning , were ready to start , only one of the seventeen brakemen had appeared . At G o'clock four freight trains were waiting for crews , but no more men had appeared , and the one ' who was present earlier in the morning had determined to join his associates . Later some of the disaffected employes arrived at the freight yards , but refused to go to work . Assistant Superintendent Curtiss endeavored to settle the difficulty with them , but he was unsuccessful . The men declared that they had been overworked for several weeks , often working sixteen hours a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They demanded a limitation of the regular working day to ten hours , with wages of $1.95 , the regular rate , and 20 cents an hour for overtime . In the absence of Superintendent Yeomans in Springe e id Mr. Curtiss refused to take any action , and consequently the trains were tied up all day . This evening President Clark ordered the absolute discharge of all the strikers , and new men are being engaged . A train was sent out at 10:20 o'clock to-night with three conductors as brakemen , anti four other trains are being put in readiness to start early in the morning . The tracks through the outs in the centre of the city are being guarded by policemen . The strikers allege that they delivered a formal statement of their grievances to Assistant Superintendent Curtiss several days ago , but this is positively denied by Mr. Curtiss . The freight traffic on the Northampton Road has been exceedingly heavy this week , and the failure of the outgoing trains to run to-day has caused a great deal of confusion .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
