txt The general strike order issued from the United Mine Workers ' headquarters at Columbus has not been obeyed by all the miners of the Pittsburg district . From definite reports received it is known that fully 5 , C00 men went to work this morning , and it is believed many more will return to-morrow morning . The capacity of the mines in operation is enough to supply present consumption , and the price of coal will not be materially advanced . President Patrick Dolan of the District Mine Workers seems confident of success , however , and says he will get all the miners out . The mines at work are the Harrison of Beadling Brothers , Allison of J. V. Cook &; Son , Oak Hill , Plum Creek , and Sandy Creek of the New York and Cleveland Gas Coal Company ; First Pool , Glenshaw , and Jumbo No. 1 of the F. L. Robbins Company ; Gastonville and Snowden of the Pittsburg and Chicago Coal Company , Whitsell , Darr , and West Newton of Osborne &; Saeger ; Banning of Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boreland Mine of Pan Handle Coal Company , Painter of the J. W. Painter Coal Company , Euclid of the Ohio and Pennsylvania . Lyons Run of the Elkins Gas Coal Company , Cliff and Montour of the Imperial Coal Company , and Eureka of the Eureka Coal Company . M. A. Hanna &; Co. ' s men refused to strike at the Boreland Mine . The miners who came to headquarters to-day said that there was talk of steps being taken to compel all the miners to come out , and if any such attempt is made trouble will ensue . The miners ' officials have no funds with which to carry on the strike properly . None of the river miners quit except those of Jones &; Co . President Dolan of the miners says he will hold meetings at all the places where the miners are at work to persuade them to quit . While working among the men employed at the New York and Cleveland mines yesterday he got into a row and was saved by a Superintendent . A meeting win be called at these mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent letters to all Pittsburg operators , offering to supply coal for all contracts for lake shipments at GO cents a ton net at Buffalo . W. P. Dearmitt , President of the New York and Cleveland Gas Coal Company , was emphatic in his assertion this evening that the strike would be a failure . " We bad more men at work to-day , " said he " than any day for a number of years after a holiday . I attribute this to the tact that the men came to work because they did not care to be identified with this movement . . More than twenty-five mines were working in the Pittsburg district to-day . " At the miners ' headquarters , President Dolan was apparently in the best of humor . He had received reports from nearly every part of the ' district , and seemed pleased with the prospects . " More miners will join the movement before the end of the . week , " said he . " and I am perfectly satisfied with the progress made . Yet there are some mines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " While it is estimated that at least two-thirds of the miners have thrown down their picks , enough men are still at work to seriously impair the chances of the strikers unless they can ultimately be brought out . This President Dolan confidently claims can be done . The operators , on the other hand , assert that the strike can not succeed . The first break in the operators ' ranks was made this afternoon by J. W. Steen of the 0 . I. C. mines at Rossville . The diggers refused to work , and the mine was closed down , but a notice was posted that after to-day the sixty-nine-cent rate would he paid . It is not likely that the officials will allow the men to work until a majority of the operators have agreed to the miners ' demands . In West Virginia the miners have been slow in responding to the strike order . A dispatch to-night says that a general strike in the State is not probable . The men are not organized and they are inclined to regard the strike elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at good prices while it is pending . Great pressure is being brought to bear upon them by the United Mine Workers ' officials to join the strike , but so far without success . The impression among operators and miners in this State is that West Virginia will be able to supply the demand for coal in the event of a prolonged strike , and that the operators will be justified in offering the miners inducements to remain at work , as they did in 1591.
