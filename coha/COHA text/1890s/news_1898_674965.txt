txt The situation tonight on the eve of the Democratic State Convention is as it was this morning and Yesterday . Thera is no promise of its clearing up until the convention meets and confronts the calestion of candidates . As far as can now be ascertained there is no slate and no set programme . Mr. Croker himself , it is said , is waiting to test the temper of the convention . Tammany , it is generally admitted by the up-State delegates , holds the key to the situation , but the New York organization is embarrassed by the prominence with which Mayor Van Wyck 's name has been mentioned . If the Mayor was out of the way it is thought Tammany would name the nominee at once . As it is , however , it will wait and see how the convention receives the nomination of Mr. Van Wyck . Mr. Croker is credited with saying , in reply to a question if he would support Van Wyck : " I do n't want to see Van Wyck run , but if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will have it . " All of the disadvantages of Tammany having its Mayor enter the race are being eagerly discussed to-night , as they have been all day . The weight of opinion seems to be that it would be bad policy , but that Tammany may easily find Itself compelled to go to Van Wyck 's support , even at the cost of some discomfort in the home organization . At all events , this possibility is very much feared by the other candidates , and they are in an uneasy state of mind . A Stampede Talked Of . There , s a carefully laid plan to rush Van Wyck 's name through the convention . Frank Rice , ex-Secretary of State , will place him in nomination , and the Ontario and Wayne delegates are expected to go to him . It is then expected that the Tammany delegates , 105 strong , will shout for Van Wyck , that banners will be fluttered over the convention , and that the delegates will rush into the front to support the Tammany candidate . It is asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to this scheme , but it is admitted by them that if it is sent off with some enthusiasm it would be almost impossible to avoid making it a success . A Boom for Stanchfield . . It is thought that Mr. Croker , and , of course , Tammany , would like to put Stanch-field in nomination , and , failing him , then Justice Herrick of Albany . The most positive talk among politicians to-night is in favor of Stanchfield , and it is said that the delegates from all over the State , having learned something as to Mr. Croker 's preference , are going over to the candidate from Elmira . If the Van Wyck boom comes to naught or can be quietly called off without hurting the Mayor 's feelings , the solid Tammany vote , together with that of Kings County , will be thrown to Stanchfield . At least , such is the opinion to-night of close friends of Mr. Croker . Eliot Danforth seems to have lost following to-day . There is corresponding gloom about his headquarters . He said to-night that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first ballot . His highest calculation is that he will have ISO delegates behind him . There is very little talk to-day , however , of the Danforth boom . Since Mr. Stauchfield came so far to the front , there are not many outside of Mr. Danforth 's Own following who expect to see him win out . The talk of the free-silver men about running him on an independent ticket if the convention refuses to reaffirm the Chicago platform has also hurt his chances . It is said that he should not have allowed his name used by the threatened bolters . Little Support for Herrick . It has surprised the friends of Justice Herrick to find that he has apparently little support outside his immediate neighborhood . It was reported this morning that he would be the Tammany Hall candidate because of his political enmity toward ex-Senator Hill , and it was urged that his long experience in politics and his long public life had made him a familiar and respected figure throughout the State . The Herrick men , however , have met only discouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is talking Herrick . It is conceded , however , that the Justice is still a potent factor in the convention , and no one would be much surprised to see the tide set back toward him after a ballot Or two . District Attorney Asa Bird Gardiner , who was here long before the Tammany delegation arrived , was asked this afternoon if there was any truth in certain reports that he might be a candidate for the Gubernatorial nomination . " I would n't touch the nomination with a ten-foot pole , " said the Colonel . " I talked with Mr. Croker about it , and that 's what I told him . There is really no reason why I should want it . " The Colonel also said that he thought the Tammany leaders did not want Mayor Van Wyck to get the nomination , and thus cause them to risk the Mayoralty next year . He said , however , that there did seem to be a good deal of sentiment for the Mayor . Titus and the Governorship . Justice Titus is quoted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-four votes on first ballot in the convention , and those sixty-four will all stick to me . I will accept no other place on the State ticket . " Outside of the counties of the Eighth Judicial District the Justice claims Warren and Sullivan . William F. Mackey of Buffalo will nominate Justice Titus . The delegates pledged to vote for Justice Titus for Governor met this afternoon and appointed a , committee of five to work in the Justice 's interest among the other delegations . The Erie delegates say their candidate 's name will in no circumstances be withdrawn and that they are confident that he will get the nomination . Neither Mr. Croker nor Senator Murphy attended the meeting of the State Committee this evening . Mr. Hill was the only one of the four State leaders present , but he took no part in the proceedings beyond saying a few words in regard to a small matter of routine business . Palmer Temporary Chairman . Senator Patrick H. McCarren , Chairman of the Campaign Committee , moved that George M. Palmer of Schoharie be selected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted . The Senator then moved that Charles R. De Freest , Frank P. Hulett , and Thomas E. Benedict and Clark Day be selected as temporary Secretaries of the convention . This motion also was carried . It was decided that the new State Committee should meet immediately after the convention adjourns . The latest report is that Herbert P. Bissell of Buffalo , brother of ex-Postmaster ' General Bissell , will be permanent Chairman of the convention . It is a general belief among the Tammany men that Senator McCarren will be chosen Chairman of the new State Committee . Elliot Danforth , they expect , will sink into obscurity after the supposed fall of Mr. Hill . Soon after Mr. Croker arrived a conference was held , which was attended by Mr. Croker , Mr. Hill , Senator Murphy , Senator McCarren , and Anthony V. Brady of Albany . The action taken later by the State Committee was decided upon , but there was no talk of candidates for Governor . Only one man was practically decided upon for the ticket . This was Thomas F. Conway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought for by at least a dozen men in different parts of the State . Ex-Judge John D. Lynn of Rochester and Charles V. Bulger were two of those counted upon as strong candidates . From a reliable source it was learned that there was little doubt that Mr. Conway would be nominated . Croker Dines with Hill . The most interesting feature of the meet-. ing between Mr. Croker and Mr. Hill came after the conference . To the surprise of nearly everybody these two men , who have been at swords points and who have been considered not only enemies politically but personally as well , took dinner together in a private room . They were all alone , and what passed between them has not yet leaked out . Even Mr. Hill 's old friends admit that he has lost his grip on the State organization . He has opened headquarters here , and is making what is asserted to be a fruitless effort to win back men who stuck by him through thick and thin in former years . Mr. Hill is said to realize his defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know what is going on , " said an up-the-State leader to-night . " He knows he no longer cuts much of a figure in the councils of the party , and he is a bitterly disappointed man . " After Mr. Hill and Mr. Croker had dined the latter went to the theatre , . and Mr. Hill went up to the State Committee meeting .
