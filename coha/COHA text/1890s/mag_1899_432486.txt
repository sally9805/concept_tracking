 | IN that clamor which has arisen in the modern world , where now this , and then that , is demanded for and by large bodies of modern women , he who listens carefully may detect as a key-note , beneath all the clamor , a demand which may be embodied in such a cry as this : " Give us labor and the training which fits for labor ! We demand this not for ourselves alone , but for the race ! " If this demand be logically expanded , it will take such form as this : " Give us labor ! For countless ages , for thousands , millions it may he , we have labored . When man first wandered , the naked , newly erected savage , and hunted and fought , we wandered with him ; each step of his was ours . Within our bodies we bore the race , on our shoulders we carried it , we sought the roots and plants for its food ; and when man 's barbed arrow or hook brought the game , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and the savage woman , we wandered free together , and labored free together . And we were contented " Then , a change came . " We ceased from our wanderings , and camping upon one spot of earth , again the labors of life were divided between us . While man went forth to hunt , or to battle with the foe who would have dispossessed us of all , we labored on the land . We hoed the earth , we reaped the grain , we shaped the dwellings , we wove the clothing , we modeled the earthen vessels , and drew the lines upon them , which were humanity 's first attempt at domestic art ; we studied the properties and uses of plants , and our old women were the first physicians of the race . as often its first priests and prophets . " We fed the race at our breast , we bore it on our shoulders ; through us it was shaped , fed and clothed : labor more toilsome and unending than that of man was ours ; yet did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . While savage man lay in the sunshine on his skins , resting , that he might be fitted for war or chase , or while he shaped his weapons of death , he ate and drank that which our hands had provided for him ; and while we knelt over our grindstone , or hoed in the fields , with one child in our womb and one on our back , toiling till the young body was old before its time ? did we ever cry out that the labor allotted to us was too hard for us ? Did we not know that the woman who threw down her burden was as the man who cast away his shield in battle ? a coward , and a traitor to his race ? Man fought ? that was his work : we fed and nurtured the race ? that iv as ours . We knew that upon our labors even as upon man 's depended the life and well-being of the people whom we bore . We endured our toil , as man bore his wounds . silently ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change came . " Ages passed , and time was when it was no longer necessary that all men should go to the hunt or the field of war : and when only one in five , of one in ten , or but one in twenty , was needed continually for these labors : Then our fellow-man , having no longer full occupation in his old fields of labor , began to take his share in ours . He too began to cultivate the field , to build the house . to grind the corn ( or made his male slaves do it ' ) : and the hoe , and the potter 's tools , and the thatching-needle , and at last even the grindstones which we first had picked up and smoothed to grind the food for our children , began to pass from our hands into his . The old , sweet life of the open fields was ours no more ; we moved within the gates . where time passes more slowly and the world is sadder than in the air outside : but we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If . indeed , we might no longer grow the food for our people , we were still its dressers ; if we did not always plant and prepare the flax and hemp , we still wove the garments for our race ; if we did not longer raise the house walls , the tapestries that covered them were the work of our hands : and , close about our  | feet , from birth to manhood , grew up the children whom we had borne ; their voices were always in our ears . At the doors of our houses we sat with our spinning-wheels , and we looked out across the fields which once were ours to labor in ? and were contented . Lord 's wife , peasant's. or burgher 's , we all still had our work to do ! A thousand years ago , had one gone to some great dame , questioning her why she did not go out a-hunting or a-fighting , nor enter the great hall to dispense justice and confer upon the making of laws , she would have answered , Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Have I not a hundred maidens to keep at work at spinning-wheels and needles ? with my own hands daily do not I dispense bread to over a hundred folk ? in the great hall go and see the tapestries I with my maidens have created by the labor of years , and which we shall labor over for twenty more , that my children 's children may see recorded the great deeds of their forefathers . In my store-room are there not salves and simples , that my own hands have prepared for the healing of my household , and the sick in the country round ? Ill would it go , indeed , if when the folk came home from war and the chase of wild beasts , weary or wounded , they found all the womenfolk gone out a-hunting and a-fighting , and none there to dress their wounds or prepare their meat ! Better far might my lord and his followers come and help us with our work , than that we should go to help them ! You are surely bereft of all wit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go to labor in her husband 's workshop , or away into the market-place , or go a-trading to foreign countries , would certainly have answered , ' I ant too busy to speak with such as you ! The bread is in the oven ( already I smell it a-burning ! ) , the winter is coming on and my children lack good woolen hose and my husband needs a warm coat ? I have six vats of ale all a-brewing ? and I have daughters whom I must teach to spin and sew ? and the babies are clinging round my knees ! And you ask me why I do not go abroad to seek for new labors ! Godsooth ! Would you have me to leave my household to starve in summer , and die of cold in winter , and my children to go untrained . While I gad about to seek for other work A man must have his belly full and his back covered before all things in life Who , think you , would spin and bake and brew , and rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed ! When the days are not long enough , and I have to toil far into the night ! I have no time to talk with fools ! ' " And the young maiden at the cottage door , beside her wheel , asked why she was content , and did not seek new fields of labor , would surely have answered : Go away , I have no time to listen to you . Do you not see that I am spinning here , that I too may have a home of my own ? I am weaving the linen garments that shall clothe my household in the long years to come ! I can not marry till the chest upstairs be full . You " a can not hear it , but as I sit here alone , spinning , far off across the hum of my spinning-wheel I hear the voices of my little unborn children calling to me ? ' O mother , mother . hasten on ! ' ? and sometimes , when I seem to be looking out across my wheel into the sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , and the light shines on the faces round it ; and I spin on the faster and the steadier when I think of what shall be ! Do you ask rue why I do not go out and labor in the fields with the lad whom I have chosen ! Is his work then indeed more needed than mine for the raising of that home that shall be ours ? Oh , very hard I will labor , for him and for my children , in the long years to come . But I can not stop to talk to you now . Far off , through the hum of my spinning-wheel , I hear the voices of my children calling to me. and I must hurry on . Do you ask me why I do not seek for labor whose hands are full to bursting ? ' Such would have been our answer in Europe in the ages of the past . if asked the question why we were contented with our field of labor and sought no other . Man had his work ; we had ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders ; and that through the labor of our hands it was sustained and strengthened ? and we were contented .  | " But now , again a change has come . " Something that is entirely new has entered into the field of human labor , and left nothing as it was . In man 's field of toil change has accomplished , and is yet more accomplishing , itself . On lands where once fifty men and youths toiled with their cattle , to-day one steam-plow , guided by but two pair of hands , passes swiftly ; and an automatic reaper in one day reaps and hinds and prepares for the garner the produce of fields it would have taken a hundred strong male arms to harvest in the past . The iron tools and weapons , only one of which it took an ancient father of our race long months of stern exertion to extract from ore and bring to shape and temper , now are poured forth by steamdriven machinery as a mill pond posers forth its water ; and even in war , the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversal of the ancient order has taken place . Time was when the size and strength of the muscles in a man 's legs and arms , and the strength and size of his hones , largely determined his fighting powers , and an Achilles or a Richard Coeur de Lion , armed only with his spear or battle-ax , grade a host fly before him ; today , the puniest manikin behind a modern Maxim gun may hew down in perfect safety a phalanx of heroes whose legs and arms and physical powers a Greek god might have envied , but . who having not the modern machinery of war fall powerless . The day of the primary import to humanity of the strength in man 's extensor and flexor muscles , whether in labors of war or of peace , is gone by forever ; and the day of the all-importance of the strength , culture and activity of man 's brain and nerve has already come . The brain of one consumptive German chemist who in his laboratory accomplishes the compounding of a new explosive , has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of ten thousand soldierly legs and arms ; and the man who invents one new labor-saving mechanical device may , through the cerebration of a few days , have performed the labor it would otherwise have taken hundreds of thousands of his lustily legged and armed fellows to perform . " Year by year , month by month , and almost hour by hour , this change is increasingly shaping itself in the field of the modern man 's labor ; and crude muscular force , whether in man or beast , sinks continually in its value in the field of human toil , while intellectual power , virility and activity , and that culture which leads to the mastery of the inanimate forces of nature , to the invention of machinery and to the delicate manipulative skill required in guiding it , becomes ever of greater and greater importance to the race . Already to-day we tremble on the verge of a discovery which may come to-morrow or the next day , when through the attainment of some simple and cheap method of controlling some widely diffused , everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of the great tidal wave ) there will at once and forever pass away even that comparatively small value which still , in our present stage of material civilization , clings to the expenditure of mere crude , muscular human energy ; and the creature , however muscularly powerful , who can merely pull , push and lift , will have no further value in the field of human labor . " Therefore , even to-day , we find that wherever that condition which we call modern civilization prevails , and in proportion as it tends to prevail ? wherever steam-power , electricity , or the forces of wind or water , are compelled by man 's intellectual activity to act as the motorpowers in the accomplishment of human toil ; wherever the delicate adaptations of scientifically constructed machinery are taking the place of the simple manipulations of the human hand ? that there has arisen , all the world over , a large body of males who find their ancient fields of labor have slipped or are slipping from them , and who discover that the modern world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates of our dockyards , in our streets and in our fields , are to be found everywhere , in proportion as modern civilization is really dominant , men whose bulk and animal strength would have made them as warriors invaluable members of any primitive community , and who would have been  | valuable even in any simpler civilization than our own as machines of toil , but who , owing to lack of intellectual or delicate manual training , have now no form of toil to offer society which it stands really in need of , and who therefore form our Great Male Unemployed , a body which finds the only powers it possesses so little needed by its fellows , that in return for its intensest physical labor life is hardly sustained . The material conditions of life have been rapidly modified , and the man has not been modified with them : machinery has largely filled his place in the old fields of labor , and he has found no new one . " It is from these men , often men who viewed from the broad humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who might in a simpler state of society have been the heroes , leaders and chiefs of their people , that there arises in the modern world the bitter cry of the male unemployed : Give us labor or we die ! ' * " Yet it is only upon one , and a comparatively small , section of the males of the modern civilized world that these changes in the material conditions of life have told in such fashion as to take all useful occupation from them and render them wholly or partly dependent on society . If the modern male 's field of labor has contracted at one end ( the physical ) , at the other ( the intellectual ) it has immeasurably expanded ! If machinery , and the command of inanimate motor-forces , have rendered of comparatively little value the male 's mere muscular energy , the demand upon his intellectual faculties , the call for the expenditure of nervous energy , and the exercise of delicate manipulative skill in the labors of human life , have immeasurably increased . In well-nigh a million new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening up before the feet of the modern man , which his ancestors never dreamed of ; and day by day they yet increase in numbers and importance . The steamship , the hydraulic lift , the patent road-maker , the railway-train , the electric tram - car , the steam-driven mill . the Maxim gun and the torpedo-boat. once made , may perform their labors with the guidance and assistance of comparatively few hands ; but a whole army of men of science , engineers , clerks and highly trained workmen is necessary for their invention , construction and maintenance . In the domains of art , of science , of literature , and above all in the field of politics and government , an almost infinite extension has taken place in the fields of male labor . Where in primitive times woman was often the only builder , and patterns she daubed on her hut walls or traced on her earthen vessels were the only attempts at domestic art ; and where later but an individual here and there was required to design a king 's palace or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintingsto-day , a mighty army of males , a million strong , is employed in producing plastic art alone , both high and low , from the traceries on wall-papers and the ill us ! rationin penny journals , to the production of the pictures and statues which adorn the national collections , and a mighty new field of toil has opened before the anciently hunting and fighting male . Where once one ancient witch-doctress may have been the only creature in a whole land who studied the nature of herbs and earths , or a solitary wizard experimenting on poisons was the only individual in a whole territory interrogating nature ; and where later , a few score of alchemists and astrologers only were engaged in examining the natures of substances or the movements of planets . to-day a hundred thousand men in every civilized community are laboring to unravel the mysteries of nature , and from the practical chemist and physician and anatomist and engineer , to the astronomer and mathematician , scientific men form a mighty and always increasingly important army of male laborers . Where once an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where later a few thousand priests and men of letters wrote and transcribed for the few to read , to-day  | literature gives labor to a multitude of males almost as countless as a swarm of locusts . From the penny-a-liner to the poet and philosopher , the demand for their labor continually increases . Where one town-crier with stout legs and lusty lungs was once all - sufficient to spread the town news . a se ire of men now sit daily , pen in hand , preparing the columns of the morning 's paper , and far into the night a hundred compositors are engaged in a labor which requires a higher culture of brain and finger than most ancient kings and rulers possessed . Even in the labors of war , the most brutal and primitive of the occupations lingering on into civilized life from the savage state . the new demand for intellectual male labor is enormous , and the invention , construction and working of one Krupp gun , though it hardly demands more crude muscular exertion than a savage expends in shaping his boomerang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of wellrewarded male labor . Above all , in the domain of politics and government , where once a king or queen . aided by a handful of councilors. was alone practically concerned in the labors of national guidance or legislation , to day , owing to the rapid means of intercommunication , and the consequent diffusion of political and social information throughout a territory , it has become possible , for the first time , for every adult in a large community to keep himself closely informed on all national affairs , and in every highly civilized state the ordinary male has been almost compelled to take his share , however small , in the duties and labors of legislation and government , and thus has been opened before the mass of males a vast new sphere of labor undreamed of by their ancestors . Thus , in every direction , the change which modern material civilization has wrought . while it has militated against that comparatively small section of males who have nothing to offer society but the expenditure of their untrained muscular energy ( inflicting much and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended the field of male labor as a whole . Never before in the history of the earth has the male field of remunerative toil been so wide , so interesting , so complex , and in its results so all-important to society ; never before has the male sex , taken as a whole , been so fully and strenuously employed . " So much is this the case , that , exactly as in the earlier conditions of society an excessive and almost crushing amount of social labor often devolved upon the female , so under modern civilized conditions among the wealthier and fully civilized classes an unduly excessive share of labor tends to devolve on the male , That almost entirely modern , morbid condition , affecting brain and nervous system , and shortening the lives of hundreds of thousands in modern civilized societies , which is vulgarly known as " overwork " or " nervous breakdown , ? and which is immensely more common among males than females , is but one evidence of the frequently excessive share of mental- labor devolving upon the modern male , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon him a larger or smaller number of entirely parasitic females . Whatever the result of the changes of modern civilization may be with regard to the male , he certainly can not complain that they have as a whole robbed him of his labor , diminished his share in the conduct of life , or reduced him to a condition of morbid inactivity . " In our woman 's field of labor , matters have tended to shape themselves wholly otherwise ! The changes which have taken place during the last centuries , and which we sum up under the compendious term ' modern civilization , ' have tended to rob women , not merely in part but almost wholly , of her ancient domain of productive social labor , and , where there has not been a determined and conscious resistance on her part , have nowhere spontaneously tended to open out to her new and compensatory fields . " It is this fact which constitutes our modern Woman 's Problem . ' ' ' Our spinning-wheels are all broken : in a thousand huge buildings steam-driven looms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of men ) . produce the garments of our race ; and we dare no longer say , proudly , as of old , that we and we alone clothe our peoples .  | " Our hoes and our grindstones passed from us long ago , and the plowman and the miller took our toil ; but we kept fast possession of the kneading-trough and the brewing-vat . To-day , steam often shapes our bread , and the loaves are set down at our very door ( it may be , by a man-driven motor-car ) : and the history of our household drinks we know no longer till we see them set before us at our tables . Day by day machine-prepared and factory-produced viands take a larger and larger place in the dietary of rich and poor alike , till even the workingman 's wife places before her household little that is of her own preparation ; while among the wealthier classes , so far has domestic change gone , that males are not infrequently found laboring in our houses and kitchens , and even standing behind our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food between our feminine lips . The army of rosy milkmaids has passed away forever to give place to the cream - separator and the male- and machinery-manipulated butterpat . In every direction the ancient saw . that it was exclusively the woman 's sphere to prepare the viands of her race , has become , in proportion as civilization has perfected itself , an antiquated lie . " Even the minor domestic operations are tending to pass out of the circle of woman 's domestic labor : in modern cities our carpets are beaten , our windows cleaned , our door-steps polished , by machinery or extra-domestic and often male labor . And the change has gone much further than to the mere taking from us of the preparation of the materials from which the clothing of the race is formed . Already the domestic sewing-machine . which has supplanted almost entirely the ancient needle , begins to become antiquated and a thousand machines driven in factories by central engines are already supplying not merely the husband and son , but the woman herself , with almost every article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy classes , Worth with his hundred fellow male-milliners and dressmakers is helping finally to explode the ancient myth , that it is woman 's exclusive sphere as a part of her domestic toil to shape the garments of her race . " Year by year , day by day . there is a silently working but determined tendency for the sphere of woman 's domestic labors to contract itself : and this contraction is marked exactly in proportion as that condition which we term modern civilization is advanced . It manifests itself more in England and America than in Italy and Spain , more in great cities than in country places . more among the wealthier classes than the poorer . and is an unfailing indication of advancing modern civilization . ' But it is not only , nor even mainly , in the sphere of woman 's material domestic labors that change has touched her and shrunk her ancient field of labor . " Time was , when the woman kept her  | children about her knees till adult years were reached . Hers was the training and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lay on her breast . till her daughters left her for marriage and her sons took share in man 's labor , they were continually under the mother 's influence . To-day , so complex have become even the technical and simpler branches of education , so mighty and inexorable are the demands which modern civilization makes for specialized instruction and training , for all individuals who are to survive and retain their usefulness under modern conditions , that from the earliest years of its life the child is of necessity largely removed frcul the hands of the mother , and placed in those of the specialized instructor . Among the wealthier classes , scarcely is the infant born when it passes into the hands of the trained nurse , and from hers on into the hands of the qualified teacher ; till at nine or ten the son , in certain countries , often leaves his home forever for the public school . to pass on to the college and university ; while the daughter , in the hands of trained instructors and dependents , owes in the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternal toil . While even among our poorer classes , the infant-school , the board-school , and later on the necessity for manual training , take the son and often the daughter as completely , and always increasingly as civiliration advances , from the maternal control . So marked has this change in woman 's ancient field of labor become , that a woman of almost any class may have borne many children and yet at middle age be found sitting alone in an empty house , all her offspring gone from her to receive training and instruction at the hands of others . The ancient statement that the training and education of her offspring is exclusively the duty of the mother , however true it may have been with regard to a remote past . has already of necessity become an absolute misstatement ; and the woman who should at the present day insist on entirely educating her own offspring would , in nine cases out of ten . inflict an irreparable injury on them , because she is incompetent . " But , if possible , yet more deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient field of labor in another direction ? in that very portion of the field of human labor which is peculiarly and organically ours , and which can never be wholly taken from us . Here t re shrinkage has been larger than in any other direction , and touches us as women more vitally . Time was , and still among almost all primitive and savage folk , when the first and all-important duty of the female to her society was to bear , to bear much , and to bear unceasingly ! On her adequate and persistent performance of this passive form of labor , and on her successful feeding of her young from her own breast , depended , not merely the welfare , but often the very existene , of her tribe or nation . Where , as is the case among almost all barbarous peoples , the rate of infant mortality is high : where the unceasing casualties resulting from war , the chase , and acts of personal violence tend continually to reduce the number of adult males : where , surgical knowledge being still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above all , recurrent pestilence and famine , unfailing if of irregular recurrence , decimated the people , it has been all-important that woman should employ her creative power to its very uttermost limits if the race were not at once to dwindle and die out . ' May thy wife 's womb never cease from bearing , is still to-day the highest expression of good will on the part of a native African chief to his departing guest . For , not only does the prolific woman in the primitive state contribute to the wealth and strength of her nation as a whole , but to that of her own male companion and of her family . Where the social conditions of life are so simple that , in addition to bearing and suckling the child , it is reared and nourished through childhood almost entirely through the labor and care of the mother , requiring no expenditure of tribal or family wealth on its training or education , its value as an adult enormously outweighs both to the state and the male the trouble and expense of rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become warriors or laborers is by so much the richer and the more powerful than he who has but one , while the state whose women are prolific stands so insured against destruction . Incessant and  | persistent child-bearing is thus truly the highest duty and the most socially esteemed occupation of the primitive woman , equaling fully in social importance the labor of the man as hunter and warrior . " Even under those conditions of civilization which have existed in the centuries which divide primitive savagery from high civilization , the demand for continuous child-bearing on the part of woman as her highest social duty has generally been hardly less imperious . Throughout the Middle Ages of Europe , and down almost to our own day , the rate of infant mortality was almost as large as in a savage state ; medical ignorance destroyed innumerable lives ; antiseptic surgery being unknown , serious wounds were almost always fatal ; in the low state of sanitary science , plagues , such as those which in the reign of Justinian swept across the civilized world from India to northern Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1349 , which in England alone swept away more than half the population of the island , were but extreme forms of the destruction of population continually going on as the result of zvmotic disease ; while wars were not merely far more common but , owing to the famines which almost invariably followed them , were far more destructive to human life than in our own days , and deaths by violence , whether at the hands of the state or as the result of personal enmity , were of daily occurrence in all lands . Under these conditions abstinence on the part of woman from incessant child-bearing might have led to almost the same serious diminution or even extinction of her people as in the savage state ; while the very existence of her civilization depended on the production of an immense number of individuals as beasts of burden , without the expenditure of whose crude muscular force in physical labor of agriculture and manufacture those intermediate civilizations would , in the absence of machinery , have been impossible . Twenty men had to be born , fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude brute labor which is performed to-day by one small , well-adjusted steam-crane ; and the demand for large masses of human creatures as mere reservoirs of motor-force for accomplishing the simplest processes was imperative . So strong indeed was the consciousness of the importance to society of continuous childbearing on the part of woman , that as late as the middle of the sixteenth century ' Martin Luther wrote . If a woman becomes weary or at last dead from hearing , that matters not : let her only die from bearing , she is there t o do it ' ; and he doubtless gave expression to the profound conviction of the bulk of his contemporaries , both male and female . " To-day , this condition has almost completely reversed itself . The advance of science and the amelioration of the physical conditions of life tend rapidly toward a diminution of hum to mortality . The infant death-rate among the upper classes in modern civilizations has fallen by more than one-half ; while among poorer classes it is already . though slowly , falling ; the increased knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized peoples the depopulation by plagues a thing of the past , and the discoveries of the next twenty years will probably do away forever with the danger to man of zymotic disease . Famines of the old desolating type have became an impossibility where rapid means of transportation convey the superfluity of one land to supply the lack of another ; and war and deeds of violence . though still lingering among us , have already become episodal in the lives of nations as of individuals ; while the vast advances in antiseptic surgery have caused even the effects of wounds and dismemberments to become only very partially fatal to human life . All these changes have tended to diminish human mortality and protract human life ; and they have to-day already made it possible for a race not only to maintain its numbers , but even to increase them , with a comparatively small expenditure of woman 's vitality in the passive labor of child-bearing . " But yet more seriously has the demand for woman 's labor as child-bearer been diminished by change in another direction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untrained muscular human labor , diminishes also the social demand upon woman as the producer  | in large masses of such laborers . Already throughout the modern civilized world , we have reached a point at which the social demand is not merely for human creatures in the bulk for use as beasts of burden , but rather , and only . for such human creatures as shall be so trained and cultured as to be fitted for the performance of the complex duties of modern life . Not now merely for many men , but rather for few , and those few well born and well instructed , is the modern demand . And the woman who to-day merely produces twelve children and suckles them , and then turns them loose on her society and family , is regarded . and rightly so , as the curse and down - draft , and not the productive laborer of her community . Indeed , so difficult and expensive has become in the modern world the rearing and training of even one individual , in a manner suited to tit it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to the family as well as to the state , unlimited fecundity on the part of the female has already in most cases become an irremediable evil : whether it be in the case of the artisan , who at the cost of immense self-sacrifice must support and train his children till their twelfth or fourteenth year , if they are ever to become even skilled manual laborers , and who if his family Le large often sinks beneath the burden , allowing his offspring , untaught and untrained , to become waste-products of human life ; or that of the professional man , who by his mental toil is compelled to support and educate at immense expense his sons till they are twenty or older , and to sustain his daughters often throughout their lives , should they not marry , and to whom it large family proves often no less disastrous : while the state whose women produce recklessly large masses of individuals in excess of those for whom they call provide training , is a state , in so far , tending toward deterioration . The commandment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shalt bear , ' but rather Thou shalt not bear in excess of thy power-to rear and train satisfactorily ' ; and the woman who should to-day appear at the door of a workhouse or the tribunal of the poor-law guardians followed by her twelve infants , demanding honorable sustenance for them and herself in return for the labor she had undergone in producing them , would meet with but short shrift . While the modern ratan who on his wedding-day should be greeted with the ancient good wish that he might become the father of tell sons and ten daughters , would regard it as a malediction rather than a blessing . It is certain that the time is now rapidly approaching , when child-bearing will be regarded rather as a luxury , permissible only to those who have shown their power rightly to train and provide for their offspring , than as a labor . in itself , and , under whatever conditions performed , beneficial to society. * " Further , owing ' partly to the diminished demand for child-bearing , rising from the extreme difficulty and expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social causes , millions of women in our modern societies are so placed as to be absolutely compelled to go through life not merely childless , but without sex-relationship in any form whatever ; while another mighty army of women is reduced by the dislocations of our civilization to accepting sexual relationships which negate child-bearing , and  | whose only product is physical and moral disease . " Thus it has come to pass that vast numbers of us are , by modern social conditions , prohibited from child-bearing at all , and that even those among us who are child-bearers are required . in proportion as the class or race to which we belong stands high in the scale of civilization , to produce a smaller and ever smaller number of offspring ; so that even for these of us child-bearing and suckling , instead of filling the entire circle of female life from youth to age , becomes an episodal occupation , profitably employing only three or four out of the threescore and ten years which are allotted to human life . In such societies the statement ( so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even largely true with regard to those in the intermediate stages of civilization ) that the main and continuous occupation of the woman from puberty to age is the bearing and suckling of children , and that this occupation must fully satisfy all her needs for social labor and activity , becomes ? an antiquated and unmitigated LIE . " Not only are millions of our women precluded from ever bearing a child , but for those of us who do bear the demand is ever increasingly in civilized societies coupled with the condition that if we would act socially we must restrict our powers. * " Looking round then with the uttermost impartiality we can command , on the entire field of woman 's ancient and traditional labors , we find that fully three-fourths of it have shrunk away forever , and that the remaining fourth still tends to shrink ! ' It is this great fact , so often and so completely overlooked , which lies as the propelling force behind that vast and restless ' Woman 's movement ' which marks our day . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is more often the case . vaguely and painfully felt , which awakes in the hearts of the ablest modern European women their passionate , and at times it would seem almost coherent , cry for new forms of labor and new fields for the exercise of their power . " Thrown into strict logical form , our demand is this : We do not ask that the wheels of time should reverse themselves , or the stream of life flow backward . We do not ask that our ancient spinning-wheels be again resuscitated and placed in our hands ; we do not demand that our old grindstones and hoes be returned to us , nor that man should again betake himself to his ancient province of war and the chase , leaving to us all domestic and civil labor ; nor do we even ask that society shall again so reconstruct itself , that every woman may be again a child-bearer ( desirable as it might be , and deep as lies the hunger for motherhood in every virile woman 's heart ) ; still less do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning thereby social approbation ; neither do sve demand that the children whom we bear shall again be put exclusively into our hands to train . This we know can not be . The past material conditions of life have gone forever ; no will of man can recall them . But this is our demand : We demand , that , in that strange new world that is arising alike upon the man and the woman , where nothing is as it was , and all things are assuming new shapes and relations ? we demand that in this new world we also shall have our share of honored and socially useful human toil , our full half of the labor of the children of woman . We demand nothing more than this , and we will take nothing less . This is our ' WOMAN 'S RIGHT '
