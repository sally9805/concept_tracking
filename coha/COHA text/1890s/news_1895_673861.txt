Goff. of the United States Circuit Court , had issued another injunction against the State authorities , on the grounds that the Registration Act of 1882 was unconstitutional ; that there was sufficient fraud at the polls in the election last Fall to vitiate the calling of the Constitutional Convention ; that there was then a conspiracy between Tillman , Evans , and others , to commit frauds ; that the agreement between Tillman , Evans , Barnwell , Hemphill , and others was a conspiracy to defraud the negro of his right of suffrage ; that Evans , as Governor , had sought to carry out these conspiracies by removing notaries for taking affidavits from negroes ; that the illegal acts of the Supervisors of Registration were part of the same conspiracy , &c.; The important portion of the order reads as follows : " It Is ordered that the defendants ; John Gary Evans , Governor of the State of South Carolina , and P. Butler McCoy , a Commissioner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the laws of the said State with the duty of holding or managing elections for delegates to a convention to be held on the second Tuesday in the month of September , 1895 , for the purpose of revising , amending , or changing the Constitution of that State , be , and they are hereby enjoined and restrained from any and all action looking to the holding of such election or elections until the further order of this court . " It is further ordered that said defendants do show cause why they , and each of them , should not be perpetually enjoined from ordering , holding , or procuring to be held in the said State , any election or elections for delegates to a convention for the purpose of revising or changing the Constitution of said State of South Carolina .

He made this statement to-day : " I have not been served with any order or any other paper from Judge Goff , but from the published accounts it seems that I have been enjoined as Governor of the State of South Carolina , and Mr. McCoy , as a Commissioner of Elections of the State of South Carolina , and not as individuals . The State of South Carolina is still sovereign and independent , and it is my duty , under the constitution of the State , to execute the laws of the State . I shall continue to do this without fear of presumptive interference of a United States Circuit Judge . I shall treat the proceeding with the contempt it deserves . " We will , of course , act at the proper time , in accordance with the respect due to the Constitution of the United States , and at the same time all arrangements necessary for the carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitutional Convention will be made , and all duties required of me by the Constitution and by the statute laws of the State of South Carolina will be faithfully performed . If I am in contempt of Judge Goff he must make the most of it . "
