txt The long-expected , catastrophe at Dawson has occurred , and three-fourths of the town lies in ashes , while hundreds of miners and shop keepers , gamblers and saloon men , are living in tents , sleeping on the snow in blankets , or moving up the creeks into the settlements at the mines Stark Homes , son of Mayor T. J. Humes of this city , brings a direct and circumstantial story of the loss . He arrived at Victoria this morning , and wires details of the story here . According to Humes , a veritable panic reigned in Dawson the day after the fire , because hundreds of tons of provisions were burned up . and it will be at least five weeks before any considerable amount can be obtained from the outside . An area of ground three-quarters of a mile long and four blocks in width was eaten over by the flames , leaving absolutely nothing but ashes . One hundred and eleven buildings were destroyed . The Fire Department , so-called , was practically unable to cope with the conflagration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of all facilities for handling the apparatus , and of an insufficient water supply , made the efforts of the force of fire fighters almost ridiculous . The heaviest . o.sers by the fire are &; of Victoria and Vancouver , who had an immense stock of iron and tinware and miner s ' supplies , taken in at heavy expense , and the Bank of British North America , whose rather flimsy vault did not withstand the heat , the papers in it being destroyed . The bank also lost a large amount of gold dust . A rough estimate places the loss to gold and paper money alone at ** Dawson 's curse , its low women , caused the conflagration . This is the fourth fire that has resulted from a drunken debauch , in which the demi-monde of the place have figured . Twice before drunken women quarreling overturned lamps , and started fires that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars . This fire had its beginning In the same way , an apartment over a saloon being the scene of the first blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 21 , according to Humes . A saloon adjoining Mc-Donald 's Theatre , on the water front , was first consumed , and then the flames spread rapidly to the main buildings , and thence across Second Street into the very heart of the business section . Humes describes the incidents of the fire as some serious , others tr , igic , and some bordering on the grotesque . The small shopkeepers and restaurants were the greatest sufferers . Some thought only of their stock of provisions . Others saved their hidden buckskin sacks of gold dust at the peril of their lives . As the flames ate their way up Second Street , the women of the disorderly houses fled before them , carrying their treasures . Many were scantily clad , and suffered much from the biting gale that blew from the river 's edge . DAwn found the conflagration unimpeded in Its career of destruction , despite the fact that dozens of hou : ! es were blown up by giant powder . Martial law was declared by the mounted police , and the men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of the ruins claimed that there was treasure beneath the ashes . Thieves were plentiful , and an improvised dungeon was reported full of accused persons when Humes and his companion left on their outward trip . flumes says : " The fire is the worst that Dawson ever saw , but , notwithstanding that fact , there will be no material interruption in the work at the mines , for most of the mine owners had plenty of provisions stored in their cabins . The gambling houses , saloons , hotels , and restaurants are the greatest losers . There are some people at Dawson who will regret the fire because it , has put a total stop to all forms of vice . Saloons that saved some of their goods were doing a great business , and the price of all drinks was doubled and sometimes trebled . " In estimating the loss at $4,000,000 it must be remembered that an exaggerated value was doubtless placed on the property destroyed in many instances . For examnle , stores that would cost but a thousand dollars to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high price of labor and material . The destruction of great quantities of provisions Is the main incident of the fire . Fortunately a fairly early . Spring is promised . and barges and steamers laden with goods can be sent from the lakes above Skaguay . The merchants of that place were preparing to send rafts laden with supplies down the river as fast as the Ice gave way . "
