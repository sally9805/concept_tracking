txt Ex-Alderman William Doyle of Newburg , whom Gov . Hill has made Assistant Secretary to the Forest Commission , has long been a hanger-on at the sessions of the Legislature . Once , through the good offices of Judge George Green of New-York and Jersey Bridge fame , Doyle 's name appeared on the list of newspaper reporters as the representative of the Newburg Register . This bogus indorsement gave him " the privileges of the floor " of both houses , and he made the most of them . Doyle has been known as a member of the gang of would-be lobbyists , men who are always trying to " catch on " to some bill which is to be forced through by questionable means . He has been a pliant tool of the Governor , and last Winter he exeouted any number of little commissions for David . He was here throughout the session , although his name was not on the pay rolls . He belongs to the class of legislative parasites that ought to be kicked out of the Capitol and kept out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the laws . His appointment by Hill furnishes fresh evidence that the Governor does not care a picayune whether the men on whom he bestows places are worthy of public confidence or not If they are able to serve Hill , that is all that he requires . Only a few more changes need be made to bring the Forest Commission and its attaches up to the Hill machine standard . And what a standard it is for the people to contemplate ! The names of the foresters appointed at yesterday 's meeting of the Forest Commission , and which Secretary McCreedy did not have time to pronounce , are Edward H. Buell of East Constable . Franklin County , and Fred BillIngham of Clinton , Oneida County . It is unnecessary to say that both are warm supporters of Gov . HilL
