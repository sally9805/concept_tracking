txt The address delivered at the University of Michigan yesterday by Prof. NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER of Columbia was such a message as it is well for the great university of the East to send to the strong university in the heart of the continent . Its subject was " The Education of Public Opinion , " with especial reference to politics . It put before the audience two questions that reveal the spirit of the speaker and of the address ; " Are you politically alert ? Are you politically honest ? " No one has a clearer right to ask these questions , no one could answer them with a clearer conscience , than Prof. BUTLER . The general subject of the address was the relation of the educated man to party organization . Prof. BUTLER believes in the absolute necessity of such organization and in the possibility of so conducting it as to secure the fair and beneficial operation of public opinion . He recognizes the abuses to which it is exposed and has no confidence that these can be wholly avoided , but he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainable . He holds it to be the duty of each citizen to attach himself to the party that he finds the better for as long a time as It continues on the whole to be the better , and to use his energies and influence to promote its efficiency and preserve its character . He regards the course of those who hold aloof from the constructive work of a party , who are unwilling to give it the degree of loyalty that is required to entitle them to a share in its management , as ill-advised and wasteful of the force that each citizen can exert for good in the affairs of the community . He recognizes equally the right and duty of every member of a party to quit it and oppose it when its course has become in his opinion unfitted to advance the ends for which he joined it . But he lays great stress on the need of careful judgment in this respect and on the imperative need of cool , broad , and intelligent consideration of the relative good and evil involved in such action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question , not only of the badness of the party one quits , but of the alternative that is open after quitting . This , it will be seen , brings the whole matter to the tribunal of individual conscience , only Prof. BUTLER insists that the tribunal shall take into consideration all the facts , and especially that the need and duty of action of some sort shall not be ignored . He has no respect and little patience for the man who tries to avoid responsibility for political evils by doing nothing . Knowing that the evil-minded will act with all their might and with no more scruple than they are compelled to observe , he holds that it is as vicious as it is cowardly and selfish to withdraw and leave them a free field . There is no quarreling with this theory . Nor can it be dismissed as too vague for practical application . Each man must decide for himself how far he can go with a party . To the great body of men the question will not give much trouble ; they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as it cares to lead , generally without trying to take any active share in its management . Of the others , some will try conscientiously to shape the course of their party and will leave it only when they despair of satisfying their conscience . But there will always be those who find it to be their duty to vote at each election for those candidates on one or another ticket whose election seems to them best for the community , but do not find it their duty to seek any share in the control of the course of any party because the conditions now imposed by party usages are such that they can not honestly conform to them . Until these usages are changed we do not see that these citizens can fairly he condemned . But the question of political action is always a complex and changing one . Prof. BUTLER treats it with candor , sound judgment . and marked ability . We trust that his excellent address will be given to the public in a form that will secure for it the widest circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
