txt The result of the contest for reform in the Municipal Government will depend largely upon the extent to which the legal voters of the city are registered on Friday and Saturday next . The registration of the first two days indicates that if the proportion is carried out the number of names upon the lists will fall 40,000 below that of two years ago , though the number of legal voters has considerably increased . This deficiency would be caused by the indifference or negligence of men who would not be likely in any case to vote the Tammany ticket , for Tammany is wont to strain every nerve to secure the registration of its voters . The issues involved in this election come more closely home to the people of this city and more nearly affect their everyday lives and their business and social interests than those in which questions of party policy are to be settled , and there is quite as much reason why they should take the slight trouble required for registering and voting . A full registration and a full vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indifferent to the conflicts of local factions , would be certain to give the anti-Tammany force a large predominance over the organization which has mismanaged the affairs of the city . There should be no chance left for the failure of the reform movement through apathy on the part of those who favor honest government for the city . The numerous changes that have been made in the election districts of the city , and the still more numerous changes in the location of polling places , made necessary by the requirements of the new law , may be a little troublesome , but the districts are generally small , and the places of registration can be easily found by inquiry . Any one wishing to save himself this small trouble has only to address a postal card to the People 's Municipal League , at 1,144 Broadway , stating his residence , and he will be at once informed of the location of his place of registration and voting . Those who take an interest in this contest may serve the cause of reform by inducing their apathetio friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose . Nobody should be deceived by the apparent quiet of the Tammany canvass thus far . There is a purpose in it . It has been noted that the increase of registration in Tammany districts is not so great as in antiTammany districts , but Tammany will not neglect to have its voters registered on the last two days . It may have sought to lull its opponents into a sense of security , and to encourage the disinclination to register of those who are lacking in zeal with the idea that it is not necessary . It is greatly to its interest to avoid arousing its opponents from any feeling of confidence or indifference by a show of activity on its own part until the registration books have been closed . But it will probably be found that Tammany itself will use every effort on the last days for registration to get its own voters upon the lists , and when no more names can be added it will begin to " whoop up " its campaign . It will be too late then for those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to vote against its ticket . Its apparent quiet demeanor will be thrown off after next Saturday ; its voters will have been fully registered , and it will make every effort to arouse them to I enthusiasm and bring them to the polls in full force . Anti-Tammany voters should be on the alert and allow no advantage to the wily leaders and tireless workers of the Wigwain . They should be prepared to exert their full power at the polls on the 4th of November , and in order to do so they must have their names upon the registry lists . Every man who desires to see the admirable ticket of the people elected , who desires to see an able , public-spirited , and honest Mayor chosen in place of the subservient tool of Tammany , should not only have his own name registered , but see that that of every voter with whom he has any influence is placed upon the list . If that is done , and if the votes of all those who would be gratified at the overthrow of Tammany are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , there can be no doubt of the result , and that result will redound to the credit and the advantage of New-York as the result of no municipal election-has done before in many years .
