txt In the controversy which has arisen between Mrs. Virginia . M. Hallett and her janitor , of course public sympathy will be entirely with Mrs. Hallett and against the janitor . This unanimity of sentiment will be due neither to the fact that the contest is one between a man and a. woman , nor to the more or less inconsequential circumstance that in this particular case the man is attempting to enforce a wrong principle and the woman a right one , but merely because the janitor is a janitor , and therefore a natural enemy of the whole human species . It has long been certain that some day there would appear a. person courageous enough to face one of these monsters as he emerged growling from his basement , and , by denying his too long asserted and too long recognized ordination as the ruler of our destinies , at last bring the question to a test . Mrs. Hallett , like the rest of us , has probably endured theft and impertinence uncomplainingly , but when the tyrannical ruler of her abode undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter his domain , the end of patience came , the standard of revolt was raised , and now war has begun . One shudders to learn that Mrs. Hallett told her janitor , " I shall , " when he had said , " You shall not , " but reassured by the information . that this dauntless woman still liN es , the shudder transforms itself into a. thrill of atmiration . Now that the first fateful step has been taken , perhaps some man , following in the footsteps of so illustrious a Predecessor , may rise to the giddy heights of heroism , and test , by physical means or an appeal to law , the question whether a tenant who has lost his latchkey has a right or not to expect the janitor to rise from his subterranean den and open the door . That point gained , the rest would be easy , and the now unendurable insolence of these underlings might finally be abated . One does not need to be deeply versed in the nature or possibilities of hypnotism to be sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Prof. W. X. Sudduth was a practically accurate summing up of the whole matter , especially well worth reading by those who fear the most dangerous consequences from the exercise of what is , after all , a power with narrow limitations . A veil of wholly needless mystery has been thrown around the phenomena of hypnosis in its various forms by the charlatans and knaves who have exploited it for years . Many people have somehow or other leaped to the conclusion that a man who can induce that peculiar state of mind possesses a boundless influence over his willing or unwilling subjects , and can , if he chooses , exercise that Influence in infinitely harmful ways by " suggesting " the perpetration of crimes for which the unconscious instrument is irresponsible , and which can with the utmost difficulty , if ever , be fastened upon him who prompts and profits by them . Real scientists have always doubted , and now utterly deny , these claims , and Prof. Sudduth does well to emphasize the denial . Any man who says he killed or robbed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court recognizes the excuse as valid , it will be merely a proof of egregious ignorance and superstition on the part of Judge and jurors . Campos has won another decisive victory over Maceo . The details thereof are deeply impressive . A body of 850 royal troops fought for eight hours with 3,500 rebels . The combat was desperate . as is shown by the fact that , adding the fatalities on both ' sides , they foot up forty-eight . This is at the rate of six per hour . To be exact , during each sixty minutes that the carnage lasted , one Spanlard and a half was killed and four and a half Cubans . These are the official figures , and one who reads them can not help wondering just how deep a crimson the Caribbean Sea has been stained by the torrents of blood that must have flowed into it on San Indio 's fatal day . And only forty-eight hours before a regiment of sturdy conscripts had captured from a rebel General named Zayas two tents and a good stem-winding silver watch ! Evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . An English sporting paper has Invented a charming addition for an extremely ancient yarn . A lawyer , it says , who was fishing last Spring in an indefinite region called " up North , " dropped his gold watch from the boat in which he was sitting . A few days ago he visited the same place , and inside the first fish he caught was the watch . That , of course , is all right . Watches and rings always come back in just that way , and people have long ago ceased to be surprised or even interested when they come across accounts of such commonplace happenings . This particular watch , however , wag still going when recovered , and , more than that , had not lost or gained a second in the months that had elapsed since the fish swallowed it . Here was a novel circumstance that evidently needed an explanation , but the English paper , or perhaps it was the lawyer , easily solved the little mystery . The watch was of the modern kind , for which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish 's internal machinery that every time the creature moved his jaw the protruding wheel was turned part way around . In this way the watch was regularly wound , day after day . The fish had to eat ; therefore , he had to wind his watch , and therefore the ancient yarn has received a new lease of life .
