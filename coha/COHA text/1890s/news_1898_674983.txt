txt Col. Theodore Roosevelt , at the close of the second day of his campaign tour , reached this city this evening , having made many speeches on the way , and addressed a large ' meeting to-night Under the auspices of the St. Lawrence County Republican Committee . Hundreds of persons could not get into the hall to hear Col. Roosevelt and the other orators , and had to be content with catching a glimpse of them . The hall held about 2,000 . It was prettily decorated with bunting , and a band played . The meeting wag called to order by William H. Daniels , Chairman of the County Committee . When COI . Roosevelt was introduced the applause was deafening , and lasted some minutes . After thanking his auditors for their attendance , and touching upon the various themes that he had used at the stopping places during the day , he suddenly took up the excise question and said : " One of the issues this Fall is the excise question . Our opponents announce that they intend to repeal the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a State of seven or eight millions of people , with widely diverse interests and prejudices , to get an excise law that will be satisfactory everywhere . There are two or three principles which I should like to see embodied in the excise legislation ( that as yet are not ) , but , as Abraham Lincoln said , ' When we can not get the best , we must get the best possible , ' and our duty is to take the best excise law which there is any chance of getting . What we have to look at in the present campaign is whether the present excise law is or is not better than the one it superseded , the one which the Democrats threaten to put upon the statute books in its place . This is the plain and simple issue . OLD AND NEW LAWS CONTRASTED . " It is all very well for our opponents to denounce the present law , but what they propose to put in its place is so bad as to be preposterous . On the whole , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on the statute books . The old Democratic law which it superseded represented not much more than legalized blackmailing , It encouraged drunkenness , it promoted corruption among police and excise officials , saloon keepers , and political leaders alike , and it brought no adequate revenue to the State or the counties . " The present law has done completely away with corruption by Excise Boards and has minimized the corruption of the police . It has reduced drunkenness and it has given us an enormous revenue from the very traffic which can best afford to pay that revenue . Nearly thirteen millions of dollars are yearly turned into the State and County Treasuries by the present law . Between four and five millions of dollars go to the State , the remainder to the counties . - " Now , it the Demec.rats keep their prom- ise , they Will , if th'ey elect their Governor ' and the Legislature , repeal this law and at one stroke take away some $5,000,000 from the revenues of the State , and about as many more from the revenues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Treasury , I am told , over $9,000,000 more than the old law did . In other words , they will make k necessary for the State , if it is to continue its present expenditure , to increase the tax rate by from a quarter to a half . Moreover , they will make it necessary for the counties to raise just about as much more in addition , TAXATION THE ALTERNATIVE . I " How are they going to do this ? What I are they going to tax ? They have got to get money somehow . They will have to make the farmer , the business man , the mechanic , the workingman , pay , somehow , . the nine or ten millions from which they relieve the liquor traffic , and at the same time , by reverting to the old system of corruption and of multitudinous licenses , they will work damage to all men in the business . During the last few years the State has assumed the care of the indigent insane , who were formerly cared for by the counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; quarter , these indigent insane would have to be given back to the counties to care for if our opponents are able to do as they say they will do in the excise matter . This would mean that the burd  --  n of taxation imposed upon the counties would he literally intolerable . " It is easy enough to denounce any law , but when our opponents denounce the present excise law , I ask you to carefully consider what they propose to put in its place and to realize the harm they would do to decent government and the intolerable additions to our burdens of taxation which would follow if they actually succeed in doing what they threaten to do . " Gen. Stewart L. Woodford was generously received by the audience , and spoke at some length upon National issues in the present election . He asked for support for President by this State this Fall . Lieut . Gov . Woodruff devoted his speech to taxation . Mason Mitchell , the actor-Rough Rider , and John Proctor Clarke were other I speakers at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reception in the city , both When the party arrived and later , was a most pleasant one . There were fireworks , bands of music , and illuminations . The party leaves at 8 o'clock in the morning for the return trip .
