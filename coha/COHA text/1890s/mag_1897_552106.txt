JOHN LANGDON . By Charles 1 ? . Corning . HE Langdon family had long T been prominent in the administration of affairs in the old town of Portsmouth , New Hampshire , and its members had often been called to various offices of honor and responsi6 i6 bility . In examining the records of the town during the *8th century and the early years of the *9th , scarcely a year can be found when some one of this distinguished name was not selected to assist in the management JOHN LANGDON . From a painting by Colonel John Trumbull , 1794. // of local and sometimes of Provincial affairs . Such training was destined to promote the family into the front rank of public servants , and thoroughly to equip its male members for the momentous epoch of revolution . The most distinguished descendant to bear the name was John Langdon , who was born at the old homestead on the outskirts of Portsmouth , in December , 1739 . His boyhood was unmarked by prophecy or wonders . He did what other boys did , trudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was one of the characters of his day , recited his lessons , and left no gleaming legend for scholarship . Langdon was not a genius and his sound sense always kept him safely within bounds . The counting room of Daniel Rindge , a prominent merchant of Portsmouth , put the finishing touches to the young man 's education , and at the end of his apprenticeship he had made up his mind to reap the rewards incident to the life of the sailor . This was natural , for in those days the allurements of India and Europe were strong and tempting . Langdon was soon afloat , and he seems to have followed his sea-faring life up to the time when the stout yeomen of New Hampshire remonstrated with and finally defied Governor John Wentworth and his subservient Council . Probably Langdon had long foreseen the coming of the storm ; but whether he had or not , he quit the sea and again became a resident of his native town . Such men as he were wanted by the public , and soon after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotic and resolute a man . He made no excuses and shirked no responsibility ; he knew that the day for temporizing had gone and that the time for action had come . He bravely burned his bridges behind him and calmly watched the ruins float from his sight . His was the typical patriotism that men loved to see . Langdon 's first appearance as a legislator was , I think , when he was sworn in as a member of the Provincial House of Representatives , at Portsmouth , in May , 1775 . He took to his new duties with a prescience decidedly remarkable . The message of Governor Wentworth counseled moderation and forbearance ; but the House was in no mood for such advice-so Langdon was one of the committee to wait on that official for the purpose of asking for an adjournment of the assembly to a time more conducive to calm discussion . The Governor finally assented , and adjourned the House for a month . The differences between the colonists and England were daily growing wider , but the men of Portsmouth and vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the midnight exploit of the year before , when Langdon and John Sullivan led an angry crowd and captured Fort William and Mary , was still rankling in Wentworth 's breast , when another excurENTRANCE TO THE LANGDON MANSION . // sion of the same men resulted in completely dismantling the fortification at Jerry 's Point . The temper of the populace was high , and while no violence was offered the Governor , for he was a native of Portsmouth and personally popular , public impetuosity could not always be made to keep quiet , as the chief magistrate soon found out . One day it was reported that a well-known and wellhated loyalist was at the Wentworth mansion , and in an hour a crowd gathered and , wheeling a cannon before the hospitable portals , loudly clamored for the surrender of Fenton . One course alone was left , and that was prompt acquiescence ; Colonel Fenton gave himself up to the excited patriots , who sent him to Exeter with a strong guard . Under circumstances so perilous the Governor again adjourned the recalcitrant House until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last royal Governor had fled to the protection of H. M. Frigate Scarborough . The people at last were kings , responsible only to themselves . They were not carried away by wild and impracticable theories , nor were they swayed by intemperate appeals to deeds of violence . The transition caused no disruption in affairs ; all went on in conformity to the sternest maxims of law and order . Liberty-loving men like Langdon , Weare , Thornton and Sullivan comprehended to the utmost what it all meant , and the people trusted and followed them . In the same year that the last royal House sat in Portsmouth , a convention of delegates assembled at Exeter , not as a rival but rather as an advisory body sent directly from the people . The Exeter Congress took hold of matters in a very determined way , raising troops , furnishing supplies , establishing post offices , appointing a committee of safety , and devising ways and means for the public support . It was by this Congress that Langdon and Sullivan were chosen as delegates to represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May . Their powers were undefined and elastic , and it was provided that each of them in the absence of the other should have full and ample powers to consent and agree to all measures which said THE LANGDON MANSION , PORT5MOUTH N H // Congress should deem necessary to obtain redress of American grievances . The sum of two hundred and fifty pounds lawful money was raised to defray the expenses of this mission . The delegates made their way slowly to Philadelphia ,  --  the journey at that time consumed from ten days to two weeks of toilsome traveling ,  - -  and attended the sittings of the first Continental Congress . In this Congress were Washington , Henry , Lee , Sam Adams , Rutledge , Chase , and others of eminence . A jo.int letter dated May 22 , 1775 , and addressed to the New Hampshire Committee of Safety throws light on the important subject of Indian invasion by way of Canada . The letter states that the evidence laid before Congress proved that the English were persuading the Indians to take up arms against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point and the erection of a new fort at the lowest part of Lake George ; and in these views the writers hoped that New Hampshire would promptly acquiesce . " We earnestly entreat you for the Honor of the Province , if such a requisition is made to give every possible assistance to preserve our people from the invasions of a barbarous &amp; Savage Enemy . We are sorry , Gentlemen , that Honor will not permit us to give you the least information respecting our proceedings ; we can only say that all the Colonies are firmly united &amp; are preparing for the worst . " P. 5 . We earnestly entreat you to prevent our General Court from making an application to great Britian for Redress of Grievances , as that would Draw the Resentment of all America upon our Province , it being agreed that no one shall make terms without the advise &amp; consent of the whole . " Jno Sullivan " John Langdon . " Late in June Sullivan took his departure from Philadelphia and set out for New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that his place was in the field . Langdon writes to Thornton , July 3 , 1775 , giving the latest intelligence , and ending by pouring out the innermost feelings of his heart , an outburst of nature very rare in a man so calm and conservative . " The low mean revenge and wanton cruelty of the Ministerial sons of tyranny , in burning tbe pleasant Town of CharlesPARLOR IN THE LANGDON MANSION . // town , Beggars all Description ; this does not look like the fight of those who have so long been Friends , and would hope to be Friends again , but rather of a most cruel Enemy , tho ' we shall not wonder when we Reflect that it is the infernald hand of Tyranny which always has and Ever will Delluge that part of the World ( which it lays hold of ) in Blood . . . .

I shall endeavor as far as my poor abilities will admit of to render every service in my power to my Country . " These lines admirably sum up the course and purpose of Langdon 's long and useful public career . He . was a firm patriot , loyal to his country to the latest moment of his honored life . His loneliness as the only delegate from his Province was soon relieved by the appointment of Josiah Bartlett ; and a year later William Whipple was added to the delegation . Langdon was prominent in the proceedings of the Congress , and stood high in the estimation of his associates . He served on important committees , and was one of those who was sent to Canada on a secret mission , ostensibly to ascertain the state of the troops and fortifications and the general progress of the war . Among Langdon 's Congressional duties none was more important than that of providing an adequate and constant supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee . Early in 1776 we find him at home busily engrossed in superintending the manufacture of powder and of small arms , encouraging his fellow citizens by his example of unceasing activity and conspicuous disinterestedness . The war had now come upon the colonies in earnest , and New Hampshire from its geographical position was between two dangers . The best of the troops were in Washington 's army near JOHN LANGDON . ALCOVE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM OF THE LANGDON MANSION . // Boston , yet the exigency of the situation demanded prompt and generous reinforcements for the army in Canada . The northern townships were in constant alarm lest the Indians burst upon them , and their fears were by no means idle or groundless . More than once the danger was imminent , and the Committee of Safety did its utmost to furnish men to protect the threatened frontier and thus compose the fears of the inhabitants . The Continental Congress was greatly perplexed with these border troubles , and considerable time was spent in determining the best course to be pursued . While Langdon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress called on New Hampshire for a quota of seven hundred and fifty men to reinforce the troops in Canada , and the Provincial House ( at once ) voted to raise the required number , giving a bounty of six pounds to each soldier . About this time Captain Langdon , as he was called , was appointed colonel of light infantry , with authority to nominate his commissioned officers , a mark of confidence somewhat rare in military procedure . It does not appear that Langdon had attended the Congress in Phjladelphia for nearly a year ; consequently Matthew Thornton was appointed , and thus Langdon missed the proud distinction of signing the Declaration of Independence . Congress , mindful of Langdon 's abilities , made him its agent for the building in Portsmouth of a frigate called the Raleigh , and into this new business he threw all his resolution and energy . His commission as colonel of the light infantry did not interfere with the construction of the frigate , and during the rest of the year he remained at home undistressed by the alarms of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Representatives , and chosen speaker , presiding over the brief and uneventful session with that impartiality and dignity which always characterized him . The procuring of lead , powder , flints and other indispensable articles for the army caused Langdon no little trouble , but a fair measure of success // attended his efforts . Cupidity was not wanting among the Portsmouth merchants , and in some instances they refused to part with their goods except at an unreasonable profit . This kind of dealing was too much for a man of John Langdon 's ideas and temperament , and he suggested to the Committee of Safety the propriety of seizing such articles as were needed by the army . Rum was an essential concomitant to war in those days , and the merchants , knowing the fact , raised the price accordingly . Their shrewdness , however , availed them nothing , for the sheriff went his rounds taking from each dealer a certain percentage of his hogsheads . To illustrate the belief in the efficacy of rum in the war then waging , a quotation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be very remiss so will the batteaux men and teamsters if in the heat of summer they are to drink water . " At the June session of 1777 Langdon was again speaker , little dreaming of the momentous question that was destined to come before the I-louse and in the decision of which he was to act so splendid a part . The times were exciting , for the war was now at its height ; but the session dragged along and was soon adjourned ,  --  only to be quickly summoned to reassemble again by the command of the Committee of Safety . l3urgoyne had begun his march , and the sound of his guns could almost be heard by the excited people . The wildest rumors passed from town to town and for a moment the stoutest men became disheartened . The House took instant action . The state troops were put into two brigades , the second being commanded by John Stark , who was to be wholly amenable to the General Court for his actions . Stark had retired from the Continental Army , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw his sword against the enemy . At this juncture Langdon made his name precious to the memory of Americans . The House was in committee of the whole and the question of raising money to send Stark and his men to Bennington was under discussion . Public credit was low and daily getting lower ; the exchequer of the infant state was really empty , and further taxation was useless . Langdon was no orator ; he was scarcely a fair talker ; but on this occasion the hidden spring of speech was touched to its depths . The members were silent , despondent , discouraged . " I have a thousand dollars in hard money , " exclaimed Langdon , " I will pledge my plate for three thousand more . I have seventy hogsheads of Tobago rum , which will be sold for the most they will bring . They are at the service of the state . If we succeed in defending our fireTHE LANGDON TOMB , PORTSMOUTH , N. H. TABLET IN ST . JOHN S CHURCH , PORTSMOUTH . // sides and our homes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the property xviii be of no value to me . Our friend Stark , who so nobly maintained the honor of our state at Bunker Hill , may safely be entrusted with the honor of the enterprise , and we will check the progress of Burgoyne . " These stirring sentiments were the grand precursor of that brilliant victory a few xveeks later which broke the spirit of England , averted all danger of invasion from Canada , and bound anew the loosening ties of the dejected patriots . But Langdon did not stop here ; he followed up his generosity by calling for volunteers to go with Stark ; and in a short time a company was enrolled , Langdon himself being among the first to enlist . This battalion took part in the battles of Bennington and Stillwater and was present at the surrender of General Burgoyne . Colonel Langdon left Gates 's headquarters on October 17 , bearing copies of the terms of capitulation . The success of the Americans was complete ; and Langdon stood higher if possible than ever before . He still continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence , and he held that office until 1782 , although during those years he was more occupied with executive than with legislative matters . Later , he bore arms under General Sullivan in Rhode Island , which ended his military career . Having been appointed by Congress as naval agent for New England , he gave his whole attention to building frigates , enlisting seamen and providing the sinews of war . Of Langdon it may truly be said that he held nearly every office within the gift of the people . He frequently held several offices at the same time , yet no one ever accused him of greediness or selfishness . To the end of the war he continued to serve as agent for the confederation , holding in the meanwhile various official positions the number and duties of which at this day strike one as amusing . He was president of the New Hampshire Convention called for the purpose of appreciating and strengthening paper money , and had the satisfaction of presiding over two sessions of this extraordinary body . In 1783 , in view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services were called for , and he once more received appointment as a delegate to Philadelphia . In 1778 a State Constitutional Convention convened , of which he was a member . He was also a member of the long-lived convention which met in 1781 and after seven sessions finally adjourned in 1783 . No man had a clearer comprehension of what was necessary to make a united and strong country than Langdon , and to the bringing about of this result he bent his strength and gave his time and money . At last peace was declared and the long and impoverishing war was ended ; but the future was yet dark . The revolution was by no means accomplished when Coruwallis laid down his arms , for the most difficult and doubtful part still confronted the people . The emission of worthless paper money , the impairment of credit , and above all the deep-seated jealousies subsisting between the states , made the adjustment of differences the most perplexing and delicate task ever set before statesmen . Delay was carrying the victorious Americans speedily toward irreparable disaster , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest the remedy . In New Hampshire public concerns were reeling from weakness , yet personal feelings were generously subordinated to the common welfare . As yet no heartburnings had set the patriots against each other ; all were anxious to put the machineryof government in order ; but a paralysis seemed to have settled upon the leading men of the country which for the moment threatened the direst calamities . At length the spirits of the ex // hausted confederation were raised by the assembling of the famous convention from which issued the present Constitution . As may be supposed , the public choice fell upon Langdon at this juncture , and he took his seat in this memorable body as a delegate from his native state . He was not a stranger among the members , for there he renewed many of his old Congressional acquaintances and met with a cordial welcome . The deliberations were kept secret and not given to the world until long after every member had been gathered to his fathers . Langdon , however , took a leading part , and his suggestions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . His colleagues were lawyers and soldiers , with here and there a few scholars ; but scarcely one among them equaled the New Hampshire delegate in practical knowledge of everyday affairs . On the question of the slave trade Langdon expressed himself with vehemence , declaring it " a violation of good conscience . " But compromise dominated the convention . New Hampshire voted with others to prolong the slave trade for twenty years , and in return the extreme slave states agreed to the clause relating to the Navigation Acts . Langdon spoke and voted in favor of giving to Congress the power to subdue rebellions without the intercession of the state legislatures . Shays 's Rebellion was a living image before his eyes , and he wanted to make impossible any repetition of such violence . The evils of paper money were apparent to all men , and in condemnation of its issuance by Congress the convention approached unanimity . " Rather than grant the power ( of making paper money ) to Congress , " exclaimed Langdon , " I would reject the whole plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Less than a century later the question of paper legal tender rose to harass and excite the republic and to perplex its highest tribunal , which held the question a long time in consultation owing to judicial differences . On the seventeenth of September the Federal Convention ceased its labors , and the instrument was submitted to popular judgment . Langdon and his Massachusetts colleagues probably had a long and tedious journey homeward and it was not with the lightest or most confident heart that he saw the familiar landmarks of Portsmouth in the distance . There was still a struggle ahead , for not all the articles of the Constitution were by any means fitted to the liking of his constituents . An appeal to patriotism and moderation by calm discussion was the only way to make a compromise acceptable ; and to this labor Langdon gave his days and nights . It was the work of a giant , but fortunately in New Hampshire a great majority of the leading men were in favor of ratification and exercised their influence to that end ; yet the farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and this class being numerous and strong , put the result in doubt . The convention met in Exeter , then adjourned to Concord , where on the anniversary of Bunker Hill the session was opened , lasting four days , when by a vote of fifty-seven to forty-six the Constitution was ratified , and as New Hampshire was the ninth state , the Constitution thus became a reality and the union was established . In this convention Langdon was the leader of the constitutional party , aided by Josiah Bartlett and Samuel Livermore , and the instrument was finally successful in spite of most strenuous opposition . During the next decade Langdon was constantly in public life , and to few men were greater honors accorded . Langdon was not a scholar , a soldier , nor an orator ; he was only a strong-willed , modest man , highly endowed with common sense , systematic habits and calm , unruffled // disposition ; he was honest , straightforward and courteous , and men always knew where to find him . For these characteristics he was honored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1788 , and in the same year the legislature , anticipating the organization of the general government , elected him as senator in Congress , with Paine Wingate as his colleague . The new government was to meet in New York and proceed to serious business on March 4 , but when that day arrived only eight senators and thirteen representatives were in the city . The proceedings had to be postponed , and the day appointed for the inauguration of the president passed by almost unnoticed . The government could not go into operation , and to aggravate the strange situation scarcely a member a day put in appearance . All this was highly diverting to the Anti-Federalists  --  and New York was the breeding ground of that noxious school of politicians . Yet when one studies the physical conditions prevailing at that inclement season of the year and takes into consideration the newness and novelty of the electoral machinery , the unfortunate delay does not appear so remarkable . March was nearly spent when the necessary number of senators answered to their names , and , a quorum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirtieth of the month and proceeded to organize . Langdon was chosen president pro tern of the Senate , and on the sixth of April he sent a message over to the House to notify it to attend to the declaration of the vote for president and vice-president . The historic scene had been put off so many times that a spirit of levity could with difficulty be suppressed ; but the solemn moment had at last come , and amid a deep silence Langdon opened the ballots and read them off to the tellers appointed by each house . Washington received sixty-nine , the whole number , and John Adams received thirty-four , the remaining votes being cast for ten different persons . Soon after this event the senators drew lots to determine the class to which each should belong ; and to Langdon fell the third class of six years . On the twenty-first of April the vice-president-elect was escorted into the Senate chamber , where Colonel Langdon briefly addressed him and conducted him to his chair . The courtesies of the inauguration were now over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every turn . They were great sticklers for form and ceremony in those days , and one of the first of the Senate debates arose on the subject of how messages should be presented to the Senate and to the House . Our simple forefathers voted that the following was the correct procedure : " When a bill shall be sent up by the House of Representatives to the Senate , it shall be carried by two members , who at the bar of the Senate shall make their obeisance to the president and then advancing to the chair make a second obeisance and deliver it into the hands of the president . After having delivered the bill they shall make their obeisance to the president , and repeat it as they retire from the bar . The Senate shall rise on the entrance of the members within the bar , and continue standing until they retire . " On the question of ceremony both parties seemed agreed . Styles or titles became a prolific source of speech-making , nearly every senator expressing his opinion on the momentous subject . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called forth some extraordinary arguments . Adams himself spoke freely on the question , taking strong ground in favor of the dignity of a title , and this very speech was quoted against him in his campaign for president . Senator Maclay , who drew a two years ' lease of official life , and who wrote caustically of the great // men of the day , spoke forcibly in opposition . Among the titles under consideration were : His Excellency , His Mightiness , His Grace , His Serene Highness and others still more flattering . Langdon took Madison 's view , confining his remarks to a brief speech in which he ridiculed the whole business , declaring that the selection of a title was the least of the present difficulties . The whole subject having been debated in every light was suffered to drop , and it soon passed out of sight and was forgotten . In the meantime Washington had been sworn into office , and the great federal machine began slowly to move . The tariff was another firebrand of discussion and recrimination , which burned more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections . Langdon stood for a protective tariff , and his views , being those of a man of wide experience in mercantile affairs , were eagerly listened to by his colleagues . For it must be remarked that he possessed a remarkable faculty of making money , and even during the war , when want and distress went stalking through the land , his coffers were filling for his ventures yielded good returns . Compared with the rich merchants of New York and Philadelphia he was a man of moderate means , but measured by the New Hampshire standard he was a Crcesus . Throughout the debates on the tariff and on taxation Langdon was a frequent participant , and while his speeches were short they were carefully considered and carried weight . On the judiciary bill and on the tonnage bill great obstinacy was manifested , the contentious spirit extending to the House of Representatives , where the debates were long and heated . On the subject of commerce Langdon was at home , and through his conciliatory efforts the threatened split on the question of discrimination between our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the midst of sharp debates and sectional prejudices a few social functions took place , which may or may not have been calculated to soften the senatorial tempers . The President and Mrs. Washington gave a series of dinners during the session , to which the distinguished statesmen of the day were bidden . At one of these Langdon and his wife were guests . The entertainment is vividly portrayed by Senator Maclay , whose appreciation of the father of his country was far from effusive in its expression . After mentioning the guests the account continues : The President and Mrs. Washington sat opposite each other , in the middle of the table , the two secretaries one at each end . It was a great dinner and the best of the kind ever I was at . The room , however , was disagreeably warm . First was soup ; fish , roasted and boiled meats-gammon , fowls , etc . This was the dinner . The middle of the table was garnished in the usual tasty way , with small images , flowers ( artificial ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. ; then ice creams , jellies , etc. ; then water melons , musk melons , apples , peaches , nuts . It was the most solemn dinner ever I sat at . Not a health drank-scarce a word said , until the cloth was taken away . Then the President taking a glass of wine , with great formality , dran'k to the health of every individual , by name , round the table . Everybody imitated him-changed glasses ; and such a buzz of health , Sir , and health , Madam , and thank you Sir , and thank you Madam . never had I heard before . Indeed I had like to have been thrown out in the hurry ; but I got a little wine in my glass and passed the ceremony . The bottles passed about , but there was a dead silence almost . Mrs. Washington at last withdrew with the ladies . I expected the men would now begin , but the same stillness remained . The President told of a New England clergyman , who had lost a hat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , and everybody else laughed . The President kept a fork in his hand , when the cloth was taken away , I thought for the purpose of picking nuts . He eat no nuts , but played with the fork , striking on the edge of the table with it . " Thus did the amenities of society soften the asperities of the law-makers . The first session so prolific of experiment and oratory at last drew to an end , and the senators and representatives // hurried home to face their anxious constituents and to gage the popular will . During this period Washington made his wellremembered journey to New England , visiting among other places the old town of Portsmouth . He was met at the state line by a cavalcade of prominent citizens , many of whom he knew by name . The chief magistrate received a royal welcome from the people , and his reception was most hospitable by all , but by none more than by Langdon . Washington in his diary mentions that Colonel Langdon 's house was the best in Portsmouth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his distinguished guest . The sentiments of patience and moderation , which characterized the beginning of the government because of the uncertainty of everything , soon began to disintegrate , and before the expiration of Langdon 's first term sufficient opposition was aroused in New Hampshire to prevent his prompt reelection ; although the House chose him , the Senate was obstinate , remaining so until the next session , when it concurred , and he entered upon his second term . During this period party policies or rather factional jealousies began to show themselves on every side . Washington and Hamilton were respectively suspected and hated , while Jefferson was both loved and despised by the men of the time . Langdon inclined toward Jefferson , and at last openly allied himself to the forces hostile to Washington . There is reason to believe that it was not so much Jefferson who captured Langdon , although there was an intimacy between them , but that the moving force was Madison , for whom Langdon had an unstinted admiration . We now find Langdon an out and out Republican , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Jay treaty soon gave full opportunity to the Republicans to rejoice and sing hosannas , because of the treaty*s seeming unpopularity . In the Senate Langdon strenuously opposed its ratification , although his colleague took the opposite ground ; but the Senate by a decisive majority approved the treaty . Langdon probably lived long enough to change his views on this treaty , for it worked well for the commerce of the country , particularly that of New England . A gross intemperance of speech was directed at the president and his supporters , grosser by far than has ever since been applied to our chief magistrates , even in periods of intensest public passions . In nearly every town of consequence windows were smashed and all kinds of petty violence indulged in . Statesmen were hung in effigy , and the mobs sang ribald songs as they marched past the houses of prominent Federalists . Great excitement prevailed throughout the land . In Portsmouth , Langdon was the hero of the hour . Speeches were made and a vote of thanks was given him for voting against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same mind . In Claremont menaces were uttered and a figtire resembling that of the senior senator was seen dangling from a high pole . The legislature , too , at its session in November , moved by the suggestion of Governor Gilman , unanimously voted undiminished confidence " in the virtue and ability of the minister who negotiated the treaty , the senate who advised its ratification , and the president , the distinguished friend and father of his country , who complied with this advice . " Thus began the bitter war between the Republicans and the Federalists which with names changed continues to the present day and promises to endure to an epoch bordering on the millennium . In the public excitement Langdon had passed from the happy condition of being the one man trusted and popular in the public mind to that of the partisan whose hand was against all // who did not think and act as he did . He had taken a leading part in the political warfare , and he must abide the inevitable hostility of his former friends . He had now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a distinguished contem-porary : " He was a man of decent talents , but neither great nor brilliant . In early and middle life he was liberal of his money , but not profuse or lavish . His manners were easy , polite and insinuating , and his habits peculiarly social . He courted popularity with the zeal of a lover and the constancy of a martyr . Though he loved pomp and parade , his love of money was stronger and made him frugal and economical . He was not a good scholar and read but little . " From this time until his retirement from public office Langdon was an intense party man . His political preferment was no longer based on the unanimous will of his fellow citizens , but was essentially the result of vigorous party management and strife . During his second senatorial term his affiliations with Jefferson and the Republicans became closer and more conspicuous , thereby placing him in opposition to John Adams and the measures of his administration . The wheel of political chances will not go on forever bestowing favors ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of all his influence the four votes of New Hampshire went to Aaron Burr instead of to Thomas Jefferson , whose candidacy he so warmly espoused . In i8oi , his term having expired , he intended to quit public life forever ; but party exigencies decreed otherwise and called him to other stations of honor and trust . At the outset of Jefferson 's term as president he offered the Secretaryship of the Navy to Langdon ; indeed he almost pressed the place upon him ,  --  but without success . The relations between the two men continued intimate , and a few months later we find the president writing to Langdon in this strain : " Although we have not yet got a majority into the fold of Republicanism in your state , yet one long pull more will effect it . We can hardly doubt that one twelvemouth more will give an executive and legislature in that state whose opinions may harmonize with their sister states , - unless it be true , as is sometimes said , that New Hampshire is but a satellite of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter state to adopt out and out Republican tenets , Jefferson adds : " But I am in hopes they will in time discover that the shortest road to rule is to join the majority . " Langdon was the undisputed leader of the Republicans in his state and as such he had to bear the heavy burdens and keep himself equipped for the fight . His ideas of civil service as applied to office-holders were Draconic ; he is on record as declaring that he hoped to live to see a change in men from George Washington to doorkeepers . This language does not sound natural to such a man , but it illustrates the rancor of the period and the innermost thoughts of the fathers of the republic . The fact that Langdon had been a senator and an associate of the leading statesmen of the country did not prevent him from beginning his legislative life anew by again representing Portsmouth in the state legislature . From i8oi-i8o* he was a member , and during the last two years served as speaker . Governor Plumer says of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held did he appear so much to his own advantage as in that of presiding officer . He was attentive , prompt , impartial , and his conduct was generally approved . " As leader of his party he had to head the ticket , consequently he became the Republican candidate for governor as early as 1802 , receiving nearly half the entire vote . He was again candidate in 1803 , 1804 and 1805 when he was successful . The gains of his // party had become immense , so that in some of his subsequent elections he received nearly fourfifths of the popular vote . Unswerving support of Jefferson 's administration was the fundamental doctrine and practice of the dominant party . We find the legislature passing a vote of confidence in the virtuous and magnanimous administration " and condemning in strong terms " that spirit of malignant abuse " with which it had been assailed . The situation was just reversed from that of the previous decade . Under Langdon 's chief magistracy some very beneficent laws were passed . Among the best was that for the division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be ascribed to various political causes and he was repeatedly reélected governor , with the exception of one year , until i8i i , when he peremptorily declined to be a candidate . The elections toward the last were intensely exciting , and strife ran high . The country was on the eve of another war ; the administration needed all its friends , and even then the outcome was uncertain . The Republicans of New Hampshire fought as they never fought before and rescued the state from the Federalists , who had held it for one year . On the momentous subject of the Embargo , Langdon , having been misrepresented , published a letter affirming his adherence to the measure , which he said originated in the purest patriotism and wisdom . It was incumbent on the governor to address the legislature on the great questions then agitating the country , and Langdon was not found wanting . His messages were vigorous and to the point , full of patriotic feelixig and suggestions of duty . At one time bloodshed seemed imminent , for the people were sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to itself the prerogative of a plan of action if such and such a thing came to pass . But firmness in high places had its wholesome effect , and all signs of civil strife gradually disappeared . This was Langdon 's last term , and his last public office ; for the infirmities of age warned him to withdraw from political life . He had reached his three-score and ten , had attained almost without seeking the highest offices in the state and nation , and he knew that the end of life could not be long delayed . But he was not yet through with honors for in 1812 the Republican caucus held in Washington nominated him as candidate for vice-president , and a committee was appointed to notify him of the nomination . To the letter of the committee he made the following reply : Portsmouth , May 28th , 1812 . " Gentlemen : - By the mail of last evening I had the honor of receiving your letter of the 22d inst. , which informs me that at a meeting of the Republican members of Congress I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . This mark of attention and confidence shown by the honorable Gentlemen demands my most grateful acknowledgments . I wrote to the Honorable Mr. Ringold the day before yesterday giving some fuller reasons why I could not consent to be brought forward as a candidate for Vice-President of the United States , to which I beg leave to add that I am now seventy-one years of age , my faculties blunted , and I have lived ' for the last forty years of my life in the whirlpool of politics and am longing for the sweets of retirement . I am therefore under the painful necessity of declining the honorable offer of my friends of being brought forward as a candidate for the office of Vice-President of the United States . My advanced age forbids my undertaking long journeys and renders me ' incapable of performing the duties of the important station of VicePresident with any adv'antage to our beloved Country or any honor to myself . To launch again upon the ocean of politics at my time of life appears to me highly improper . I am therefore assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept their kind offer . I have the honor to be , Gentlemen , your obliged humble ser . " John Langd'on . " With this letter the public might have seen the closing act of Langdon 's career , had it not been for that // unholy spirit of calumny then pervading every nook and corner of our country . After the war began , some miscreant made the charge that Langdon 's real reason for declining the high office of vice-president was because of his disapproval of Madison 's course . That this was a campaign lie was at once apparent ; but the blood of the old man boiled , and out came this denial , addressed to Mr. Harper , a representative in Congress : " Portsmouth , June 15th , 1812 . " Dear Sir : -I am overwhelmed when I reflect that my advanced time of life only prevented me from complying with the wishes of my friends . I have the most sincere desire to join my friends at this all important moment , to carry into effect every decided measure to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take my old friends by the hand &amp; to have an opportunity of paying my personal respects to those honorable gentlemen from the several states who have been pleased to favor me with their notice ; but I am prevented . I should have thought it an honor &amp; it would have been my highest pleasure to serve my country in any station while my great and good friend Mr. Madison continued in the presidency , as I consider him one of our greatest statesmen , an ornament to our Country and above all the noblest work of God , an honest man . I think it happy for our Country that we have at this important crisis such a decided character at the head of our affairs . As our patience is worn out &amp; we have drunk the dregs of the cup of humiliation , if we now act with spirit &amp; decision there is nothing to fear . I pray you , Sir , to present my most profound respects to all my friends as they may fall in your way . I pray you , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteem . " John Langdon . " President Madison had no more steadfast supporter than this venerable man , who warmly approved of the policy of his friend 's administration , especially the war legislation . After Langdon 's death Madison in a letter to a New Hampshire man speaks thus of him : " I was myself intimately acquainted with your uncle ( Langdon ) and cheerfully concur in all the praise Mr. Jefferson bestows on him . He was a true patriot and a good man , with a noble way of thinking and a frankness and warmth of heart that made his friends love him much , as it did me in a high degree , and disarmed his enemies of some of the asperity indulged toward others . " The closing years of Langdon 's life were quietly passed at his beautiful home in Portsmouth . He took an interest in current events , both national and local ; but his long and arduous service in politics had weakened him and left him defenseless against the attacks of advancing age . Governor IPlumer , his devoted friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and from his pen we catch a glimpse of the last scenes in that busy and historic career . Under date of July 23 , i8i6 , the diary says : " Visited L. He is so literally broken down in body and mind that it gave me pain to behold the wreck of human nature and witness so much debility , decrepitude and helplessness in a man who had been so distinguished for the elegance of his person and the offices he had held in public life . He was civil , kind and affectionate and tho ' weak in mind yet not foolish . He retained his former opinions and cautious habits of speaking respecting men and measures . But on some subjects and on recent events he appeared lost and embarrassed and distrusted his own judgment . " The end was near , and on the eighteenth of September , 1819 , he passed away , in the seventy-ninth year of his age . On the day appointed for his funeral , military honors were paid to his memory by the United States troops , minute guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forts , the navy yard and the shipping in the harbor displayed their colors at half-mast , and every mark of respect was rendered to the memory of the distinguished patriot who had done so much for the welfare of his country and for the good of his fellow-citizens.
