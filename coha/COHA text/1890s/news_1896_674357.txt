txt We have no doubt that the City of New York will take its full share of the work to be done to make the Indianapolis Convention of Business Men on Jan. 12 a success . There is no city in the Union with interests so great , direct and indirect , in the purposes of the convention . There is none in which the business men can exert greater influence With proper organization , care , and energy . Not only the business men of New York , but those with whom they deal and with whom they are in constant communication , can and should join in this work . It has already been brought up in the Chamber of Commerce , and other commercial bodies can do valuable service . In our judgment , the time has gone by when New York men should hesitate to take a definite stand , agree upon What they believe will be best for the country , and press it with all their might . They want nothing but the good of the entire country . They are absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity . The financial system that will make their business safe and profitable will do the same from Oregon to Texas . The notion that they thrive on the suffering of others is false . It is entertained by a considerable number of ignorant persons , but it originated with unscrupulous demagogues , and was started by simple lying . The recent campaign did much to dissipate this notion and confound its authors . What remains of it can not stand against frank , intelligent , resolute work by the men of New York themselves .
