txt The real estate lawyers and others who have formed an association to promote the construction of a proper building for the records of this city and county , affecting the titles of real estate to a vast amount , have made a brilliant discovery . After declaring that such a building should be for the exclusive use of the Register of the county , they have discovered that there are also documents and records in the office of the County Clerk and that of the Surrogate which also affect real estate titles , and that the care of these is hardly more adequately provided for than that of the records of the Register 's office . If these gentlemen continue their inquiries they may find out that there has for several years been ample provision of law for obtaining a site and constructing a proper Record Building , and that a still existing commission with authority unimpaired is charged with the duty of giving effect to this law . It was as well known ten years ago as it is npw that the Hall of Records was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proposed to replace it with a new structure , the propriety of making provision for the offices and records of the Register , County Clerk , and Surrogate in the same building was recognized . It was manifest beyond question then , and is so still , and there should be no consideration given to a proposition for a building for the sole use of the Register . An act was passed in 1888 making the Sinking Fund Commissioners , the Surrogate , the County Clerk , and the Register a commission to secure a site " in the neighborhood of the County Court House , " but " not in the City Hall Park , " for precisely such a structure as was then needed and is still more needed now , and to cause such a structure to be erected thereon . Every power necessary for the work was given to this commission . Nothing having been accomplished in two years , and there being a demand for a municipal building which should accommodate other offices than those named , the act was so amended in 1890 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to include in the plan provision for these other offices . This extension of the design was left to the discretion of the commission . Two more years passed with nothing accomplished , and owing to the difficulty of securing a site near the Court House and outside the park , the law was amended to permit the commission to take the necessary land either in the park or " adjacent thereto . " This was followed by the scheme for removing the old City Hall and building a new one sufficient to meet all the needs and requirements of die municipal and county offices and their records , and an act authorizing the removal of the old buildings was passed in 1893 . But opposition to displacing the old City Hall or putting new buildings in the park revived , and in 1894 the act of 1892 was repealed , leaving that of 1890 in full force and effect . Amendments to this were adopted in 1895 , making definite provision for obtaining plans , letting contracts , &c.; There the matter stands to-day . The commission created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers granted by the amendments of 1890 for obtaining a site and causing a building to be erected " as nearly fire-proof as can be practically secured ; sufficient to provide suitable accommodations for the office and use of the Register of the City and County of New York ; for the office and use of the Clerk of the City and County of New York , and for the offices and the court and for the use of the Surrogate of the City and County of New York , being the various offices in which the records affecting public interests are required by law to be kept in said city and county . " This is the building provided for by legislation nearly nine years ago , and it is the building that is needed to-day . The best thing the association of citizens specially concerned in the preservation of these records can do is to bring pressure to bear upon the commission which went to sleep after the failure of the great City Hall project in 1894.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
