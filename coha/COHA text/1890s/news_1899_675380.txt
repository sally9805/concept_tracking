txt Two citizens well-known in Wall Street will call upon Park Commissioner Clausen this morning to demand of him an explanation why they can not continue to operate automobiles in the Park upon the strength of permits issued a few days ago by Mr. Clausen himself . One is Jefferson Seligman of the banking firm of J. &; W. Seligman &; Co. , and the other is Isaac L. Rice , a Director of the Electric Vehicle Company and other electric concerns . Their permits were revoked yesterday by Mr. Clausen , but neither Mr. Seligman nor Mr. Rice had received official notice last night of the fact . They will this morning . The reason for the revocation of the per ' mits , according to the statement of Mr. Clausen , is that both sent automob:le cabs , or coaches , into the Park , whereas , se Mr. Clausen says , their permits called for " electric automobile pleasure carriages " only , and that , furthermore , their vehicles were operated other than by.themselves . Mr. Rice 's wife and two children were driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Rice hires by the month and which is operated by a man in uniform . The automobile was stopped at the Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue entrance , but was allowed to pass upon presentation of the permit . On the West Drive the automobile and its passengers and Mr. Clausen , who was driving at the time , approached one another . Mr. Clausen was astonished at the size of the vehicle , wit : , remembering that he had issued no Permits for one of its make , closely scrutinized the driver and his pasengers . About this time Capt . England of the Park Squad appeared , and Mr. Clausen ordered him to stop the cab : The driver ProduCed his permit . It bore the signature of the Commissioner and was regularly made out to Mr. Rice . " Well , " said Mr. Clausen , after Capt . England had reported , " let it go on , but such a vehicle has no right here . " The automobile later was stopped by a mounted policeman , who ordered the driver to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , but by this time Mrs. Rice , appreciating the fact that riding in an automobile and being stopped every few minutes was not pleasure , but annoyance , ordered her driver to leave the Park and go home . Mr. Rice was indignant that evening when he heard the story , and yesterday when he was told that his permit was about to be revoked he called Mr. Clausen 's action a " high-handed outrage . " It may be , ' , he said , " that Mr. Clausen thinks he owns the Park , and can do as he pleases by keeping some citizens out and letting others in. but I think his action is high-handed . The cab in which my wife and children rode was as much of a pleasure vehicle as any other electric cab . I do not understand his designation of pleasure vehicle . ' " Furthermore , his action in peering into the cab was , to say the least , decidedly unwarranted . What he means by it all I do-not know . I am not prepared to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall see him in the morning and see what he means . I want to know whetheratre  --  tiatfaltsalte. , owirs utrat-Taalc-n-ra not . I shall certainly , demand that my permit be returned to me . He has no right to revoke it . My driver is an expert and perfectly competent . " Mr. Clausen 's complaint against Mr. Seligman is that the banker 's brougham in charge of an operator and footman was driven through the Park a few days ago . This was reported to Mr. Clausen , and his action of yesterday followed , although Mr. Seligman had had no notice of the contemplated action , nothing having been said when the permit was shown to an officer . Mr. Seligman said he had three electric automobiles , a brougham , victoria , and a phaeton . The phaeton he drives himself , and the others are in charge of an operator and footman . " I am a citizen and pay considerable money in taxes , " said Mr. Seligman last night . " Mr. Clausen is also a citizen and pays taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His action in revoking my license is a high-handed proceeding . I consider that I have a perfect right to send my operator in the Park with my vehicles . They are essentially pleasure vehicles . " Mr. Clausen seems to take this means of stopping the march of progress , but he can not do it . The automobile will eventually take the place of horses . I have sold my horses and now rely on my electric carriages . My wife rides in the brougham and has been in the Park frequently . If Mr. Clausen has any grievance against me , the gentlemanly . way would have been to notify me directly . instead of allowing me to learn of the revocation of my permit through the newspapers . " Mr. Seligman said that he also would make it his business to see Mr. Clausen to-day . Mr. Clausen. when asked for an explanation of the affair , said : " I do not term the lumbering affair of Mr. Rice 's a pleasure carriage ' . It is one of those old-fashioned coaches of the early makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen understood the nature of the permits , and believe they had a misconception of the scope of the permits when they put the vehicles in charge of uniformed operators . Perhaps they did not understand . " Mr. Selig-man and Mr. Rice will now have to make new applications and take their turns . My plan , as they know , or ought to know , is to issue these permits gradually . I have no personal animus in this affair . The rules were simply broken , that is all . My aim is. and I want it understood , to allow in the Park only light , open vehicles driven by their owners . "
