txt It pleases the Republicans to make the assertion that in the next few months there will be the greatest rush of office seekers to Washington the country has ever known . Civil Service Commissioner Lyman is of opinion that , if there is such a rush , a vast number of those participating in it will return home with a fine stock of disappointment . Mr. Lyman was a member of the Civil Service Commission under Mr. Cleveland 's Administration , and got a good idea of the President-elect 's views on the subject of office seeking . He said to-day that ho believed Mr. Cleveland would respect to the fullest the letter and the spirit of the civil service law . It would undoubtedly save some persons much vexation of spirit if they were to regard Mr. Lyman 's opinion in the light of personal advice . It was said at the White House to-day that the President had decided to pursue a strictly conservative course in all matters relating to appointments . He does not desire to lay the Administration open to the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vindictiveness or retaliation . Consequently he will extend the classified service only to the degree which he had determined upon in case he was re-elected . This decision , it is said , will not affect more than half a dozen positions in each department . It is stated that the President does not desire to take the Government Printing Office into the classified service , as he has been urged to do . The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is virtually within its list now . Within the past three days each head of a department has been fairly besieged by employes who were not appointed under the civil service law to be taken into the classified service in some way in order to afford them protection . It is said that these employes are very much alarmed , as they fear that the coming Administration will pursue a more aggressive policy than Mr. Cleveland did during his former tenure of office .
