txt In behalf of the investigating committee , of which he is Chairman , Assemblyman Mazet gave out to-day the following statement : " The committee is gratified at the way in which the investigation has opened , and believes that it will be productive of the best results for the City of New York , and , we hope , will lead to remedial legislation which will eradicate the many evils alleged to have grown to such proportions in the several departments of tile city Government . " The evidence already adduced has con-. vinced us of the necessity for this investigation , and we shall make it as searching and thorough as we know how . We already have a large mass of important information in hand , which is being carefully sifted . A large proportion of this evidence is of the most valuable and positive kind . Some has been furnished by persons and organizations who have devoted themselves to the wont of gathering and compiling it . But we realize that there is a great deal more that should be furnished to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on account of their timidity . " These are the very people who , in a large measure , are responsible for the present conditions in that they have weakly submitted to extortion and blackmail in the past , and unless they now have moral courage to come forward and assist the work of this committee they are the ones who should be held answerable for the failure in any degree of the committee to expose the ramified system of blackmail and extortion . We will give complete protection to those persons who volunteer this information , and if so required will treat their communications as confidential . " We wish to express to the press our grateful appreciation for their cordial and almost unanimous support , - both in their news and editorial columns , and we welcome from them any suggestions that may be helpful to the investigation , realizing that many avenues for securing information are open to them that may be closed to us and our agents . " we also appreciate that , no matter what the committee may discover , our work will be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a proper manner . We therefore shall at all times be glad to co-operate with the press , to receive information from them and to post them fully upon the workoand the plans of the committee , so far as such publication will not jeopardize the success of the investigation . " we earnestly invit3 all persons , organizations , and associations of every kind to co-operate with us in the work we have undertaken , assuring them that the investigation will be carried on without fear or favor . " Mr. Hoffman , the Tammany member of the committee , desires it understood that this statement did not represent the views of the minority . It is intimated here that the committee expects , when it resumes its work in New York on Friday , to pursue the inquiry into the construction and contracting companies in which James W. Hinkley and Richard Croker 's sons are interested . and that further startling developments may be expected . The fact of young Croker 's interest ' n the - United Company , formed to take city contracts , was brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is believed that pursuit of the inquiry along that line may develop other surprises . From a source outside the committee , but fully informed as to its workings , it is learned that revelations of the most sensational character concerning the methods by winch corporations have been " held up " may be locked for . " Since the open raid on the Manhattan Elevated Railroad Company , " said this informant . " the men at the head of the big Wall Street corporations have had their eyes opened to the danger they are in . Before that they were unwilling to come out and testify against the people who were blackmailing them , but the boldness of that raid has convinced them that they must come into the open and fight or surrender , ' horse , foot , and dragoons , ' to the raiders . Now that the committee and Mr. Moss have demonstrated the serious and earnest character of the investigation , the capitalists who have been ? held up ' after the manner of the Manhattan people will be ready enough to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extorting patronage from the owners of private office buildings and apartment houses , which has been reported to the committee , is as follows : A man who is constructing such a building will be notified that he must employ certain men , to be named by the Tammany district leader , as janitors , watchmen , &c.; If he refuses he will get a notice of some violation of the building law in his building , which the department had overlooked . If he yields then , the charge is not pressed . Nine times out of ten , it is said , this method succeeds in securing employment for the men the district leader names . Another case into which the committee may look is that of the owner of a big business building , who on several occasions received a. notification that a " violation " had been placed on his building by the Building Department , and who was at the same time flooded with circulars by mail of a certain patent article which could have been used to take the place of that objected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring in on the committee since the public has realized that it is to do something more practical than to expose the corruption of the police force .
