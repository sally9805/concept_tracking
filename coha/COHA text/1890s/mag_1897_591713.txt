BRYANT 'S PERMANENT CONTRIBUTION TO LITERATURE . " It hath been said of old that Virtue dwells Above , among the inaccessible rocks , And treads the holy plac3 with weary feet . She is not seen by eyes of mortal man Save him whom heart - consuming toil hath worn , He who hath climbed the height of fortitude . " IF such a mortal man be born a poet , if one of the seraphim have touched his mouth with a live coal from off the altar , he is a comforter of men , and out of reach of praise . Yet a man may be a poet and have simpler duties before him . He will give utterance to those feelings , the common chattels of the heart , which men have , and know they have , but can not put into words . When Cupid hovered about Psyche in the dark , she divined his presence , she felt his power , she knew his grace , but she needed the definiteness of sight , the certainty of touch , the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human weakness and desire . We need a poet to tell us what we feel . The utterance of the dumb poetry which is in us is for those poets who act intermediate between us and the powers that endowed us with it . it is essential to real expression of that dumb poetry in us that the poet should be in close relation with us . This nearness is almost always found in our American poets . It is natural that it should be so . A poet is affected by the character and habits of the people about him : his thought is colored by their thoughts , his attitude towards the great facts of life is suggested by theirs . In his turn he acts upon his neighbors , and a certain similarity of thought and feeling is established . We see in Keats the joy of Englishmen in English life ; in Shelley , the aspirations of Englishmen ; in Byron , their discontent ; in Wordsworth , their contemplative asceticism . Yet it is not always so . Consider Anosto , a great poet beyond dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , he adopts so brilliantly artificial a style , he displays such ironical contempt of life , that it is impossible that he should be in harmony with the serious life of common men . Our poets more than most poets - and this characteristic may be their chief merit - utter the sentiments of their fellows . They do not affect to consider themselves as men set apart , but endeavor to express the feelings of the people among whom they live . This intimate interdependence of poet and people is very obvious in our best known group of poets . Bryant , Longfellow , Whittier , Lowell , and in their several ways Poe and Whitman , utter the common human feelings that enter the hearts of common men . This is particularly true of Bryant . He says what a large body of people feel , understand , and hold in sympathy . This trait in his poetry is the result of his character , which is essentially American . If we take as the two ideal types of our American character George Washington and Abraham Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-control of Washington to the emotion and selfcontrol of Lincoln . This difference between the two serves fairly to illustrate the tendency of our American type . Bryant is an excellent specimen of the earlier . He was calm , intelligent , selfrespecting , abounding in common sense , contemplative , gentle , peaceful , almost austere . He was like the country in which he was born . Hampshire County , Massachusetts , his birthplace , is in sight of the Berkshire Hills . If Bryant 's verses were to be turned into meadow , hill , dale , and river , we should have almost the counterpart of western Massachusetts . It is somewhat significant that his two best poems , Thanatopsis and the // lines To a Waterfowl , were written there , in his early youth , before he had had experience of the greater emotions and incidents of life . It is on them that his fame chiefly rests , and it is they that best indicate the characteristics of his talents . Early in his long life they gave him public distinction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor . When Thanatopsis was published , the youth of Boston and New York were struck with surprise . A consideration of death came to them like an intellectual creative thought . They were like children of few years , to whom life and immortality are the same , who have no conception of death . These readers had a vague notion in the backs of their minds that death was a subject for philosophy , for the Greek drama ; but that they , men of action , citizens of a free republic , separated by an ocean from Europe , rich in enterprise , invention , and machinery , resting upon a written constitution , and electing to the presidency a Jefferson and * Jackson , should stop to ponder upon death , was to them astounding . If Death had come into the poem like Slippered Pantaloon with his Scythe , mowing down the Fairest Flowers , and scattering the Passions , " baneful band , " they would not have heeded ; they would have classified the poem as poetry , and would have gone on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simple as the Bible ; it suggested no thought beyond the natural compass of their minds ; it gave the earth , the earth of New England , which they themselves trod , so hard to the plough , so stubborn to the harrow , an interest that it had never had before . They were touched and paused to read it , and to read it again , as a man hurrying by a church hears the organ , stops , pauses to catch the voice of the congregation , and then goes on softly , thinking . Thanatopsis is a very extraordinary feat for a boy of eighteen years . Its language shows honest familiarity with the English Bible . Its thoughts are elevated , its manner is quiet and restrained . Dignity and ease , sensibility and selfcommand , stand out conspicuous . But can we read a chapter from the book of Job , and then turn to it and not be aware of a falling off ? Can we set Thanatopsis beside Gray 's Elegy in a Country Churchyard , and not miss Gray 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can we match it with Lines composed near Tintern Abbey ? No , most assuredly . Thanatopsis does not rank with these great poems , but it is a noble poem , and disappoimiting only in this , that it gives promise of a greater excellence , which Bryant never attained . The lines To a Waterfowl also quickly became famous . Young Americans had never thought very much about waterfowl . Wild ducks were good to set upon the table before a guest , they were hard to shoot , they were not plentiful enough to be articles of commerce , their feathers eked out those from the barnyard in stuffing the best pillows . Young men regarded the wild duck as the Church of England regards it , graciously endowed with life for man to take away , made for him to mar . Bryant thought differently . In later years he was impressed by the fact that the Rev. F. W. Robertson " seemed to amuse himself with naught but killing birds . " Bryant , in his boyhood , felt as Wordsworth felt , that the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of all life . He did not try to reconcile religion and the doctrine that a creature rich in immortal life may take from his feebler fellow creatures all the life they have . He had learned , and he , too , taught the lesson , " Never to blend our pleasure or our pride With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels . " He drew a moral from the flight of the waterfowl through " the desert and illimitable air , " and it was accepted . The doctrine was in harmony with the feelings of the Unitarians . The subject of // the poem was therefore peculiarly f avorable . The simplicity and delicacy of expression are of great excellence . Bryant 's poems inevitably bring Wordsworth to our minds , yet it seems unfair to Bryant 's talents to measure their increase by comparison with the fruits of Wordsworth 's genius . Bryant 's lot took him to the city , to newspapers and daily cares , while Wordsworth sauntered contemplative over Helvellyn and along the margin of Windermere . Great poetry has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it his concentrated thought and his whole heart . Chaucer , Shakespeare , Spenser , Pope , Wordsworth , Shelley , Byron , all the great poets of England have given undivided allegiance to poetry . Bryant could not do so , and his poems bear the marks of his involuntary disloyalty . A poet must be judged by his achievement alone . Bryant 's veises , except at their best , show a lack of art . They are a little undisciplined ; they betray truancy to the classics-Great masters of verse - Milton , Spenser , Tennyson , Swinburne - have wrought their poems and labored over them with the care and minuteness of coral insects . Horace has taught all his students the great Roman truth that discipline and care conquer the world . His lines march together as the men of the Tenth Legion paraded before Julius C*esar* The second-best word goes to a court-martial , the superfluous syllable is cast off on the instant . The task of the poet is to learn form , that he may have dominion over matter . Drudgery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant holds so high his independence that he will not submit enough to discipline , and therefore he says , " The sun was near his set ; " he speaks of " sylvan lakelet , " and then before that has dribbled out of our memory " wavelets " come splashing along . There may be high authority for these expressions , but they were not meet for Bryant 's purposes . This incivility to English that appears in Bryant , seldom , yet too often , is due partly to his willful independence , partly to his lack of training , and also in a measure to his lack of sensitiveness . A man keenly alive to delicate impressions , to " shadows and sunny glimmerings , " will do one of two things : either he will try and try again until he shall succeed in making his readers partakers of his sensations , or he will forbear ; lie will not put up with inadequate expression . Wordsworth has willfulness in bountiful abundance , but in those poems which we prize most highly there is the simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Dorothy Wordsworth says somewhere in her journal , " William has come back tired : he has spent all the day in thinking of an adjective for the cuckoo . " While most of us , of ourselves , with our feeble capacity for belief , with our lean imagination , in our dreamless days and our prose-ridden nights , do not feel that nature has personality , nevertheless the most hardened among us are compelled so to feel after reading Wordsworth . Then we believe in some attribute of Deity immanent in nature , and we grow conscious of what the Bible names " the presence of God . " But Bryant only makes us see what he sees , - beautiful inanimate nature , fruitful in suggestion , quick to catch the color of our imaginings , ready to reflect our moods , but at most only tinged with us and painted with our thoughts . Certainly we need to be reminded that beauty lies about ns , that pleasures have been scattered thick at our doorsteps , that " we are too ready with complaint in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is work of a less degree of excellence than that of drawing aside the veil from the temple of God . Bryant shows us many , but not all the aspects of nature . His love of nature is simpler than nature . He enjoys her calm , he finds repose in her inaction ; // he does not enter into all her joyousness , her delicate growths , her childlike activities . " Solitude to her Is blithe society , which fills the air With gladness and involuntary songs . " But Bryant falls into seriousness as soon as he is in a wood . So , too , nature 's sorrowful fadings and fallings pass him by unheeded except as lie draws a sorrowful inference for man . We can not but feel the great difference between Bryant 's poems on nature and those of Wordsworth . In most of Wordsworth 's familiar poems we find this sensitive recognition of nature " through the veil that seems to hide " her , - nature , as we would fain believe her , our young virgin mother , a Primavera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wrought . In Bryant we find nature is but an echo of himself . High , serene , calm , and sometimes beautiful , she rises like an eidolon of Bryant . Through Wordsworth we learn love and reverence for nature ; he teaches us that she will suffer us like little children to come unto her , and we find rest , refreshment , and delight . " She gives us eyes , she gives us ears And tender hopes and delicate fears , A heart the fountain of soft tears And love and thought and joy . " In Bryant nature is a patch on a New England hillside . There is much beauty , much tenderness , much room for virtuous reverie and noble thought , but nature for him does not vary with its changing seasons . It is October , sunshine or shade , all the year ; there is but one music in the pines , but one rustle in the fallen leaves ; the grasses speak in monotone . Sometimes , it is true , Bryant is half conscious of a girlish spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , too quick to catch . He attempts to lay hold of her , and writes Sella and Little Children of the Snow . But nature , the wood nymph , is denied to him ; She enchants all poets , they all woo her on summer eves by haunted stream , " but few hold commerce with her . Few can say : - " Here at the fountain 's sliding foot Or at some fruit-tree 's mossy root , Casting the body 's vest aside My soul into the boughs does glide . " Although Bryant does not reveal to us the holy spirit of nature as Wordsworth does , or nature the forest nymph as Theocritus does , or even portray all her outward aspects , he does show the most important significance of nature for us . That light carelessness which some poets have , which from its very lightness is able to catch " the gay motes that people the sunbeams , " is meet for the holiday time of life , for feast-days and for youth . We have a more abiding need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our faith is weak ; with the bodily eye we can not always discern how that law prevails in the world about us . The difficulties of belief can not be overcome without the help of beauty , which bare laws of cause and effect ; probable rules for escaping evils , can not of their own nature put on . We need poets to make that moral law beautiful in our eyes , to " endue it with heavenly gifts , " to cover it with " thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls " or with an authority that we will not question . Whatever man does so deserves well of the people . Bryant , in narrow limits , perhaps , and with uneven powers , has done this for us . Men with need of metaphysical and subtle reasonings , and men too much in the glare of common sense , may not feel the value of his work , but " Country folks who live beneath The shadow of the steeple , The parson and the parson 's wife And mostly married people , Youth green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - all these will feel that Bryant has added a touch of poetry to that moral law , has helped to show more clearly a loveliness // which our hearts accept as inherent in it , and to show how that moral beauty belongs to Earth , our mother , and is somehow in harmony with the powers that draw the tracery in ferns and frost , and put their colors in the poppy and the dandelion . The Forest Hymn , The Planting of the Apple Tree , The Death of the Flowers , 0 Fairest of the Rural Maids , Green River , and a number of other poems , incompletely perhaps , and with various degrees of excellence , bear witness to this great service which he has thus rendered to us . Bryant first read Wordsworth at the age of seventeen . In the Fable for Critics Mr. Lowell says Bryant has " the advantage that Wordsworth before him has written . " But this is hardly fair . We fail to find any imitation of Wordsworth in Bryant 's best poems . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his own natural growth , and not by any artificial graftings or foreign influences . The poem To a Waterfowl is quite different from Wordsworth 's manner . Wordsworth has had many followers . Walter Bagehot said that he had a whole host of sacred imitators ; that Keble translated him for timid women , and Hartley Coleridge for gentle devotees of nature . Bryant was not one of these . His disposition , impelled by the same large causes which moved Wordsworth , led him to the same simple subjects , - to the flowers of the field , and to the waterbrooks which nourish them . Yet the disciples of Wordsworth would lay claim to a larger art , born of a stronger mind and of a wider imagination , in the poems To a Green Linnet , To the Little Celandine , and their fellows . And no one would be quicker than such disciples to admit that a man might be a worthy poet , although unequal to the great Englishman . Hartley Coleridge , no mean judge , once read the Waterfowl to Matthew Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short poem in the English language . The mention of Hartley Coleridge suggests a comparison with Bryant . Of the two , perhaps Coleridge had the greater poetic sensibility . To him life appeared wrapped in his own fancy . He felt the " weight of unintelligible things , " and lie shrank under an acute consciousness that his native endowments were inadequate to cope with the unmanageable facts of the world . He sought refuge in Wordsworth , in poetry , in his own musings . Bryant had a strong character : he was perfectly competent to face the world , and to take from Fortune her buffets and rewards with equal thanks . He , too , turned for consolation to Wordsworth , to poetry , and to his own niusings . He , too , was of a meditative mind , tinged with religious thought . He , too , had poetic talents of a limited range . Neither had capacity for dramatic expression . If our only knowledge of men came from their poems , we should not know that blood ran red through human veins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Bryant . Neither Bryant nor Hartley Coleridge had the ability to write a long poem . Bryant is reported to have said , " There is no such thing as a long poem ; " his theory was that poems such as Paradise Lost and the Divine Comedy are strung upon a thread of verse which serves to hold the attention of the reader over the interpoetical spaces . Bryant did not have the gift of lyrical expression to as high a de .. gree as Hartley Coleridge . In fact he has left no songs , though he has given that name to one or two short poems . Neither poet seems to have had much sense of humor . Yet , with a certain similarity in their native gifts , there was such an immense difference between their characters that it is hard to think of them together . Both were meditative , moderate , high-minded men , given to contemplation , but the difference in their characters has rendered entirely unlike the matter in their verse . Bryant had repose , self - restraint , peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleridge was sick at heart , self-distrustful , appealing for help . It is a matter of temperament which of the two one prefers . One man likes Coleridge 's sonnets better , another Bryant 's poems . To a poet as a poet , except in so far as the lack may prevent achievement , character , in the usual meaning of the word , is not essential . But as mesm are made without nice heed of logical necessities , they set a value upon a man s poetry in accordance , in large measure , with his character . This habit they justify by saying that the most necessary element in poetry is sincerity ; that that poetry can not be sincere which is not after the pattern of a man 's character , and therefore , however delightful may be the sequence of words , the sway of rhythm , or the ring of rhyme , words not sincere are but tinkling cymbals and profit nothing . The juster method would seem to be to judge words by themselves ; they lie before us , open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrouded in doubt and uncertainty . Howbeit , it is certain that the high character of a poet is of great consequence to the people among whom he lives . It is a constant proof of the spiritual effect of lofty thoughts and of the truth of poetry . It strengthens our belief in refinement , in self-sacrifice , in nobility of action and of aims . It brings our hearts closer to our minds ; it shows the nearness of poetry and religion . All this Bryant has helped to do . His calm , self-contained , noble character shines in all his poetry , and he has well and faithfully given a bright example of a virtuous man . It is said that " of all their gifts to man No greater gift than self-sobriety The gods vouchsafe him in the race of life . " This gift they vouchsafed to Bryant , and the light of it shines in all his life . Much stress has been laid upon the ethical nature of Bryant 's poetry , and , as it seems to us , often in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man ; it is certain that he never wrote a verse that might not with propriety be read to virgins and to boys . These virtues , however , are not enough to give his poetry a high ethical character . Justly to deserve that reputation , poetry should be fit not only for young women and children , but for strong men . That which makes man larger , freer , more sensitive , more aspiring , more tender , quicker to seek whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are just and of good report , that is ethical . That poetry which stimulates our interest in men and women , which quickens our sympathies , which starts our tears and calls out our deepest feelings , is ethical . Byron , if he has broadened and deepened our comprehension of discontent , if he has awakened in us compassion , is an ethical poet . The greatest ethical poet is Shakespeare . No one has given us so noble a conception of humanity as he , or has made us so acquainted with grief or so intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure a poet 's work . Bryant is didactic ; he dwells upon the pleasure and innocence in nature , in contemplation , in the colors of flowers and the noise of falling waters . Many a man draws his noblest inspiration from these simple outputtings of nature which neither vex nor thwart him . They hinder not his will ; they yield to his mood ; they minister to his fancy ; they obey his thoughts , and tender a simple fellowship which he has not found elsewhere . This deliverance from temptation , this comfortable solitude , have caused men to believe that by withdrawing from the world they have ascended towards heaven . It is well to encourage and develop such a habit and such a disposition . Bi ! t contemplation is too narrow a school in which to study ethics . In this generation , when the metaphysical aspects of religion have a less firm foundation in the minds of men , morality is sought , not in communion with Deity , but in coming // closer to humanity , and in a world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not find among Bryant 's poems any which stir our sympathies with passion or with joy . After reading every poem he has written , the reader is not richer in any frcsh knowledge of mankind . He has learned no more of yearning , of despair , of all the doubts and perplexities that hedge us in . Bryant has told of quiet love , of gentle griefs , of sorrows subdued , of his own pleasure in meadows and brooks , in yellow violet and fringed gentian , in maple leaf and climbing vine ; he has told of the refreshment and succor in reverie and contemplation , in rest from the bustle of cities . This is well . This interests us , it encourages us , it helps us to lead simpler , nobler lives ; but are we not become better somewhat at the expense of freedom and generosity ? Are we not become Pharisees ? Do we not take the greater satisfaction that we are not as other men are , eager for vanities , greedy , self - seeking , selfproclaiming fools ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charity ? Bryant learned his own limitations , and put his talents to usury accordingly . In the simplicity of human feelings , the region of the greatest poetry , he found his most excellent expression , and he wrote Abraham Lincoln , The Flood of Years , and The Death of the Flowers . It is strange that , good citizen as Bryant was , good American as it is claimed that he was , he had no emotional sympathy with democracy . He lived his boyhood among Federalists , and early was taught disapproval , to use a moderate word , of Jefferson and the Republicans . After he had grown to maturity lie became a Democrat in national politics ; nevertheless , he never was a real Democrat in any genuine meaning of the word . The sense of emancipation , of room , of freedom , which at the time of his birth had affected men so much in Europe , did not stir his boyhood nor his manhood . Byron , " with haughty scorn that mocked the smart , " showed through Europe like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty ; Wordsworth was moved to " lyrical ballads . " Across the Channel , Victor Hugo and his disciples took up the cry of equality . On this side of the Atlantic , the ideas of deinocracy have not affected any of our poets , except Walt Whitman , in an emotional manner , unless we consider the abolition of slavery as an element of democracy . Longfellow , Whittier , Lowell , none of them breathed the hot breath of democracy . They were conservative , reasonable men , full of common sense and of respect for the past . Bryant embodied a very useful , profitable , and valiant aspect of democracy , of a kind most valuable to the stability of a nation , but not of a kind that a passionate lover of equality would acknowledge as democratic . Bryant was a believer in the individual responsibility of a man for his own soul . " Know thyself . " " Be true to thine own self . " " Look to thine own footsteps , and if thy straight path help another man to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty is for thyself and with thyself . " These were his mottoes . The limitations encompassing Bryant 's powers appear as soon as he departs from the narrow path of reverie in the meadows . Take The Ages as an example . This poem , he tells us , is meant , by means of history , to encourage the hopeful in their hopes that the world is better and happier than it was , and that it will be better and happier than it is . It touches various matters of history ; among others , the Roman Catholic Church . Here is one aspect of her condition prior to the Reformation - " Where pleasant was the spot for men to dwell , Amid its fair broad lands the abbey lay , Sheltering dark orgies that were shame to tell , And cowled and barefoot beggars swarmed the way , All in their convent weeds , of black , and white , and gray . " // The effect of the Reformation is thus described : - " From many a proud monastic pile , o'er-thrown , Fear-struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that for a thousand years had grown O'er prostrate Europe , in that day of dread Crumbled and fell , as fire dissolves the flaxen thread . " When the poet reaches the year of his poem , 1821 , he alludes to the United States and to Europe in these lines : - " Here the free spirit of mankind at length Throws its last fetters off ; and who shall place A limit to the giant 's unchained strength , Or curb his swiftness in the forward race Europe is given a prey to sterner fates , And writhes in shackles . " This is commonplace . It is poor in form , and narrow-minded in substance . We merely quote it as a sample of his work in matters not native to his cunning . The mechanical work of Bryant 's poetry is generally well done : the rhymes rhyme , the rhythm moves along , the blank verse does not halt . His language is good , yet it is not flexible enough for lyrical poetry . Perhaps it is not fanciful to trace the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in much of his work all through life . A correct , monotonous metre shows in many passages , where his inspiration is scant of breath . Bryant , however , rarely tries to do what he can not do fairly well . His fine self-sobriety taught him what to eschew . Sometimes his form is his misfortune , in that it recalls Campbell or Moore ; for a marked metre , of course , calls to memory the best poems in that metre , and the comparison suggested is not always fair . His blank verse is very good ; not majestic , but simplc and severe . It fails to impress us as the handiwork of a man who is confident in perfect mastery . There is none of the flush of victory that shows in Milton 's verse . Shakespeare 's lines move like Othello , simple , innocent , yet with a royal manner , and in the verse lurks the tremulous presence of passion . A man may write good blank verse , and yet deprecate such a comparison . But these are the poets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wordsworth 's blank verse is admirable , appropriate to the emotion , delicate and powerful , ebbing and swelling like far-off noises which rise and fall with the wind . Tennyson 's is most individual . It would be rash to compare Bryant 's verse with theirs . Blank verse is the metre in English most sensitive to the personality of the writer . There is no juster measure of a man . It can not be handled theatrically , it will not lend itself to tricks , it will be no man 's mask . In it the poet walks , great or small , heroic , human , or mean , according to the measure that nature has meted to him . Art can enable the poet to write blank verse , but it can not help him to hide himself in it . The greatest blank verse must be written by the greatest man . Take the form of a sonnet as the other extreme in poetical form , and it appears that greatness is almost out of place . Petrarch 's sonnets , as sonnets , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , they are better than Shakespeare 's . Craft , skill , long endeavor , patience , ingenuity , are all necessary to the construction of a sonnet . It is not so with blank verse : that is a glass house which none but the worthy must inhabit . Bryant 's blank verse is at its best in Thanatopsis . In his translation of Homer it struggles to produce the effect of the Greek hexameters , and it rejects this alien duty . In Sella it sometimes reads too much like prose , wherein the words are shifted out of deference to the beat of the verse . Simplicity is the most serviceable slave , but the worst master , and Bryant occasionally felt the weight of its yoke . His sonnets are very poor sonnets , feeble imitations of Wordsworth . Bryant is said to have had correct knowledge of metre , but he had not sufficient flexibility and delicacy , // not enough effeminacy of taste , we might say , to use that knowledge well and successfully . Bryant 's prose consists of his editorials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two volumes , entitled Letters of a Traveller , and of sundry discourses and orations . His style is simple , direct , and clear . It is almost too baldly simple . It has the shrewd situplicity of the prose of a Yankee storekeeper . It discloses a mind with almost childlike curiosity , which picks up the things immediately in front of it , and then , those dropped , reaches towards one new object after another . Some men are born to write of travels ; they establish a human relation with bridges , towers , cornpatches , chance passengers in the omnibus , and they can give on paper an interesting account of these intimacies . We are absorbed in their breakfasts , in their troubles with foreign coins , in their purchases of cologne or snuff . We read eagerly what they have to say of the Tower , of Salisbury Cathedral , of the Boulevard des Capucines , - of everything we may have seen fifty times and read about a hundred . Keats 's letters written on his trip in Scotland are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the short liaison between it and Keats . Bryant tells us facts , conscientiously and intelligently . He has one great merit : he tells what he sees , he describes it as it appears to his mind . There is no mixture of the opinions of art critics and amateurs ; there is the blunt delineation of the prospect as it was reflected on the retinas of Bryant 's eyes . He goes to Venice , " this most pleasing of the Italian cities which I had seen , " and there is no declamation . In Paris he passes the fountain of Moli*re in the Rue Richelien , " where the effigy of the comic author " stands , and there is no disquisition upon his genius , with a peroration pronouncing his inferiority to Shakespeare . He went to an exhibition at Turin . " The first thing I observed , on entering the lower galleries of the Valentino , was a long case of shelves filled with models of the different varieties of cultivated fruits , executed with such skill as fairly to deceive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told better . " He then describes them for half a page . These imitation peaches and plur*s interested him , and this interest is most agreeable compared with an assumption of aesthetic superiority to a waxen apple . Bryant 's chief attractiveness is in his modesty . It always is by him . He omits all gossip of famous men from his letters , he leaves out all special courtesies shown to him . This modesty is not tinged with affectation , but it is a union of native self-respect and early training . It makes us proud of our country to see how simply and worthily her true-born sons demean themselves . Bryant had the simple standard that a man is to be judged by his deserts , and by no false measures , which we , pleasing our fancy in the midst of history , ascribe to some old Romans , and know to be true of some of our own famous countrymen . Bryant acquired a familiarity with the German , French , Italian , Spanish and Portuguese languages ; he had a knowledge of Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not show any real affection for literature as literature . He makes no meiition of Goethe , none of Dante . He has no allusion to Victor Hugo . He scarce seems aware of Shelley , who was but two years his senior , or of Tennyson . In nothing he says is there enthusiasm for Shakespeare . He admired Dickens ; he enjoyed Sir Walter Scott , but he was driven so to do by his intelligence rather than by any emotional need . He wrote his poetry for the pleasure of self-expression , and not to exalt himself by joining the band of poets . Literature was of his " life a thing apart ; " whatever he may have said about his love of poetry , the fact remains that , even after he had acquired sufficient property for his needs , he did not devote himself to literature . // Born men of letters do not so . To him letters were an accomplishment . Br*rant 's indifference to literature , or perhaps it were better named the indolence of his attachment to letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . Our self-possessed young republic looked at letters with the eyes of the father in the old comedies : they were very well in their way , but not the sort of thing for serious men . Such views and their kith and kin were eminently useful in the formation of a young country . They enabled us to resist the attraction of an attempt to dazzle the world by a new conception of human relations , of new rights and duties , by a disrespect for property or passion for art . They gave us the cohesiveness of conservatism , the simplicity of measuring everything by its value in gold , and the safety of highroad traveling , which have enabled us to bear our national growth and expansion without breaking . But these noti9ns did not prepare the way for a ready* acceptance of new things , nor for nice *perception of the value of ideas , nor for aji appreciation of literature . Very likely they served us better than more intelligent and broader conceptions of life , and we must accept the advantages with their attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a poet and man of letters . Bryant had no fanatic leaven in him . He could never have walked to Rome barefoot , nor have sold all his goods to feed the poor . He accepted implicitly the teachings of common sense , and he found his refreshment in poetry and letters . He looked upon them as refined pleasures rather than as a means of grace or of satisfying spiritual needs . And being such a man , he stood well in need of an eager , emotional public to kindle him into enthusiasm and to quicken his poetic talents . After Mrs. Bryant died , in 1866 , Bryant betook himself for consolation to the Iliad and the Odyssey , which he completely translated before December , 1871 , at the age of seventy-seven . There are few things more touching than this comfort tenderly given by man to man across the gap of twenty-five hundred years . Nothing furnishes a more eloquent argument of the worth of poetry and of its profound humanity than this . The translation of Honier is a very personal matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human breast that burn only in front of its own Penates . Pope 's translation was a success , Cowper 's was a success ; so were Lord Derby 's and Mr. Bryant 's . Mr. Lang and his associates , also Professor Palmer , have made excellent traNslations . All these renderings are very different one from another , and doubtless owe their respective successes to the variety among readers . There is one class of people that has never read the Greek , another that has read and forgotten , a third and small class that compares the translation and the original ; and there are other persons still who condemn all translations of Homer without reading them . Bryant 's work is said to be faithful to the original ; but the stories of Ilium and of O4*sseus feel somewhat ill at ease in* English blank verse . The Greek spirit is so different from our spirit , the Greek language is so unlike our language , that almost all translators , and Bryant among them , must rest content with moderate praise .

Bryant died in 1878 . On May 29 he delivered an address in Central Park at the unveiling of a statue of Mazzini , and the effort exhausted him . He walked across the park to the house of a friend , and on the stoop suddenly fell . He lived until June 12 , on which day he died , in his eighty-fifth year , - leaving " all those things which should accompany old age , as honor , love , obedience , troops // of friends . " His body was buried at Roslyn* " There scattered oft , the earliest of the year , By hands unseen , are showers of violets found ; The redbreast loves to build and warble there , And little footsteps lightly print the ground .

" Mr. John Bigelow says , " Every one of his verses will bear the supreme test of a work of literary art , which discloses a wider horizon and more merit at each successive perusal . " We are not all alike . Thoughts and words come to us with different force and charm . Nothing brings to our minds more keenly how separate we are than the different welcome and harbor we give to poets .
