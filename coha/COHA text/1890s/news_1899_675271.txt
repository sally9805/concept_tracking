txt A reader of this newspaper asks us to publish an article entitled " Meat Not Necessary as . an Article of Foofi , " for the enlightenment of the people who are likely to suffer most from the advance in prices recently made by the butchers and retailers of meat . He argues that vegetarians can supply statistics to prove that many thousands of stalwart people throughout the world have never tasted meat , and that in athletic games victories are often won by vegetarians . His object is to induce his fellow-citizens to try to live without meat and bring the butchers to their senses , as he believes the prices now asked for meat are unjust . If we were able to accept the testimony of habitual vegetarians as to the superiority of their diet to that of other folks , we should advocate its general use solely for the good of humanity as a matter of duty , and not for the sake of hurting the meat trade . Unfortunately your confirmed vegetarian too closely resembles that young soldier of legend who fancied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except himself , and is both blind to reason and devoid of the sense of humor , so far as his hobby is concerned . We have known vegetarians whose opinion on every subject but meat was entitled to respect , but who were clearly little than monomaniacs on that subject . Vegetarianism is doubtless useful in certain forms of dyspepsia , though we are inclined to doubt that a certain panacea for all digestive ills can be secured in a diet limited to cereals , fruits , and vegetables . Even oatmeal , despised by the learned but gluttonous Dr. JOHNSON , but esteemed since his time a nutritious article of human diet in many other lands than Scotia , may become a bad friend to man through over-familiarity , and hives may ensue . Objections recently made to certain fruits and vegetables as food have some sort of reason to sustain them , as the acid of the strawberry , ( still esteemed as highly as it was in the days of that sage , Dr. BOTELER , whose fame rests on a single but unforgetable quotation in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while for others danger veritably lurks in the humble , versatile tomato and the fragrant pineapple . As a matter of fact , in the present condition of the human race , animal food is necessary , especially for the young and constitutionally weak . That the use of it is excessive in this community we are willing to believe , but the same thing is true of the staff of life . Some of our smaller bodily ills are directly due to the excessive use of wheaten flour . For men and women in middle life a moderate quantity of meat once a day , especially if it be red meat , beef , or mutton , or venison , is ' burely sufficient . It is likely , too , while a great advance has been made in this respect in comparatively recent years , that the multitude still has much to learn about the varieties of edible fish and methods of cooking them . A wise restriction in the use of butchers ' meat is certainly desirable . The Britons , since the dawn of their history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , . perhaps , slowwitted in consequence , but they have been conquerors . It would be folly to compare the ill-fed multitudes of Continental Europe with them . Black bread . onions , and sour wine may promote meekness and restrain hopeless ambition , but they do not inspire courage and endurance . As for the sentimental side of , the meat-eating question , which so frequently intrudes itself in discussions of vegetarianism , the arguments deduced from that are manifestly unanswerable , and doubtless in the millennium man will sustain life without devouring the lower animals . Meanwhile he will continue to need a fair share of porterhouse steaks and filet Chateaubriand , and to esteem the comforting broiler at its true value . While the prevailing high prices of meats are maintained , there will naturally be a decreased demand for them , but the market for the necessaries of life can not long be governed by speculators . That fact has been often proved . We have no idea that the present situation will long continue and we doubt if any appreciable suffering will result from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
