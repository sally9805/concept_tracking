txt SOME MEMORIES OF HAWTHORNE . I. HAWTHORNE 'S English Note-Books , as well as the elaborated papers that make up Our Old Home , disclose something of his daily life in England during his consulship ; but it was in the rapid , familiar letters of my mother to her family that his life was most freely narrated . I have preserved'these letters , and shall give extracts from them in the pages that follow , prefacing and interpolating a few girlish memories of my father and of the places in which I saw him , although they are trivial and meagre in incident . He died the day before my thirteenth birth- // day , and as my existence had begun at a time when his quiet life was invaded ( if we may use that term in connection with a welcome guest ) by fame , with its attendant activity in the outside world , my intercourse with him was both juvenile and brief . In England , he mingled more than ever before with the members of literary and fashionable society . I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be satisfied with a glance and a smile , which were so much less than he had been able to give to my brother and sister in their happier childhood days , for they had enjoyed hours of his companionship as a constant pastime . I was , moreover , much younger than the others , and was never allowed to grow , as I wished , out of the appellations of Rosebud , Baby , and Bab ( as my father always called me ) , and all the infantine thought which those pet names imply . I longed myself to hear the splendidly grotesque fairy tales , sprung from his delicious jollity of imagination , which Una and Julian had reveled in when our father had been at leisure in Lenox and Concord ; and the various frolics about which I received appetizing hints as I grew into girlhood made me seem to myself a stranger who had come too late . But a stranger at Hawthorne 's side could be very happy , and , whatever my losses , I knew myself to be rich . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most radiant . His face was sunny , his aspect that of shining elegance . There was the perpetual gleam of a glad smile on his mouth and in his eyes . His eyes were either a light gray or a violet blue , according to his mood . His hair was brown and waved loosely ( I take it very hard when people ask me if it was at all red ! ) , and his complexion was as clear and luminous as his mother 's , who was the most beautiful woman some people have ever seen . He was tall , and with as little superfluous flesh and as much sturdy vigor as a young athlete ; for his mode of life was always athletic , simple , and abstemious . He leaned his head a little to one side , often , in a position indicating alert rest , such as we find in many Greek statues , - so different from the straight , dogged pose of a Roman emperor . He was very apt to make an assent with an upward movement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sympathetic he was , indeed , and warm with the fire that never goes out in great natures . He had much dignity ; so much that persons in his own country sometimes thought him shy and reticent to the verge of morbidness . But it was merely the gentlemanliness of the man , who was jocund with no one but his intimate friends , and never fierce except with rascals , as I observed on one or two occasions . Those who thought him too silent were bores whom he desired not to attract . Those who thought him unphilosophical ( and some philosophers thought that ) were not artists , and could not analyze his work . Those who knew him for a man and a friend were manly and salubrious of soul themselves . Perhaps the testimony of old George Mullet , of Salem , who was often with my father in the Custom House , will serve as an example of the good-fellowship of a nature which could be so silent at will : - " Captain Stephen Burchmore was the Veteran Ship-Master ' spoken of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawthorne to laughter and admiration . ' The stories themselves were generally extravagant and grotesque ; it was the marvelous gift ' of narration that carried people away . I have known the company present to roar with laughter , and not one more convulsed than Mr. Hawthorne . . - For nearly four years I was brought into almost daily proximity to him , either officially or casually . His port , his placidity , his hours of abstraction , his mild , pleasant voice ( no sweeter ever uttered by mortal lips ) , are all readily recalled even now . " 174 February , // He was usually reserved , but he was ready for action all the time . His full , smooth lips , sensitive as a child 's , would tell a student of facial lines how vivid was his life , though absolutely under his cool command . He was a delightful companion even when little was said , because his eyes spoke with a sort of apprehension of your thought , so that you felt that your expression of face was a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of anticlimax . His companionship was exquisitely restful , since it was instinctively sympathetic . He did not need to exert himself to know you deeply , and he saw all the good in you there was to know ; and the weakness and the wrong of any heart he weighed as nicely in the balance of tender mercy as we could do in pity for ourselves . I always felt a great awe of him , a tremendous sense of his power . His large eyes , liquid with blue and white light and deep with dark shadows , told me even when I was very young that he was in some respects different from other people . He could be most tender in outward action , but he never threw such action away . He knew swine under the cleverest disguise . I speak of outward acts of tenderness . As for his spirit , it was always arousing mine , or any one 's , and acting towards one 's spiritual being invisibly and silently , but with gentle earnestness . He evinced by it either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approbation , or a sadly glanced , adverse comment that lashed one s inner consciousness with remorse . He was meditative , as all those are who care that the world is full of sorrow and sin , but cheerful , as those are who have the character and genius to see the finite beauty and perfection in the world , which are sent to the true-hearted as indications of heaven . He could be full of cheer , and at the same time never lose the solemnity of a perception of the Infinite , - that familiar fact which we , so many of us , have ceased to fear , but which the greatest men so remember and rever ence . He never became wholly merged in fun , however gay the games in which he joined with us children ; just as a man of refinement who has been in war never quite throws aside the dignity of the sorrow which he has seen . He might seem , at a superficial glance , to be the merriest of us all , but on second thoughts he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very evident to me that my father was as comfortable and happy as he cared to be . When he stood upon the hearth-rug , before the snapping , blushing English fire ( always poked into a blaze towards evening , as he was about to enter the parlor ) , - when he stood there with his hands clasped behind him , swaying from side to side in a way peculiar to him , and which recalled the many sea-swayed ancestors of his who had kept their feet on rolling decks , then he was a picture of benevolent pleasure . Perhaps , for this moment , the soldier from the battlefields of the soul ceased to remember scenes of cruelty and agony . He swayed from side to side , and raised himself on his toes , and creaked his slippered heels jocosely , and smiled upon me , and lost himself in agreeable musings . He was very courteous , entirely sincere , and quiet with fixed principles as a great machine with consistent movement . He treated children handsomely ; harshness was not in him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing would have seemed to him blasphemy . He stooped to my intelligence , and rejoiced it . We were usually a silent couple when off for a walk together , or when we met by chance in the household . I suppose that we were seeing which could outdo the other at " holding the tongue . " But still , our intercourse , as I remarked before , might be complete . I knew him very well indeed , - his power , his supremacy of honesty , his wealth of refinement . And he , I was fully aware , could see through me as easily as if I were a soul in one of his own books . // His aspect avoided , as did that of his art , which exactly reproduced his character , r anything like self-conscious picturesqueness . It is pleasant to have the object of our regard unconscious of himself . He had a way of ignoring , while observing automatically , all accessories , which reminded us that his soul was ever awake , and waiting to be made free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he frequently wore a soft brown felt hat and a brown talma of finest broadcloth , whose Greek - like folds and double-decked effect were artistic , but did not tempt him to pose or remember his material self . He was as forgetful of his appearance as an Irishman of the true quality , who may have heard something about his coat or his hair , but has let slip from his mind what it was , and cares not , so long as the song of his comrades is tender and the laughter generous . In some such downright way , I was convinced , my father regarded the beauty and stateliness which were his , and for which he had been praised all through his existence . He forgot himself in high aims , which are greater than things seen , no matter how fine soever . We made a very happy family group as we gladly followed and looked upon him when he took ship to start for the Liverpool Consulate ; and of this journey and the new experiences which ensued my mother writes to Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 7 , 1853 . M* DEAREST FATHER , - It is early morning . Wrapped in furs and blanket shawl , in the sun and close against the vast scarlet cylinder of scalding hot steam , I have seated myself to greet you from Halifax , where we shall arrive tonight . I was glad to leave the sight of you while you were talking with Mr. Fields , whose cheerful face ( and words , no doubt ) caused you to smile . I was so glad to leave you smiling happily . Then came the cannonade , which was very long . And why do you suppose it was so long ? Mr. Ticknor says that always they give a salute of two guns ; but that yesterday so many were thundered off because Mr. Hawthorne , the distinguished United States consul and author , was leaving the shore , and honoring her Majesty 's steamship with his presence . While they were stabbing me with their noise I was ignorant of this . Perhaps my wifely pride would have enabled me to bear it better if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my husband . After this we were quiet enough , for we were moving magically over a sea like a vast pearl , almost white with peace . I never saw anything so fair and lovely as the whole aspect of the mighty ocean . Off on the horlEon a celestial blue seemed to meet the sky . Julian sat absorbed . He did not turn his head , but gaEed and gaEed on this , to him , new and wondrous picture . Seeing a point of land running out , he said , " That , I suppose , is the end of America ! I do not think America reaches very far ! " I managed to change his beaver and plume for his great straw Fayal hat , but he would not turn his head for it . It was excessively hot . An awning was spread at the stern , and then it was very comfortable . I heard that the British minister was on board , and I searched round to find him out . I decided upon a fine-looking elderly gentleman who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hawthorne and said the minister wished to make his acquaintance ; and behold , here was my minister , a stately , handsome person , with an air noble and of great simplicity and charm of manner . Mr. Hawthorne introduced me , but I had no conversation then . Later , I had a very delightful interview . . . . Near by stood a gentleman whom I supposed his attach6 ; and with him I had a very long and interesting conversation . We had a nice talk about art and Rome , and America and // England , and architecture . I do not yet know his name , but only that his brother was joint executor with Sir Robert Peel on the estate of Hadley , the artist . This unknown told me that the minister was an exquisite amateur artist , and his portfolio was full of the finest sketches . This accounted for the serene expression of his eyes , that rest contemplatively upon all objects . Mr. Silsbee looks so thin and pale that I fear for him ; but I will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hawthorne have the seats of honor , on either hand of the captain . He is a very remarkable man . The minister told me that he sailed with him five years ago , when the captain was very young , and he was then astonished at his skill and power of command ; that the captains of these great English steamers are picked men , trained in the navy , and eminent for ability and accomplishment , and that Captain Leitch is remarkable among the best . It was good to see his assured military air , as he walked back and forth while we moved out of the beautiful harbor . He made motions with his hand with such an air of majesty and conscious power . His smile is charming , and his voice fine . The enunciation of Mr. Crampton , the minister , is also wonderfully fine . Mr. Crampton says that these steamers have run for seventeen years , and that not one accident has happened , and not a man been lost , except that once a steamer was lost in a fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Una enjoys herself very much , and reads the Tanglewood Tales , and walks and races on the upper deck with Julian , this fine cold morning . It is glorious , glorious , - this blue surrounding sea , and no land . Your affectionate daughter , SoPHIA . WATERLOO HOUSE , LIvERPOoL , July 17 , 1853 , Sunday Morning . Here we are , dear father , in England ; and I can not realize it , because a mo ment ago we were in Boston Harbor , and how can I be three thousand miles afar ? If we had had more difficulty , storms , and danger , I could realize it better ; but it seems like a pleasure excursion on a lake . I sit in a parlor , with one great , broad window from ceiling to floor , a casement opening upon a balcony , which commands a handsome street . It does not look like Boston , and , Mr. Hawthorne says , not like New York , but - like Liverpool . People are going to church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every gentleman has an umbrella under his arm , for it is bright sunshine one moment , and a merry little shower the next . I spoke in my note from Halifax of Mr. Crampton , and a gentleman whom I thought his attachS . Mr. Crampton we lost at Halifax , but the supposed attach6 remained ; and I was glad , for he was the most interesting person in the steamer . We in vain tried to discover his name , but at last found it to be Field Talfourd , brother of Sir Thomas Talfourd , author of Ion . I had very charming conversations with him . He was a perfect gentleman , with an ease of manner so fascinating and rare , showing high breeding , and a voice rich and fulL Whenever he spoke , his words came out clear from the surrounding babble and all the noise of the ship , so that I could always tell where he was . He is one of the primitive men , in contradistinction to the derivative ( as Sarah Clarke once divided people ) . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the passengers were trying feats of skill and physical prowess to pass the time , I saw Mr. Talfourd exhibit marvelous power as a gymnast in performing a feat which no one else would even attempt . His education was all-sided , body and mind , apparently ; and , with all , this charm of gentlemanliness , - not very often met with in America . It seems to require more leisure and a deeper culture than we // Americans have yet , to produce such a lovely flower . 19th July . We all have colds now , except Mr. Hawthorne , with whom earth 's maladies have nothing to do . Julian and Una are homesick for broad fields and hilltops . Julian , in this narrow , high room , is very much like an eagle crowded into a canary-bird 's cage ! They shall go to Prince 's Park as soon as I can find the way ; and there they will see water and green grass and trees . They think of the dear Wayside with despair . As soon as possible we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Crittendon , called . Mr. Hawthorne likes him much . 21st July . An Oxford graduate , who went to see Mr. Hawthorne in Concord , called to see him , and brought his father , a fine-looking gentleman . Their name is Bright . Mary Herne thought the son was Eustace Bright himself ! To-day the father came to invite us all out to West Derby to tea on Saturday , and the son is coming for us . There the children will see swans and gardens and green grass , and they are in raptures . Young Henry Bright is a very enthusiastic young gentleman , full of life and emotion ; and he very politely brought me from his gardens a radiant bouquet of flowers , among which the heliotrope and moss-. roses and all other roses and mignonette make delicious fragrance . Yesterday Miss Lynch sent me a bunch of mossrose buds , - nine ! Just think of seeing together nine moss-rose buds ! Henry Bright brought the Westminster Review to Mr. Hawthorne , and said he should bring him all the new books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town London , and Mr. Hawthorne and I went back with her to the Adelphi , and walked on to see a very magnificent stone building , called St. George 's Hall . It is not quite finished ; and as far as the mist would allow me to see , it was sumptuous . . . . We have strawberries as large as small peaches , one being quite a feast , and fine raspberries . The head of the Waterloo House , Mr. Lynn , is a venerable-looking person , resembling one 's idea of an ancient duke , - dressing with elaborate elegance , and with the finest ruffled bosoms . Out of peculiar respect to the Consul of the United States , he comes in at the serving of the soup , and holds each plate while I pour the soup , and then , with great state , presents it to the waiter to place before each person . After this ceremony he retires with a respectful obeisance . This homage diverts Mr. Hawthorne so much that I am afraid he will smile some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Hawthorne calls our Methodist preacher . The service is absolutely perfect . Your affectionate child , SOPHIA . The Brights , especially Henry Bright , appear frequently in the Note-Books , and their names occur very often in my mother 's letters . The young Oxford graduate I remember most distinctly . He was thin , and so tall that he waved like a reed , and so shining-eyed that his eyes seemed like icebergs ; they were very prominent . His nose was one of your English masterpieces , - a mountainous range of aristocratic formation ; and his far-sweeping eyebrows of delicate brown , his red , red lips and white doglike teeth , and his deeply cleft British chin were a source of fathomless study . In England a man can be extraordinarily ordinary and material ; but the men of culture are , as a rule , remarkably forcible in unique arid deep-cut characteristics , both of face and of mind , with a prevailing freedom from self-analysis - except privately , no doubt . Henry Bright and my father would sit on opposite sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosty gaze directed unmeltingly at the sunny glow of the coals as he talked , his slender long fingers propping up his charming head ( over which // his delicately brown hair fell in closegliding waves ) as he leaned on the arm of his easy - chair . Sometimes he held a book of Tennyson 's poetry to his nearsighted , prominent eyes , as closely as two materials could remain and not blend into one . He recited The Brook in a fine fury of appreciation , and with a sure movement that suggested well the down-tumbling of the frolicking element , with its undercurrent of sympathizing pathos , the life-blood of the stream . " For men may come , and men may go , but I go on for ever ! " rang in my empty little head for years , and summed up , as I guessed , all of Egyptian wisdom and spiritual perpetuity in a single suggestive fact . Mr. Bright had a way of laughing that I could never cease to enjoy , even in the faint echo of retrospect . It always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nose . He laughed often , at his own and my father 's remarks , and at the close of the tumbling diction of The Brook ; and he therefore frequently snorted in this sweeping-of-the-wind fashion . I listened , spellbound . He also very gently and breezily expressed his touched sensibility , after some recitation of his of rare lines from other poems , but in the same odd manner . My father stirred this beloved friend with judicious , thought-developing opposition of opinion concerning all sorts of polite subjects , but principally , when I overheard , concerning the respective worth of writers . The small volume of Tennyson which Mr. Bright held in his two hands caressingly , with that Anglo-literary filliping of the leaves which is so great a compliment to any book , contained for him a large share of Great Britain 's greatness . His brave heart beat for Tennyson ; I think my father 's did not , though his head applauded . My mother , for her part , was entranced by the goldsmith 's work of the noble poet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , - perfections within the pale of convention and fashion and romantic beauty which make lovely Tennyson 's baronial domain . Henry Bright wrote verses , too ; and he was beginning to be successful in a cer.tain profound interest which customarily absorbs young men of genuine feeling who are not yet married ; and therefore it was worth while to stir the young lover up , and hear what lie could say for The Princess and The Lord of Burleigh . My mother , in a letter written six months after we had reached England , and when he was established as a household friend , draws a graphic picture of his lively personality : - ROCK PARK , December 8 , 1853. - We had a charming visit from Henry Bright a fortnight ago . He stayed all night , and he talks - I was going to say , like a storm ; but it is more like a breeze , for he is very gentle . He is extremely interesting , sincere , earnest , independent , warm and generous hearted ; not at all dogmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is highly cultivated , and writes for the Westminster . - . . Eustace Bright , as described in the Wonder-Book , is so much like him in certain things that it is really curious : " Slender , pale , yet of a healthy aspect , and as light and active as if he had wings to his shoes . " He is also nearsighted , though he does not wear spectacles . His eyes are large , bright , and prominent , rather , indicating great facility of language , which he has . He is an Oxford scholar , and has decided literary tastes . He is delicately strung , and is as transparent-minded and pure-hearted as a child , with great enthusiasm and earnestness of character ; and though a Liberal , very loyal to his Queen and very admiring of the aristocracy . This comes partly by blood , as his mother has noble blood in her veins from various directions , even the Percys and Stanleys , and is therefore a native aristocrat . He enjoyed his visit to America extremely , and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Channing their patron saint . I like to talk with him : he can really converse . He goes to the Consulate a good deal , for he evidently loves Mr. Hawthorne dearly . I wish my husband could always have visitors so agreeable . The other day a woman went to him about a case in Chancery . Mr. Hawthorne thought she was crazy ; and I believe all people are who have a suit in Chancery . A few weeks after the date of the last letter , a visit was paid to the Brights at their family home , and my mother thus writes of it : - ROCK PARK , February 16 , 1854 . I returned yesterday from a visit to Sandhays , the domain of Mr. Bright . Mr. Bright has been urging all winter that we should go and dine and stay all night , and I have refused , till last week Mrs. Bright wrote a cordial note and invited Mr. Hawthorne and Una and me to go and meet Mr. and Mrs. James Martineau , and stay two nights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I did not like to leave Jahan and baby so long . Mr. Hawthorne , however , intended to stay but , one night , and the next morning would come home and see Julian and Rose , and take Juhan to spend the day at the Consulate with him ; and we left King , that excellent butler , in the house . It was really safe enough ; only , you know , mothers have , perhaps , unfounded alarms . We took a carriage at the Pier-head ( Una and I ) , and drove to the Consulate , where we took up Mr. Hawthorne and Mr. Henry Bright .... We arrived at about six o'clock , and Una and I had to dress for dinner after our arrival . It was a party of twelve . . . . Mrs. H. is a fashionable lady , who resides in London in season , and out of season at Norris Green . She was dressed in crimson velvet , with pearls and diamonds , and her neck and arms were very fair and pretty . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostolic dignity about him . But the full dress of gentlemen now requiring a white muslin cravat and tie , they all looked ministerial to me , except the United States Consul , who will hold on to black satin , let the etiquette be what it may . He does not choose to do as the Romans do while in Rome . At least , he is not yet broken in . I suppose it is useless for me to say that he was by far the handsomest person present , and might have been taken for the king of them all . The chandelier that poured floods of light down on the heads beneath was very becoming to him ; for the more light there is , the better he looks always . The dinner was exceedingly elegant , and the service as beautiful as silver , finest porcelain , and crystal could make it . And one of the attendants , the coachman , diverted me very much by the air with which he carried off his black satin breeches , white silk long hose , scarlet vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with silver . Not the autocrat of all the Russias feels grander than these livery servants . The butler , who is really above the livery servants in position , looked meek in his black suit and white vest and cravat , though he had a right to look down on the varlet in smallclothes . This last , however , was much the most imposing in figure , and fair round red cheeks , and splendid shining black hair . Dear me , what is man ! At the sound of a bell , when the dessert was put upon the table , the children came in . They never dine with mamma and papa , . . - and all troop in at dessert , looking so pretty , in full dress , - thin white muslin or tulle , with short sleeves and low necks , and long streaming sashes . I found the next day that it was just the same when there was no great party at dinner . Little S. looked funny in his white vest and muslin cravat , - like a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weaving // golden threads into our talk . Ellen Martineau played Mendelssohn 's Songs without Words . Mrs. H. laid regular siege to Mr. Hawthorne , resolved to tease him into consent to go to her ball . Just imagine him in the clutches of a lady of fashion ! But he always behaves so superbly under the most trying circumstances that I was exceedingly proud of him while I pitied him . . . . Finally she could not tell whether he would accept or not , and said she would leave the matter to me , with confidence that I would prevail . . . . Just after luncheon on Tuesday , Mrs. Bright 's brother came to tell her that the Great Britain had come , and she would not believe it , because her husband had not telegraphed her about it , . . . that largest ship in the world , belonging to Mr. Bright . It had come back from Australia . This family is very charming . Mrs. Bright is the lady of ladies ; her children are all clever ( in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . They are all good as well as clever ; well educated , accomplished , and most entirely united . It is all peace and love and happiness there , and I can not discover where the shadow is , - health , wealth , cultivation , and all the Christian graces and virtues . I can not see the trail of the serpent anywhere in that Paradise . . . . Mrs. Bright and I had some nice little talks . She told me elaborately how she admired and loved Mr. Hawthorne 's books ; how she had found expressed in them what she had found nowhere else ; with what rapture one of her sisters read , re-read , and read again the WonderBook ; . . . how Mrs. H. thought him peerless , and so on . There is not the least extravagance about Mrs. Bright , but remarkable sobriety ; and so what she said had double force . Your loving child , SOPHIA . The pride which my mother took in my father , and which appears in all her accounts of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father for a portrait of herself : - " I never dreamed of putting myself into a picture , because I am not handsome enough . . . . But I will endeavor that you have Mr. Hawthorne and Rosebud , some time or other . Mr. Hawthorne looks supremely handsome here ; handsomer than anybody I see . Every other face looks coarse , compared ; and his air and bearing are far superior to those of any Englishman I have seen . The English say that they should suppose he were an Englishman - till he speaks . This is a high compliment from the English . They look at him as much as they can , covertly ; as much as they can without being uncivil and staring as if they wanted to assure themselves that he really were so wondrous handsome . He does not observe this ; but it is nuts to me , and I observe it . The lofty , sumptuous apartments become him very much . I always thought he was born for a palace , and he shows that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these letters in order to bring together the scattered references to the Bright family . I now take up the narrative in my mother 's letters . A few weeks after our arrival in Liverpool , the confinement of city life led to a removal across the Mersey to Rock Ferry . " We have at last found a house , " my mother writes to her father , " which we shall take for a year , at least . It is a great stone house , fashioned in castellated style , with grounds in perfect order , and surrounded by thick hedges . The rent first asked was ? 200 ; but they will take ? 160 . It made a great deal of difference when the lady found it was the United States Consul who wanted the house , instead of Mr. Nobody , so much influence has any rank and title in dear old England . As for Mr. Hawthorne , the author , the lady did not seem to know about him . My husband wishes to escape from too constant invitations // to dinner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good excuse for refusing , when there is really no reason or rhyme in accepting ; for the last steamer leaves Liverpool at ten in the evening . And I shall have a fair cause for keeping out of all company I do not very much covet . I have no particular fancy for Liverpool society , except the Rathbones and Brights . Mr. Hawthorne was obliged , the other day , to bury an American captain who died at his boardinghouse . My husband paid for his funeral out of his private purse ; though I believe he expects some brother captains will subscribe a part of the amount . Mr. Hawthorne was the whole funeral , and in one of those plumed carriages he followed the friendless captain . I am not very brisk . My husband is always well . " ROCK PARK , Sept. 29 , 1853 . I wish you could be undeceived about the income of this Consulate . Mr. Hawthorne now knows actually everything about it . . . . He goes from us at nine , and we do not see him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pelted within an inch of our lives with a hailstorm of sovereigns , so as to satisfy every one 's most gorgeous hopes ; but I am afraid we shall have but a gentle shower , after all . . . . I am sorry I have had the expectation of so much , because I am rather disappointed to be so circumscribed . With my husband 's present constant devotion to the duties of his office , he could no more write a syllable than he could build a cathedral . He never writes by candle-light . . . . Mr. Crittendon tells Mr. Hawthorne that he thinks he may save five thousand dollars a year by economy . He himself , living in a very quiet manner , not going into society , has spent four thousand dollars a year . He thinks we must spend more . People will not let Mr. Hawthorne alone , as they have Mr. Crittendon , because they feel as if they had a right to him , and he can not well forego their claim . The Scarlet Letter seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . . . . It will give you pleasure , I think , to hear that Mr. Cecil read a volume of The Scarlet Letter the other day which was one of the thirty-fifth thousand of one publisher . Is it not provoking that the author should not have even one penny a volume ? .. . He is perpetually at the Consulate , and attends to everything from ten to half past four . It is a terrible loss to us , as you may conceive . His time is much frittered by visits . His own office is within the clerk 's office , and they do not let any one disturb him that they can help , but visits of ceremony they can not prevent . . . . The head clerk is highly delighted when he is the bearer of a good heap of gold . He delivers to Mr. Hawthorne in the morning the receipts of the day before , and the old man 's face shines with a ruddy benevolence when he lays down a good day 's income . I have been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great white stone building , a very unlovely part of the town . The Consul 's sanctum is a gloomy room with two windows . Nothing worth looking at can be seen out of it , and there is nothing worth seeing inside of it , except my husband , and that gentleman Mr. Hawthorne can not see . So I think he can not enjoy himself much there . In the middle of the day he walks out , and sees strange sights in Liverpool . Sept. 30th . I was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Hawthorne and Mr. Ticknor from Chester . They had a fine excursion , and were so occupied in examining Old Chester that no time was left for Eaton Hall . Julian is quite well today , and has been parading round the garden this morning , blowing a trumpet which papa brought him from Chester , and dragging after him a portentous wooden cannon which would not help to gain the smallest battle . It is actually a sunny day ! . .. A very great joy // it is to Rosebud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up crumbs . They excite a peculiar love . They have great faith in man , and come close to the window without fear . They have told the linnets and thrushes of our hospitality , and the linnets actually come , though with dread and trembling , and they carry off the largest crumbs for their families and neighbors . The English robin is very dear . Mr. Ticknor has been to see Dc Quincey , and says he is a noble old man and eloquent , and wins hearts in personal intercourse . His three daughters , Margaret , Florence , and Emily , are also very attractive and cultivated , and they are all most impatient to see my husband . ... From London an American traveler writes to Mr. Hawthorne , " A great day I spent with Sir William Hamilton , and two blessed evenings with De Quincey and his daughters . In De Quincey 's house yours is the only portrait . They spoke of you with the greatest enthusiasm , and I was loved for even having seen you . Sir William Hamilton has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seven Gables is more powerful in description than The Scarlet Letter . " Did I tell you once of an English lady who went to the Consulate to see Mr. Hawthorne , and introduced herself as a literary sister ? She had never been in Liverpool before , and desired him to show her the lions , and he actually escorted her about : An American lady who knows this Englishwoman sent , the other day , a bit of a note , torn off , to my husband , and on this scrap the English lady says , " I admire Mr. Hawthorne as a man and as an author more than any other human being . " I have diligently taken cold these four months , and now have a hard cougb . It is very noisy and wearying . Mr. Hawthorne does not mind fog , chill , or rain . He has no colds , feels perfectly well , and is the only Phcnbus that shines in England . I told you in my last of Lord IDufferin 's urgent invitation to him to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours from Liverpool . Mr. Hawthorne declined , and then came another note . The first was quite formal , but this begins , " My dear Mr. Hawthorne , Mrs. Norton his aunt , the Honorable Mrs. Norton hopes ... that you will ab low her to have the pleasure of receiving you at her house in Chesterfield Street ; and I trust you will always remember that I shall esteem it an honor to be allowed to receive you here whenever you may be disposed to pay this country a visit . Believe me , my dear Mr. Hawthorne , yours very truly , DUFFEJSIN . " Now have I not given you a fine feast of homage ? " Flummery , " my husband calls it . December 8th . Yesterday , who should come to see me but Mr. James Martineau the brother of Harriet Martineau and his wife . I have the greatest admiration for him as a divine , and I do not know what I expected to see in the outward man . But I was well pleased with his aspect as I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , though not thin , with the most perfectly simple manners and beautiful expression . It seemed as if he had always been my brother ; as if I could find in him counselor , friend , saint , and sage ; and I have no doubt it is so , so potent is the aroma of character , without a word or sign . How worse than folly it is to imagine that character can either be cried up or cried down ! No veil can conceal , no blazonry exalt , either the good or the evil . A man has only to come in and sit down , and there he is , for better , for worse . I , at least , am always , as it were , hit by a person 's sphere ; and either the music of the spheres or the contrary supervenes , and sometimes , also , nothing at all , if there is not much strength of character . Mr. Martineau did not say much ; but his voice was very pleasant and sympathetic , and he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martineau sat with her back to the only dini light there was , and I could receive no impression from her face ; but she seemed pleasant and friendly . She said she wished very much that we would go to her party on the 19th , which was their silver-wedding day . She said we should meet Mrs. Gaskell - the author of Mary Barton , Ruth , and Cranford - and several other friends . It is the greatest pity that we can not go ; but it would be madness to think of going out at night , in these solid fogs , with my cough . They live beyond Liverpool , in Prince 's Park . Mrs. Martineau showed herself perfectly well bred by not being importunate . It was a delightful call ; and I feel as if I had friends in deed and in need , just from that one interview . Mr. Martineau said Una would be homesick until she had some friends of her own age , and that he had a daughter , a little older , who might do for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came pretty near it , for they could not have got out of the lodge gate before he came home ! Was not that a shame ? January 5 , 1854 . Perhaps you have heard of Miss Charlotte Cushman , the actress ? The summer before we left America , she sent a note to Mr. Hawthorne , requesting him to sit to a lady for his miniature , which she wished to take to England . Mr. Hawthorne could not refuse , though you can imagine his repugnance on every account . He went and did penance , and was then introduced to Miss Cushman . He liked her for a very sensible person , with perfectly simple manners . The other day he met her in Liverpool , and she told him she had been intending to call on me ever since she had been at her sister 's , at Rose Hill Hall , Woolton , seven miles from Liverpool . Mr. Hawthorne wished me to invite her to dine and pass the night . I invited her to dine on the 29th of December . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her famous character , Meg Merrilies , with a face of peculiar , square form , most amiable in expression , and so very untheatrical in manner and bearing that I should never suspect her to be an actress . She has left the stage now two years , and retires upon the fortune she has made ; for she was a very great favorite on the English stage , and retired in the height of her fame . The children liked her prodigiously , and Rose was never weary of the treasures attached to her watchchain . I could not recount to you the gems clustered there , such as a fairy tiny gold palette , with all the colors arranged ; a tiny easel with a colored landscape quarter of an inch wide ; a tragic and comic mask , just big enough for a gnome ; a cross of the Legion of Honor ; a wallet , opening with a spring , and disclosing compartments just of a size for the keeper of the privy purse of the fairy queen ; a dagger for a pygmy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small pea , in a gold case ; an opera-glass ; faith , hope , and charity , represented by a golden heart and anchor - and I forget what - a little harp . I can not remember any more . These were all , I think , memorials of friends . Marcb 12 , 1854 . Mr. Hawthorne dined at Aigbarth , one of the suburbs of Liverpool , with Mr. Bramley Moore , an M. P. Mr. Moore took an effectual way to secure Mr. *Iawthorne , for he went one day himself to his office , and asked him for the very same evening ; thus bearding the lion in his den and clutching him . And Mrs. II . would not be discouraged . She could not get Mr. Hawthorne to go to her splendid fancy ball , to meet Lord and Lady Sefton and all the aristocracy of the county , . . . but wrote him a note , telling him that if he wished for her forgiveness he must agree with me upon a day when we would go and dine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote me a note , appointing the // 16th of March for us to go and meet the Martineaus and Brights , and remain all night . There was no evading this ; so he is going , but I refused . Her husband is a mighty banker , and she is sister of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer , W. E. Gladstone ; and they are nobly connected all round . . . . Mr. Hawthorne does not want to go , and especially curses the hour when white muslin cravats became the sine q ? ics non of a gentleman 's full dress . Just think how reverend he must look ! I believe he would even rather wear a sword and cocked hat ; for he declares a white muslin cravat the last abomination , the chief enormity of fashion , and that all the natural feelings of a man cry out against it , and that it is alike abhorrent to taste and to sentiment . To all this I reply that he looks a great deal handsomer with white about his throat than with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me looks like the stocks , and that it is habit only which makes him prefer it . . Miaroh 16th . My dear father , Mr. Hawthorne has gone to West Derby to dine . . . and stay all night . He left me with a powerful anathema against all dinner-parties , declaring he did not believe anybody liked them , and therefore they were a malicious invention for destroying human comfort . Mr. Bramley Moore again seized Mr. Hawthorne in the Consulate , the other day , and dragged him to Aigbarth to dine with Mr. Warren , the author of Ten Thousand a Year and The Diary of a Physician . Mr. Hawthorne liked him very well . Mr. Warren commenced to say something very complimentary to Mr. Hawthorne in a low tone , across an intermediate gentleman , when Mr. Bramley Moore requested that the company might have the benefit of it . So Mr. Warren spoke aloud ; and then Mr. Hawthorne had to make a speech in re-turn ! Hospitality was abundant in our first English home , as many letters affirm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glitter of little dinnerparties was as surprising to me as if I could have had a real consciousness of its contrast to all the former simplicity of my parents ' life . Down the damask trooped the splendid silver covers , entrancingly catching a hundred reflections from candle - flame and cut glass , and my own face as I hovered for a moment upon the scene while the butler was gliding hither and thither to complete his artistic arrangements . On my father 's side of the family there had been a distinct trait of material elegance , appearing in such evidences as an exquisite tea-service , brought from China by my grandfather , with the intricate monogram and dainty shapes and decoration of a hundred years ago ; and in a few chairs and tables* that could not be surpassed for graceful design and finish ; and so on . As for my mother 's traits of inborn refinement , they were marked enough , but she writes of herself to her sister at this time , " You can not think how I can not be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . " Her opinion of herself was always humble ; and I can testify to the distinguished figure she made as she wore the first ball-dress I ever detected her in . I was supposed to be fast asleep , and she had come to look at me before going out to some social function , as she has told me she never failed to do when leaving the house for a party . Her superb brocade , pale-tinted , low-necked and short-sleeved , her happy , airy manner , her glowing though pale face , her dancing eyes , her ever-hovering smile of perfect kindness , all flashed upon me in the sudden light as I roused myself . I insisted upon gazing and admiring , yet I ended by indignantly weeping to find that my gentle little mother could be so splendid and wear so triumphant an expression . " She is frightened at my fine gown ! " my mother exclaimed , with a changed // look of self-forgetting concern ; and I never forgot how much more beautiful her noble glance was than her triumphant one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor of it , from Salem days , in which it is recorded that for the year 1841 she ordered ten pairs of number two kid slippers , - which was not precisely economical for a young lady who needed to earn money by painting , and who denied herself a multitude of pleasures and comforts which were enjoyed by relatives and friends . In our early experience of English society my mother 's suppressed fondness for the superb burst into fruition , and the remnants of such indulgence have turned up among severest humdrum for many years ; but soon she re fused to permit herself even momentary extravagances . To those who will remember duty hosts of duties appeal , and it was not long before my father and mother began to save for their children 's future the money which flowed in . Miss Cushman 's vagary of an amusing watch-chain was exactly the sort of thing which they never imitated ; they smiled at it as the saucy tyranny , over a great character , of great wealth . My father 's rigid economy was perhaps more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , " I never knew what charity meant till I knew my husband . " There are many records of his having heard clearly the teaching that home duties are not so necessary or loving as duty towards the homeless .
