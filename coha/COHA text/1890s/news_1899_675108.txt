txt The President and Cabinet were much surprised to-day by the receipt of the following dispat'hh from Admiral Dewey : ? Manila , Feb. 24 . For political reasons the Oregon should be sent here at once . DEWEY . Another message from the Admiral was also received . It was as follows : Manila , Feb. 24 . Yorktown arrived ; Charleston and Petrel cruising around the Philippine Islands . Affairs more quiet : DEWEY . The Oregon is expected by the Navy Department to arrive at Manila about March 10 , and Gen. Otis within a week will have about 2,500 men as reinforcements . Among the officials here no one knew , or , at least , would admit that he knew , the nature of the political reasons which the Admiral says demand the immediate presence of the battleship Oregon . The cablegram was taken to the Cabinet Board and fully discussed there . The conclusion reached by the Cabinet was that too much importance should not be attached to it ; that Dewey wants the big ship to influence the Filipinos through fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reference to political reasons in the dispatch , said : " I am sure that it has no international significance , you may state positively . Probably he wants a fine ship there , as the American Commissioners are about due , and it will give weight to the American representations . " It is . suggested from other naval sources that Dewey wants the Oregon to release a number of the smaller ships of the fleet for other . work .

It is also necessary to establish a close blockade to prevent the insurgent ? from receiving . supplies . These projects require for their execution a number of ships . Dewey can not spare them at present , but when the Oregon gets into Manila Harbor . she , will be sufficiently formidable to insure the protection of the entire harbor in conjunction with the two big double-turreted monitors Monterey and.Monadnock . The remainder of the feet then will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships are lying in Manila Bay there is no fear that any force can enter or pass out without their consent . But there is an underlying doubt in the minds of some officials whether the Admiral may not be keenly sighting a gathering cloud in the East , and is looking to the prevention of any possible intervention or interference by European powers in the struggle now in progress in the neighborhood of Manila . It is believed that in the big fires much property of foreign residents and business concerns was destroyed . That these fires were caused by the insurgents can not be denied , and it may be that some of the foreign naval commanders in the East are disposed to seize upon the pretext that their interests demand protection which we can not afford them to making a landing or d4 somathing obnoxious to the United States and likely to encourage the insurgents . With such a strong naval force as would be afforded by the reinforcements of Dewey 's fleet by the Oregon , there could not be any sound reason , nor even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of third parties . It is said here that up to this moment there has been no intimation of a purpose on the part of any foreign Government to file any claims for pecuniary remuneration for the property of their citizens destroyed in the fires or fighting at either Manila or Iloilo . Just what disposition would be made of any such claims is not indicated here , thcugh there is ground for the belief that if it can be shown that our military and naval officers practiced the precautions required by international law in the matter of giving due notice to foreigners of any action in the way of bombardment that might injure their property , and otherwise did everything that could be done to protect the foreign interests equally-with our own , then there is little foundation for a sound claim for damages . The Oregon arrived at Honolulu on the 5th instant , according to a telegraphic report that came to the Navy Department this morning . No mention was-made of her being in need of repairs , as is stated in the press dispatches . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honolulu a week before the acindia and the Iris , which started out with her from San Francisco . The two tenders were supposed to attend the Oregon , to help her out with a tow in case she ran short of coal , or was otherwise in distress . Probably one of the boats broke down , and the other was left to take her in tow while the Oregon pushed on to Honolulu . Assuming that the battleship really needed ten days ' repairs , she should have started away from Honolulu on her long run - to Manila on the 15th inst . There is no way in which the Navy Department coital hurry her movements , if disposed to do so on Admiral Dewey 's request , owing to the lack of a cable from San Francisco , so there is nothing to be done save to let the ' ship plow along at her usual rate of speed . It is figured at the Navy Department that she must find seine place en route to Manila , such as Guam , for instance , to coal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry her clear across the 4,000 miles from Honolulu to the Philippines . Allowing for detention on account of coaling , it is estimated that the Oregon will reach Manila about the 10th of March . - Meanwhile the War Department . officials were agreeably surprised this morning to learn that Gen. Otis , at Manila , had re  --  ceived the first of his reinforcements nearly six days before they were expected . They came on the Scandia. which bore half of the Twentieth Infantry . She sailed ' from San Francisco Jan. 26 , in company with the Morgan City , which has aboard the remaining half of the Twentieth Infantry , , and ; ; as both ships were at Honolulu at the same time the Morgan City- also will be reported at Manila within twenty-four bours , uniess - she , has , been detained , which is not expected : The , transports Ohio and Senator with the Twenty-second Infantry aboard sailed from San Francisco only five days later , - than the Scandia , so that within a. week Otis will have 2,500 fresh men to relieve those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
