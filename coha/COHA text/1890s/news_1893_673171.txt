txt John B. Riley , the first lieutenant of Smith M. Weed in Clinton County and a strong Cleveland man , was removed from his position as Chief Examiner of the Civil Service Commission this afternoon . Every one concerned in the business except Mr. Riley . from Gov . Flower to the Commissioners , has been " explaining " the cause in sophistry that is amusing to those who know the inside facts . When the commission was reorganized early in January , Mr. Riley tendered his resignation . to Goy . Plower , who assured him that no disposition existed to disturb him . Last Friday Gov . Flower gave Mr. Riley notice ; to-day the axe fell . Thomas Carmody of Gates County suecoeds Mr. Riley . In the language of one of Senator Murphy 's earnest followers in this county , Mr. Riley was removed because " he was not with ue , that 's all . " And yet the Civil Service Commissioners and the Governor delusively explain that Mr. Riley is supplanted by a Cleveland Democrat . Yates County is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bitter contests between the Cleveland and Hill factions , in which the former , under the leadership of Michael Leary , has invariably routed the Hill men , who were commanded by Calvin J. Mason . former member of Assembly , now Deputy State Controller . In all those disturbances Leary 's most active lieutenant has been Thomas Carmody . Experience has shown that in a fair fight and no favor Leary 's generalship was invariably successful , and that in the order of events he would bring to the next State Convention a solid anti-machine delegation . Only one resource was left to the MaChine , to cripple him by capturing his ( thief lieutenant . To that end Riley was sacrificed and Carmody dropped into a soft **28;27;TOOLONG billet , In the expectation that his sense of obligation will drive him from his old allies to the benefit of the machine . The new Civil Service Commission met this afternoon and organized by electing E. . Prentiss Bailey of the Utica ooserver President , in place of A. C. Resume , removed . Short work was made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bailey issued the following state-ment : " Thera have been sensational statements in some of the newspapers regarding the selection of Mr. Carmody . No factional significance can justly be attached to the change . The change in the odic ? of Chief Examiner is made upon the Governor 's judgment anti wish , and he has given his reasons to the commission . They are not at all factional reasons . If it is said that Mr. Riley in a Cleveland man , nothing to lost , for Mr. Carmody is a Cleveland man , too . He is a lawyer , eloquent on the stump , very popular in his region of the State . and has made a good impression on the Commissioners . I caused an inquiry to be made regarding him the other day . and this was written of him by a wellknown Yates County Democrat : ' Ho is well qualified for the position , and the proposed appointment meets with the hearty approval of everybody , including men of all shades of political opinion . Ho has been and now is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with use in all our Contests hero . ' " " Ono way of stating the case . " Mr. Bailey added , " is that Gov . Flower has appointed a new Civil Service Commission in place of Coy . Hill 's board , and that change includes the Chief Examiner , who was also an appointee under Gov . Hill when Gen. Daniel E. Sickles hold the position to which I was ( Aerated to-day . "
