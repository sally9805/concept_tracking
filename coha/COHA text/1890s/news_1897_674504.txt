txt The retirement of a Federal officer who has contributed to the personal comfort and business convenience of the people of a great city in so notable a degree as Postmaster DAYTON is a matter of public moment . The supreme test of the efficiency of a Post Office is that it shall do its work with the unerring precision and regularity of a perfect piece of machinery , so that those who are served by it have no occasion to take thought about it from one week 's end to another . That test Mr. DAYTON has successfully met . The complaints of error and miscarriage that have come to our attention during his term of office have been wonderfully few ; and newspapers not only do a large Post Office business themselves , but are in the way of hearing from a multitude of other persons who use the Post Office and get heated and communicative about any fault in its operations . Mr. DAYTON leaves the office with the reputation of having attended strictly to business during his incumbency . The Post Office has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigns , but the community he has served so well would gladly have him stay . He has not had at all times the support he should have had from the department at Washington . It is the customary policy to make pinching and niggardly allowances to the Post Office that has by far the greatest earning power of all the Post Offices in the country . But he has borne his privations with patience and has made insufficient appropriations go far . We bespeak for Postmaster VAN COTT more generous treatment from headquarters , and can assure him of the general hope that he may find and give much satisfaction in the performance of duties with which he is already familiar .
