txt We publish in full this morning a letter of Mr. Dawn B. HILL to the State Press Association on the amazing Ellsworth bill , which we strongly commend to the attention of all our readers . They need not fear its length It is interesting from start to finish , and even if the subject were of less importance would repay reading as an example of acute analysis and destructive criticism . In one sense this very effective letter may be taken as political . RICHARD CHOICER has approved the bill unqualifiedly ; Mr. HILL denounces it , and fully justifies his denunciation . His letter is , therefore , the first open movement on the part of Mr. HILL in antagonism to Mr. CHOKER . Clearly , it does not make for that " harmony " which the triumphant leaders of Tammany have proclaimed as the logical result of their victory and the appearance of their chief in the field of State politics . But this is a matter of slight and passing importance compared to the very grave issues presented by the bill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing may be accepted ? as ' absolutely established . The bad motive of the bill is shown by the fact that for any of the good purposes which its advocates pretend to seek it is wholly unnecessary and also futile . What , then , are they after when they enact into law provisions that violate every principle of the Constitution intended to guard the liberty of the press , the personal liberty of citizens , and the rights of property ? What are they after when they provide for.indictment , conviction , ' Imprisonment , and fine for offenses so vuue that they can neither be proved nor disproved , and yet of such a nature that prejudiced jurors can readily be found to give a verdict of guilty ? It is not libel that they wish to punish . That can be done now . It ' is not mere indecency . The law amply covers that . They'say that they seek to protect public morals . Heaven knows there is need of that , and that demoralization is in fact a profitable trade , vigorously carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the general offense of these papers can not be made a crime in Jaw without requiring clear proof of specific acts capable of clear definition and actually defined either by the statute or by judicial interpretation . Otherwise , the remedy is infinitely worse than the evil , because these limitations are necessary to the protection of individual rights . Any one who wishes to know how inevitable are corruption , oppression , and cruelty where courts can punish vaguely defined general offenses , should read the history of the tribunals of the French Revolution . Practically every victim of the Conciergenie prison and the guillotine was convicted of " incivisme , " or lack of patriotism , under a code on which the Ellsworth bill is substantially modeled . The plain and simple truth in regard to the Ellsworth bill is that it is intended to give , and does give , to the politicians who have devised it outrageous means for persecution and blackmail . It is conceived in malignity and brought forth in corruption , and bad as are the journals whose course is made a pretext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse
