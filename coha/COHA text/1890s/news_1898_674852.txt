txt That was a characteristic explosion of Senator MORGAN 'S over the citation by Senator WHITE of a letter from the Japanese Minister correcting the misapprehensions of the Foreign Committee of the Senate . Senator MonGAN is himself , as we have had occasion to note to our sorrow , and may have occasion to note to our cost , an ornament of the committee in question , and in resenting the protest of the Japanese Minister , he had the air of speaking to a question of personal privilege . In his character of Hawaiian boomer , Senator Mortonw is quite aware how desirable it is to represent that if we do not take the islands somebody else will . It is true that for two generations we have strenuously insisted that no other power should possess them , and have let it be known that annexation or the establishment of a protectorate by any other power would be resented and resisted by us . It is also true that every power which could be supposed to be concerned has solemnly disclaimed any such intention . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlist public opinion in favor of the job by representing England as coveting the islands and lying in wait to annex them . But this appeal was shorn of an its force by the unfeeling representative of the Britisn Government in the House of Commons . He cruelly declared that Great Britain recognized the paramount interest of the United States In Hawaii and would acquiesce in any disposition which the United States saw fit to make . There was then nothing better to do than to accuse Japan of a like intention . The only interest that Japan ever showed in the matter was . to represent that n0 change in the ownership or Government of the islands should be allowed to affect the rights under existing treaties of Japanese resident there . This very proper caveat was worked by the boomers for very much more than it was worth . They accused Japan of an intention to acquire the islands , and even suggested that , the laborers that the Japanese Government showed such an interest in were soldiers smuggled in in the disguise of coolies , and biding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , overwhelm alike the Kanakas and the sons of missionaries , and seize the Government . The imputation of a Japanese intention to seize : the islands was made in the report of the Committee of Foreign Affairs . It was entirely unwarranted and highly uncivil , and the Japanese Minister , in behalf of his Government , strenuously disclaimed it . It is this disclaimer which Senator MORGAN calls " a very serious and very outrageous assault upon the rights and privileges of the Senate . " The heat of Senator ** seems uncalled for . The intentions of the Japanese Government are perhaps the only subject on earth upon which that Government can Speak with more authority than the Senator from Alabama , but upon that he must admit that they have at least superior sources of information to his Own . When the Japanese Minister repels , we are sure with more politeness than the Committee on Foreign Affairs used in making it , the imputation that his Government desires to acquire Hawaii , he seems quite within his rights , and he has not been guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt Senator MORGAN id pained by the prompt exposure of the misrepresentation , but the " outrageous " part in the performance is not that taken by the Japanese Minister .
