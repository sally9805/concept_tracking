txt The tremendous speed of the little Welsh wheelman , MICHAEL , lends some confirmation to the theory that the combination of light weight and a strong pair of legs ought to produce a fast rider . MICHAEL weighs 100 pounds , and his leg muscles are like steel . He rides easily , but his great speed is made easier by his trick of riding close Up to the quartet that " paces " him . A big machine with four riders necessarily overcomes the resistance of the air , and riding at their heels the little racer has something like a vacuum in front of him and air in swift , eddying , and favorable motion on both sides . His thirty miles in 59 minutes and 44 seconds is good railroad speed ; while his feat of making thirty-two miles , every one of which was ridden in less than two minutes , leaves the trotting horse forever outclassed . The dynamics of high speed with the wheel are only just coming within the comprehension of the racing cyclists , as is proved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two weeks ago GARDNER rode a mile in 1:39 2-5at Philadelphia . MCDUFEE , at the Charles River track Aug. 14 , made the mile in 1:38 1-5 , which was the world 's record until the 19th , when PLATT  --  BETTS rode a mile in 1:37 3-5 at the Crystal Palace track , London . Already the bicycle mile record is within a trifle over two seconds of Salvator 's running mile in 1:351A . That record will surely be beaten , probably before the present season is over . It will then be a demonstrated possibility for man to transport himself by his own power faster than the swiftest horse can carry him .
