THE CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS-THE END OF REBELLION-LINCOLN 'S FAME . BY JOHN G. NICOLAY AND JOHN HAY , PRIVATE SECRETARIES TO THE PRESIDENT . THE CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS . Jefferson Davis and the remnant of the Confederate Cabinet , with the most important and portable portion of their department archives , left Richmond on the night of April 2 , in consequence of Lee 's retreat , they proceeded to Danville , southwest of Richmond , arriving there the following morning . In a conference between Davis and Lee , in which the probability of abandoning Richmond was discussed , they had agreed upon this point at which to endeavor to unite the armies of Lee and Johnston , first to attack and beat Sherman and then return and defeat Grant . We have related how Grant , so far from permitting Lee to execute the proposed junction , did not even allow him to reach Danville . Lee had been pressed so hard that he had not found opportunity to inform Davis where he was going , and this absence of news probably served to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to reach fulfillment . Nevertheless , the rebel President made a show of confidence ; rooms were obtained , and , he says , the " different departments resumed their routine labors , " though it may be doubted whether in these labors they earned the compensation which the Confederate States promised them . Two days after his arrival at Danville , Jefferson Davis added one more to his many rhetorical efforts to " fire the Southern heart . " On the 5th he issued a proclamation , in which , after reciting the late disasters in as hopeful a strain as possible , he broke again into his neverfailing grandiloquence : maintain your cause with my whole heart and soul ; that I will never consent to abandon to the enemy one foot of the soil of any of the States of the Confederacy ; that Virginia- noble State , whose ancient renown has been eclipsed by her still more glorious recent history ; whose bosom has been bared to receive the main shock of this war ; whose sons and daughters have exhibited heroism so sublime as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the help of the people and by the bless , ing of Providence , shall be held and defended , and no peace ever be made with the infamous invaders of her territory . If , by the stress of numbers , we shall be compelled to a temporary withdrawal from her limits or those of any other border State , we will return until the baffled and exhausted enemy shall abandon in despair his endless and impossible task of making slaves of a people resolved to be free.2 In his book , written many years after , Davis is frank enough to admit that this language in the light of subsequent events may fairly be said to have been oversanguine . He probably very soon reached this conviction , for almost before the ink was dry on his proclamation , a son of Governor Wise , escaping through the Federal lines on a swift horse , brought him information of the surrender of Lee 's army to Grant . Rumor also reaching him that the Federal cavalry was pushing southward west of Danville , the Confederate Gover*sment again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Greensboro ' , North Carolina . Its reception at this place was cold and foreboding . The headquarters of the Government remained on the train at the depot . Only Jefferson Davis and Secretary Trenholm , who was ill , were provided with lodgings . From this point Davis sent a despatch to General Johnston , soliciting a conference , either at Greensboro ' or at the general 's headquarters ; and in response to this request Johnston came without delay to Greensboro ' , arriving there on the morning of April i 2 . Within an hour or two both Generals Johnston and Beauregard were summoned to meet the Confederate President in a council of war , We have now entered upon a new phase of the struggle . Relieved from the necessity of guarding particular points , our army will be free to move from point to point , to strike the enemy in detail far from his base . Let us but will it and we are free . Animated by that confidence in your spirit and fortitude which never yet failed me , I announce to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Copyright by J. G. Nicolay and John Hay , i886 . All rights reserved . // there being also present the members of the rebel Cabinet , namely : Benjamin , Secretary of State ; Mallory , Secretary of the Navy , and Reagan , Postmaster-General . The meeting was held in a room some twelve by sixteen feet in size , on the second floor of a small dwelling , and contained a bed , a few chairs , and a table with writing-materials.1 The infatuation under which Davis had plunged his section into rebellion against the Government , pitting the South with its disparity of numbers2 and resources against the North , still beset him in the hour of her collapse and the agony of her surrender . He had figured out how the united armies of Lee and Johnston could successively demolish Sherman and Grant , but he could not grasp the logic of common sense that by the same rule the united armies of Grant and Sherman would make short work of the army of Johnston alone whenever they could reach it . The spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best inferred from the description of it written by the two principal actors themselves . Davis says : I did not think we should despair . We still had effective armies in the field , and a vast extent of rich and productive territory both east and west of the Mississippi , whose citizens had evinced no disposition to surrender . Ample supplies had been collected in the railroad depots , and much still remained to be placed at our disposal when needed by the army in North Carolina . . . . My motive , therefore , in holding an interview with the senior generals of the army in North Carolina was not to learn their opinion as to what might be done by negotiation with the United States Government , but to derive from them information in regard to the army under their command , and what it was feasible and advisable to do as a military problem.5 Johnston 's statement shows still more distinctly how impossible it was for Davis to *ay aside the airs of dictator : We had supposed we were to be questioned concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of continuing or terminating the war . But the President 's object seemed to be to give , not to obtain , information ; for , addressing the party , he said that in two or three weeks he would have a large army in the field by bringing back into the ranks those who had abandoned them in less desperate circumstances , and by calling out the enrolled men whom the conscript bureau with its forces had been unable to bring into the army . . . . Neither opinions nor information was asked , and the conference terminated.4 1 Frank H. Aifriend , " Life of Jefferson Davis , " p. 623. 2 " Dividing their free population between the two sections , and the odds were six and a half millions against twenty and a half millions . " Ibid. , p. 573. 3 Davis , " Rise and Fall of the Confederate Govern . ment , " Vol . II. , pp. 679 , 68o . Pollard , the Southern historian , is probably not far wrong in saying that this was an interview of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauregard were those who had experienced most of the prejudice and injustice of the President ; he had always felt aversion for them , and it would have been an almost impossible excess of Christian magnanimity if they had not returned something of resentment and coldness to the man who , they believed , had arrogantly domineered over them and more than once sought their ruin.5 Now when Davis , without even the preface of asking their opinions , bade these two men resuscitate his military and political power and transform him from a fugitive to a commander-in-chief , it is not to be wondered at that the interview terminated without result . Matters were thus left in an awkward situation for all parties : the rebel chief had no promise of confidence or support ; the generals no authority to negotiate or surrender ; the Cabinet no excuse to intervene by advice or protest to either party . This condition was , however , opportunely relieved by the arrival during the afternoon of the Secretary of War , Breckinridge , who was the first to bring them the official and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , of which they had hitherto been informed only by rumor , and which they had of course hoped to the last moment might prove unfounded . The fresh news naturally opened up another discussion and review of the emergency between the various individuals , and seems at length to have brought them to a frank avowal of their real feelings to each other in private . Johnston and Beauregard , holding military counsel together , " agreed in the opinion that the Southern Confederacy was overthrown . " 6 This opinion Johnston also repeated to Breckinridge and Mallory , both of whom , it would seem , entertained the same view . The absence of anything like full confidence and cordial intimacy between Davis and his advisers is shown by the fact that these two members of his Cabinet were unwilling to tell their chief the truth which both recognized , and urged upon General Johnston the duty of making the unwelcome suggestion " that negotiations to end the war should be commenced . " Breckinridge promised to bring about an opportunity ; and it was evidently upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet and his generals.7 There is a conflict of statement as to when it 4 Johnston , " Narrative of Military Operations , " pp. 396 , 397. 5 Pollard , " Life of Jefferson Davis , with a Secret History of the Confederacy , " p. 514. 6 Johnston , " Narrative of Military Operations , " p. 397. 7 Ibid. , p. 398. // took place . Both Davis and Mallory in their accounts group together all the incidents as if they occurred at a single meeting , which Mallory places on the evening of the i 2th , while Johnston 's account mentions the two separate meetings , the first on the morning of the i 2th , and the second on the morning of the i 3th ; there being , however , substantial agreement between all as to the points discussed . Of this occasion , so full of historical interest , we fortunately have the records of two of the participants . General Johnston writes : Being desired by the President to do it , we compared the military forces of the two parties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry and artillery , and 5000 mounted troops ; those of the United States , three armies that could be combined against ours , which was insignificant compared with either Grant 's of i8o , ooo men , Sherman 's of 110,000 at least , and Canby 's of 6o , ooo-odds of 1 7 or 8 to i , which in a few weeks could be more than doubled . I represented that under such circumstances it would be the greatest of human crimes for us to attempt to continue the war ; for , having neither money nor credit , nor arms but those in the hands of our soldiers , nor ammunition but that in their cartridge-boxes , nor shops for repairing arms or fixing ammunition , the effect of our keeping the field would be , not to harm the enemy , but to complete the devastation of our country and ruin of its people . I therefore urged that the President should exercise at once the only function of government still in his possession , and open negotiations for peace . The members of the Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions on the important question . General Breckinridge , Mr. Mallory , and Mr. Reagan thought that the war was decided against us , and that it was absolutely necessary to make peace . Mr. Benjamin expressed the contrary opinion . The latter made a speech for war much like that of Sempronius in Addison 's play.l Secretary Mallory 's account is even more full of realistic vi.vidness . He represents Davis , after introducing the dreaded topic by several irrelevant subjects of conversation , and coming finally to " the situation of the country , " as saying : " Of course we all feel the magnitude of the moment . Our late disasters are terrible , but I do not think we should regard them as fatal . I think we can whip the enemy yet , if our people will turn out . We must look at matters calmly , however , and see what is left for us to do . Whatever can be done must be done at once . We have not a day to lose . " A pause ensued , General Johnston not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presi-. dent said , " We should like to hear your views , General Johnston . " Upon this the general , without preface or introduction ,  --  his words translating the expression which his face had worn since he entered 1 Johnston , " Narrative of Military Operations , " pp. 398 , 399. 2 Aifriend , " Life of Jefferson Davis , " pp. 623-625. the room ,  --  said , in his terse , concise , demonstrative way , as if seeking to condense thoughts that were crowding for utterance : " My views are , sir , that our people are tired of the war , feel themselves whipped , and will not fight . Our country is overrun , its military resources greatly diminished , while the enemy 's military power and resources were never greater , and may be increased to any desired extent . We can not place another large army in the field ; and cut off as we are from foreign intercourse , I do not see how we could maintain it in fighting condition if we had it . My men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my artillery teams to aid their escape to their homes . Since Lee 's defeat they regard the war as at an end . If I march out of North Carolina , her people will leave my ranks . It will be the same as I proceed south through South Carolina and Georgia , and I shall expect to retain no man beyond the by-road or cow-path that leads to his house . My small force is melting away like snow before the sun , and I am hopeless of recruiting it . We may perhaps obtain terms which we ought to accept . " The tone and manner , almost spiteful , in which the general jerked out these brief , decisive sentences , pausing at every paragraph , left no doubt as to his own convictions . When he ceased speaking , whatever was thought of his statements - and their importance was fully understood - they elicited neither comment nor inquiry . The President , who during their delivery had sat with his eyes fixed upon a scrap of paper which he was folding and refolding abstractedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , broke the silence by saying , in a low , even tone , " What do you say , General Beauregard ? " " I concur in all General Johnston has said , " he replied . Another silence , more eloquent of the full appreciation of the condition of the country than words could have been , succeeded , during which the President 's manner was unchanged.2 Davis 's optimism had taken an obstinate form , and even after these irrefutable arguments and stern decisions he remained unconvinced . He writes that he " never expected a Confederate army to surrender while it was able either to fight or to retreat " ; 3 but sustained only by the sophomoric eloquence of Mr. Benjamin , he had no alternative . He inquired of Johnston how terms were to be obtained ; to which the latter answered , by negotiation between military commanders , proposing that he should be allowed to open such negotiations with Sherman . To this Davis consented , and upon Johnston 's suggestion Secretary Mallory took up a pen and at Davis 's dictation wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the results of which have been related . The council . of war over , General Johnston returned to his army to begin negotiations with Sherman . On the following day , April 14 , Davis and his party , without waiting to 3 Davis , " Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , " p. 682. 4 Alfriend , " Life of Jefferson Davis , " p. 625. // hear the result , left Greensboro ' to continue their journey southward.1 The dignity and resources of the Confederate Government were rapidly shrinking ; railroad travel had ceased on account of burned bridges , and it could no longer even maintain the state enjoyed in its car at Greensboro ' . We are not informed what became of the archives ; its personnel - President , Cabinet , and sundry staff officers - scraped together a lot of miscellaneous transportation , composed of riding horses , ambulances , and other vehicles , which , over roads rendered almost impassable by mud , made their progress to the last degree vexatious and toilsome . The country was so full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time an admitted custom and privilege . We have the statement of Davis 's private secretary that eight or ten young Mississippians , one of them an officer , who volunteered to become the rebel President 's bodyguard , equipped themselves by " pressing " the horses of neighboring farmers , rendering necessary a premature and somewhat sudden departure in advance of the official party.2 Obtaining shelter by night when they could , and camping at other times , the distinguished fugitives made their way to Charlotte , North Carolina , where they arrived on the i8th of April . Since the Confederate Government had considerable establishments at Charlotte , orders were despatched to the quartermaster to prepare accommodations ; and this request was reasonably satisfied for all the members of the party except its chief . The quartermaster met them near the town and explained that , though quarters could be furnished for the rest of us , he had as yet been able to find only one person willing to receive Mr. Davis , saying the people generally were afraid that whoever entertained him would have his house burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood threats to that effect had been made everywhere by Stoneman s cavalry . There seemed to be nothing to do but to go to the one domicile offered . It was on the main street of the town , and was occupied by Mr. Bates , a man said to be of Northern birth , a bachelor of convivial habits , the local agent of the Southern Express Company , apparently living alone with his negro servants , and keeping asort of " open house , " where a broad , well-equipped sideboard was the most conspicuous feature of the situation-not at all a seemly place for Mr. Davis.a Mr. Davis was perforce obliged to accept this entertainment ; and whether he failed to realize the significance of such treatment or whether he was moved by his suppressed in- 1 Burton N. Harrison in THE CENTURy , November , 1883 , pp. 134 ' 137. 2 Ibid. , p. 133. 3 Ibid. , p. 136. 4 Ibid. dignation to a defiant self-assertion , when a detachment of rebel cavalry passing along the street saluted him with cheers and called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , he " expressed his own determination not to despair of the Confederacy , but to remain with the last organized band upholding the flag . " * And this feeling he again emphasized during his stay in Charlotte by a remark to his private secretary , " I can not feel like a beaten man . " The stay at Charlotte was prolonged , evidently to wait for news from Johnston 's army . No information came till April 23 , when Breckinridge , Secretary of War , arrived , bringing the memorandum agreement made by Sherman and Johnston on the *8th.5 The memorandum seems to have been discussed at a Cabinet meeting held on the morning of the 24th , and Mr. Davis yielded to the advice they all gave him to accept and ratify the agreement . He wrote a letter to that effect , 6 but almost immediately received further information , which Sherman communicated to Johnston , that the Washington authorities had rejected the terms and agreement , and directed Sherman to continue his military operations , and that Sherman had given notice to terminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the assassination of President Lincoln , which the party had received on their arrival in Charlotte , stimulated the hopes of the rebel President , and he sent back instructions to Johnston to disband his infantry and retreat southward with so much of his cavalry and light artillery as he could bring away . Against the daily evidence of his own observation and the steady current of advice from his followers , he was still dreaming of some romantic or miraculous renewal of his chances and fortunes . And in his book , written fifteen years afterward , he makes no attempt to conceal his displeasure that General Johnston refused to obey his desperate and futile orders . The armistice expired on the 26th , and the fugitive Confederate Government once more took up its southward flight . At starting , the party still made show of holding together . There were the President , most of the members of the Cabinet , several staff officers , and fragments of six cavalry brigades , counting about two thousand , which had escaped in small parties from Johnston 's surrender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still talk of the expedition turning westward and making its way across the Mississippi to join Kirby Smith and Magruder . But the 5 " Southern Historical Papers , " Vol . XII. , pp. 100 102 // meager accounts plainly indicate that Davis* s advisers fed his hope for politeness ' sake , or to furnish the only pastime with which it was possible to relieve the tedium of their journey ; for as they proceeded the expedition melted away as if by enchantment . Davis directed his course towards Abbeville , South Carolina . Mr. Mallory records that though they had met no enemy , At Abbeville the fragments of disorganized cavalry commands , which had thus far performed , in some respects , an escort 's duty , were found to be reduced to a handful of men , anxious only to reach their homes as early as practicable , and whose services could not further be relied on . . . . Almost every cross-road witnessed the separation of comrades in arms , who had long shared the perils and privations of aterrific struggle , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens.1 The members of the Cabinet , except Reagan , also soon dropped off on various pretexts . Benjamin decided to pursue another route , Breckinridge remained behind with the cavalry at the crossing of the Savannah River and never caught up . At Washington , Georgia , a little farther on , Mallory halted " to attend to the needs of his family . " Davis waited a whole day at Washington , and finding that neither troops nor leaders appeared , the actual situation seems at last to have dawned upon him . " I spoke to Captain *Campbell of Kentucky , commanding my escort , " he writes , " explained to him the condition of affairs , and telling him that his company was not strong enough to fight , and too large to pass without observation , asked him to inquire if there were ten men who would volunteer* to go with me without question wherever I should choose .

After passing Washington , in Georgia , rumors of pursuit by Federal cavalry increased , and a more ominous rumor gained circulation that a gang of disbanded Confederates was preparing to plunder the train under the idea that it carried a portion of the official treasure . Apprehension of this latter danger induced the Confederate President to hurry forward and overtake his family , and during three days he traveled in their company . It seems to have been a dismal journey ; the roads were bad , heavy storms 1 Aifriend , " Life of Jefferson Davis , " p. 630. 2 Davis , " Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , " Vol . II. , p. 695. were prevailing , signs of danger and prospects of capture were continually increasing , and they were sometimes compelled to start at midnight and push on through driving rain to make good their concealed flight . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to camp and rest in the pine woods by a small stream in the neighborhood of Irwinville , Irwin County , near the middle of southern Georgia . Here the situation was discussed , and it became clear that any hope of reaching the trans-Mississippi country was visionary . The determination was finally arrived at to proceed to the east coast of Florida , and by means of a small sailing vessel , stated to be in readiness , endeavor to gain the Texas coast by sea . It was also agreed that Davis should at once leave his family and push ahead with a few companions . Davis explains that he and his special party did not start ahead at nightfall , as had been arranged , because a rumor reached him that the expected marauding party would probably attack the camp that night , and that he delayed his departure for the protection of the women and children , still intending , however , to start during the night . With this view , his own and other horses remained saddled and ready . But the camp was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deep slumber until dawn of May io , when by a complete surprise a troop of Federal cavalry suddenly captured the whole party and camp . There is naturally some variance in the accounts of the incident , but the differences are in the shades of coloring rather than in the essential facts . Two expeditions had been sent from Macon by General James H. Wilson in pursuit of Jefferson Davis and his party - the one to scour the left , the other the right bank of the Ocmulgee River ; one , under Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Harnden , commanding the ist Wisconsin Cavalry , starting on the 6th , and the other , under Lieutenant-Colonel B. D. Pritchard , commanding the 4th Michigan Cavalry , starting on the 7th of May . Following different routes , these two officers met at the village of Abbeville , Georgia , in the afternoon of May 9 , where they compared notes and decided to continue the pursuit by different roads . As the chase grew hot , smaller detachments from each party spurred on , learned the location of the slumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at daylight , but remained unconscious of each other 's proximity . The fugitives ' camp was in the dense pine woods a mile and a half north of Irwinville . Pritchard had reached this village after midnight , obtained information about the camp , and procured a negro boy to guide him to it . // Approaching to within half a mile , he halted , both to wait for daylight and to send his lieutenant , Purinton , with twenty-five dismounted men to gain the rear of the camp , but cautioning him that a part of Harnden 's command would in all probability approach from that direction , and that he must avoid a conflict with them . ( See also pages *86 and 595 . ) At daybreak writes Captain Lawton of Pritchard 's force the order was passed in a whisper to make ready to enter the camp . The men were alive to the work . Mounting their horses , the column moved at a walk until the tents came in sight , and then , at the word , dashed in . The camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the left hand , as we entered , were wagons , horses , tents , and men on the right were two wall-tents , fronting from the road . All was quiet in the camp . We encountered no guards ; if there were any out , they must have been asleep.l Just at this instant , however , firing was heard back of the camp , where Purinton had been sent . This created instant confusion , and Pritchard with most of his force rushed forward through the camp to resist a supposed Confederate attack . It turned out that , despite the precautions taken , the detachment of Pritchard 's men under Purintori ( the 4th Michigan ) had met a detachment of Harnden 's men ( the ist Wisconsin ) , and in the darkness they had mistaken and fired on each other , causing two deaths and wounding a number . The rush of the cavalry and the firing of course aroused the sleepers , and as they emerged from their tents there was a moment of confusion during which only one or two Federal soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis 's horse , 2 which had stood saddled since the previous evening , and which a colored servant had just brought to 1 G. W. Lawton in " The Atlantic , " September , 1865 , p. 344. 2 Ibid. 3 Davis , " Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , " pp. 701 , 702 . It is but just to give the following narrative of Captain G. XV . Lawton of the 4th Michigan Cavalry . It was printed in " The Atlantic Monthly " for September , 1865 , and the reader may profitably compare it with Jefferson Davis 's own narrative which is quoted in the text . " Andrew Bee , a private of Company L , went to the entrance of Davis 's tent , and was met by Mrs. Davis , bareheaded and barefoot , ' as he describes her , who , putting her hand on his arm , said : " Please do n't go in there till my daughter gets herself dressed . ' " Andrew thereupon drew hack , and in a few minutes a young lady ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with age , wearing a lady 's waterproof , ' gathered at the waist , with a shawl drawn over the head , and c , arrying a tin pail , appear , and ask to go to the run ' for water . Mrs. Davis also appears , and says : " For God 's sake , let my old mother go to get some water ! " No obiections being made , they passed out . But his tent . Of what ensued , we give Mr. Davis 's own account : I stepped out of my wife 's tent and saw some horsemen , whom I immediately recognized as cavalry , deploying around the encampment . I turned back and told my wife these were not the expected marauders , but regular troopers . She implored me to leave her at once . I hesitated , from unwillingness to do so , and lost a few precious moments before yielding to her importunity . My horse and arms were near the road on which I expected to leave , and down which the cavalry approached ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to start in the opposite direction . As it was quite dark in the tent , I picked up what was supposed to be my " raglan , " a waterproof light overcoat , without sleeves ; it was subsequently found to be my wife 's , so very like my own as to be mistaken for it ; as I started , my wife thoughtfully threw over my head and shoulders a shawl . I had gone perhaps fifteen or twenty yards when a trooper galloped up and ordered me to halt and surrender , to which I gave a defiant answer , and dropping the shawl and raglan from my shoulders advanced towards him ; he leveled his carbine at me , but I expected , if he fired , he would miss me , and my intention was in that event to put my hand under his foot , tumble him off on the other side , spring into his saddle and attempt to escape . My wife , who had been watching , when she saw the soldier aim his carbine at me , ran forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantaneous action , and recognizing that the opportunity had been lost I turned back , and , the morning being damp and chilly , passed to a fire beyond the tent.3 Colonel Pritchard relates in his official re-port : Upon returning to cari*p I was accosted by Davis from among the prisoners , who asked if I was the officer in command , and upon my answering him that I was , and asking him whom I wasto call him , he replied that I might call him what or whoever I sharp eyes were upon the singular-looking old mother . ' Suddenly , Corporal Munger of Company C , and others , at the same instant , discovered that the old mother was wearing very heavy hoots for an aged female , and the corporal exclaimed : " That is not a woman ! Do n't you see the hoots ? ' and spurring his horse forward and cocking his carbine , compelled the withdrawal of the shawl , and disclosed Jeff* Davis . " As if stung by this discovery of his unmanliness , Jeff . struck an attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among you ? If there is , let me see him " Yes , ' said the corporal , I am one ; and if you stir , I will blow your brains out ! " I know my fate , ' said Davis , and might as well die here . ' " But his wife threw her arms around his neck , and kept herself betxveen him and the threatening corporal . " No harm , however , was done him , and he was generally kindly spoken to : he was only stripped of his female attire . " As a man , he was dressed in a complete suit of gray , a light felt hat , and high cavalry boots , with a gray beard of about six weeks ' growth covering his face . // pleased . When I replied to him that I would call him Davis , and after a moment 's hesitation he said that was his name , he suddenly drew himself up in true royal dignity and exclaimed , " I suppose that you consider it bravery to charge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft , it is vandalism " 1 That the correctness of the report may not be questioned , we add the corroborating statement of Postmaster-General Reagan , the sole member of the rebel Cabinet remaining with the party : Colonel Pritchard did not come up for some time after Mr. Davis was made a prisoner . When he rode up there was a crowd , chiefly of Federal soldiers , around Mr. Davis . He was standing , and dressed in the suit he habitually wore . He turned towards Colonel Pritchard and asked , " Who commands these troops ? " Colonel Pritchard replied , without hesitation , that he did . Mr. Davis said to him , " You command a set of thieves and robbers . They rob women and children . " Colonel Pritchard then said , " Mr. Davis , you should remember that you are a prisoner . " And Mr. Davis replied : " I am fully conscious of that . It would be bad enough to be the prisoner of soldiers and gentlemen . I am still lawful game , and would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pritchard 's official report gives the following list of the persons who fell into his hands : I ascertained that we had captured Jefferson Davis and family ( a wife and four children ) ; John H.

Howell , midshipman in the rebel navy , and twelve private soldiers ; Miss Maggie Howell , sister of Mrs. Davis ; two waiting maids , one white and one black , and several other servants . We also captured five wagons , three ambulances , about fifteen horses , and from twenty-five to thirty mules . The train was mostly loaded with commissary stores and private baggage of the party . The details of the return march are unnecessary ; there is no allegation that the prisoners were ill treated . They arrived at Macon on May 13 , both captors and prisoners having on the way first learned of the offer of a reward of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having been an accomplice in the assassination of President Lincoln . In due time Davis was imprisoned in Fort Monroe . These pages do not afford room to narrate his captivity of about " He said he thought our Government was too magnanimous to hunt women and children that way . " When Colonel Pritchard told him that he would do the best he could for his comfort , he answered : I ask no favors of you . ' " To which surly reply the colonel courteously responded by assuring him of kind treatment . two years , his arraignment at Richmond before the United States Circuit Court for the District of Virginia for the crime of treason , and his liberation on bail , Horace Greeley having volunteered to become his principal bondsman .

Three weeks from that day President Johnson bestowed upon Mr. Davis and those who had been his followers a liberal and fraternal Christmas gift . On the 25th of December , i868 , he issued a proclamation supplementing the various prior proclamations of amnesty , which declared " unconditionally and without reservation , to all and to every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion , a full pardon and amnesty for the offense of treason against the United States , or of adhering to their enemies during the late civil war , with restoration of all rights , privileges , and immunities under the Constitution and the laws which have been made in pursuance thereof .

THE END OF REnELLION . IN the early years of the war , after every considerable success of the national arms , the newspapers were in the habit of announcing that " the back of the rebellion was broken . " But at last the time came when the phrase was true ; after Appomattox , the rebellion fell to pieces all at once . Lee surrendered less than " Arrangements were forthwith made to return to Macon . . . " The members of Davis 's staff submitted with a better grace than he to the capture and march , and were generally quite communicative. " 1 Pritchard to Stanton , May 25 , 1865. 2 J. H.

Leading minds on both sides thought the war might be indefinitely prolonged . We have seen that Jefferson Davis , after Richmond fell , issued his swelling manifesto , saying the Confederates had " now entered upon a new phase of the struggle , " and that he would " never consent to abandon to the enemy one foot of the soil of any of the States of the Confederacy . " General Sherman , so late as the 25th of April , said , " I now apprehend that the rebel armies will disperse ; and instead of dealing with six or seven States , we will have to deal with numberless bands of desperadoes . " Neither side comprehended fully the intense weariness of war that had taken possession of the South ; and peace came more swiftly and completely than any one had ever dared to hope . The march of Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carolinas had predisposed the great interior region to make an end of strife , a tendency which was greatly promoted by Wilson 's energetic and masterly raid . The rough usage received by Taylor and by Forrest at his hands , and the blow their dignity suffered in the capture of their fugitive President , made their surrender more practicable . An officer of Taylor 's staff came to Canby 's headquarters on the i 9th of April to make arrangements for the surrender of all the Confederate forces east of the Mississippi not already paroled by Sherman and by Wilson - embracing some 42,000 men . On the 4th of May the terms were agreed upon and signed at the village of Citronelle in Alabama . General Taylor gives a picturesque incident of his meeting with General Canby . The Union officers invited the Confederates to a luncheon , and while the latter were enjoying a menu to which they had long been unaccustomed , the military band in attendance began playing " Hail , Columbia . " Canby - with a courtesy , Taylor says , equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door ; the music ceased for a moment , and then the air of " Dixie " was heard . The Confederates , not to be left in arrears of good-breeding , then demanded the national air , and the flag of the reunited country was toasted by both sides . The terms agreed upon were those accorded by Grant to Lee with slight changes of detail , the United States Government furnishing transportation and subsistence on the way home to the men lately engaged in the effort to destroy it . The Confederates willingly testify to the cordial generosity with which they were treated . " Public property , " says General Taylor , " was turned over and receipted for , and this as orderly and quickly as in time of peace between officers of the same service . At the same time and place the Confederate Commodore Farrand surrendered to Admiral Thatcher all the naval forces of the Confederacy in the neighborhood of Mobile - a dozen vessels and some hundreds of officers . General Kirby Smith commanded all the insurgent forces west of the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flying Cabinet were fixed , after the successive surrenders of Lee and Johnston had left them no prospect in the east . They imagined they could move westward , gathering up stragglers as they fled , and , crossing the river , could join Smith 's forces , and " form an army , which in that portion of the country , abounding in supplies and deficient in rivers and railroads , could have continued the war . . . . " " To this hope , " adds Mr. Davis , " I persistently clung . " Smith , on the 21st of April , called upon his soldiers to continue the fight . You possess the means of long resisting invasion . You have hopes of succor from abroad . .

The same generous terms were accorded him that had been given to Taylor  --  the Government fed his troops and carried them to their homes . Meanwhile , General Wilson had been paroling many thousands of prisoners , who wandered in straggling parties within the limits of his command . One hundred and seventy-five thousand men in all were surrendered by the different Confederate commanders , and there were , in addition to these , about ninety-nine thousand prisoners in national custody during the year , ; one-third of these were exchanged and two-thirds released . This was done as rapidly as possible , by successive orders of the War Department , beginning on the 9th of May and continuing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the waste of war .

It had grown during the last few months to portentous dimensions . The impression that a great and final victory was near at hand , the stimulus of the national hope , the prospect of a brief and prosperous campaign , had brought the army up to the magnificent complement of a million men . ' The reduction of this vast armament , the retrenchment of the enormous expenses incident to it , were immediately undertaken with a method and despatch which were the result of four years ' thorough and practical training , and which would have been impossible under any other circumstances . Every chief of bureau was ordered on the 28th of April to proceed at once to the reduction of expenses in his department to a peace footing , and this before Taylor or Smith had surrendered and while Jefferson Davis was still at large .

They began without delay to sell the immense accumulation of draught animals ; eight million dollars were realized from that source within the year . The other departments also disposed of their surplus stores . The stupendous difference which the close of the war at once caused in the finances of the country may be seen in the fact that the appropriations for the army in the fiscal year succeeding the war were $33,814,461 as against $516,240,131 for the preceding year . The army of a million men was brought down , with incredible ease and celerity , to one of twenty-five thousand . Before the great army melted away into the greater body of the Republic the soldiers enjoyed one final triumph , a march through the capital , undisturbed by death or danger , under the eyes of their highest commanders , military and civilian , and the representatives of the people whose nationality they had saved . The Army of the Potomac and the army of Sherman - such corps of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ordered to pass in review before General Grant and President Johnson , in front of the Executive Mansion , on the 23d and 24th of May . Those who witnessed this solemn yet joyous pageant will never forget it , and will pray that their children may never witness anything like it . For two whole days this formidable host , eight times the number of the entire peace es1 May i , 1865 , the aggregate was 1,000,516 . EJohnson , Message , Dec. 4 ' i86* .

XXXIX. - 79. tablishment , marched the long stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue , starting from the shadow of the dome of the Capitol , and filling that wide thoroughfare to Georgetown with their serried mass , moving with the easy , yet rapid pace of veterans in cadence step . On a platform in front of the White House stood the President and all the first officers of the state , the judges of the highest court , the most eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weather , on both days , was the finest a Washington May could afford ; the trees of Lafayette Square were leafing out in their strong and delicate verdure . The Army of the Potomac , which for four years had been the living bulwark of the capital , was rightly given the precedence . Meade himself rode at the head of his column , then came the cavalry headed by Merritt - for Sheridan had already started for his new command in the Southwest . Custer , commanding the Third Division , had an opportunity of displaying his splendid horsemanship , as his charger , excited beyond control by the pomp and martial music , bolted near the Treasury , and dashed with the speed of the wind past the reviewing stand , but was soon mastered by the young general , who was greeted with stormy applause as he rode gravely by the second time , covered with garlands of flowers , the gifts of friends on the pavement . The same graceful guerdon was given all the leading commanders ; even subalterns and hundreds of private soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps , the Ninth , under Parke , the Fifth , under Griffin ,  --  though Warren was on the stand , hailed with tumultuous cheers by his soldiers ,  - -  and the Second , under Humphreys , moved swiftly forward . Wright , with the Sixth , was too far away to join in the day 's parade.2 The memory of hundreds of hard-fought battles , of saddening defeats and glorious victories , of the dead and maimed comrades who had fallen forever out of the thinned ranks , was present to every one who saw the veteran divisions marching by under the charge of generals who had served with them in every vicissitude of battle and siege - trained officers like Crook and Ayres , and young and brilliant soldiers who had risen like rockets from among the volunteers , such as Barlow and Miles . Every brigade had its days of immortal prowess to boast , every tattered guidon had its history . On the 24th Sherman 's army marched in review . The general rode in person at the head of his troops , and was received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rapturous plaudits , which might have assured him of the peculiar place he was // to hold thereafter in the hearts of his fellowcitizens . His horse and he were loaded with flowers ; and his principal commanders were not neglected . Howard had just been appointed chief of the Freedmen 's Bureau , and therefore Logan commanded the right wing of the Army of the Tennessee , the place he had hoped for , and , his friends insist , deserved , when McPherson fell ; Hazen had succeeded to the Fifteenth Corps , and Frank Blair , a chivalrous and martial figure , rode at the head of the Seventeenth . Slocum led the left wing , - the Army of Georgia ,  --  consisting of the Twentieth Corps under Mower , and the Fourteenth underj . C. Davis . The armies of Meade and Sherman were not exclusively from the East and West respectively ; for Sherman had the contingent which Hooker and Howard had brought to Chattanooga from the East ; and there were regiments from as far west as Wisconsin and Minnesota in the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all intents and purposes Western men , and they were scanned with keen and hospitable interest by the vast crowd of spectators , who were mainly from the East . There was little to choose between the two armies : a trifle more of neatness and discipline , perhaps , among the veterans of Meade ; a slight preponderance in physique and in swinging vigor of march among the Westerners ; but the trivial differences were lost in the immense and evident likeness , as of brothers in one family . There was a touch of the grotesque in the march of Sherman 's legions which was absent from the well-ordered corps of Meade . A small squad of bummers followed each brigade , in their characteristic garb and accessories ; small donkeys loaded with queer spoils ; goats and game-cocks , regimental pets , sitting gravely on the backs of mules ; and pickaninnies , the adopted children of companies , showed their black faces between the ranks , their eyes and teeth gleaming with delight . As a mere spectacle , this march of the mightiest host the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was not as a spectacle alone that it affected the beholder most deeply . It was not a mere holiday parade ; it was an army of citizens on their way home after a long and terrible war . Their clothes were worn with toilsome marches and pierced with bullets ; their banners had been torn with shot and shell and lashed in the winds of a thousand battles ; the very drums and fifes that played the ruffles as each battalion passed the President had called out the troops to numberless night alarms , had sounded the onset at Vicksburg and Antietam , had inspired the wasted valor of Kenesaw and Fredericksburg , had throbbed with the electric pulse of victory at Chattanooga and Five Forks . The whole country claimed these heroes as a part of themselves , an infinite gratification forever to the national self-love ; and the thoughtful diplomatists who looked on the scene from the reviewing stand could not help seeing that there was a conservative force in an intelligent democracy which the world had never before known . XVith all the shouting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one sad and dominant thought which could not be driven from the minds of those who saw it-that of the men who were absent , and who had , nevertheless , richly earned the right to be there . The soldiers , in their shrunken companies , were conscious of the ever-present memories of the brave comrades who had fallen by the way ; and in the whole army there was the passionate and unavailing regret that their wise , gentle , and powerful friend , Abraham Lincoln , was gone forever from the house by the avenue , where their loyal votes , supporting their loyal bayonets , had contributed so much to place him . The world has had many lessons to learn from this great war : the naval fight in Hampton Roads opened a new era in maritime warfare ; the marches of Sherman disturbed all previous axioms of logistics ; the system of instantaneous intrenchments , adopted by the soldiers of both sides in the latter part of the war , changed the whole character of modem field tactics . But the greatest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the American Republic saved its life is the manner in which its armies were levied , and , when the occasion for their employment was over , were dismissed . Though there were periods when recruiting was slow and expensive , yet there were others , when some crying necessity for troops was apparent , that showed almost incredible speed and efficiency in the supply of men . Mr. Stanton , in his report for i865 , says : After the disaster on the Peninsula , in 1862 , over 8o , ooo troops were enlisted , organized , armed , equipped , and sent to the field in less than a month . Sixty thousand troops have repeatedly gone to thefield within four weeks ; and 90,000 infantry were once sent to the armies from the five States of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Iowa , and Wisconsin within twenty days . This certainly shows a wealth of resources nothing less than imperial , and a power of commanding the physical and moral forces of the nation which has rarely been paralleled . Even more important , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations by the quick and noiseless dispersion of the enormous host when the war was done . The best friends of the Republic in Europe feared for it in this crisis , and those who disbelieved in // the conservative power of democracy were loud in their prophecies of the trouble which would arise on the attempt to disband the army . A million men , with arms in their hands , flushed with intoxicating victory , led by officers schooled in battle , loved and trustedwere they not ready for any adventure ? Was it reasonable to believe that they would consent to disband and go to work again at the bidding of a few men in black coats at Washington ? Especially after Lincoln was dead , could the tailor from Tennessee direct these myriads of warriors to lay down their arms and melt away into the everyday life of citizens ? In America there was no anxiety on this score among the friends of the Union . Without giving the subject a thought they knew there was no danger . The war had been made to execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when those objects were attained there was no thought among the soldiers , from the general to the humblest filecloser , but to wait for the expected orders from the civil authorities for their disbandment . The orders came as a mere matter of course , and were executed with a thoroughness and rapidity which then seemed also a matter of course , but which will appear more and more wonderful to succeeding generations . The muster-out began on the 29th of April , before Lincoln was borne to his grave , before Davis was caught , before the rebels of the TransMississippi had ceased uttering their boasts of eternal defiance . First the new recruits , next the veterans whose terms were nearly expired , next those expensive corps the cavalry and artillery , and so on in regular order . Sherman 's laurel-crowned army was the first to complete its muster-out , and the heroic Army of the Potomac was not far behind it . These veterans of hundreds of battlefields were soon found mingled in all the pursuits of civic activity . By the 7th of August 641,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 8oo , ooo had been mustered outwithout a fancy in any mind that there was anything else to do . The Navy Department had not waited for the return of peace to begin the reduction of expenses . As soon as Fort Fisher fell the retrenchment began , and before Grant started on his last campaign considerable progress had been made in that direction . The ist of May the squadrons were reduced one-half ; and in July but thirty steamers comprised the entire blockading squadron on the Atlantic and the Gulf . The Potomac and Mississippi flotillas were wholly discontinued in another month . When Mr. Welles made his annual report in December he could say : " There were in the several blockading squadrons in January last , exclusive of other duty , 471 vessels and 2445 guns . There are now but 29 vessels remaining on the coast , carrying 210 guns , exclusive of howitzers . " Superfluous vessels were sold by hundreds and the money covered into the Treasury ; thousands of the officers and sailors who had patriotically left the merchant service to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . For the purposes of pacification and the reestablishment of the national authority the country was divided into five grand divisions - that of the Atlantic , commanded by Meade ; the Mississippi , by Sherman ; the Gulf ; by Sheridan ; the Tennessee , by Thomas ; and the Pacific , by Halleck . These again were subdivided into nineteen departments , and we print here the names of the generals commanding them for the last time , as a roll of the men who survived the war , most favored by fortune and their own merits : Hooker , Hancock , Augur , Ord , Stoneman , Palmer ( J. M. ) , Pope , Terry , Schofield , Sickles , Steedman , Foster ( J. G. ) , Wood ( T. J. ) , Wood ( C. R. ) , Canby , Wright , Reynolds , Steele , McDowell . The success or failure of these soldiers in administering the trusts confided to them , their relations to the people among whom they were stationed , and to the President who succeeded to the vacant chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attempted to tell . On the i3th of June the President proclaimed the insurrection at an end in the State of Tennessee ; it was not until the second day of April , i866 , that he proclaimed a state of peace as existing in the rest of the United States , and then he excepted the State of Texas ; on the 20th of August , in the same year , he - made his final proclamation , announcing the reestablishment of the national authority in Texas , and thereupon he concluded , " I do further proclaim that the said insurrection is at an end , and that peace , order , tranquillity , and civil authority now exist in and throughout the whole of the United States of America. ** LINCOLN 'S FAME . THE death of Lincoln awoke all over the world a quick and deep emotion of grief and admiration . If he had died in the days of doubt and gloom which preceded his reelection , he would have been sincerely mourned and praised by the friends of the Union , but its enemies would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misguided victims of sectional hate . They would have used his death to justify their malevolent forebodings , to point the moral of new lectures on the instability of democracies . But as he had fallen in the moment of a stupendous victory , the halo // of a radiant success enveloped his memory and dazzled the eyes even of his most hostile critics . That portion of the press of England and the Continent which had persistently vilified him now joined in the universal chorus of elegiac praise.1 Cabinets and courts which had been cold or unfriendly sent their messages of condolence . The French government , spurred on by their Liberal opponents , took prompt measures to express their admiration for his character and their horror at his taking-off . In the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies the imperialists and the republicans vied with each other in utterances of grief and of praise ; the Emperor and the Empress sent their personal condolences to Mrs. Lincoln . In England there was perhaps a trifle of self-consciousness at the bottom of the official expressions of sympathy . The Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited the occasion since the assassination of Henry IV . The sterling English character could not , so gracefully as the courtiers of Napoleon III. , bend to praise one who had been treated almost as an enemy for so long . When Sir George Grey opened his dignified and pathetic speech in the House of Commons , by saying that a majority of the people of England sympathized with the North , he was greeted with loud protestations and denials on the part of those who favored the Confederacy . But his references to Lincoln 's virtues were cordially received , and when he said that the Queen had written to Mrs. Lincoln with her own hand , " as a widow to a widow , " the House broke out in loud cheering . Mr. Disraeli spoke on behalf of the Conservatives with his usual dexterity and with a touch of factitious feeling . There is he said in the character of the victim , and even in the accessories of his last moments , something so homely and innocent , that it takes the question , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceremonial of diplomacy ; it touches the heart of nations and appeals to the domestic sentiment of mankind . In the House of Lords the matter was treated with characteristic reticence . The speech of 1 One of the finest poems on the occasion of his death was that in which the London " Punch " made its manly recantation of the slanders with which it had pursued him for four years : Beside this corpse that bears for winding-sheet The Stars and Stripes he lived to rear anew , Between the mourners at his head and feet , Say , scurrile jester , is there room for you ? Yes , he had lived to shame me from my sneer , To lame my pencil , and confute my pen ; To make me own this hind of princes peer , This rail-splitter a true-born king of men . Lord Russell was full of that rugged truthfulness , that unbending integrity of spirit , which appeared at the time to disguise his real friendliness to America , and which was only the natural expression of a mind extraordinarily upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derby followed him in a speech of curious elegance , the object of which was rather to launch a polished shaft against his opponents than to show honor to the dead President ; and the address proposed by the Government was voted . While these reserved and careful public proceedings were going on , the heart of England was expressing its sympathy with the kindred beyond sea by its thousand organs of utterance in the press , the resolutions of municipal bodies , the pulpit , and the platform . In Germany the same manifestations were seen of official expressions of sympathy from royalty and its ministers , and of heartfelt affection and grief from the people and their representatives . Otto von Bismarck , then at the beginning of his illustrious career , gave utterance to the courteous regrets of the King of Prussia ; the eloquent deputy , William Loewe , from his place in the House , made a brief and touching speech . The man he said who accomplished such great deeds from the simple desire conscientiously to perform his duty , the man who never wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his people , will find his own glorious place in the pages of history . In the deepest reverence I bow my head before this modest greatness , and I think it is especially agreeable to the spirit of our own nation , with its deep inner life and admiration of self-sacrificing devotion and effort after the ideal , to pay the tribute of veneration to such greatness , exalted as it is by simplicity and modesty . Two hundred and fifty members of the Chamber signed an address to the American minister in Berlin , full of the cordial sympathy and admiration felt , not only for the dead President , but for the national cause , by the people of Germany . You are aware they said that Germany has looked with pride and joy on the thousands of her sons who in this struggle have placed themselves so resolutely on the side of law and right . You have seen with what pleasure the victories of the Union have been hailed , and how confident the faith in the final triumph of the great cause and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , even in the midst of calamity . Workingmen 's clubs , artisans ' unions , sent numberless addresses , not merely expressive of sympathy , but conveying singularly just appreciations of the character and career of Lincoln . His death seemed to have marked a step in the education of the people everywhere . // In fact it was among the common people of the entire civilized world that the most genuine and spontaneous manifestations of sorrow and appreciation were produced , and to this fact we attribute the sudden and solid foundation of Lincoln 's fame . It requires years , perhaps centuries , to build the structure of a reputation which rests upon the opinion of those distinguished for learning or intelligence ; the progress of opinion from the few to the many is slow and painful . But in the case of Lincoln the many imposed their opinion all at once ; he was canonized , as he lay on his bier , by the irresistible decree of countless millions . The greater part of the aristocracy of England thought little of him , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant every discordant voice . It would have been as imprudent to speak slightingly of him in London as it was in New York . Especially among the Dissenters was honor and reverence shown to his name . The humbler people instinctively felt that their order had lost its wisest champion . Not only among those of Saxon blood was this outburst of emotion seen . In France a national manifestation took place which the government disliked , but did not think it wise to suppress . The students of Paris marched in a body to the American Legation to express their sympathy . A two-cent subscription was started to strike a massive gold medal ; the money was soon raised , but the committee was forced to have the work done in Switzerland . A committee of French Liberals brought the medal to the American minister , to be sent to Mrs. Lincoln . " Tell her , " said Eug*ne Pelletan , " the heart of France is in that little box . " The inscription had a double sense ; while honoring the dead Republican , it struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; abolished slavery , reestablished the Union : Saved the Republic , without veiling the statue of Liberty . " Everywhere on the Continent the same swift apotheosis of the people 's hero was seen . An Austrian deputy said to the writer , " Among my people his memory has already assumed superhuman proportions ; he has become a myth , a type of ideal democracy . " Almost before the earth closed over him he began to be the subject of fable . The Freemasons of Europe generally regard him as one of them - his portrait in Masonic garb is often displayed ; yet he was not one of that brotherhood . The Spiritualists claim him as their most illustrious adept , but he was not a Spiritualist ; and there is hardly a sect in the Western world , from the Calvinist to the atheist , but affects to believe he was of their opinion . A collection of the expressions of sympa thy and condolence which came to Washington from foreign governments , associations , and public bodies of all sorts was made by the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It forms a large quarto of a thousand pages , and embraces the utterances of grief and regret from every country under the sun , in almost every language spoken by man . But admired and venerated as he was in Europe , he was best understood and appreciated at home . It is not to be denied that in his case , as in that of all heroic personages who occupy a great place in history , a certain element of legend mingles with his righteous fame . He was a man , in fact , especially liable to legend . We have been told by farmers in central Illinois that the brown thrush did not sing for a year after he died . He was gentle and merciful , and therefore he seems in a certain class of annals to have passed all his time in soothing misfortune and pardoning crime . He had more than his share of the shrewd native humor , and therefore the loose jest books of two centuries have been ransacked for anecdotes to be attributed to him . He was a great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fortune . One night he had a dream , which he repeated the next morning to the writer of these lines , which quaintly illustrates his unpretending and kindly democracy . He was in some great assembly ; the people made a lane to let him pass . " He is a common-looking fellow , " some one said . Lincoln in his dream turned to his critic and replied , in his Quaker phrase , " Friend , the Lord prefers common-looking people : that is why he made so many of them . " He that abases himself shall be exalted . Because Lincoln kept himself in such constant sympathy with the common people , whom he respected too highly to flatter or mislead , he was rewarded by a reverence and a love hardly ever given to a human being . Among the humble working people of the South whom he had made free this veneration and affection easily passed into the supernatural . At a religious meeting among the negroes of the Sea Islands a young man expressed the wish that he might see Lincoln . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man see Linkum . Linkum walk as Jesus walk-no man see Linkum. " 1 But leaving aside these fables , which are a natural enough expression of a popular awe and love , it seems to us *o calmer nor more just estimate of Lincoln 's relation to his time has ever been made - nor perhaps ever will be-than that uttered by one of the wisest and most Amer1 Mr. Hay had this story from Captain E. W. Hooper immediately after it happened . It has been told with many variations . // jean of thinkers , Ralph Waldo Emerson , a few days after the assassination . We can not forbear quoting a few words of this remarkable discourse , which shows how Lincoln seemed to the greatest of his contemporaries . A plain man of the people , an extraordinary fortune attended him . Lord Bacon says , " Manifest virtues procure reputation ; occult ones fortune . " His occupying the chair of state was a triumph of the good sense of mankind and of the public conscience . . . . He grew according to the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the problem grew , so did his comprehension of it . Rarely was a man so fitted to the event . . . . It can not be said that there is any exaggeration of his worth . If ever a man was fairly tested , he was . There was no lack of resistance , nor of slander , nor of ridicule . . . . Then what an occasion was the whirlwind of the war ! Here was no place for holiday magistrate , nor fair-weather sailor ; the new pilot was hurried to the helm in a tornado . In four years-four years of battle-dayshis endurance , his fertility of resources , his magnanimity , were sorely tried and never found wanting . There by his courage , his justice , his even temper , his fertile counsel , his humanity , he stood a heroic figure in the center of a heroic epoch . He is the true history of the American people in his time ; the true representative of this continentfather of his country , the pulse of twenty millions throbbing in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue . The quick instinct by which the world recognized him , even at the moment of his death , as one of its greatest men , was not deceived . It has been confirmed by the sober thought of a quarter of a century . The writers of each nation comkare him with their first popular hero . The French find points of resemblance in him to Henry IV. ; the Dutch liken him to William of Orange ; the cruel stroke of murder and treason by which all three perished in the height of their power naturally suggests the comparison , which is strangely justified in both cases , though the two princes were so widely different in character . Lincoln had the wit , the bonhomie , the keen , practical insight into affairs of the B6arnais ; and the tyrannous moral sense , the wide comprehension , the heroic patience of the Dutch patriot , whose motto might have served equally well for the American President - Sa*vis franquillus in undis . European historians speak of him in words reserved for the most illustrious names . Merle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest that history has to inscribe on its annals . " Henri Martin predicts nothing less than a universal apotheosis : " This man will stand out in the traditions of his country and the world as an incarnation of the people ; and of modern democracy itself .

In this country , where millions still live who were his contemporaries , and thousands who knew him personally , where the envies and jealousies which dog the footsteps of success still linger in the hearts of a few , where journals still exist that loaded his name for four years with daily calumny , and writers of memoirs vainly try to make themselves important by belittling him , his fame has become as universal as the air , as deeply rooted as the hills . The faint discords are not heard in the wide chorus that hails him second to none and equaled by Washington alone . The eulogies of him form a special literature . Preachers , poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconditional love and reverence . Men speaking with the authority of fame use unqualified superlatives .

" He is spoken of , with scarcely less of enthusiasm , by the more generous and liberal spints among those who revolted against his election and were vanquished by his power . General Longstreet1 calls him " the greatest man of rebellion times , the one matchless among forty millions for the peculiar difficulties of the period . " An eminent Southern orator , 2 referring to our mixed Northern and Southern ancestry , says : From the union of those colonists , from the straightening of their purposes and the crossing of their blood , slow perfecting through a century , came he who stands as the first typical American , the first who comprehended within himself all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this republic - Abraham Lincoln . It is not difficult to perceive the basis of this sudden and world-wide fame , nor rash to predict its indefinite duration . There are two classes of men whose names are more enduring than any monument- the great writers , and the men of great achievement ; the founders of states , the conquerors . Lincoln has the singular fortune to belong to both these categories ; upon these broad and stable foundations his renown is securely built . Nothing would have more amazed him while he lived than to hear himself called a man of letters ; but this age has produced few greater writers . We are only recording here the judgment of his peers . Emerson ranks him with A3sop and Pilpay in his lighter moods , and says : The weight and penetration of many passages in his letters , messages , and speeches , hidden now by the very closeness of their application to the moment , are destined to a wide fame . What pregnant definitions , what unerring common sense , what foresight , and on great occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human tone ! His brief speech at Gettysburg1 will not easily be surpassed by words on any recorded occasion.2 His style extorted the high praise of French Academicians ; Montalembert3 commended it as a model for the imitation of princes . Many of his phrases form part of the common speech of mankind . It is true that in his writings the range of subjects is not great ; he is concerned chiefly with the political problems of the time , and the moral considerations involved in them . But the range of treatment is remarkably wide ; it runs from the wit , the gay humor , the florid eloquence of his stump speeches to the marvelous sententiousness and brevity of the letter to Greeley and the address at Gettysburg , and the sustained and lofty grandeur of the Second Inaugural . The more his writings are studied in connection with the important transactions of his age the higher will his reputation stand in the opinion of the lettered class . But the men of study and research are never numerous ; and it is principally as a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the story of his objective life that will forever touch and hold the heart of mankind . His birthright was privation and ignorance-not peculiar to his family , but the universal environment of his place and time ; he burst through those enchaining conditions by the force of native genius and will ; vice had no temptation for him ; his course was as naturally upward as the skylark 's ; he won , against all conceivable obstades , a high place in an exacting profession and an honorable position in public and private 1 The text of the address , as slightly revised by President Lincoln , is as follows , and is taken from the autographic copy made for the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Fair in Baltimore in 1864 : " Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . Now , we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great battlefield of that war . We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live . It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this . But , in a larger sense , we can not dedicate , we can not consecrate , we can not hallow this ground . The brave men , living and dead , who struggled here , have consecrated it , far above our poor power to add or detract . The world will little note nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what they did here . It is for us , the living , rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced . It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us ; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that , cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion ; that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain ; that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom ; and that government of life ; he became the foremost representative of a party founded on an uprising of the national conscience against a secular wrong , and thus came to the awful responsibilities of power in a time of terror and gloom . He met them with incomparable strength and virtue . Caring for nothing but the public good , free from envy or jealous fears , he surrounded himself with the leading men of his party , his most formidable rivals in public esteem , and through four years of stupendous difficulties he was head and shoulders above them all in the vital qualities of wisdom , foresight , knowledge of men , and thorough comprehension of measures . Personally opposed , as the radicals claim , by more than half of his own party in Congress , and bitterly denounced and maligned by his open adversaries , he yet bore himself with such extraordinary discretion and skill , that he obtained for the Government all the legislation it required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal effort or solicitation he became the only possible candidate of his party for redlection , and was chosen by an almost unanimous vote of the Electoral Colleges . His qualities would have rendered his administration illustrious even in time of peace ; but when we consider that in addition to the ordinary work of the executive office he was forced to assume the duties of commander-in-chief of the national forces engaged in the most complex and difficult war of modern times , the greatness of spirit as well as the intellectual strength he evinced in that capacity is nothing short of prodigious . After times will wonder , not at the few and unimthe people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . " - EDITOR . 2 It has sometimes been said that this speech was not appreciated at the time of its delivery ; we therefore add the testimony of another high authority to that of Emerson . On the day after the dedication Edward Everett wrote to the President : " Permit me to express my great admiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriateness at the consecration of the cemetery . I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion , in two hours , as you did in two minutes . " Mr. Lincoln replied : " Your kind note of to-day is received . In our respective parts yesterday , you could not have been excused to make a short address , nor I a long one . I am pleased to know that in your judgment the little I did say was not entirely a failure . Of course I knew that Mr. Everett would not fail ; and yet while the whole discourse was eminently satisfactory , and will be of great value , there were passages in it which transcended my expectations . The point made against the thedry of the General Government being only an agency , whose principals are the States , was new to me , and , as I think , is one of the best arguments for the national supremacy . The tribute to our noble women for their angel ministering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects of it , whatever has gone before . " Unpublished MS. 3 " La Victoire du Nord , " p. 133. // portant mistakes he may have committed , but at the intuitive knowledge of his business that he displayed . We would not presume to express a personal opinion in this matter . We use the testimony only of the most authoritative names . General XV . T. Sherman has repeatedly expressed the admiration and surprise with which he has read Mr. Lincoln 's correspondence with his generals , and his opinion of the remarkable correctness of his military views . General W. F. Smith says : I have long held to the opinion that at the close of the war Mr. Lincoln was the superior of his generals in his comprehension of the effect of strategic movements and the proper method of following up victories to their legitimate conclusions.1 General J. H. Wilson holds the same opinion ; and Colonel Robert N. Scott , in whose lamented death the army lost one of its most vigorous and best-trained intellects , frequently called Mr. Lincoln " the ablest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high literary excellence , and easy practical mastery of affairs of transcendent importance , we must add , as an explanation of his immediate and worldwide fame , his possession of certain moral qualities rarely combined , in such high degree , in one individual . His heart was so tender that he would dismount from his horse in a forest to replace in their nest young birds which had fallen by the roadside ; he could not sleep at night if he knew that a soldierboy was under sentence of death ; he could not , even at the bidding of duty or policy , refuse the prayer of age or helplessness in distress . Children instinctively loved him ; they never found his rugged features ugly ; his sympathies were quick and seemingly unlimited . He was absolutely without prejudice of class or condition . Frederick Douglass says he was the only man of distinction he ever met who never reminded him by word or manner of his color ; he was as just and generous to the rich and well born as to the poor 1 " Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing rare among politicians . He was tolerant even of evil : though no man can ever have lived with a loftier scorn of meanness and selfishness , he yet recognized their existence and counted with them . He said one day , with a flash of cynical wisdom worthy of La Rochefoucauld , that honest statesmanship was the employment of individual meannesses for the public good . He never asked perfection of any one ; he did not even insist for others upon the high standards he set up for himself . At a time before the word was invented he was the first of opportunists . With the fire of a reformer and a martyr in his heart he yet proceeded by the ways of cautious and practical statecraft . He always worked with things as they were , while never relinquishing the desire and effort to make them better . To a hope which saw the Delectable Mountains of absolute justice and peace in the future , to a faith that God in his own time would give to all men the things convenient to them , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good and the bad , all the virtues and the infirmities of men , and a patience like that of nature , which in its vast and fruitful activity knows neither haste nor rest . A character like this is among the precious heirlooms of the Republic ; and by a special good fortune every part of the country has an equal claim and pride in it . Lincoln 's blood came from the veins of New England emigrants , of Middle State Quakers , of Virginia planters , of Kentucky pioneers ; he himself was one of the men who grew up with the earliest growth of the Great West . Every jewel of his mind or his conduct sheds radiance on each portion of the nation . The marvelous symmetry and balance of his intellect and character may have owed something to this varied environment of his race , and they may fitly typify the variety and solidity of the Republic . It may not be unreasonable to hope that his name and his renown may be forever a bond of union to the country which he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in death - with such entire devotion .
