txt The exhibition which is to be held in Chicago in 1892 will be not so much a World 's Fair as it will be a display of the peculiar ability of James G. Blaine to manipulate passing events for his own aggrandizement , unleas some power greater than his stops in to prevent him from getting full control of the machinery of what is grandiosely termed the " World 's Columbian Exposition . " Mr. Blaine 's latest dodge is moat worthy Of himself . Having failed , for the present , in getting W. E. Curtis made special envoy of the Commission to South America to boom Blaine and reciprocity , the egotistical diulomat in the State Department has been reaching out in another direction to accomplish a similar purpose . It is generally conceded that the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Exhibits will have considerable power and plenty of chances to make agreeable alliances and most desirable schemes , in connection with the representatives of foreign nations , if he chooses to do so . From the time when the division of the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. T. B. Bryan has been spoken of in connection with the position . Mr. Bryan 's abilities as a scholarly man , with rare attainments as a public and after dinner speaker , his tact and readiness in dealing with men , made him peculiarly fitted for the office . It was supposed that the Choice was made , and no other men were mentioned even as possibilities . A week ago it was given out at the headquarters lu an unofficial way that Mr. George R. Davis , the Director General , would himself act as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Exhibits . In this conne.ctiou a very interesting little yarn was spun for the benefit of the public to quiet suspicion and prevent any criticism of the shelving of Mr. Bryan . This story was wound around Mr. Gushorn. - who was Director General of the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876 . He was here on a visit at the time , and was reported at the fair headquarters as giving able and valuer ble advice to the managers of the Chicago show , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaine fair people was said to be that the Director General should also act as chief of the Department of Foreign Exhibits . " because the represeutatives of foreign nations would treat only with the Director General in person , " all otaer officials being too insiguiticant for them to notice and associate with . Upon this slight intimation and with such alacrity as betokened great readiness to undertake the additional labor for some secret reason , Mr. Davis had himself bulletined as theproba.ble chief of the Committee on Foreign Exhibits . The annotincemen was not much more of a surprise to mr , Bryan than it was to everybody around the headquarters not in the ring . and to the citizens generally of Chicago , who had supposed Mr. Bryan 's appointment a foregone conclusion . It required but little probing- for interested people to discover why the foreign representatives were to be received , entertained , aud bidden godspeed on their return to their native lands by Mr. Davis instead of by Mr. Bryan . Mr. Davis is a Blaine man . Mr. Bryan has been a Democrat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could rely ou Mr. Davis and was not at all sure of Mr. Bryan . As chief of the Committee on Foreign Exhibits , a Blaine man would have many opportunities to insinuate flattering speeches into the ears of the foreigners about his chief . He will have the appointment of many emissaries to foreign countries to boom the fair , and incidentally work up interest in Mr. Blaine and reciprocity . These are but a low of the ways in which he could make bay for the egotist while the sun was partially obscured by the little man with the big bat in the White House . o show that Mr. Davis took advantage of a random remark made by Mr. Goshen ) , to put himself in a position to further Mr. Blaine 's interests , it is only necessary to refer to a conversation which took place the day after the announcement of Davis 's probable appointment by himself , between Mr. Goshorn and Mr. Bryan . Mr. Goshorn met Mr. Bryan accidentally . He pretended to be very much surprised when he learned that Mr. Bryan wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Foreign Department . To smooth the matter over , he said to Mr. Bryan that it he had known that he was booked for the position he would never have made the proposition he did to Mr. Davis , and that his reason for so doing was because his assistant at Philadelphia , in that office , had proved incompetent . He had been obliged to do the work himself , not because the representatives of foreign nations refused to treat with a subordinate , but because the subordinate was not competent to perform the duties of the position . Mr. Davis and every other man in the local Direotory and national commission have recognized Mr. ffi Bryan 's perfect fitness for the office , and the Director General could , therefore , not nave had the same excuse that Mr. Uoshorn had for taking to himself the negotiating with foreign nations . Mr. Davis has not yet appointed himself Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Exhibits . The appointment may not be announced until the next meeting of the commission in April . Perhaps it will not be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this seems unlikely . He and his followers see too great an opportunity in the fair to urge their own schemes upon this Nation and foreigners to let it slip . They are getting the machinery of the fair into their Own hands , and will probably not scruple to use it . In connection with this , the story of bow John T. Dickinson came ' to be made Secretary is interesting . Dickinson was a Texas politician , who lived in semi-obscurity until he lauded in Chicago as an applicant for a clerical position paying $1,500 or $2,000 a year . He is a Democrat , but in Texas had some business relations with Russell Harrison . He secured a small clerical position , but almost immediately began to be talked about for the Secretaryship . Some offices had to be given to Democrats as a matter of form . Dickinson was not a great man , and , the rlugstere argued , could do no great harm . But his affiliations with Russell Harrison were not pleasing to the Blaineites . They toot occasion to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was discovered that he was not . He was willing to accept , aerviee under the men in the ring , and he obtained this office , with a salary of $10,000 a year . Now lie is whistling to himself under his breath and sawing imaginary wood , for the office work consists in drawing the salary and posing as a Democrat in the public prints so as to give an appearance of non-partisanship to the fair . Speculation as to the oomposition of President Palmer 's Board of Control for the national commission was ended Tuesday by the announcement that these men had been chosen : Thomas M. Waller , Connecticut ; George V. Massey , Delaware ; E. B. Martindale , Indiana ; J. W. et . Clair , West Virginia ; Robert E. Lindsey , Kentucky ; and M. H. De Young , California . In compliance with the terms of the joint conference committee 's report , this board , with a like body from the Directory , will arbitrate all differences between the Directory and the commission and will have full power to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session . President Palmer and Ferdinand Peck left Chicago Wednesday for Washington to lay before President Harrison all the proof that is necessary for the Presidential proclamation . The rules and regulations for exhibitors prepared by Director General Davis were approved Last Saturday by a joint committee . All Governments will be invited to appoint Commissioners for the purpose of organizing their departments at the exposition . The transportation , receiving , unpacking , and arranging of produots will be at the expense of the exhibitor , Exhibitors will not be charged for space . There will he twelve departments . as specified in the report of the Committee on Classification . A limited quantity of steam and water power will be supplied gratuitously . Articles that are in any way dangerous or offensive , and nostrums and empirical preparations whose ingredients are concealed , will not be admitted to the exposition . A specified time will be allowed exhibitors to remove their goods after the close of the exposition , Goods not removed at the expiration of that time will be sold by the Director General for expanses , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhibition of fine arts . Committees have been appointed from the Directory , Art lustitute , and Commercial Club to raise funds for a magnificent art building on the lake front . An effort will be made to secure $1,000,000 for this purpose , in addition to the $600,000 that will probably be appropriated by the Directory from the building fund of $10,000,000 . Benjamin Butterworth was boomed for chief of the Bureau of Promotion and Publicity early in the week , and later for Solicitor General , but both booms subsided . The Illinois Stadia-Zeitung Company refuses to pay its subscription of $5,000 until assured that there will be no sumptuary or Babbatarian regulations adopted by the Directors . Representatives of several States called on Director General Davis this week and asked him to apportion them area at Jackson Park . Commissioner Harrison of Minnesota said he had been instructed to get eight acres and to assure Col. Davis that the State would spend $250,000 for an exhibit . The State of California will construct a marble palace at the World 's Fair . The marble used will bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in that State . Orders have been given for the setting out of large boxes of five-year-old orange trees . These will be brought to Chicago before 1893 , in bearing order , and used as approaches to the California Building , Commissioners from New-Mexico have undertaken to raise money to construct an onyx building for the fisheriea display . They propose to send all the onyx necessary , and deliver it on the ground without expense to the exposition company . The building will remain a permanent attraction after the fair . United States Minister Ryan of Mexico was in the city Tuesday , and said that Mexico would appropriate $2,000,000 for an exhibit at the fair . The Mexican display at Paris post $1,400 , - 000 . At to-night 's meeting of the local Directory pireator General Davis recommended that the work of the Committee on Foreign Exhibits be transacted through his office , This was unanimously concurred in by the Directors . The following appointments were made : Moses P. Handy , the well-known newspaper man of Philadelphia , to be chief of the Bureau of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be chief of the Bureau of Agriculture , and Joseph Hurst of Indiana to be Secretary of the Bureau of Installations . The last two named are Commissioners and will have to resign as such in order to accept the positions now offered them . Messrs . Bryan , Gage , Peck , Winston , Jeffery , Cregier , Palmer , and Walker of the local Directory were named as members of the Board of Control to act with a similar committee from the National Commission mentioned above .
