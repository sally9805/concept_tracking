ORTY years ago in this month of September , California was admitted into the Union . The rounding out offour decades of State life will be the occasion of a great celebration at San Francisco on the 9th of this month , in which an effort will be made to restore and to make real to the generation of to-day the hardy pioneers and gold hunters who founded in this far western land as genuine an American commonwealth as Massachusetts or New York . It will help the young Californian of to-day to appreciate the services of the men who , despite many errors , laid firmly and well the foundations of the chief State on the Pacific coast . The philosophic historian , with a perspective of forty years , is apt to look back with a certain polite condescension upon the leading events of early Californian history , and especially upon the Bear Flag movement.1 He condemns it out of hand as unnecessary , impolitic , and the work of men who had sinister or selfish motives . But the historian is unable to put himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors in that episode as in the other stirring events in California that crowded the ordinary normal development of a century into a decade of strenuous life . To get the full measure of this early Californian life one must have shared in the experiences of the pioneers , or have heard the story of their perils and privations from the lips of survivors . Their stories furnish the best ansxver to the historian 's strictures that the policy of the American settlers in California , just before the cession of the territory to the United States by Mexico , was uncalled for and unjustifiable . It is impossible to get a correct idea of the period without a clear knowledge of the envi1 The revolution against Mexican authority in California , known as the Bear Flag movement , will be fully treated of in future papers of the series on the Gold hunters of California , to which the present paper is preliminary , being here printed out of place chronologically by reason of its appositeness to the anniversary of the admission . It is enough for the purposes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of friction between certain American settlers in California and the Mexican authorities , and that it was more or less intimately connected with the misunderstandings between General Castro , commander-in-chief of the Mexican forces , and Captain ronment and without some sympathy with the actors . The California pioneers were made heroic by the deeds which they performed . In part , they had greatness thrust upon them , for the very stress of circumstances developed those qualities which enabled them to bring order out of chaos and to solve questions in government and social order that had never been solved before in this country . Yet they were only plain Americans , many of them as rude and uncouth as Lincoln in his rail-splitting days , but all had that fund of sound common sense which is born of hard experience and that ready adaptability to a new land and new customs that makes the western pioneer the ideal colonist . They brought with them across the plains in their huge wagons , that have been so aptly termed " ships of the desert , " that passionate love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in this far western land . They found a pastoral people living a life as gracious as their climate . The two elements refused to mingle , and the stronger at once asserted itself . That the conquest was made with so small a loss of life and so little personal suffering is greatly to the credit of the more aggressive race . With Englishmen in the place of the American pioneers the first sign of restiveness on the part of the weaker race would have been the signal for hostilities that would not have ended in a well-nigh bloodless revolution . What the conquest of California proved above all other things was the rare self-control of the men who were gathered from all parts of the country . Down-east Yankee lawyers and Missourian backwoodsmen fraternized and made common cause in the effort to plant American institutions in this new land . This work was marred by occasional outbursts of race prejudice and by undue haste in executing punishment , but these exceptions Fr*mont on the occasion of his visit to California with an exploring expedition in 1846 . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut on page 784 is a representation , was hoisted at Sonoma on the 14th of June . The capture of Sonoma was effected , without resistance , by thirty-two of the settlers under command of Ezekiel Merritt ; and General M. G. Vallejo , Colonel Victor Prudon , Captain Salvador Vallejo , and Jacob P. Leese , brother-in-law of the Vallejos and an American who refused to join the rebels , were taken to Sutter 's Fort as prisoners . Merritt was succeeded in the command of the insurgents by William B. Jde. - EDITOR. 775 // only prove the essential justice and fairness of the work of the pioneers . It is not in the province of this article to discuss the Bear Flag episode . Only a brief summary of the salient events that led up to the cession is necessary to comprehend the curious tangle of political interests in California that was destined never to be unraveled but to be cut by the hand of war . The conquest of California would probably have been pushed resolutely by the settlers had not the Mexican war broken out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the independence of California made it impossible for the actors in this revolution to recede from their position . Four years before , Commodore Jones had taken possession of Monterey and hoisted the American flag on the report that Mexico had begun hostilities . He made a formal apology when he discovered his mistake , but it is very unlikely that Fr6mont would have apologized for his part in the Bear Flag revolt , or that Mexico would have accepted any explanation . All the actors in this period with whom I have talked declare positively that the settlers were convinced that the occupation of Upper Californra by the Americans would be a question of only a few months . They all felt assured that the United States was prepared to seize the country on the first sign of hostilities on the part of Mexico . And their position was rendered the more difficult by the constant fear of English annexation . The historians who have made the most careful study of this period look upon this fear of England as a bogy , but survivors of those days declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acts of the settlers . Whether England had any intention of appropriating the territory is a point which will probably never be satisfactorily determined . Although there was nothing stronger at the time than rumors of English designs on California , it is only natural that men who h*td a vivid recollection of the war of i8 I 2 should suspect the motives of England . She possessed British Columbia ; she claimed all territory north of the Columbia ; she had not even relaxed her grip on Oregon . Here was a magnificent stretch of territory , with the finest harbor on the Pacific , that could be gained should the United States be found napping . It would have been against human nature for the settlers at the time of the conquest not to suspect England of lusting after this fair domain . It was known to a few also that the British vice- consul in California for several years had been trying to induce his govern- 1 We give place to this widely received version of Commodore Sloat 's action ; but see the article in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harvard University. - EDITOR . ment to intervene and establish a protectorate over the territory , which in English hands could so easily be transformed into actual possession . About the time that the Bear Flag party were getting ready for action in Sonoma the American naval commander in charge of the Pacific squadron was at Mazatlan . Commodore Sloat had received the most specific orders to occupy California at the first outbreak of hostilities with Mexico . In the harbor of San Blas was the English admiral Sir George Seymour on board the British frigate C'oZZi ; igwood . Sloat feared that Seymour might receive the first news of the Mexican war and thus anticipate him in seizing Monterey ; so as soon as he obtained positive proof of the capture of Matamoras by General Taylor he sailed for California . Our navy was then a fair match for the British , especially in speed , and the Savaizuali could easily outsail the Collingwood ; but Sloat took no risks , crowded on all sail , and reached Monterey on July 2 . He had the sloops Cyane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yerba Buena ( San Francisco ) and no British sail had yet appeared.1 Sloat was a man who dreaded responsibility . He expected to find California peaceful ; he even hoped to meet small opposition in raising the American flag . But what was his astonishment to learn that the native Californians were bitterly opposed to any change , and that they were in a red heat of resentment over Fr*mont 's action . He found the British vice-consul , Forbes , supporting General Castro and Governor Pio Pico in their diatribes against the American adventurers , while the Spanish vice-consul , Lataillade , surpassed all the others in his condemnation of the Sonoma revolution . Sloat accordingly hesitated five days before taking possession of Monterey . On July 7 , 1846 , Commodore Sloat took formal possession of California in the name of the United States . After making a formal demand for surrender upon the Mexican commandant , which that officer evaded by disclaiming authority to act for Castro , the commodore prepared for action . He issued orders warning the men against plundering or maltreating any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty seamen and marines was landed and . marched up in front of the old custom-house , which usually bore the Mexican colors . There is a conflict of authority as to whether the flag was flying on this day . The people crowded about , eager to see the spectacle , but there was no hostile demonstration . The commodore 's proclamation to the people of California was read . It declared that he proposed to hoist the American flag at Monterey and to carry it // throughout California . It was Greek to most of the spectators , who understood Spanish only , and was received in silence . Then the Stars and Stripes were run up , three roaring cheers were given , a salute of twenty-one guns was fired , and California thus passed into the hands of the Americans . On the following day the proclamation was read on the plaza at Yerba Buena , and the Mexican colors were supplanted by the American flag . At the old presidio , near the Golden Gate , was the dilapidated Mexican fort with its rusty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stripes were raised - an earnest that this main gateway of the Pacific would now be held against all comers . In the other towns where the VoL* XL-1o2 . American flag was raised there was unbounded enthusiasm on the part of the settlers . The native Californians looked on in apathetic silence . It may be that they counted on British interference ; but when Admiral Seymour arrived in Monterey Bay he courteously accepted the announcement of American possession , as did also the captain of the British war ship Juno , which visited San Francisco Bay two days after the flag was raised . This bloodless transfer of authority could probably have been the beginning and the end of the conquest of California but for the enmity aroused by the Bear Flag uprising and the feud between Fr6mont and Castro . As it was , the subsequent events of the conquest JOHN C. FR1*MONT . ( FROM A DAGUERREOTYPE TAKEN ABOUT 1850 ; LENT BY GENERAL FR*MONT. ) // may be put in a paragraph .

Stockton was the exact antithesis of Sloat . Responsibility did not worry him ; in fact , he enjoyed it . He promptly accepted Fr6mont 's troops and issued orders for their prompt organization into a regiment . He pushed the campaign vigorously against the native Californians , who were massed at Los Angeles ; but when he reached that city he found everything quiet , took possession , and declared the war at an end . He had only just reached Monterey on his return when he was informed that all the south was again in arms . It required six months to subdue this revolt ; but the power of the insurgents was broken by General Kearney , who arrived over land from New Mexico , after one of the severest marches on record . He cooperated with Stockton 's marines , and finally the Californians gave up the fight ; and the treaty of Cahuenga on January 13 , 1847 , ended the last stand made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Californians surrendered to Fr*mont probably because they counted on getting better terms than from Stockton ; and this expectation was fulfilled , as unconditional pardon was granted to all who had borne arms , with freedom to leave the country , and full rights of citizenship to those who chose to remain . There was a strong element of op*ra boi*e about the conquest . Seldom did the opposing forces number over five hundred men , and even the engagements at San Pasqual and San Gabriel were little more than skirmishes . But it is undeniable that much hard work was done by Stockton , Fr6mont , and Kearney . The ensuing five months before the cession COMMODORE SLOAT , U. S. N.

They resulted in the departure of all three to the East and the succession of Colonel Richard B.

All doubts and fears were ended , however , on August 6 , 1848 , when news of the ratification of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was received . The territory ceded by Mexico included not only California but Arizona , New Mexico , and Texas . One year 's time was given to all residents of this territory to decide whether they would remain as United States citizens or depart for Mexico . Property rights and Mexican grants and titles were to be fully respected . Governor Mason issued a wise proclamation , in which he assured all the old inhabitants that they would be protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property . But hard-headed American pioneers demanded a better system of government than the Mexican law gave them . decisions* and though this system might suit a primitive pastoral community , it was as obsolete for Americans as the laws of feudal England.1 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that Congress would not adjourn without providing proper officers for the new territory , which was now American in name as well as in fact . President Polk , in a special message to Congress on July 6 , 1848 , called attention to the peculiar situation in California and urged Congress to establish a territorial government . At this time it began to be foreseen by the friends of California that a hard struggle was before them , but it is doubtful whether any one suspected that the fight over California between the two sections would become so bitter as to threaten secession and civil war . Extension of slavery and maintenance of the slave-holding power in Congress were the great issues . The admission of Iowa and Wisconsin had neutralized the South 's advantage in securing Texas . Thus the lines were evenly drawn in the Senate ,  - -  fifteen States on each side ,  --  and the Southern leaders saw clearly that unless they obtained control of the new territory ceded by Mexico all the fruits of the Mexican war would be Under this system the alcalde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court enjoys to-day .

For three years the power of the free States bad been growing at a rate which threatened speedily to place the slave States tary hacking ; yet he declared he would exercise control over the alcaldes appointed and maintain order if possible . He held that no one had any right to move in providing a better government until Congress should act in the matter . Directly opposed to his assumption of power were the majority of the American settlers , who held that they had a perfect right to establish a government so long as Congress failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HALl. , MONTEREY - SCENE OF THE CON5TITLYrIONAL CONVENTION . // // in a feeble minority . The struggle over the Wilmot proviso - which prohibited the introduction of slavery into the territory to be acquired by the Mexican *var-was an earnest of the savage political warfare that was to follow . The pioneer effort for compromise on California was made just after the treaty with ? vlexico . This was the reference of the subject to a committee of eight from the Senate , which decided to admit Oregon , California , and New Mexico as Territories , but to refer the slavery question to the Supreme Court . This satisfied the Senate , but the House promptly refused to adopt it . While California thus served as a bone of contention in Congress , an event occurred that gave an enormous impetus to the movement in favor of State government . This was the discovery of gold by James W. Marshall in Captain Sutter 's mill race at Coloma on January i 9 , r8*8.1 Most significant of all dates in California history is this , for the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chief State of the Pacific coast . Yet , to the men who preceded the gold hunters we must look for the impulse towards a sound government . The Forty-niners aided the movement by sheer force of numbers , but the yeoman 's work was done by the many able men who had helped to conquer California or who came in from the adjoining Territory of Oregon . One of the anomalies of the gold discovery was its slowness in reaching Americans in California . It was midsummer before the news was generally credited in California and Oregon . Then , when people became convinced that the reports were true and that fortunes could be made in a few months in the Sacramento Valley , there was a rush such ' as was never before known in history . Of course the California settlers had the great advantage of proximity to the new El Dorado . Next , per " haps , came those in Honolulu .

They were poor , and they saw in the future only a vista of weary work with small profits , as they had no market for their produce . Suddenly the scattered settlements were electrified by the news of the gold discovery . Those who took part in the rush declare that not less than two-thirds of all those capable of bearing arms swarmed over the Siskiyou Mountains and came down to the gold fields 1 This is the commonly accepted date , but Mr. John S. Hittell has demonstrated in the " Overland Monthly " th' t the actual date was January 24. - LusTok. of the Sacramento . In the mean time the news had spread to the East , to Australia , and to South America . From all quarters came young men as eager for adventure as for gold . Not one in a thousand had any practical knowledge of mining or any plan of remaining in the country after a fortune had been made . Eighty thousand is a conservative estimate of the number of gold hunters who flocked to California in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great majority of the gold seekers were crowded into the Sacramento Valley , where the richest placers had been found on the Sacramento , Yuba , American , and Feather rivers . Sacramento City had been founded on the river hard by Sutter 's historic fort , and was the chief town in the valley . The American passion for corner lots developed early among the miners , and to record transfers some legal officers were required . In January , 1849 , the people of Sacramento accordingly elected a first magistrate and recorder for the district . In San Francisco and San Jose the same trouble was experienced and the same desire was felt for a suitable government . Meetings were held in the three cities , and it was decided to elect delegates to a convention for forming a provisional government . San Francisco was in the most grievous plight because of conflict of authority between the provisional officers . In August , 1847 , Governor Mason had sanctioned the election of a town council , but this went out of existence in December , 1848 . Ar ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud . San Francisco differed from nearly every other large town in California in that it had no basis of native inhabitants . It was almost purely American , and the national desire for self-government led to the election of a legislative assembly and three justices of the peace . The old office of alcalde was to be abolished . This programme was carried out , but the alcalde refused to give up his office . Finally the offices of sherif register , and treasurer were added , and the alcalde was legally ejected . Yet none of the acts of this improvised body was ever legally sanctioned . General Persifer F. Smith had succeeded Mason as military commander , and General Bennett Riley had been appointed military governor . Smith 's duties were to defend California and Oregon from attack and to preserve peace . To Riley was intrusted the difficult task of administering the civil affairs of a land which was neither an acknowledged Territory nor a State . Two months before Riley 's arrival the delegates elected to the convention decided to postpone this meeting until August . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delegates were to meet at Monterey and draft a constitution to be submitted to the people . // Old Bennett Riley was perhaps the best man who could have been selected for governor1 as he was the embodifl*ent of all that was just and impartial in the military system . He had strong convictions ; but , unlike most of the military men who came into prominence in California , he was not prejudiced or yadilating . He made a thorough study of the situation , and when he had once become convinced of the soundness of his position1 neither coaxing nor bullying could move him one jot . His arrival in May brought to a head the whole question of the government of the new territory . There was absolutely no precedent for the cession of the territory , and the neglect of Congress to provide territorial officers left California in the unique position of a land without a government . ? wo opposing theories of the status of the country were held , one by the settlers and the other by the military governor ; yet , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competent court , and remains undecided to this day . Many of the settlers who were most active in demanding that the people should elect their own officers came from Oregon . They were gold hunters , but they had had valuable pioneer training in redeeming Oregon from the wilderness and in working out unaided the problem of self- government . At their head was Peter H. Burnett , a Tennesseean who migrated to Missouri and started for Oregon in the summer of i843 . He was a lawyer , and did good work in the legislative committee of Oregon which drafted a good constitution and established an efficient government . Burnett , who was destined to play an important part in the movement for statehood in Cali PETER II . BURNETT , FIRST GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA . ( FROM A DAGUERREOTYPE. ) // fornia , is a fine specimen of the Western pioneer ; for he is still alive , in full possession of his faculties , at eighty-two years . He had done his part in Oregon , and now he saw the same necessity arising in California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring State . He presided at the first meeting held in Sacramento to devise plans for a provisional governmnent , and in June , 1849 , he became a member of the legislative assembly of San Francisco , and at once took an active part in the movement that resulted in the calling of a constitutional convention . Early in June , Riley issued two proclamations . One , addressed to the people of California , gave a clear summary of the situation and announced a special election for delegates to a convention which he called to meet at Monterey in September for the purpose of forming a territorial or State organization . It also included a list of officials , adapted from the Mexican system , to be elected . The second proclamation , issued a day later , was a formal declaration that the legislative assembly of San Francisco had usurped the powers vested only in Congress . It fell to Burnett to head the settlers ' party in its opposition to the claims of General Riley . The situation was unique in American politics . Riley 's position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , he held , must continue in force until changed by competent authority . The power to replace these laws by others is vested in Congress . The situation differed from that in Oregon , for Oregon was without laws , while California had a complete system , which , though defective , must continue in force until repealed by valid legislative power . California , in fine , resembled Louisiana after the purchase ; and the decision of the Supreme Court recognizing the validity of the laws of Louisiana under French rule formed a safe guide in the present case . Thus , according to Riley 's logic , the San Francisco legislative assembly had usurped powers belonging to Congress , and had absolutely no right to call a convention . The position of the settlers may be summed up in a few words . The moment the treaty took effect , according to their view , the United States Constitution and American laws superseded in California the Mexican civil law ; while Congress refused to legislate for California , the people had the right , under the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not fill the office 1 See article by Francis Lippitt in " Californiana " in of governor ; it was not common sense to ex- th present number. - EnmvoR. pect Americans , unfamiliar with Spanish , to administer the Mexican law , which they did not understand , and which had no bearing on practical life . Finally , a temporary exercise of legislative power by the people was not in violation of the Constitution , but only the practical application of the rights of American citizens.1 Political excitement ran high when General Riley 's two proclamations reached San Francisco on June * . It had been an eventful week . On the 4th the long-expected steamer arrived from Panama . As she came into the harbor the wharf was crowded with men , eager to learn the news of the action of Congress . The majority were confident the new territorial officers were on board , empowered to provide for some representation of California in Congress . Deep was the disgust when it was found that Congress had not only failed to make any provision for the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws to the new territory and had sent a collector to levy the duties . The re sources of Californians in picturesque profanity were sadly taxed on that day . The Plaza , the streets , the saloons , the gambling palaces , echoed to the indignant protests of men who felt the injustice of taxation without representation as keenly as their forefathers smarted under the measures of Lord North . The excitement GR . W. M. OWIN . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY BRADLEY &amp; RULOPSON. ) // found vent in a great mass meeting on the Plaza , or Portsmouth Square - the scene of most of the stirring events in early San Francisco history . Resolutions , written by Burnett , expressed in no uncertain language the feelings of the people . They declared that both parties in Congress evidently expected California to settle the question of her admission , which hinged solely on slavery , and that the quicker this was done the better . They recommended the immediate election of delegates to the constitutional convention . The scenes in Congress during this second struggle over California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirtieth Congress met on December 5 , 1848 , President Polk again presented the claims of California , fortified by Governor Mason 's report , and by letters of Thomas 0 . Larkin , United States consul at Monterey , detailing the importance of the gold discovery and the certainty of an enormous immigration into the new territory . Stephen A. Douglas , who was eager to prevent an open rupture between the two sections , drafted a bill for the admission of all the new territory as the State of California , with the proviso that Congress divide it , after admission , into other States . The judiciary committee pronounced this unconstitutional , and recommended the making of two new Territories out of the ceded domain . The Congress that discussed this question i ; ncluded some of the ablest of American statesmen , yet not one appeared to foresee the importance of California or the significance of the gold discovery . Several of the schemes proposed were puerile and senseless . A motion was even adopted by the committee of the whole to cede back to Mexico all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then have been for this country what Hong Kong is for England on the coast of China . The quarrel over California grew more and more envenomed as the session proceeded , until finally a deadlock resulted . Amendments providing for revenue laws in California had been added to the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill . The followers of Calhoun denounced this as an invidious scheme on the part of the Northern faction to force the issue over California , and they threatened to defeat the appropriation bill and thus leave the Government without funds unless the California section was withdrawn . Congress expired by limitation on Saturday , March 3 , at midnight , but the new President , General Taylor , was not to be inaugurated until Monday . The Southern senators filibustered in the hope of killing the bill , and with it any recognition of California . The Senate Chamber has witnessed many exciting scenes , but none perhaps ever equaled the storm that raged on this night as the hands of the great clock neared the midnight hour . The Southerners insisted that the session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who held that the legislative day ended only with the sitting , at last prevailed .

The steamer which bore this news of congressional inaction brought to California two men , one destined to prominence in the first ten years of California 's stormy political life , the other to brief notoriety , due as much to his eccentricity as to his official position . The first , who showed from the outset his dominating mind , was Dr. William M. Gwin of Mississippi , who had served in Congress , and who came to California with the purpose ofbecoming the first United States senator from the new State . He J.

In several other towns meetings were held approving the San Francisco resolutions , and one assemblage on Mormon Island , in the Sacramento River , pledged itself to discountenance any effort towards secession from the Union . The report of this meeting , with vague rumors of the growing discontent , appeared to confirm the suspicions of General Riley that there was a real plan to form an independent governrnent . He thereupon issued a third proclamation , denouncing the scheme , and asserting that recent orders from Washington confirmed his previous views that the plan of establishing an independent government could not be sanctioned . Burnett at once replied , showing the absurdity of the suspicion that the settlers wanted independence , and making a strong plea for the wisdom and justice of the course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intention wantonly to antagonize General Riley was proved by the action of the delegates in agreeing to hold the convention at Monterey on the ( lay fixed by the governor .

In this interregnum of two months about the only incident worthy of note is furnished by Butler King , President Taylor 's ambassador to the new territory . In Julyhe made an official tour of the mines . He traveled in state , being escorted by General Smith , Commodore Jones , and a body of cavalry under Lieutenant Stoneman , afterwards prominent in the war and lately governor of the State . It was the height of the dry season , when the wide plains of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin glowed under the fierce heat of a semi-tropical sun .

King , however , rose superior to the climate as well as the customs of the far West .

It was vitally important that the man selected for this work should be quick to see the spirit of the people ; but King tried to mold this Western life , which he never comprehended , to fit his orders , and the result was that he played directly into the hands of the men who came so near to securing the greater part of the new territory to the slave-holding States . Gwin used King as he tised others , to carry out his scheme , which was only thwarted by the shrewdness of a few antislavery men in the convention . During the two months before the convention met Gwin had strongly impressed his personality upon California public affairs , and secured election as a delegate to the convention . Although when the convention opened he had been in California only four months , he had managed by his skill and address to become possessed of all the political influences at work and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election of delegates was to give the proslavery men the predominance , although later , when additional delegates were admitted to form a quorum , the Northern men numbered 22 , against m* from the slave-holding States , 7 native Californians , and 4 of foreign birth . The convention met on September T , but was not organized until two days later , for lack of a quorum . The meeting-place was Colton Hall , in Monterey , which had the distinction of being the only plastered house in the new territory . Considering the haphazard way in which the delegates were selected , the convention was an able l ) Ody . The curious mingling of races in California , as well as the youth of the pioneers , was seen in its composition . Of the 48 members 36 were Americans ; New York furnished m i , New England 6 , and Maryland g . Of native Californians there were 7 , while * delegates were of foreign birth . Only two of the native Californians spoke English with any fluency or understood it easily ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings were recorded in English and // Spanish . It was probably the most youthful legislative body that ever met ; 9 men being under thirty , 23 over thirty but under forty , T 2 between forty and fifty , and only 4 over fifty years of age . Four members had been in California only four months ; nine had been there one year or less . There is pretty good evidence that Gwin went to the convention with the purpose of becoming its president and thus guiding its deliberations , but the native Californians and several of the pronounced antislavery men had strong prejudice against him , and Robert Scmpie , a typical Western backwoodsman , who was equally ready with the rifle and the printer 's stick , was chosen to preside . Captain Marcy , who had arrived with Stevenson 's New York regiment , was elected secretary , and J. Ross Browne , who in later years gained fame on the coast as humorist and traveler , was appointed official reporter . Of all the members Uwin easily occupies the foremost place . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Halleck , what he said had great weight , and in nearly every controversy he either carried his point or effected a compromise well-nigh as advantageous as a victory . A master of the arts of the parliamentarian , Gwin was constantly called upon to exercise his skill , and it is no exaggeration to say that his readiness , courtesy , suggestiveness , and persuasive powers have *arely been surpassed in a deliberative body . A careful reading of the debates in this convention , aided by the suggestions of survivors , proves conclusively that Gwin had the settled purpose to secure so large a territory for California that Congress would feel bound to divide it . He was too shrewd a politician to hope to commit the new territory to slavery . The spirit shown at public meetings of settlers and miners which he had attended proved that slavery would not be tolerated . Hence instead of pressing the slavery issue , he devoted his energies to securing the best u4timate advantages for the slave-holding States . California had a coast line of over five hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rocky Mountains . What was more simple and logical than to secure the admission of this immense domain as free territory and then persuade Congress to divide it , giving the southern half- the lion 's share - to slavery ? Division on no other than lateral lines seemed feasible at that time , as the great central region was regarded as a desert . A new State must possess a coast line , and the most natural division was on the historic parallel of 360 30 ' - that color line that was drawn with such monotonous regularity by Calhoun and his followers . In this work Gwin betrayed masterly political manipulation . He made an easy conquest of Butler King and Halleck , and these allies he used to win over the suspicious native Californians . It was not difficult to prove to them that they would be benefited by the erection of Southern California into a new territory , distinct from the North . Then , as now , it was a plausible argument that the southern half of the country differed so materially from the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quick to see that in the North their political supremacy was clear gone - swept away by the thousands of gold hunters . Gwin shrewdly intimated that the policy backed by the representative of the Administration must be the winning one , and that the men who aided King and himself in getting the admission of the whole Western territory could depend upon recompense in legislation that would lighten the burden of taxation and secure them in possession of their royal grants of land , measured not by miles , but by leagues . The Californians had everything to gain by this alliance , while on the other hand the settlers who opposed the admission of so vast a territory had nothing to offer them . It was to the strongest sentiments of human nature that Gwin appealed , and his success seemed a foregone conclusion . That he failed to carry his point in the convention was due mainly to the superb fight made by Charles T. Botts , a Virginian , aided by the firm backing of the old settlers , Semple , Hastings , Shannon , McDougall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority for his plan . On the second occasion , when the measure passed the house , having been previously adopted in committee of the whole , the most exciting scene of the convention ensued . McCarver , an old Oregon pioneer , moved for immediate and final adjournment , crying out passionately , " We have done enough mischief . " Snyder shouted , " Your constitution is gone Your constitution is gone ! " For a few moments it looked as though the convention had hopelessly split upon this rock , but finally an adjournment was secured to the following day , when , after long debate , the boundary was fixed as it stands to-day , with the Sierra Nevada and the Colorado as the eastern line , with the great central desert , to be formed later into Nevada , Utah , and Arizona.1 The constitution adopted by the convention was one that did good service for thirty years , until the Kearney agitation swept it away in a great outburst of popular feeling against railway and land monopolies , which , gathering force for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few powerful corpo1 For an account of how this was done see " Califor**iana " in this number of THE CENTURY-EDITOR. // rations and a small clique of millionaires who fancied they owned the State . The constitution was largely drawn from that of New York , with some provisions by the then recently adopted constitution of Iowa . What will strike any reader of the debates is the strong desire of the members to secure the rights of settlers and the equally strong wish to make education as free and as thorough as possible . Two sections in each township were set apart as school lands , seventy-two sections for a university , as well as five per cent . of the proceeds of the sale of all public lands . Semple and McCarver , both self-made men , who came up from the people , and who therefore placed a high value on free education , made eloquent pleas for a liberal school fund . Semple argued that California could have a university equal to any abroad , as she had the gold-dust to pay for " talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the president of Oxford University here by offering a sufficient salary . " Another amusing feature was furnished by the discussion over the seal of the new State . Every interest wished to be represented , but the old settlers were determined to have the grizzly bear in the foreground . This naturally excited Vallejo , who had suffered at the hands of the Bear Flag party , and he grimly suggested that Ursus of the Sierra have a lasso about his neck . The debate ended in the adoption of the well-known design - Minerva , type of the entrance of California full grown into the Union , with the grizzly at her feet ; wheat-sheaf and vine , the miner and his tools , represented the leading industries ; while the l ) ackground was the bay of San Francisco framed in by the Sierra Nevada , and over all the magic word , " Eureka . " One of the men who worked hard iii the convention , but who has received little credit for his labor from the historians , was Captain Halleck , the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riley made io attempt to influence the convention , but Halleck was tacitly understood to speak for him . Halleck had great legal ability , and he drafted the excellent public papers that Riley issued . He also prepared an excellent digest of the Mexican laws for the use of Americans . He spoke frequently in the convention and always to the point , and no survivor of that body fails to declare that his judgment was sound and that his services were invaluable because of his intimate knowledge of the country . Some recognition of his merit has been made by the erection of a statue to his memory in Golden Gate Park , San Francisco . Of the native Californians in the convention , Carrillo , who had been a valued adviser of 787 Pio Pico , the last Mexican governor of California , was the ablest . He made the best speeches , and seemed to have the clearest apprehension of the great change that had come over the country and of the new measures that were needed . More popular than any of his Californian associates was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate in the Sonoma Valley , stretching from San Pablo Bay for forty miles up the beautiful valley . His sister had married Jacob P. Leese , an early pioneer , and Vallejo always professed the warmest admiration for the Americans . Even the rude treatment he received from the Bear Flag party did not sour his temper . Like Sutter , he had a magnificent opportunity to take a foremost place in the affairs of the new territory ; but he was formed for the life he had led for forty years ,  --  the pleasant life of a landed grandee ,  - -  and he had neither the energy nor the mental suppleness to adapt himself to the new regime . To Vallejo , however , belongs the great credit of using his large influence to persuade his fellow-Californians to accept the new government cheerfully , and to do all in their power to strengthen the hands of the conservative men who he saw clearly formed the only hope of safety from wholesale spoliation of land and herds . Long before the convention was over candidates for office had announced themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From all accounts it was as unique as the other features of State-making . Peter H. Burnett , who was then Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court appointed by General Riley , was the most l ) prominent candidate for governor , his opponents being W. S. Sherwood , a New York lawyer ; Captain Sutter ; Geary , the popimlar last alcalde of San Francisco ; and *Vilham M. Stewart , who had been prominent in the work of securing a State convention . Gwin *snd Fr*mont were the leading candidates for the United States Senate . All started out on electioneering tours that extended into many of the new mining camps . Th* Argonauts of m849 in the remote camps had cavalier methods of settling the claims of candidates . A man who " put on style " was sure to be defeated . A " boiled " shirt could be tolerated , but not a silk hat , and there were grave doubts about the honesty of a candidate who did not chew tobacco or take his liquor like a man . Burnett 's great claim to popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . his rigid honesty , and his knowledge of the law . He had some amusing adventures on his tour of the mines that would have discouraged any one except a pioneer . At Mud Springs , in the heart of a rich placer-mining country , the l ) roprietor of the canvas hotel honored his guest with the best // bed in his big lodging-tent , and the weary candidate hoped for sweet and refreshing sleep , but during the night rain fell in torrents , the wind arose , tore away the fastenings of the tent , and the structure collapsed . The guests were forced to hug the main pole with the loose canvas flapping about them and the rain beating without . Of this unhappy town the writer has a vivid recollection in 1857 , when very heavy rain swelled the creek that formed the center of the main street , and the floors of all the shops and houses were two feet under water . Many of the miners regarded the election as a huge joke . A typical instance of the way miners voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One fellow , who had voted a straight ticket , gave his reasons over the bar in the saloon in this original fashion : " When I left home I was bound to go it blind . ' I did go it blind in crossing to California , and I m not going to stop now . I voted for the constitution , and I ye never seen the constitution . I voted for all the candidates , and I do n't know ad d one of'em . I m going it blind all through - I am ! " The first election resulted in a small vote . Three-qiarters of the American miners did not leave their . tents to go to the polls . The Mexicans and native Californians took considerable pride in casting their first ballot , though in later years they have not betrayed any keen interest in politics , and they have never held the balance of power which early observers feared because of their numerical majority . Burnett was elected governor , receiving 6716 votes ; his next competitor , Sherwood , getting 3188 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , 1849 , the first legislature met at San Jose , that city having secured the honor of the State capitol by guaranteeing to furnish suitable buildings . The conditions were found even more primitive than at Monterey . The Capitol building was a rude , unfurnished wooden structure . The Assembly , composed of thirty-six members , succeeded in using the large upper chamber , but for several weeks the sixteen senators were forced to meet at a private residence . Five days after the first meeting Governor Burnett was installed , General Riley having on the same day resigned his powers as governor . Despite the discomforts and the lack of all the usual facilities , this first California legislature went to work manfully . Again was seen the triumph of the pioneer over circumstances that would have paralyzed an older community . The first business was the election of United States senators , for it was wisely urged that the presence of these men at Washington would hasten admission of the State . Among the candidates were Butler King , the eccentric Administration agent ; Fr6-mont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally regarded as the Bear Flag hero ; Gwin , whose ability had been proved in the convention ; Geary , the San Francisco alcalde ; Halleck , whose friends claimed this reward for his services ; and Semple , whose aspirations were as lofty as his stature . Fr6mont was the most popular , partly because of his prominent part in the conquest , and partly because he was known to have behind him Senator Benton , a political power who could do much for California . Fr6mont was elected on the first ballot and Gwin on the second . George W. Wright and Edward Gilbert had been elected representatives . It has been common for Californians to regard this first legislative body as a roistering crowd that drank and swore like the troops in Flanders . But it must be said that these pioneer legislators proved far more industrious than any of their successors . They framed in a few weeks an excellent body of laws . Although they included a few rampant proslavery men , they were mainly the old settlers who had worked for a State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body the unsavory but picturesque title of " The legislature of a thousand drinks . " This was Thomas Jefferson Green , a professional politician who was attracted to California , like Gwin , Butler King , Geary , Broderick , and others , by the hope of a good office and political influence . Green seemed to look upon the session of the legislature as a picnic . He had a room near the State House liberally supplied with all kinds of drinks , and after every adjournment his sonorous voice was heard crying , " Come , let s take a thousand drinks ! " Survivors of this legislature declared that Green was a seasoned vessel , and seldom appeared the worse for potations that would have put Squire Western under the table before midday . Even with the inducement of free liquor always on tap the drinking was not general . The little coterie that Green gathered about him had no influence upon the working members . Well would it have been for California had every succeeding legislature been as honest and as efficient as this pioneer body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unknown . They felt deeply their responsibility to constituents , and they would have regarded the methods of legislative politicians of the present time as an insult to common decency . While the first California legislature was wrestling with a code of laws for the new State the fight over Calif@rnia was renewed in Congress with greater bitterness than before . President Polk in his message made a strong plea for the admission of California . He set // forth briefly the causes that led the people to decide to form a constitution , declared there was reason to believe they would soon apply for admission as a State , and warned Congress against introducing sectional issues that were dangerous to the Union . Towards the close of January , 1850 , Henry Clay introduced his compromise bill for the admission of California , which , though greatly modified , formed the ground on which an agreement was finally reached after six months of debate . The main feature of Clay 's plan was that California be admitted with suitable boundaries and without slavery . A sop to the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mexico should be erected into territorial governments unhampered by any restrictions on slavery . He also introduced clauses forbidding the interference of Congress with the slave-trade between the States , and calling for more effective enforcement of the fugitive slave law . Clay 's compromise , though artfully devised , did not accomplish the desired object of placating the Southern leaders . Debate began immediately upon their introduction . Conspicuous among the proslavery men were Jefferson Davis and Foote , who argued that the Missouri Compromise line should be recognized throughout the new territory and that slavery should be valid below that line . Clay vehemently opposed this , holding that the people of the Far West should decide for themselves whether they wished to establish slavery ; if they chose to introduce it , then he would favor the admission of California and New Mexico with such slavery provisions in their constitutions . It was at this critical period that Gwin and Frdmont and the California representatives arrived in Washington . They brought the new constitution of California , which President Taylor transmitted to Congress with the notification that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A motion was made to refer the message to the committee on Territories , but this procedure was more than Calhoun could endure . He was greatly incensed over the action of the Californians in prohibiting slavery , and though merely the shadow of his old self with strength so spent that he could not speak in the Senate , he prepared a speech against the admission of California . It was read by Mason of Virginia . The gist of this address , which proved to be the dying utterance of the great proslavery leader , was a vigorous attack on the admission of California , because its people in assuming to meet in convention and adopt a constitution had been guilty of a revolutionary act . He held that there was no excuse for such open defiance of Congress , and hence he suggested that California be remanded to the condition of a Territory . To admit her as a State , with this constitution just adopted , would be to bar out the South from the territory acquired from Mexico and imperil the political equilibrium of the sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , second only in its impassioned passages to the reply to Hayne . Any paraphrase of its majestic language is flat and commonplace . It was an eloquent appeal for the freedom of the new territory which the South had vainly struggled for in the interests of slavery . He closed with the passage against " peaceable secession " which has become a classic in American literature . The California senators , of course , were appealed to by the rival leaders . Fr*mont was in favor of anything which Benton championed , and Benton was determined to see the new State admitted , even if it led to the civil war that Calhoun and Jefferson Davis predicted . Gwin was placed in a very embarrassing position , as to carry out the desires of his constituents he must oppose Calhoun and his party . He had a stormy interview with President Taylor , who declared that whether California was admitted or not he intended to drive the Texan authorities out of New Mexico . Gwin refused to cooperate with Taylor , which aroused the wrath of the old soldier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference with Calhoun , his old master in political arts , who roused his dying energies to try to convince his friend that the admission of California as a State would result in the supremacy of the North and the rupture of the Union . Gwin was greatly impressed with the earnestness of the dying statesman and the gloomy prophecies that he made , but he refused to adopt the policy decided upon by his party in Congress . To escape from his embarrassing position he went to New York , but after a short stay he Was sent for by Henry Clay . In some unpublished memoranda Gwin has left an interesting account of this conference . It throws so much light on the causes that led to Clay 's compromise bill that I give a portion of it entire . He says : When the California delegation reached Washington and asked for the admission of the State into the Union , I was in favor of its being acted on as a separate and independent measure , and with the least practicable delay . I found Mr. Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others who were the great leaders in Congress at that time , in favor of this policy . But afterwards they changed their views and I was sent for by Mr. Clay , who gave me the reason . He said he had been called upon by members of the House of Representatives // 790 and informed that a sufficient number of the members of that body from the Southern States to control its action had entered into a solemn compact , which they would execute at the risk of their lives , never to permit a bill to pass the House admitting California until the right of the South to carry their property to the Territories of the United States was first guaranteed by law . Mr. Clay was incredulous ; he thought it impossible for such a body of men to come to so desperate a resolve - which was revolution itself . He called for facts , which were furnished him ; names also were given , and , if necessary to remove all doubts from his mind , it was proposed to bring each member who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declaration to him in person . Mr. Clay said that then , for the first time in his life , he thought the Union in immediate peril , and that the short remnant of days left to him would see it destroyed . He at once determined upon the course he would pursue , and the first person he consulted was Colonel Benton - with whom he had been up to that time acting in full concert for the immediate admission of California into the Union  --  and my colleague , Colonel Fr6-mont . The interview lasted for an hour , and he exerted all the powers he possessed to induce Colonel Benton to join him in postponing the admission of the State until the question of the territorial government was settled , but in vain . Colonel Benton sternly ref*ised , and Mr. Clay confessed to me that he did what he had never done before in his life - he implored a fellow-man to do his duty , but all to no effect . That was their last interview and intercourse in life . Mr. Clay then sought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully , I had no doubt of the facts , and told him that I never wished to see California forced into the Union in a revoutionary way which would destroy its existence , and that I was willing that the admission of the State should be considered in connection with all the questions that were then agitating the country . In the great debate on Clay 's compromise , Seward , then coming to the front as a leader , made one of the most vigorous speeches . He declared that the settlers had shown the proper spirit , and that if not granted admission to the Union speedily California would be perfectly justified in founding with the other Pacific coast States an independent nation . Four days after Webster 's speech the California delegation , in response to a demand , presented a memorial which reviewed in detail the work done in the new State , its great resources , and its urgent need of admission to the Union . This memorial ignored the slavery issue , but it simply added fuel to the partisan flame . To Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both sets were referred to a special committee . The result was the omnibus bill of which , aside from the compromise features , the admission of California was the chief proposition . Again the I ) artisan debate broke out with increased rancor . Four months of wrangling ensued , ending finally in the passage of the bill for the admission of California , separated from the compromise resolutions . On August is , by a vote of thirty-four to eighteen , the Senate passed it . Jefferson Davis , Mason , and others could not see it adopted without a last word , so they issued a protest which summed up all the Southern hatred of national sanction of the free constitution of the California settlers . This protest had no effect on the lower house , which on September 7 also passed the bill , by one hundred and fifty to fifty-six . On September 9 , 1850 , the act was formally approved by President Fillmore , and within the next two days the California delegation was sworn in - not , however , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The South had been worsted at every point ; but it was a costly victory for the country , for a decade later burst out the pent-up fires of partisan hatred , whose lurid gleams were seen during this long struggle over California . The California legislature adjourned in April , but it was the i8th of October before news came of the admission of the State . These six months of waiting tired the souls of impatient Californians more than all the previous period of doubt and uncertainty . Complaints came from several of the southern counties of burdensome taxes that would fall upon them should Congress admit the whole of California as a State . Among Americans , however , the desire for statehood was so strong that many openly advocated separation from the Union . In no other period of their history , perhaps , was the self-control of the Americans in California more thoroughly proved than in these dreary months . Climate and life , then as now , conspired to rob the settler of patience . He yearned to gain fortune or to compass any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral stamina disunion influences would have prevailed and the world would have seen the fiasco of an independent state on the Pacific coast . But that rare judgment and foresight which comes with the Anglo-Saxon strain in American blood again prevailed . Some of the old Bear Flag party emerged again and gave vent to their anger in violent language ; but these manifestations were merely the froth on the surface . Loyalty to the Union before they formed an actual part of it was as strong as it was eleven years later when Sumter was fired on . Five weeks after California became a State the news reached San Francisco . The Panama mail steamer Oregon was sighted one October morning by the lookout on Telegraph Hill . He rubbed his glasses to make out what had transformed her familiar lines . Surely she was dressed in all her bunting , and now as she entered the harbor the rapid discharge of her // gun conveyed the long-expected news . Old pioneers can not speak with unmoistened eyes of the scene that followed . Nerves had been strung to so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole city swarmed to the water front and the hills around it . Merchants rushed to close their stores as they did on that other day , sad and long to be remembered , when the news came over the wires that Lincoln was assassinated . By a common impulse every one ran to the old Plaza . There were cheers , shouts , ringing of bells , blowing of whistles , and booming of guns . Provident passengers who brought copies of New York newspapers sold them readily for five dollars a copy . At night the young city was ablaze with bonfires , illuminations , and rockets . By steamer , stage , and pony express the nexvs was carried to all parts of the State . On many roads there was keen opposition between rival stage lines , and this led to lively races to see which should be the first bearer of the welcome news . Crandall was one of the pioneer stage drivers who with Foss and " Hank " Monk made a reputation for daredevil skillein handling six-horse teams on bad mountain roads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news reached San Francisco , with his coach decked with flags . Governor Burnett was beside him on the box . Down they dashed through the level Santa Clara Valley , then one wide tawny plain , unbroken by fence or farm-house . Behind them came the rival stage , its driver urging his Mexican mustangs to their utmost speed . As Crandall 's coach passed the houses on the road all on board swung their hats and shouted " California is admitted to the Union ! " and the cheers that rounded out this shout were taken up by the delighted people . Ex-Governor Burnett is an old man now , but he grows young again when he describes this race , full of excitement to the very end , when Crandall dashed up to the main hotel in San Jose in a cloud of dust , like one of the Homeric heroes , the victor in one of the hardest stage races ever run in this country . The formal celebration of the admission was held on September 29 , and was the first of the annual commemorations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California life . San Francisco was young , but it showed then that passion for picturesque street spectacles which has made its parades unique and noteworthy . The place of honor in the procession was given to the native Californians , who had come so cordially under the new regime . They were well represented by a band of young men , superbly mounted and richly dressed , who carried a blue satin banner with the inscription in gold letters , " California : E Pluribus Unum . " Then came the pioneers ; not old and bent as to-day , but in the full strength of young manhood . They bore a banner with the State seal and the inscription , " Far West , Eureka , 1846 . California Pioneers , organized August , 1850 . " The banner also bore a device of historical significance - a typical Yankee stepping ashore and meeting a native Californian , with serape thrown over his shoulder and lasso in hand . After the army and navy officers , the Mexican war veterans , and the civil dignitaries came the unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gala costume of sky-blue , yellow , red , and brown silk blouses , with flowery skirts such as are worn at their annual New Year ceremonies , and carrying a blue silken banner with the legend , " The China Boys . " Following them came a large car in which were seated thirty boys , each representing a State , while in the center was a white-robed girl , like a fairy in the Christmas pantomime , upon whose gleaming breastplate were the words , " California : the Union , it must and shall be preserved . " The volunteer fire department , that had already had one great battle with a fire that well-nigh swept the city off the sand dunes , turned out in great force on the Plaza . There were the usual exercises - an oration and a poem that fired the patriotic heart . Forty years seems a brief period in pastoral California , where the hand of time moves as slowly as in the land of the Aztecs ; but in California as a State it has seen marvelous changes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The climate makes him precocious , and he has a keen eye for the material side of life ; yet withal he has a large fund of sentiment , and no South Carolinian in the days before the war was ever prouder of the Palmetto State than is the youthful Californian of this commonwealth , whose birth marked a period of national travail that ended only with the freedom of four million slaves . A touch of provincialism there is in this State pride , for to most of these younger men the blue line of the Sierras is the eastern boundary of the only world they know ; yet their perfect confidence in everything Californian is , in its way , a source of strength . To General A. M. Winn first came the idea of a union of the young men born in California , in order to perpetuate the memory of the founders of the State . The society , formed at his suggestion in 1875 , under the rather florid name of " Native Sons of the Golden West , " began with a roll of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of September - the anniversary of the admission of California to the Union - was made a legal holiday throughout // the State ; every year has seen it observed by the Native Sons , who have increased in fifteen years to 8ooo members . The New England Society of California Pioneers visited San Francisco last May , and the old men looked vainly for landmarks that they could identify in a city which has sprawled over miles of sand dunes and has neared the Golden Gate . San Francisco 's growth in these forty years is typical of the enormous progress of California . Changed is the old order of mining life , gone forever the supremacy of the pioneer gold hunter with pan and rocker ; but in his place is the scientific mining engineer , using machinery that is the wonder of the world ; the wheat-grower , whose steam plow turns a mile-long furrow and whose harvest hands camp at night in the vast fields over which they move ; the fruit-grower , who has made the level valleys and even the steep foothills smile with fruitage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apricot ; and , best of all , the tiller of small farm and orchard , who is proving that in this Italy of the far West may be seen the ideal country life , with work out-of-doors which refined women may share in without risk of coarsening their hands or their natures . California to-day , with its thoroughly American people , of tireless energy and equally great selfcontrol , is the best monument to the wisdom of the pioneers who laid the foundations of its statehood .
