txt " The Committee on Foreign Relations has agreed upon its report , and it means war . " This statement was made to-night calmly and deliberately by a Senator who had just read the preamble and resolutftons drawn up by the committee , who never has been a jingo , and who has been classed since the present crisis came on as conservative . The Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate agreed upon its programme this afternoon . Nothing now remains to be done except the actual preparation of the report and its submission to the Senate . Senator Davis , Chairman of the committee , is at work on the report to-night . The expectation is that he will complete it in time to submit it for the final approval of the committee to-morrow morning , in which case it will go to the Senate some time in the afternoon . The report will be lengthy , including a statement of the reasons on which the committee bases the recommendations which , as the most conservative members believe , mean war with Spain . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will go further . It is the desire of the members of the committee to follow th wishes of the President as far as they can do so conscientiously , and every effort will be made to avoid the appearance of any conflict with the Executive . The Case Against Spain . The evidences of Spain 's inability to maintain order in Cuba , as supplied by Senator Proctor 's memorable speech , by testimony taken by the committee itself , and by the reports of the American Consular officers , will be set forth . The evidences of Spain 's responsibility for the destruction of the battleship Maine , and the death of 260 American sailors will be produced , and the intimation strongly made that that act was itself one of war . The resolutions which will accompany the report will be brief , covering , it is said , a single sheet of paper . They will be preceded by a preamble , prepared by Senator Gray of Delaware , in which the grounds of intervention by the United States in Cuba will be set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be devoted to the Maine , and another , there is good ground for believing , will touch upon the amazing revelations of misery , suffering , and death made in the Consular reports laid before Congress yesterday . A member of the Foreign Relations Committee is authority for the statement that the resolutions proper will declare for two things , and two things only . These are : 1 . A Statement of the right of the Cuban people to be free and independent , without recognition of the present Republic of Cuba . 2 . Immediate armed intervention to bring about that independence , as the only means of restoring peace to the island . The Resolution Mandatory . The resolutions will be mandatory . They will direct the President to use the military and naval forces of the United States " at once " for the purposes of intervention . They will not leave either the question of intervening or of when to intervene to the discretion of the President . He will be commanded explicitly to employ the army and navy to remove the Spanish flag from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the committee admit sounds of war , real and earnest . It is understood that a supplemental report will be submitted at the same time by five members of the committee , favoring the recognition of the Republic of Cuba as it now exists . This will not be a minority report in the sense of opposing the report of the whole committee . The advocates of recognition , led by Senator Foraker , agreed to the reporting of resolutions which did not include recognition , on the understanding that their own proposition for such recognition should be presented at the same time and the Senate should be given an opportunity to vote on it . Mr. l'oraker and those on the committee who stand with hin. on the question claim that a majority of the Senators favor recognition before intervention and that their resolution will pass . The House Committee on Foreign Affairs has agreed on the Senate resolutions , and unless something entirely unexpected occurs will report them to the House to-morrow . It has been a busy day with the two Foreign Committees . On their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the committeemen realized that they must decide quickly or else the bodies which they represented might not wait for their lead . The Committee on Foreign Relations held a meeting at 10 o'clock this morning and continued in session until the Senate met at noon . The discussion was resumed when the committee reconvened in the afternoon , and continued until Consul General Lee appeared before the committee to add his testimony to what they had already heard about the sinking of the Maine . Gen. Lee , however , told the committee little that it did not know before . The House committee met at 10 o'clock . Soon afterward the Democratic members and Mr. Newlands of Nevada , the silver Republican , withdrew , so as to allow the Republican majority to determine upon their course of action . The Republican members continued in session up to 3 o'clock , when , by agreement , the Democrats joined them , and the draft of the resolutions which the majority had agreed upon , and which are a duplicate of the Senate resolutions , was submitted for their approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into caucus and the Republicans retired , with the understanding that the full committee will meet at 10 o'clock to-morrow . Consul General Lee will appear before the committee at that time , and soon after 12 o'clock , according to the present programme , it will make its report to the House . The Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee have adopted the following resolution , which they will offer in committee as a substitute for the majority report : Resolved , by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress asrembled : Section ** United States Government hereby recognizes the independence of the Republic of Cuba .
