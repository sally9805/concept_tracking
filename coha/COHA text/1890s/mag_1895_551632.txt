IN in . Edi/ed by Mary G. Powell . ILLIAM GREGORY , the author of the following journal of a tour in New England in 1771 , was born in Ayrshire , Scotland , and came to Virginia in 1760 . For five years or more he lived in Fredericks* burg , where he belonged to the same lodge of Freemasons as George Washington . In 1766 he moved to New Haven , Connecticut , to engage in business with another Scot - William Glenn . They kept a general store , exporting horses , cattle , fish , lumber , etc. , to the West Indies , and bringing back rum , molasses and sugar . *I'his business was discontinued in 1774 , when the young partners found it prudent to display their loyalty to the mother country by winding up their affairs and returning home . William Gregory , the son of him whose journal follows , came over to Alexandria , Virginia , in 1807 , and there , in 1875 , died , leaving a numerous progeny . Tuesday , Sep/ember 17 , 1771 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grace of God sett off from New Haven on a journey toward Boston . Baited my horse and dined at Doolittle 's , Washingford , upon a very good dinner . Arrived in the evening at Hartford , put up at Butt 's Tavern all night . Slept little on account of a great headache from riding all day in the sun , besides being saddle sick . Nothing material happened , only saw the town , which is handsome for a town in Connecticut . Sep/ember iS . Sett out from Hartford very much galled , came to Suffield and dined , from thence to Springfield , where I passed two ferries , oated my horse , and 343 , fell in company with five women , with whom I rid in company as far as Kingston or Palmer to Mr. Scott 's Tavern ; overtook the coach . My horse tired . Put him in pasture , eat my supper and went to bed very much fatigued . This day rid through a charming country on a good road . Sep/ember 19 . Slept pretty well last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rid as far as Brookfield , and breakfasted and stayed until my two widows , one married woman and two young girls came up . Kept alongside of them for fourteen miles , but finding they would only be a bill of costs , and no advantage , I dropped them . I jogged on the road solitary enough . This is a very mountainous country and bad roads . Dined at Spencer , at Whitemore 's . After I refreshed my horse in the pasture , I pursued my way towards Worcester , along with two Scotch-Irishmen , who were glad to hear somebody speak broad . They left me after riding three miles , and I came up with the five women once more at Worcester . I put up at one Howard 's . The coach proceeded . This is a very handsome place and county town , and court now sits , so that the Tavern is quite full . This place lies east and west , a pretty situation , forty-seven miles from Boston . Weather still continues good , but the country very mountainous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacGregor 's of Londonderry , New England , which caused a little more respect paid me . I said he was my grand uncle and passed well so . I slept with a man who came to bed to me and got up long before me , so that I knew not what he was . A good many stragglers live or rather breathe hereabouts . This country , never less its being mountainous , is very fertile of all the necessaries of life . // Sep/ember 20 . Turned out this morning about six o'clock , paid my damage at Howard 's amounting to 135. 0 . S. or 25. 10 lawful . From thence I proceeded to the barber 's shop to be shaved and dressed , which was by the little gross Irishman . From thence I proceeded on my way and came to Shrewsbury , where I baited my horse and self at the sign of the Lamb , my horse and self delighting in short stages , both being jaded . Kept on my way after breakfast towards Marlbro and arrived there after eleven . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself by way of refreshment , being almost choked with dust . Dined here , the day prQving very hot and the roads dry . There is a fine pond here with a pretty sail boat for pleasuring . Young people here very sickly with the throat distemper , which is fatal to a good many , as they tell me . Charming fertile country this way , being thirty miles west of Bo&amp;ton and the road crowded with people going and coming from that metropolis . I proceeded from Marlbro towards Sudbury , where is a causeway about a mile long through very extensive medows . This is a very good country . Stopped and oated Dick . From thence I stretched along towards Watertown within ten miles of Boston , and put up at my good friend 's house , Ben . Learnard , who is a widower with a fine daughter . Vessels of twenty or thirty tons come from Boston up here loaded , and I believe carry on considerable trade . Here I spent the evening with several agreeable ladies . As soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slept comfortably and soundly . My reckoning this night came to I 9S. 7 , equal to about Is. io leg . September 21 . Arose betimes and pursued my way , rejoicing that I had but eight miles to Boston and that through as delightful a country as ever I saw . From Watertown I came to Cambridge , where I stopped and eat breakfast . From thence I pursued my way and passed by the College , which are pretty good buildings for America . The name of the college is Harvard or Cambridge . From thence I sett off and came to Charleston and crossed over to Boston . Ferriage for man and horse four coppers . My next employment was to seek out lodgings . I jogged along with a slow but solemn pace through most of the town unknown . At last I alighted in King Street opposite the Bristol Coffee House , at one Mr. Coburn 's , a civil man who keeps private lodgings and which suited me vastly better than a tavern . There was a man-of-war and a fine merchant ship arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into James McMaster 's store , seeing his name above the door . Got acquainted with him , and he shewed me some part of the town . This afternoon he also introduced me to Captain Millar and some Scotch captains . We went and drank punch at Captain Service 's with them . McMaster 's brother , Kipplefoot , is in London , but expected out in three weeks ; he brags prodigiously and . tells of the thousands of pounds he sells of goods . I find he is not much esteemed here for all his boasting . September 22 . This day being Sunday , I proposed going to some place of Worship . I applied to the barber who lives next door to put my hair in some kind of order , that I might look decent and cleanly , being a stranger , dressing hair being customary on the Lord 's Day for all their sanctity . I forgot to mention that I live in the place where they say the massacre was , almost opposite the Custom House , being the largest street in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went to the new Boston Church along with J. McMaster and heard Mr. Howard . In the afternoon I went to the New Stone Chapel , and we had the sweetest music I ever heard , with a sermon from Revelations . This church is very handsome , and well painted and carved in the inside ; the outside making no brilliant appearance . Before we went into church , we caused our legs to carry us up to Beacon Hill , the highest spot in all the island , where we had a charming view of the town , harbor and shipping , this place taking its name from their making a light here upon any emergency and alarming the country on the approach of danger . They have a large ring fixed on the top of a large stick , to which they fix a barrel of tar and set afire . This they say will bring in five // fifty ? thousand brave fellows quickly . At the time that the troops lay here they say they were on the point of lighting the tar barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will lie like the devil , their words can not be depended upon , - very frothy and great boasters . But the men-of-war here lying close up to the town make them sing small . They are pretty quiet just now , politics being at an end , every one being intent upon his own business . But they say they do not want the men-of-war , and do not know what so many of them are sent here for . After church I proceeded home with J. McMaster , and drank punch till the going down of the sun , when we sallied forth into the street , and then proposed going to see Captain Service , a brother of Andrew 's . I was introduced to him , and begun to count kindred , but could not make it out , he nor I knowing but little of relations . He introduced me directly to Mrs. Service , to whom he was married lately . She was born in Islay , but brought out to New York very young . They used me very kindly , bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in town . I spent the evening there very agreeably with Captain Millar , Captain Noble and some other Scotch captains who are building vessels here for the Virginia trade . Half after nine o'clock I got up and bid good night , but instead of going home , I found myself at the opposite end of the town , two miles from my lodgings . I tacked about , and after running through Lord knows how many crooked streets , I arrived in King Street to my great joy . I smoked a pipe , jawed a little and went to bed . Monday , Sep/ember 23 . Being cloudy and the wind easterly . I was entertained with something quite new and agreeable to me . Yesterday being the coronation day of George III. , it was to have been celebrated , but its being the Lord 's Day and Admiral Montgomerie being very desirous not to give any umbrage to the saints in this good town of Boston , postponed the affair until to-day . The admiral 's ship was dressed in all the colors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoisted on board of a man-of-war . She was the finest sight I ever saw , a sixty-four-gun ship and very beautiful . The whole of her colors , amounting to two hundred , were hoisted up in one minute , and continued blowing in the wind , being an easy breeze until sunsett , when all of them were lowered again in one minute , which was amazing to me . At twelve o'clock noon the batterys fired in town , and at one o'clock the admiral 's ship called the captain 's , and all the men-of-war in the harbor fired a round of twenty-one guns , which made the Town to shake , and the great guns on Castle William likewise fired after the men-of-war was done . Nothing more material happened this day , only seeing some more of the town , and the more I saw of it the more confused it seems . I find no regularity . Captain Service was kind enough to me both fore and after noon , and shew me places which I was very much obliged to him for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McMaster 's store , he opening goods just arrived from London , shipped by Kipplefoot or Patrick . About eight o'clock I came home , eat supper and spent the remainder of the evening with some Salem ladies , smoked my pipe and went to bed . Tuesday , Sep/ember 21 . Nothing material happened to-day , only I ventured to walk without a guide . Came across Captain Millar at the north ship-yards , and it being very near punch time , we steered to Captain Service 's house and had our Meridian very good . I dined with Captain Service . This day after dinner we looked out for a sail boat and sailed down to Castle William . This is a very strong place , and commands the entrance to the harbor very effectually . There is some very heavy cannon here , forty-two pounders some , but the breastwork being of brick and the wail so thin would make it very dangerous in case of attack , as the bricks would fly and kill more men than the guns . The platforms are very much out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred of soldiers at the Castle , all genteel healthylooking fellows . We drank two b6wls of punch , paid for it and came away , having no acquaintance here . About seven o'clock we.sett off for Boston , and took in // an officer passenger , but the wind being right ahead , and that dying away , we were obliged to out oars and pull . Made the officer row all the way to pay for his passage . Arrived safe at Boston half after eight in the evening , eat supper at Captain Service 's with Captains Millar , Noble and Craufurd , George Service and Mrs. Service , who is an Isla woman born , and very clever . She was widow Kinloch when he married her about the beginning of the present year . She has no children by her first husband . Her age is , I believe , about twenty-six , and her maiden name was Fraser . Came home to bed about ten o'clock in very good humor , well pleased with the excursions of the day . Wednesday , 25/h . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pater aboard the brig Be/sey for London , dated September 25 , Boston . This was the day of ordination of Mr. Bacon and installment of Mr. Hunt , both into church . There was a very great crowd of spectators , estimated to be five hundred thousand ? . My landlord , Mr. Coburn , introduced me into a pew with twelve ladies , four of whom were married women , the other eight - good God ! how can I express it- were such divine creatures that instead of attending to the duties of the solemnity I was all wonder and admiration . I am o'er happy this afternoon , think I completely paid my trouble and expenses in coming here . " Don Pedro , " my landlord , said when we came home , " Gregory , you was as happy dog as any in Boston this afternoon . You had eight of the handsomest ladies all around you as Boston affords , and ladies of the first rank , two of which , " added he , " are the greatest toasts in the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drank tea at home this afternoon , took a walk with Mr. McMasters , went into a tavern and spent the price of a bowl of punch , came home at nine o'clock . McNaught and I played the violin . We were very merry . Eat my supper , smoked my pipe and took myself to the Land of Nod . Thursday , 26/h . I went and bought a few trifles in the forenoon . At twelve o'clock went and saw a fine ship for the London trade launched , of three hundred tons burthen . There was a vast concourse of people of both sexes . I came home and eat my dinner and took my horse and rid all over the town . Being the last day I propose staying here , spent the evening at Captain Service 's . Came home half past ten , smoked my pipe and dispersed for the night . Sep/ember 27 . Arose about six o'clock , did what errands I had to do in town , drank punch with Service and McMaster and took my leave of them . Came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lady took my berth at Coburn 's . I eat dinner , drank a glass of Madeira and sett off taking my route out of the south end of the town by Liberty Tree , and then by Old Fort ; from that I jogged on to Roxbury . Passing through that town , I pursued my way as far as Dedham . Then I made a stop and oated Dick . From thence I steered my way along , and arrived at Walpole just at dark , and I put up at one Mr. Robins ' , just nineteen and a half miles from Boston , as far as I wanted to ride to divide the way between Boston and Providence . Here was two fine handsome girls . I rose about six o'clock after resting well . Here they have a fine fish pond . I proceeded on my way towards Wrentham , where I arrived to breakfast . From Mann 's at Wrentharn I pushed along and stopped at a tavern about nine miles from Providence , where I baited Billy and Dick . I then proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great fall of water and many mills . Here is an excessive high bridge , and not quite finished , which renders it very dangerous to pass . At this place I fell in company with a young lady on horse-back bound on my way , so that I came along the last four miles very merryly . I arrived at Providence half after twelve o'clock noon . time enough to save my distance with regard to dinner . After dinner I took a small walk by myself and observed the situation of the place , which is divided by the river into two towns , north and south , the . hill being so steep that they have hardly room to build one street on the bank . They have a fine new brick college which stands over the town on top of the north bank . There are some pretty good houses here , and they carry on very // considerable trade with the European , African and West Indian trade . Sunday , St. Michael 's Day , September 29 , in . Went early to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accordingly done . Came home and eat breakfast , and as most of the ministerial tribe were abroad , there was only service in one place , and the day being cold and suspecting to be too full for strangers , I contented myself to stay at home and read my book , along with Captain John and Nicholas Boggart of New York , and one Mr. Meuse , an Irish gentleman who lodged in the same house with me in Boston , together with the young lady of the house , Miss Phillis Chace , and Mr. Fleming 's lady of Boston , an accomplished lady of great good humor and affability . With this company we spent the fore part of the day . The afternoon was taken up with viewing the nice college . This certainly is as handsome a piece of building as any in America . For this sight we were obliged to Dr. Henry Stirling , a Londonderry man , very genteel and obliging . We arrived at our lodging , had some good punch made , then drank tea and spent the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forenoon . But I forgot to mention that before dinner we were introduced to some young gentlemen who proposed if we stayed here till Monday evening we should have a dust kicked up , and then we should have the pleasure of seeing the young ladies here . We agreed to stay , being four of us strangers who stayed at Mr. XVestrand 's , it being proposed merely out of compliment to us . The rest of this day and evening passed without anything remarkable , so smoked my pipe an ( l betook myself to the Land of Nod . Mon ( lay , September jo . Nothing happened particular during the course of the day , only playing cards and drinking . The ladies were notified of the dance , and at about seven o'clock in the evening we all met at the assembly-room ; which is a very handsome one . The ladies and gentlemen drew figures , and my figure was No. 2 . It happened to be the finest lady in the room , which was Miss Folly Bowen , an excellent dancer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were happy enough this night ; broke up the dance at one o'clock , saw my partner home , came home , eat some thing with some drink , and went to bed . Tuesday , October z , 1771 . This day passed over very agreeably paying visits to the ladies with Jones , Cook , Boggart , Meuse , and some others very much to my satisfaction . Arrived at my lodgings and betook myself to bed , intending to sett off early down the river to Newport . Wednesday , October 2 , 1771 . Was aroused this morning with " Turn out , you lazy dogs . The wind is fair and it is time to be a-going . " I banged up as quick as I could , pushed my way down stairs , and found my company refreshing themselves with gin . We eat breakfast , did some small errands about town , such as " Goodbye , my Sweetheart , " and about eleven o'clock we sett sail with tears in our eyes to leave this very agreeable place . We were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We took care to lay in good stores - roast beef , wine , biscuit , cherry rum , gamon , etc . Upon our passage near the town , we bought a bushel of good oysters as ever I saw , for a pistereen , and took in a half dozen more ladies , passengers for Newport , which is computed thirty miles from Providence . The wind being good northwest , we arrived at Newport on Rhode Island at three afternoon , being just four hours , a very lucky passage . After paying the compt. of landing , we betook ourselves to Mr. Wanton 's at the northwest end of the town ; when after drinking some good punch and some green tea in company with some ladies and gentlemen for Charleston , S. Carolina , we took a walk along with Commodore Wanton to the holy ground . After walking above three miles we returned home , and spent the evening together with several Newport acquaintances and one Mr. Skelton , a Scotchman from Jamaica , with whom I got very intimate after drinking plentifully of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to bed . // Oc/oler j ' . Rose time enough to be barberised and to wash myself before breakfast , but was , however , plaguey sick . Eat a very small breakfast and went to view the town of Newport . It far surpasses the idea I had formed of it , lying about southeast and northwest , - the principal street one and one half miles long , and the houses very compact , being called Thames Street , - the whole of the town making a very agreeable prospect from the water , being situated on an easy rising hill . I called on Mr. Skelton at his lodgings , and we went at half past eleven o'clock to a Quaker marriage , there being a great many Friends in this place . Saw them married , and then returned home to dinner . Skelton and myself took a ride to Turner 's , six miles from the town ; and a more pleasant ride I never had in America . The day being good and the roads level , together with the most delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rendered the view more like enchantment than real . This is certainly the finest country I have seen in America . Drank tea at Turner 's with a couple of fine ladies , and returned to town early in the evening . Played a few games at backgammon , drank punch , eat supper and went to bed about nine o'clock , being very much disposed to sleep , having slept little the foregoing night . Oc/o1*er 41 . I arose pretty early and well refreshed , went down as far as Potter 's at the Coffee House , turned out Skelton and introduced him to Mr. Jones of Providence . I paid my reckoning at Potter 's , and Jones and I took our road to Wanton 's , and breakfasted together there ; then I took my leave of Wanton and Jones , inquired for the ferry , and soon found the place . I waited almost an hour for the boat , which was on the opposite shore . There is something of a battery opposite the town upon an island , but of so little importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much notice . There is a good number of vesse - lying here at this time and a arge schooner tender . The boat came , and we embarked with a scanty wind , - my fellow passengers , two ladies , with whom I was quite agreeable ; and I catched mackerel in going over this ferry , being three miles over to Connecticut Island , and took boat with my two ladies for the main , being two and one half miles over . We arrived safe and took horse , and rid altogether till we came to Tower Hill , where I left them and jogged on by myself . I pursued my way along through a very ragged country . About three o'clock I came to one Hall 's , where I turned out Dick for an hour , and after refreshing myself sett off . Stopped at the widow Champion 's with two gents from Newport , at a place called Westerly . XVe drank some New England rum-toddy , and jogged on till I parted with my company about two miles from where I intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far before I lost myself in the wood as dark as Egypt . No house nigh to befriend the weary traveller . However , I plucked up my courage and pricked up Dick , and crossed over an old field at full speed , and before I rode very far I was extremely happy to find 1 was not far from some cottage , my ears being saluted with the sound of human voices ; and when I began to perceive a glimmering light , I made toward it . I kicked at the door , and found an old man , a middle-aged , good-looking woman , and half a dozen children . They were all surprised to see me , and invited me to sit down ; but I told them I was a stranger travelling toward New London , and had lost my way through the darkness of the night . They gave me some directions , and away I steered . After half an hour 's traversing the wood , I found the road again , when I felt happy . What added to the horror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place was inhabited by Indians , there being within a few miles about four or five hundred , but all probably friendly Indians . At last , thank God , I arrived safe at one Mr. Thomson 's , who keeps a tavern . Turned out Dick to pasture , drank some toddy and eat a fowl which my coming caused the death of* , smoked my pipe , and talked religion with the old people , who told me Mr. Whitfield always stayed at their house when he came that way , that he had converted a vast many people thereabout , and that I should sleep in the same bed to-night , - they having taken a liking to // me by the grave deportment I put on , which in reality was caused by my being tired and worn out . At last sleep catched such a fast hold on me that I fell off my chair on the floor . Then says I , " I must actually go to bed . " And after bidding a good night with gladness to get off , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , according to promise , but was interrupted in my slumbers by son Johnny coming in from a husking frolic . He entered my room , and came and drew his hand across my face , which awakened me . I immediately bawled out , thinking that old Whitfield had come from New York that night to disturb me on account of my pretended sanctity with the old folks . I dare say they thought I was converted as they called it . I laughed at heart , hut indeed I hardly could construct the muscles of my face into anything like a smile , so weary was I. I hailed my unknown friend with " What cheer , brother ? " and he , happening to be a seafaring youth , readily replied : " Damned good cheer . I have been up to Uncle Jerry 's to a husking , and I have got almost groggy . Plenty of girls were there , and I have been home with my partner . " I bid him strip and tumble into the other bed , and being myself but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . I found myself so well next morning that I got up early . October* . Turned out about seven o'clock , eat a very hearty breakfast , mounted Dick and sett off through a pleasant country , being along the shore all the way , but being the devil 's own roads . I think they surpass anything I ever saw for roughness , up hill and down hill all the way , some hills near a mile long , rugged and steep . From Westerly I kept on my way walking and riding by spells , and about ten o'clock A. M. I reached Champlain 's , at Stonington , well named from the stonyness of the country . Yesterday was bad , but to-day surpassed any idea I could conceive of bad roads . Had some oats for Dick , which he would not eat , they being spoiled , and drank some toddy myself , being nearly worn out . I sett off from this disagreeable place , and riding along slow was overtaken by a blacksmith , who turned out to be a pretty sociable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Dick taken care of and had dinner for myself . After dinner took a walk to view the town , which lies at the bottom of a hill upon the south side of the river Thames , pretty irregular , with a battery of ten or twelve guns mostly out of order . They have always good water here for vessels of all sizes , the tide ebbing and flowing but little . They have a pretty good town house , with a very homely old church and meeting house . The latter is situated on top of the hill about half a mile from the town . They carry on some trade to the West Indies , but not half so much as they did some years ago , Norwich , which lies some twelve or thirteen miles further up the river , having drawn most of the trade that way , it lying more in the center of the country . On the opposite side to New London lies Grotton , a poor , barren place not worth a description . I came home very little satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my own account by five Frenchmen who had just come in from a turtle frolic , and who felt so well on the occasion , assisted by Billy Bacchus , that they jumped , sung , whistled , and showed so many tricks that any man of common sense would have sworn that they were related to the baboon family . For my part I kept by the chimney corner and smoked my pipe and drank my toddy , yet was highly diverted with the monsieurs . October 6 . Being the Lord 's Day . I arose betimes , eat my breakfast and had myself barberized , put myself in order to attend the house of the Lord . I and one of the Frenchmen sett out and got to church . They stared at us very hard , both being strangers . The parson being an old countryman , a Hibernian , took my fancy a good deal . He had something in his physiognomy very grave and venerable . He preached about true religion , but gave me no ideas ; and the Frenchman , who hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some man just taken wild from the forest . For my part I passed well , having all the prayers by heart , and could amen as well as any of them . Came home , drank toddy and // eat a hearty dinner . Then brother Frenchman and self steered for the meeting house in the afternoon . After a very tedious walk we gained the holy place and were invited into a pew by the door flying open . A young man prayed and preached , but how he performed I can not say , for no sooner was I seated than I slept and was in the land of forgetfulness above an hour , till honest Frenchman gave me a jog and I was quite surprised to find myself in meeting , thinking I had been at my lodgings all the while . I came home very little the better , took another walk about town with an Englishman , who shewed me some houses and people , so that after reconnoitering the place we tacked about and came home to our lodgings , the London Coffee House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen much of the world , had some discourse with the monsieurs concerning the riches of France and England . Neither would give up the argument , so that it rested . Called for a bowl of toddy , then eat my supper and betook myself to the land of forgetfulness , where I rested exceeding well . October * . Being Monday . Started from bed betimes in the morning , with an intention to p : rsue my journey southward . After paying my landlord 's bill and after satisfying the shoe boy , house maid , and all the rest of the fraternity of tavern beigles , I mounted Dick and took my route out of the south end of the town ; and after climbing up one steep rocky hill , and walking down another , I arrived at a place called the Rope Ferry , about a mile wide , but the frequent washing of the sea has formed a narrow beach almost over , excepting about thirty yards . It seemed to me to be the mouth of a pretty considerable river , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gut and go up the river . This small gut is where the ferry is kept , and the tide running in and out so rapid obliged them to have a rope fixed at each side to pull over the boat by . Supposing they kept a tavern here , and as my appetite craved yet 6ould get no breakfast , the wife told me the fire was out , and there was no water in the house and none nigher than half a mile , and it was hardly worth while to get one breakfast ; but she told me that on the other side was a very good tavern , where I could get what I wanted . So I paid my fare , three coppers , and pushed off . I arrived at the tavern I. B. sign of the Rose , with these lines " lie 's a friend to the Rose Who pays as he goes . " Just as I gained the summit of the hill I espied the landlord . I asked him for a pasture near at hand for Dick , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon over . Mine host was a very convenient man . He said he liked me because I was free and talked with him . He found some people would not , and he did not like them folks , and protested he would rather give me anything for half price than the other for full price . However , I was used to such palaver . I ordered up Dick , paid my score and sett off . I had not rid far before I espied a large black snake cross the road , and as I always bear these animals a spite , I dismounted and pursued the scaly monster , and ran about half a mile before I could reach him . At length I overtook him , and he made a full stop and put out his forked tongue . However , I had no time to parley with him . I struck as hard as I could with my whip , which caused him to spring toward me ; but , falling short , I redoubled my blows and laid him flat enough . I lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as I got there I found that Dick had given me the slip and walked off . Which way to go after the battle , I knew not ; but thinking he might take himself toward mine host of the Rose , I ran that way , and saw him ascending a neighboring hill very soberly . I called to him , but no notice was taken . So I sett off and ran as hard as I could , and very soon came up with him and bestowed on him the length of my whip for his trouble . After these disasters I mounted , and about eleven of the day I passed through Lime , a small place upon the mouth of the Connecticut River . I wanted to refresh myself and Dick , but having nothing smaller than a half Johannes , and the whole town being unable to make it // smaller , was obliged to decamp from the place , having a few coppers to pay my ferriage . Crossed over to Seabrook , on the opposite bank . I found it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with fatigue and thirst , I thought every rod a mile . At length I arrived at a tavern , and asked if they could make small my piece of gold ; but , being answered in the negative , I proceeded further , and after trying and sending all over the town of Seabrook , was necessitated to go on with very great reluctance . So , growling , sett off to a tavern four miles off , at which place there happened to be a training . The Indian name of the place is Putchog , four miles east of Killingsworth . At last , after much fatigue , I reached the above named place , horse and self much exhausted ; but , thank fortune , here I was relieved from all my distress . After drinking a bowl of punch , and paying sixpence for changing my piece of gold , I eat a very hasty dinner of roasted beef and potatoes , the glory of old England and Ireland combined ; and when finished , I felt as well as any of his Majesty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and I , to bind our new contracted friendship firmer , called for a pint of the juice of the grape , and protested eternal friendship . After shaking one another 's hand heartily , we parted . I took my leave of the house , which I never will forget . After passing through a very good country and good roads , I arrived at my good friend Mr. Merrill 's house , in Killingsworth , where Dick was well cared for and myself somewhat refreshed . It being training day here likewise , there was a couple of dances in town . A good honest sailor came in , and after he had refreshed himself , " Come , " says I , " why ca n't you and I go and see the dance ? I feel somewhat that way inclined . " He said he would if I would wait until he put on his white shirt . I waited , but not long before my honest tar came down stairs , and away we jogged , and came to the house and bolted in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , every one staring at us , both being entire strangers . Hoxvever , after a small Quaker meeting , one more bold than the rest made me a low bow and long scrape of the foot , asked me and then Jack if we would dance a reel and he would find us partners . We both agreed , and he turned us out a couple of fine hale lassies . We danced , but the string tormentor executed his part so bad that it proved a very great drawback upon our pleasure . After some reels , country dances being introduced , I was put at the top . We began to sett our feet a-playing , and I believe executed our parts by dint of hard footing so well that we seemed to be admired by all , matrons and other bystanders . And the beauty of it all was , that the room we had to dance in was so small that we jostled against each other , sometimes intended . Jack and I spent a couple of hours here , much satisfied with our entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the other dance , where was much finer girls than we left . We danced here a spell ; but , finding the pillars of our legs beginning to fail , thought it prudent to bid them all good night , thanking them kindly for civilities . Jack and I made the best of our way home , where we found good " old mama " just dropping to sleep . " My children , ' ' said she , Jam glad you have come ; I have waited for you for these two very long hours . " XVe thanked her , but would have been still more obliged to her for some biscuit and milk and a bowl of toddy . So Jack and I , not caring to part dry-lipped , drank our toddy and smoked our pipes , and after a hearty grip of the hand departed each to his apartment . I slept well , considering the indifference of the bed , which I really believe was made fifty years ago , and could it speak might tell many a wonderful story . October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place , after paying damages , stretched along the plain to East Guilford , where I stopt to eat my breakfast and oat Dick ; but the tea , butter , bread , etc. , being so excessive nasty and bad I could hardly eat anything . Not liking this place , paid damages and sett off as soon as Dick had finished his oats . I was much puzzled to find the right road , this way having so many forkings and no directions for the benefit of travellers ; but I was fortunate to keep the right . I arrived at Guilford , // old town , about eleven o'clock . The first man I met was Benton , ready to wait on me . I here had Dick 's Boston shoes taken off , they being so very heavy and clumsy that they retarded his going . I had a handsome pair of light ones put on in the room , and Dick went as well again for them . I stayed one hour here , being something acquainted . From this place I sett off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down , after clearing the way with some punch made by Miss Molly , and made a very hearty dinner . I turned out Dick to pasture , but it seeming to draw on to rain , thought it judicious to sett off for home , this place , Brandford , being within eight miles from New Haven . I was lucky enough to get to my journey 's end , being but little wet after all . New Haven in my eyes makes as good a figure as any , it lying in a beautiful plain country surrounded with easy rising hills at the distance of three English miles , at the head of a fine bay six miles in length from the sound that runs between Long Island and the main , but toward the town it is something shallow , leaving it dry for n*iles out at low water , but at high water there is above sixteen feet . It resembles the Loch of Belfast more than any place I ever saw . Being nothing but soft mud , if a vessel is cast ashore she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a very large trade carried on here , chiefly to the West Indies , selling there horses , cows , hogs , sheep , and fowles of all kinds , lumber , tallow , beeswax and myrtlewax , etc. , . and bringing in return rum , sugar , molasses , cocoa , coffee , pimento , gold and silver , etc . There is at present in that trade to the number of forty vessels , brigantines and sloops , but chiefly the latter , about ninety tons burthen and carrying from thirtytwo to forty-eight creatures upon deck . The town is an exact square , the streets all regular and straight , so that you may cast your eye from one end of the street to the other , being about a mile in length and as even as a house floor . In the middle of the town is a square about a quarter of a mile square , in the midst of which stands three public buildings in a line , viz. : a noble building for a state house or governor 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the square stands the college , with a fine chapel for worship . On the east corner of said square stands the Church of England edifice . In all , six public buildings , three Presbyterian , one Church of England , five steeples , state house with a large balcony and bell on top . Likewise stands on the west corner of the square the prison , but it is a miserable poor one , not worth while to make mention of . The college , being two stately edifices , one of brick , the other of wood , was founded in 1718 by one Mr. Yale , an English gentleman , and goes by his name to this day . There are generally about one hundred and twenty students at college , the managers and a president , who is generally professor of divinity , a professor of mathematics , and professor ol languages . It costs the students nothing but their board and washing , and the professors being paid from a fund sunk for that purpose , the means of education is very cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many oxen shipt annually to the West Indies . At present there are forty-three houses in town , but that is a great deal too many by twenty . New Haven lies in lat. 41.20 northwest ; long . 71.20 ; ninety miles northeast of New York , about one hundred and seventy miles southwest of Boston , sixty miles from New London , and one hundred and ninety miles from Albany upon the Hudson River ; northeast about seven leagues from Long Island , the sound being of that breadth here and every five or six miles you may see towns and villages along the road to entertain travellers , being extremely thick settled country . The General Assembly sits here usually half the time , viz. , in October , and the other half in Hartford , a very pretty town upon the Connecticut River , forty miles north of New Haven . The Superior or Circuit Court sits here twice a year , viz. , *n the last Tuesday of February and August . Inferior court sits twice a year here likewise , first and second Tuesday in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
