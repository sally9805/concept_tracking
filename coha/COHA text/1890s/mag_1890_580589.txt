FROM KING 'S MOUNTAIN TO YORKTOWN . IN the invasion of the South by Cornwallis , as in the invasion of the North by Burgoyne , the first serious blow which the enemy received was dealt by the militia . After his great victory over Gates , Cornwallis remained nearly a month at Camden resting his troops , who found the August heat intolerable . By the middle of September , 1780 , he had started on his march to North Carolina , of which lie expected to make an easy conquest . But his reception in that State was anything but hospitable . Advancing as far as Charlotte , he found himself in the midst of that famous Mecklenburg County which had issued its " declaration of independence " immediately on receiving the news of the battle of Lexington . These rebels , he said , were the most obstinate he had found in America , and he called their country a " hornet 's nest . " Bands of yeomanry lurking about every woodland road cut off his foraging parties , slew his couriers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get any information ; but bad news proverbially travels fast , and it was not long before he received intelligence of dire disaster . Before leaving South Carolina Cornwallis had detached Major Ferguson - whom , next to Tarleton , he considered his best partisan officer - to scour the highlands and enlist as large a force of Tory auxiliaries as possible , after which he was to join the main army at Charlotte . Ferguson took with him 200 British light infantry and 1000 Tories , whom he had drilled until they had become excellent troops . It was not supposed that he would meet with serious opposition , but in case of any unforeseen danger he was to retreat with all possible speed and join the main army . Now the enterprising Ferguson undertook to entrap and capture a small force of American partisans ; and while pursuing this bait , he pushed into the wilderness as far as Gilbert Town , in the heart of what is now the county of Rutherford , when all at once he became aware that enemies were swarming about him on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumor of Indian war had aroused the hardy backwoodsmen who dwelt in these wild and romantic glens . Accustomed to Indian raids , these quick and resolute men were always ready to assemble at a moment 's warning ; and now they came pouring from all directions , through the defiles of the Alleghanies , a picturesque and motley crowd , in fringed and tasseled hunting-shirts , with sprigs of hemlock in their hats , and armed with long knives and rifles that seldom missed their aim . From the south came James Williams , of Ninety-Six , with his 400 men ; from the north , William Camp-. bell , of Virginia , Benjamin Cleveland and Charles McDowell , of North Carolirra , with 560 followers ; from the west , Isaac Shelby and John Sevier , whose names were to become so famous in the early history of Kentucky and Tennessee . By the 30th of September 3000 of these " dirty mongrels , " as Ferguson called them , - men in whose veins flowed the blood of Scottish Covenanters and French Huguenots and English sea rovers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander started in all haste on his retreat toward the main army at Charlotte , sending messengers ahead , who were duly waylaid and shot down before they could reach Cornwallis and inform him of the danger . The pursuit was vigorously pressed , and on the night of the 6th of October , finding escape impossible without a fight , Ferguson planted himself // on the top of King 's Mountain , a ridge about half a mile in length and 1700 feet above sea level , situated just on the border line between the two Carolinas . The crest is approached on three sides by rising ground , above which the steep summit towers for a hundred feet ; on the north side it is an unbroken precipice . The mountain was covered with tall pine-trees , beneath which the ground , though little cumbered with underbrush , was obstructed on every side by huge moss-grown boulders . Perched with 1125 stanch men on this natural stronghold , as the bright autumn sun came up on the morning of the 7th , Ferguson looked about him exultingly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place from which all the rebels outside of hell can not drive us ! " He was dealing , however , with men who were used to climbing hills . About three o'clock in the afternoon , the advanced party of Americans , 1000 picked men , arrived in the ravine below the mountain , and , tying their horses to the trees , prepared to storm the position . The precipice on the north was too steep for the enemy to descend , and thus effectually cut off their retreat . Divided into three equal parties , the Americans ascended the other three sides simultaneously . Campbell and Shelby pushed up in front until near the crest , when Ferguson opened fire on them . They then fell apart behind trees , returning the fire most effectively , but suffering little themselves , while slowly they crept up nearer the crest . As the British thea charged down upon them with bayonets , they fell back , until the British ranks were suddenly shaken by a deadly flank lire from the division of Sevier and McDowell on the right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a volley in their backs from the left division , under Cleveland and Williams , while the centre division promptly rallied , and attacked them on what was now their flank . Thus dread . fully entrapped , the British fired wildly December , and with little effect , while the trees and boulders prevented the compactness needful for a bayonet charge . The Americans , on the other hand , sure of their prey , crept on steadily toward the summit , losing scarcely a man , and firing with great deliberateness and precision , while hardly a word was spoken . As they closed in upon the ridge a rifleball pierced the brave Ferguson 's heart , and he fell from his white horse , which sprang wildly down the mountain side . All further resistance being hopeless , a white flag was raised , and the firing was stopped . Of Ferguson 's 1125 men , 389 were killed or wounded and 20 were missing , and the remaining 716 now surrendered themselves prisoners of war , with 1500 stand of arms . The total American loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed was the famous partisan commander James Williams , whose loss might be regarded as offsetting that of Major Ferguson . This brilliant victory at King 's Mountain resembled the victory at Bennington in its suddenness and completeness , as well as in having been gained by militia . It was also the harbinger of greater victories at the South , as Bennington had been the harbinger of greater victories at the North . The backwoodsmen who had dealt such a blow did not , indeed , follow it up and hover about the flanks of Cornwallis , as the Green Mountain boys had hovered about the flanks of Burgoyne . Had there been an organized army opposed to Cornwallis , to serve as a nucleus for them , perhaps they might have done so . As it was , they soon dispersed and returned to their homes , after having sullied their triumph by hanging a dozen prisoners , in revenge for Clarke 's men who had been massacred at Augusta . They had , nevertheless , warded off for the moment the threatened invasion of North Carolina . Thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling back upon Winnsborough , there to wait for Prom King 's Mountain to Yorktown. // reinforcements , for he was in no condition to afford the loss of 1100 men . General Leslie had been sent by Sir Henry Clinton to Virginia with 3000 men , and Cornwallis ordered this force to join him without delay . Hope began now to return to the patriots of South Carolina , and during the months of October and November their activity was greatly increased . Marion in the northeastern part of the State , and Sumter in the northwest , redoubled their energies , and it was more than even Tarleton could do to look after them both . On the 20th of November Tarleton was defeated by Sumter in a sharp action at Blackstock Hill , and the disgrace of the 18th of August was thus wiped out . On the retreat of Coruwallis , the remnants of the American regular army , which Gates had been slowly collecting at Hillsborough , advanced and occupied Charlotte . There were scarcely 1400 of them , all told , and their condition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ; and first of all came Daniel Morgan , always a host in himself . Morgan , like Arnold , had been ill treated by Congress . His services at Quebec and Saratoga had been hardly inferior to Arnold 's , yet , in 1779 , he had seen junior officers promoted over his head , and had resigned his commission , and retired to his home in Virginia . When Gates took command of the Southern army , Morgan was urged to enter the service again ; but , as it was not proposed to restore him to his relative rank , he refused . After Camden , however , he declared that it was no time to let personal considerations have any weight , and he straightway came down and joined Gates at Hillsborough in September . At last , on the 13th of October , Congress had the good sense to give him the rank to which he was entitled ; and it was not long , as we shall see , before it had r'eason to congratulate itself upon this act of justice . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now sought to restore needed a new commander-in-chief . It was well known that Washington had wished to have Greene appointed to that position , in the first place . Congress had persisted in appointing its own favorite instead , and had lost an army in consequence . It could now hardly do better , though late in the day , than take Washington 's advice . It would not do to ri.tn the risk of another Camden . In every campaign since the beginning of the war Greene had been Washington 's right arm ; and for indefatigable9 industry , for strength and breadth of intelligence , and for unselfish devotion to the public service , he . was scarcely inferior to the commander-in-chief . Yet he too had been repeatedly insulted and abused by men who liked to strike at Washingtom* through his favorite officers . As quartermaster-general , since the spring of 1778 , Greene had been malevolently persecuted by a party in Congress , until , in July , 1780 , his patience gave way , and he resigned in disgust . His enemies seized the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own keen sense of public duty and Washington 's unfailing tact his services might have been lost to the country at a most critical moment . On the 5th of October Congress called upon Washington to name a successor to Gates , and he immediately appointed Greene , who arrived at Charlotte and took command on the 2d of December . Steuben accompanied Greene as far as Virginia , and was placed in command in that State , charged with the duty of collecting and forwarding supplies and reinforcements to Greene , and of warding off the forces which Sir Henry Clinton sent to the Chesapeake to make diversions in aid of Cornwallis . The first force of this sort , under General Leslie , had just been obliged to proceed by sea to South Carolina , to make good the loss inflicted upon Cornwallis // by the battle of King 's Mountain ; and , to replace Leslie in Virginia , Sir Henry Clinton , in December , sent the traitor Arnold , fresh from the scene of his treason , with 1600 men , mostly New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold , and to keep open Greene 's communications with the North . At the same time , Washington sent down with Greene the engineer Kosciusko and Henry Lee with his admirable legion of cavalry . Another superb cavalry commander now appears for the first time upon the scene in the person of Lieutenant-Colonel William Washington , of Virginia , a distant cousin of the commander-in-chief . The Southern army , though weak in numbers , was thus extraordinarily strong in the talent of its officers . They were men who knew how to accomplish great results with small means , and Greene understood how far he might rely upon them . No sooner had he taken command than he began a series of movements which , though daring in the extreme , were as far as possible from partaking of the unreasoned rashness which had characterized the advance of Gates . That unintelligent commander had sneered at cavalry as useless , but Greene largely based his plan oC operations upon what could be done by such swift blows as Washington and Lee knew how to deal . Gates had despised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the importance of utilizing such men as Sumter and Marion . His army as a solid whole was too weak to cope with that of Cornwallis . By a bold and happy thought , he divided it , for the moment , into two great partisan bodies . The larger body , 1100 strong , he led in person to Cheraw Hill , on the Pedee River , where he co*5perated with Mari on . From this point Marion and Lee kept up a series of rapid movements which threatened Cornwallis 's communications with the coast . On one occasion , they actually galloped into Georgetown and captured the commander of that post . Cornwallis was thus gravely annoyed , but he was unable to advance upon these provoking antagonists without risking the loss of Augusta and Ninety-Six ; for Greene had thrown the other part of his little army , 900 strong , under Morgan , to the westward , so as to threaten those important inland posts and to cooperate with the mountain militia . With Morgan 's force went William Washington , who accomplished a most brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party of 250 men at a single blow . Thus worried and menaced upon both his flanks , Cornwallis hardly knew which way to turn . He did not underrate his adversaries . He had himself seen what sort of man Greene was , at Princeton and Brandywine and Germantown , while Morgan 's abilities were equally well known . He could not leave Morgan and attack Greene without losing his hold upon the interior ; but if he were to advance in full force upon Morgan , the wily Greene would be sure to pounce upon Charleston and cut him off from the coast . In this dilemma , Cornwallis at last decided to divide his own forces . With his main body , 2000 strong , he advanced into North Carolina , hoping to draw Greene after him ; while he sent Tarleton with the rest of his army , 1100 strong , to take care of Morgan . By this division the superiority of the British force was to some extent neutralized . Both commanders were playing a skillful but hazardous game , in which much depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave but over-confident Tarleton was outmarched and outfought . On his approach , Morgan retreated to a grazing ground known as the Cowpens , a few miles from King 's Mountain , where he could fight on ground of his own choosing . His choice was indeed a peculiar one , for he had a brdad river in his rear , which cut off retreat ; but // this , he said , was just what he wanted , for his militia would know that there was no use in running away . It was cheaper than stationing regulars in the rear , to shoot down the cowards . Morgan 's daring was justified by the result . The ground , a long rising slope , commanded the enemy 's approach for a great distance . On the morning of January 17 , 1781 , as Tarleton 's advance was descried , Morgan formed his men in order of battle . First he arranged his Carolinian and Georgian militia in a line about three hundred yards in length , and exhorted them not to give way until they should have delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One hundred and fifty yards in the rear of this line , and along the brow of the gentle hill , he stationed the splendid American brigade which Kalb had led at Camden , and supported it by some excellent Virginia troops . Still one hundred and fifty yards further back , upon a second rising ground , he placed Colonel Washington with his cavalry . Arranged in this wise , the army awaited the British attack . Tarleton 's men had been toiling half the night over muddy roads and wading through swollen brooks , but nothing could restrain his eagerness to strike a sudden blow , and just about sunrise he charged upon the first American line . The militia , who were commanded by the redoubtable Pickens , behaved very well , and delivered , not two , but many deadly volleys at close range , causing the British lines to waver for a moment . As the British recovered themselves and pressed on , the militia broke into two parts , and retired - partly to right , partly to left - behind the line of Continentals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so extended as to threaten the flanks of the Continental line . To avoid being overlapped , the Continentals retreated in perfect order to the second hill , and the British followed them hastily and in some confusion , having become too confident of victory . At this moment , Colonel Washington , having swept down from his hill in a s&amp;micircle , charged the British right flank with fatal effect ; Pickens 's militia , who had re-formed in the rear and marched around the hill , advanced upon their left flank ; while the Continentals , in front , broke their ranks with a deadly fire at thirty yards , and instantly rushed upon them with the bayonet . The greater part of the British army thereupon threw down their arms and surrendered , while the rest were scattered in flight . It was a complete rout . The British lost 230 in killed and wounded , 600 prisoners , two field-pieces , and 1000 stand of arms . Their loss was about equal to the whole American force engaged . Only 270 escaped from the field , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single combat with Washington . The American loss , in this astonishing battle , . was 12 killed and 61 wounded . In point of tactics , it was the most brilliant battle of the War for Independence . Having struck this crushing blow , which deprived Cornwallis of one third of his force , Morgan did not rest for a moment . The only direct road by which he could rejoin Greene lay to the northward , across the fords of the Catawba River , and Cornwallis was at this instant nearer than himself to these fords . By a superb march , Morgan reached the river first , and , crossing it , kept on northeastward into North Carolina , with Cornwallis following closely upon his heels . On the 24th of January , one week after the battle of the Cowpens , the news of it reached Greene in his camp on the Pedee , and he learned the nature of Morgan 's movements after the battle . Now was the time for putting into execution a brilliant scheme . If be could draw the British general far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join battle under disadvantageous circumstances // and at a great distance from his base of operations . Accordingly , Greene put his main army in motion under General Huger , telling him to push steadily to the northward ; while he himself , taking only a sergeant 's guard of dragoons , rode with all possible speed a hundred and fifty miles across the country , and on the morning of the 30th reached the valley of the Catawba , and put himself at the head of Morgan 's force , which Cornwallis was still pursuing . Now the gallant earl realized the deadly nature of the blow which at King 's Mountain and the Cowpens had swept away nearly all his light troops . In his eagerness and mortification , he was led to destroy the heavy baggage which encumbered his headlong march . He was falling into the trap . A most exciting game of strategy was kept up for the next ten days ; Greene steadily pushing northeastward on a line converging toward that taken by his main army , Coruwallis vainly trying to get near enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy , and an interesting feature of the retreat was the swelling of the rivers , which rendered them unfordable . Greene took advantage of this circumstance , having , with admirable forethought , provided himself with boats , which were dragged overland on light wheels , and speedily launched as they came to a river ; carrying as part of their freight the wheels upon which they were again to be mounted so soon as they should have crossed . On the 9th of February Greene reached Guilford Court-House , in the northern part of North Carolina , only thirty miles from the Virginia border ; and there he effected a junction with the main army , which Huger had brought up from the camp on the Pedee . On the next day , the gallant Morgan , broken down by illness , was obliged to give up his command . It had not been a part of Greene 's plan to retreat any farther . He had intended to offer battle at this point , and had sent word to Steuben to forward reinforcements from Virginia for this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxed the good baron 's resources that he had not yet been able to send on the reinforcements ; and as Greene 's force was still inferior to the enemy 's , he decided to continue his retreat . After five days of fencing , he placed his army on the north side of the Dan , a broad and rapid stream , which Cornwallis had no means of crossing . Thus balked of his prey , the earl proceeded to Hillsborough , and issued a proclamation announcing that he had conquered North Carolina , and inviting the loyalists to rally around his standard . A few Tories came out and enlisted , but these proceedings were soon checked by the news that the American general had recrossed the river , and was advancing in a threatening manner . Greene had intended to await his reinforcements on the Virginia side of the river , but he soon saw that it would not do to encourage the Tories by the belief that he had abandoned North Carolina . On the 23d he recrossed the Dan , and led Cornwallis a will-o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to bring him to bay , until , on the 14th of March , having at last been reinforced till his army numbered 4404 men , he suddenly pulled up at Guilford Court-House , and offered his adversary the long-coveted battle . Cornwallis had only 2213 men , but they were all veterans , and a battle had come to be for him an absolute military necessity . He had risked everything in this long march , and could not maintain himself in an exposed position , so far from support , without inflicting a crushing defeat upon his opponent . To Greene a battle was now almost equally desirable , but it need not necessarily be an out-and-out victory : it was enough that he should seriously weaken and damage the enemy . On the morning of March 15th // 1890 . Greene drew up his army in three lines . The first , consisting of North Carolina militia , was placed in front of an open cornfield . It was expected that these men would give way before the onset of the British regulars ; but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three volleys first , and , as they were excellent marksmen , this would make gaps in the British line . In a wood three hundred yards behind stood the second line , consisting of Virginia militia , whose fire was expected still further to impede the enemy 's advance . On a hill four hundred yards in the rear of these were stationed the regulars of Maryland and Virginia . The flanks were guarded by Campbell 's riflemen and the cavalry under Washington and Lee . Early in the afternoon the British opened the battle by a charge upon the North Carolina militia , who were soon driven from the field in confusion . The Virginia line , however , stood its ground bravely , and it was only after a desperate struggle that the enemy slowly pushed it back . The attack upon the third American line met with varied fortunes . On the right the Maryland troops prevailed , and drove the British at the point of the bayonet ; but on the left the other Maryland brigade was overpowered and forced back , with the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry restored the day , the cannon were retaken , and for a while the victory seemed secured for the Americans . Coruwallis was thrown upon the defensive , but after two hours of hard fighting he succeeded in restoring order among his men and concentrating them upon the hill near the court-house , where all attempts to break their line proved futile . As evening came on , Greene retired , with a loss of more than 400 men , leaving the enemy in possession of the field , but too badly crippled to move . The British fighting was simply magnificent , - worthy to be compared with that of Thomas and his men at Chickamauga . In the course of five hours they had lost about 600 men , more than one fourth of their number . This damage was irretrievable . The little army , thus cut down to a total of scarcely 1600 men , could not afford to risk another battle . Greene 's audacious scheme had been crowned with success . He had lured Cornwalhis far into a hostile country , more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earl now saw too late that he had been outgeneraled . To march back to South Carolina was more than he dared to venture , and he could not stay where he was . Accordingly , on the third day after the battle of Guilford , abandoning his wounded , Cornwalhis started in all haste for Wilmington , the nearest point on the coast at which he could look for aid from the fleet . By this movement Lord Cornwalhis virtually gave up the game . The battle of Guilford , though tactically a defeat for the Americans , was strategically a decisive victory , and the most important one since the capture of Burgoyne . Its full significance was soon made apparent . When Cornwallis , on the 7th of April , arrived at Wilmington , what was he to do next ? To transport his army by sea to Charleston , and thus begin his work over again , would be an open confession of defeat . The most practicable course appeared to be to shift the scene altogether , and march into Virginia , where a fresh opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent General Phillips down to Virginia , with a force which , if combined with that of Cornwallis , would amount to more than 5000 men ; and with this army it might prove possible to strike a heavy blow in Virginia , and afterward invade the Carolinas from the north . Influenced by such considerations , Cornwallis started from Wilmington on the // he effected a junction with the forces of Arnold and Phillips . This important movement was made by Cornwallis on his own responsibility . It was never sanctioned by Sir Henry Clinton , and in after years it became the occasion of a bitter controversy between the two generals ; but the earl was at this time a favorite with Lord George Germaine , and the commander-in-chief was obliged to modify his own plans in order to support a movement of which he disapproved . But while Cornwallis was carrying out this extensive change of programme , what was his adversary doing ? Greene pursued the retreating enemy about fifty miles , from Guilford Court-House to Ramsay 's Mills , a little above the fork of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and faced about for South Carolina . Should Cornwallis decide to follow him , at least the State of North Carolina would be relieved ; but Greene had builded even better than he knew . He had really eliminated Cornwallis from the game , had thrown him out on the margin of the chessboard ; and now he could go to work with his hands free and redeem South Carolina . The strategic points there were still held by the enemy ; Camden , Ninety-Six , and Augusta were still in their possession . Camden , the most important of all , was held by Lord Rawdon with 900 men ; and toward Camden , a hundred and sixty miles distant , Greene turned on the 6th of April , leaving Cornwallis to make his way unmolested to the seaboard . Greene kept his counsel so well that his own officers failed to understand the drift of his profound and daring strategy . The movement which he now made had not been taken into account by Cornwallis , who had expected by his own movements at least to detain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea which he had not yet taken in , and by the time he fully comprehended the situation he was already on his way to Virginia , and committed to his new programme . The patriots in South Carolina had also failed to understand Greene 's sweeping movements , and his long absence had cast down their hopes ; but on his return , without Cornwallis , there was a revulsion of feeling . People began to look for victory . On the 18th of April the American army approached Camden , while Lee was detached to cooperate with Marion in reducing Fort Watson . This stronghold , standing midway between Camden and Charleston , commanded Lord Rawdon 's line of communications with the coast . The execution of this cardinal movement was marked by a picturesque incident . Fort Watson was built on an Indian mound , rising forty feet sheer above the champaign country in which it stood , and had no doubt witnessed many a wild siege before ever the white man came to Carolina . It was garrisoned by 120 good soldiers , but neither they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an affair of rifles . Lee looked with disgust on the low land about him . Oh for a hill which might command this fortress , even as Ticonderoga was overlooked on that memorable day when Phillips dragged his guns up Mount Defiance ! A happy thought now flashed upon Major Mayham , one of Marion 's officers . Why not make a hill ? There grew near by a forest of superb yellow pine , heavy and hard as stone . For five days and nights the men worked like beavers in the depths of the wood , quite screened from the sight of the garrison . Forest trees were felled , and saws , chisels , and adzes worked them into shape . Great beams were fitted with mortise and tenon ; and at last , in a single night , they were dragged out before the fortress and put together , as in an old-fashioned New England " house - raising . " At daybreak of April 23d the British found themselves overlooked by an enormous // wooden tower , surmounted by a platform crowded with marksmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while its base was protected by a breastwork of logs , behind which lurked a hundred deadly rifles . Before the sun was an hour high a white flag was hung out , and Fort Watson was surrendered at discretion . While these things were going on Greene reached Camden , and , finding his force insufficient either to assault or to invest it , took up a strong position at Hobkirk 's Hill , about two miles to the north . 0n the 25th of April Lord Rawdon advanced , to drive him from this position , and a battle ensued , in which the victory , nearly won , slipped through Greene 's fingers . The famous Maryland brigade , which in all these Southern campaigns had stood forth preeminent , like C*sar 's tenth legion , - which had been the last to leave the disastrous field of Camden , which had overwhelmed Tarleton at the Cowpens , and had so nearly won the day at Guilford , - now behaved badly , and , falling into confusion through a misunderstanding of orders , deranged Greene 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , and three days later retreated ten miles to Clermont ; but , just as at Guilford , his plan of campaign was so good that he proceeded forthwith to reap all the fruits of victory . The fall of Fort Watson , breaking Rawdon 's communication with the coast , made it impossible for him to stay where he was . On the 10th of May the British general retreated rapidly , until he reached Monk 's Corner , within thirty miles of Charleston ; and the all-iraportant post of Camden , the first great prize of the campaign , fell into Greene 's hands . Victories followed now in quick succession . Within three weeks Lee and Marion had taken Fort Motte and Fort Granby , Sumter had taken Orangeburg , and on the 5th of June , after an obsti .. nate defense , Augusta surrendered to Lee , thus throwing open the State of Georgia . Nothing was left to the British but Ninety-Six , which was strongly garrisoned , and now withstood a vigorous siege of twenty-eight days . Determined not to lose this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversary in battle , if possible , Lord Rawdon collected all the force he could , well-nigh stripping Charleston of its defenders , and thus , with 2000 men , came up in all haste to raise the siege of Ninety-Six . His bold movement was successful for the moment . Greene , too prudent to risk a battle , withdrew , and the frontier fortress was relieved . It was impossible , however , for Rawdon to hold it and keep his army there , so far from the seaboard , after all the other inland posts had fallen , and on the 29th of June he evacuated the place , and retreated upon Orangeburg ; while Greene , following him , took up a strong position on the High Hills of Santee . Thus , within three months after Greene 's return from Guilford , the upper country of S6uth Carolina had been completely reconquered , and orfiy one successful battle was now needed to drive the enemy back upon Charleston . But first it was necessary to take some rest and recruit the little army , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , felt the need of rest , and the heat was intolerable . Both armies , accordingly , lay and watched each other until after the middle of August . During this vacation , Lord Rawdon , worn out and ill from his rough campaigning , embarked for England , leaving Colonel Stuart in command of the forces in South Carolina . Greene busied himself in recruiting his army , until it numbered 2600 men , though 1000 of these were militia . His position on the High Hills of Santec was , by an air line , distant only sixteen miles from the British army . The intervening space was filled by meadows , through which the // Wateree and Congaree rivers flowed to meet each other ; and often , as now , when the swift waters , swollen by rain , overflowed the lowlands , it seemed like a vast lake , save for the tops of tall pine-trees that here and there showed themselves in deepest green , protruding from the mirror-like surface . Greene understood the value of this meadow land as a barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The enemy could reach him only by a circuitous march of seventy miles . On the 22d of August Greene broke up his camp very quietly , and started out on the last of his sagacious campaigns . The noonday heat was so intense that he marched only in the morning and evening , in order to keep his men fresh and active ; while by vigilant scouting parties he so completely cut off the enemy 's means of information that Stuart remained ignorant of his approach until he was close at hand . The British commander then fell back upon Eutaw Springs , about fifty miles from Charleston , where he waited in a strong position . The limits of this paper do not allow us to describe the interesting battle of Eutaw Springs . It may be resolved into two brief actions between sunrise and noon of the 8th of September , 1781 . In the first action the British line was broken and driven from the field . In the second Stuart succeeded in forming a new line , supported by a brick house and palisaded garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It has therefore been set down as a British victory . If so , it was a victory followed the next evening by the hasty retreat of the victors , who were hotly pursued for thirty miles by Marion and Lee . Strategically considered , it was a decisive victory for the Americans . The state government was restored to supremacy , and , though partisan scrimmages were kept up for another year , these were but the dying embers of the fire . The British were cooped up in Charleston till the end of the war , protected by their ships . Less than thirteen months had elapsed since the disaster of Camden had seemed to destroy all hope of saving the State . All this change had been wrought by Greene 's magnificent generalship . Coming upon . the scene under almost every imaginable disadvantage , he had reorganized the remnant of Gates 's broken and dispirited army , he had taken the initiative from the first , and he had held the game in his own hands till the last blow was struck . So consummate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the field , he had , in every instance , gained the object for which the campaign was made . Under one disadvantage , indeed , he had not labored : he had excellent officers . Seldom has a more brilliant group been seen than that which comprised Morgan , Campbell , Marion , Sumter , Pickens , Otho Williams , William Washington , and the father of Robert Edward Lee . It is only an able general , however , who knows how to use such admirable instruments . Men of narrow intelligence do not like to have able men about them , and do not know how to deal with them . Gates had Kalb and Otho Williams , and put them in places where their talent was unavailable and one of them was uselessly sacrificed , while he was too dull to detect the extraordinary value of Marion . But genius is quick to see genius , and knows what to do with it . Greene knew what each one of his officers would do , and took it into the account in planning his sweeping movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan as certainly as Napoleon , in after years , relied upon Davoust on the day of Jena and Auerstadt , it would have been foolhardy for him to divide his force in the beginning of the campaign , a move which , though made in apparent violation of military rules , nevertheless gave him the initiative in his long and triumphant // game . What Greene might have accomplished on a wider field and with more ample resources can never be known . But the intellectual qualities which he showed in his Southern campaign were those which have characterized some of the foremost strategists of modern times . When Lord Cornwallis beard , from time to time , what was going on in South Carolina , he was not cheered by the news . But he was too far away to interfere , and it was on the very day of Eutaw Springs that the toils were drawn about him which were to compass his downfall . When he reached Petersburg , on the 20th of May , the youthful Lafayette , whom Washington had sent down to watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Richmond , with a little army of 3000 men , two thirds of them raw militia . To oppose this small force Cornwallis had now 5000 veterans , comprising the men whom he had brought away from Guilford , together with the forces lately under Arnold and Phillips . Arnold , after some useless burning and plundering , had been recalled to New York . Phillips had died of a fever just before Cornwallis arrived . The earl entertained great hopes . His failure in North Carolina ' rankled in his soul , and he was eager to make a grand stroke and retrieve his reputation . Could the powerful State of Virginia be conquered , it seemed as if everything south of the Susquehanna must fall , in spite of Greene 's successes . With his soul thus full of chivalrous enterprise , Cornwallis for the moment saw things in rose color , and drew wrong conclusions . He expected to find half the people Tories , and he also expected to find a state of chronic hostility between the slaves and their masters . On both points he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the task , lie knew , nevertheless , that 5000 men were not enough to conquer so strong a State , and he tried to persuade Clinton to abandon New York , if necessary , so that all the available British force might be concentrated upon Virginia . Clinton wisely refused . A State like Virginia , which , for the want of a loyalist party , could be held only by sheer conquest , was not fit for a basis of operations against the other States ; while the abandoning of New York , the recognized strategic centre of the Atlantic coast , would be interpreted by the whole world , not as a change of base , but as a confession of defeat . Clinton 's opinion was thus founded upon a truer and clearer view of the whole situation than Cornwallis 's ; nor is it likely that the latter would ever have urged such a scheme had he not been , in such a singular and unexpected way , elbowed out of North Carolina . Being now in Virginia , it was incumbent on him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal , it seemed as if he might easily begin by crushing Laf ayette . " The boy can not escape me , " said Cornwallis ; but the young Frenchman turned out to be more formidable than was supposed . Lafayette has never been counted a great general , and , indeed , though a noble and interesting character , he was in no wise a man of original genius ; but he had much good sense , and was quick at learning . He was now twenty-three years old , buoyant and kind , full of wholesome enthusiasm , and endowed with no mean sagacity . A Fabian policy was all that could be adopted for the moment . When Cornwallis advanced from Petersburg to Richmond , Lafayette began the skillful retreat which proved him an apt learner in the school of Washington and Greene . From Richmond toward Fredericksburg - over the ground since made doubly famous by the deeds of Lee and Grant - the youthful general kept up his retreat , yet never giving the eager earl a chance to deal him a blow ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I am not strong enough even to be beaten . " On the 4th of June Lafayette crossed the Rapidan at Ely 's Ford , and placed himself in a secure position ; while Cornwallis , refraining from the pursuit , sent Tarleton on a raid westward to Charlottesville , to break up the legislature , which was in session there , and to capture the governor , Thomas Jefferson . The raid , though conducted with Tarleton 's usual vigor , failed of its principal prey ; for Jefferson , forewarned in the nick of time , got off to the mountains about twenty minutes before the cavalry surrounded his house at Monticello . It remained for Tarleton to seize the military stores collected at Albemarle ; but on the 7th of June Lafayette effected a junction with 1000 Pennsylvania regulars under Wayne , and thereupon succeeded in placing his whole force between Tarleton and the prize he was striving to reach . Unable to break through this barrier , Tarleton had nothing left him but to rejoin Cornwarns ; and as Lafayette 's army was reinforced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , he became capable of annoying the earl in such wise n* to make him think it worth while to get nearer to the sen . Cornwallis , turning southwestward from the North Anna River , had proceeded as far inland as Point of Forks , when Tarleton joined him . . On the 15th of June , the British commander , finding that he could not catch " the boy , " and was accomplishing nothing by his marches and countermarches in the interior , retreated down the James River to Richmond . In so doing he did not yet put himself upon the defensive . Lafayette was still too weak to risk a battle , or to prevent his going wherever he liked . But Cornwallis was too prudent a general to remain at a long distance from his base of operations , among a people whom he had found , to his great disappointment , thoroughly hostile . By retreating to the seaboard , he could make sure of supplies and reinforcements , and might presently resume the work of invasion . Accordingly , on the 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chickahominy a little above White Oak Swamp , and marching down the York peninsula as far as Williamsburg . Lafayette , having been further reinforced by Steuben , so that his army numbered more than 5000 , pressed closely on the rear of the British all the way down the peninsula ; and on the 6th of July an action was fought between parts of the two armies , at Green Spring , near Williamsburg , in which the Americans were repulsed , with a loss of 145 men . The campaign was ended by the last week in July , when Cornwallis occupied Yorktown , adding the garrison of Portsmouth to his army , so that it numbered 7000 men , while Lafayette planted himself on Malvern Hill , and awaited further developments . Throughout this game of strategy , Lafayette had shown commendable skill , proving himself a worthy antagonist for the ablest of the British generals . But a far greater commander than either the Frenchman or the Englishman was now to enter unexpectedly upon the scene . The elements of the catastrophe were prepared , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow . As early as the 22d of May , just two days before the beginning of this Virginia campaign , Washington had held a conference with Rochambeau at Wethersfield , in Connecticut , and it was there decided that a combined attack should be made upon New York by the French and American armies . If they should succeed in taking the city , it would ruin the British cause ; and , at all events , it was hoped that if New York were seriously threatened Sir Henry Clinton would take reinforcements from Cornwallis , and thus relieve the pressure upon the Southern States . In order to undertake the capture of New York , it would be necessary to have the aid of a // powerful French fleet ; and the time had at last arrived when such assistance was confidently to be expected . The naval war between France and England in the West Indies had now raged for two years , with varying fortunes . The French government had exerted itself to the utmost , and early in the spring of this year had sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six frigates , carrying 1700 guns and 20,000 men , commanded by Count de Grasse , one of the ablest of the French admirals . It was designed to take from England the great island of Jamaica ; but as the need for naval cooperation upon the North American coast had been strongly urged upon the French ministry , Grasse was ordered to communicate with Washington and Rochambean , and to seize the earliest opportunity of acting in concert with them . The arrival of this fleet would introduce a feature into the war such as had not existed at any time since hostilities had begun . It would interrupt the British control over the water . The utmost force the British were ready to oppose to it amounted only to nineteen shipsof-the-line , carrying 1400 guns and 13,000 men , and this disparity was too great to be surmounted by anything short of the genius of a Nelson . The conditions of the struggle were thus about to be suddenly and decisively altered . The retreat of Cornwallis upon Yorktown had been based entirely upon the assumption of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of his position depended wholly upon the ability of the British fleet to control the Virginia waters . Once let the French get the upper hand there , and the earl , if assailed in front by an overwhelming land force , would be literally " between the devil and the deep sea . " He would be no better off than Burgoyne in the forests of northern New York . It was not yet certain , however , where Grasse would find it best to strike the coast . The elements of the situation disclosed themselves but slowly , and it required the master mind of Washington to combine them . Intelligence traveled at snail 's pace in those days , and operations so vast in extent were not within the compass of anything but the highest military genius . It took ten days for Washington to hear from Lafayette , and it took a month for him to hear from Greene , while there was no telling just when definite information would arrive from Grasse . But so soon as Washington heard from Greene , in April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began socretly to consider the possibility of leaving a small force to guard the Hudson , while taking the bulk of his army southward to overwhelm Cornwallis . At the Wethersfield conference , he spoke of this to Rochambeau , but to r* one else ; and a dispatch to Grasse gave him the choice of sailing either for the Hudson or for the Chesapeake . So matters stood till the middle of August , while Washington , grasping all the elements of the problem , vigilantly watched the whole field , holding himself in readiness for either alternative , - to strike New York close at hand , or to hurl his army to a distance of four hundred miles . On the 14th of August a message came from Grasse that he was just starting from the West Indies for Chesapeake Bay , with his whole fleet , and hoped that whatever the armies had to do might be done quickly , as he should be obliged to return to the West Indies by the middle of October . Washington could now couple with this the information , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorktown , where he had deep water on three sides of him , and a narrow neck in front . The supreme moment of Washington 's military career had come , - the // moment for realizing a conception which had nothing of a Fabian character about it , for it was a conception of the same order as those in which Caesar and Napoleon dealt . He decided at once to transfer his army to Virginia and overwhelm Cornwallis . He had everything in readiness . The army of Rochambeau had marched through Connecticut , and joined him on the Hudson in July . He could afford to leave West Point with a comparatively small force , for that strong fortress could be taken only by a regular siege , and he had planned his march so as to blind Sir Henry Clinton completely . This was one of the finest points in Washington 's scheme , in which the perfection of the details matched the audacious grandeur of the whole . Sir Henry was profoundly unconscious of any such movement as Washington was about to execute ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , from the American headquarters near West Point , Washington could take his army more than half-way through New Jersey without arousing any suspicion at all ; for the enemy would be sure to interpret such a movement as preliminary to an occupation of Staten Island , as a point from which to assail New York . Sir Henry knew that the French fleet might be expected at any moment ; but he had not the clue which Washington held , and his anxious thoughts were con-cerned with New York harbor , and not with Chesapeake Bay . Besides all this , the sheer audacity of the movement served still further to screen its true meaning . It would take some time for  --  the enemy to comprehend so huge a - *sweep as that from New York to Virginia , and doubtless Washington could Teach Philadelphia before his purpose could be fathomed . The events justified his foresight . On the 19th of August , five days after receiving the dispatch from Grasse , Washington 's army crossed the Hudson at King 's Ferry , and began its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force at Saratoga , and General Heath , with 4000 men , remained at West Point . Washington took with him southward 2000 Continentals and 4000 Frenchmen . It was the only time during the war that French and American land forces marched together , save on the occasion of the disastrous attack upon Savannah . None save Washington and Rochambeau knew whither they were going . So precious was the secret that even the general officers supposed , until New Brunswick was passed , that their destination was Staten Island . So rapid was the movement that , however much the men might have begun to wonder , they had reached Philadelphia before the purpose of the expedition was distinctly understood . As the army marched through the streets of Philadelphia , there was an outburst of exulting hope . The plan could no longer be concealed . Congress was informed of it , and a fresh light shone upon the people , already elated by the news of Greene 's career of triumph . The windows were thronged with fair ladies , who threw sweet flowers on the dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts , anticipating the great deliverance that was so soon to come . The column of soldiers , in the loose order adapted to its swift march , was nearly two miles in length . First came the war-worn Americans , clad in rough toggery , which eloquently told the story of the meagre resources of a country without a government . Then followed the gallant Frenchmen , clothed in gorgeous trappings , such as could be provided by a government which at that time took three fourths of the earnings of its people in unrighteous taxation . There was some parading of these soldiers before the president of Congress , but time was precious . Washington , in his eagerness galloping on to Chester , // received and sent back the joyful intelligence that Grasse had arrived in Chesapeake Bay , and then the glee of the people knew no bounds . Bands of music played in the streets , every house hoisted its stars - and - stripes , and all the roadside taverns shouted success to the bold general . " Long live Washington ! " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch Cornwallis in his mousetrap ! " But these things did not stop for a moment the swift advance of the army . It was on the 1st of September that they left Trenton behind them , and by the 5th they had reached the head of Chesapeake Bay , whence they were conveyed in ships , and reached the scene of action , near Yorktown , by the 18th . Meanwhile , all things had been working together most auspiciously . On the 31st of August the great French squadron had arrived on the scene , and the only Englishman capable of defeating it , under the existing odds , was far away . Admiral Rodney 's fleet had followed close upon its heels from the West Indies , but Rodney himself was not in command . He had been taken ill suddenly , and had sailed for England , and Sir Samuel Hood commanded the fleet . Hood outsailed Grasse , passed him on the ocean without knowing it , looked in at the Chesapeake on the 25th of August , and , finding no enemy there , sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who commanded the naval force in the North . This was the first that Graves or Clinton knew of the threatened danger . Not a moment was to be lost . The winds were favorable , and Graves , now chief-in-command , crowded sail for the Chesapeake , and arrived on the 5th of September , the very day on which Washington 's army was embarking at the head of the great bay . Graves found the French fleet blocking the entrance to the bay , and instantly attacked it . A decisive naval victory for the British would at this moment have ruined everything . But after a sharp fight of two hours ' duration , in which some 700 men were killed and wounded on the two fleets , Admiral Graves withdrew . Three of his ships were badly damaged , and after nianeuvring for four days he returned , baffled and despondent , to New York , leaving Grasse in full possession of the Virginia waters . The toils were thus fast closing around Lord Cornwallis . He knew nothing as yet of Washington 's approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his danger , and , crossing the James River , seek safety in a retreat upon North Carolina . Lafayette forestalled this solitary chance . Immediately upon the arrival of the French squadron , the troops of the Marquis de Saint-Simon , 3000 in number , had been set on shore and added to Lafayette 's army ; and with this increased force , now amounting to more than 8000 men , " the boy " came down on the 7th of September , and took his stand across the neck of the peninsula at Williamsburg , cutting off Cornwallis 's retreat . Thus , on the morning of the 8th , the very day on which Greene , in South Carolina , was fighting his last battle at Eutaw Springs , Lord Cornwallis , in Vim ' - ginia , found himself surrounded . The door of the mousetrap was shut . Still , but for the arrival of Washington , the plan would probably have failed . It was still in Cornwallis 's power to burst the door open . His force was nearly equal to Lafayette 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained 3000 militia . Cornwallis carefully reconnoitred the American lines , and seriously thought of breaking through ; but the risk was considerable , and heavy loss was inevitable . He had not the slightest inkling of Washington 's movements , and he believed that Graves would soon return with force enough to drive away Grasse 's blockading squadron . So he decided to wait before strik // ing a hazardous blow . It was losing his last chance . On the 14th Washington reached Lafayette 's headquarters , and took command . On the 18th the Northern army began arriving in detachments , and by the 26th it was all concentrated at Williamsburg , more than 16,000 strong . The problem was solved . The surrender of Cornwallis was only a question of time . It was the great military surprise of the Revolutionary War . Had any one predicted , eight months before , that Washington on the Hudson and Cornwallis on the Catawaba , eight hundred miles apart , would so soon come together and terminate the war on the coast of Virginia , he would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promptness of execution , the movement , on Washington 's part , was as remarkable as the march of Napoleon in the autumn of 1805 , when lie swooped from the shore of the English Channel into Bavaria , and captured the Austrian army at Thin . By the 2d of September , Sir Henry Clinton , learning that the American army had reached the Delaware , and coupling with this the information he had got from Admiral Hood , began to suspect the true nature of Washington 's movement , and was at his wit 's end . The only thing he could think of was to make a counterstroke on the coast of Connecticut , and he accordingly dotached Benedict Arnold with 2000 men to attack New London . This was a thoroughly wanton assault , for it did not and could not produce the slightest effect upon the movements of Washington . By the time the news of it had reached Virginia the combination against Cornwallis had been completed , and day by day the lines were drawn more closely about the doomed army . Yorktown was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel was opened by General Lincoln . On the 11th , the second parallel , within three hundred yards of the enemy 's works , was opened by Steuben . On the night of the 14th Alexander Hamilton and the Baron de Viomenil carried two of the British redoubts by storm . On the next night the British made a gallant but fruitless sortie . By noon of the 16th their work.s were fast crumbling to pieces , under the fire of seventy cannon . On the 17th - the fourth anniversary of Burgoyne 's surrender - Coruwallis hoisted the white flag . The terms of the surrender were like those of Lincoln 's at Charleston . The British army became prisoners of war , subject to the ordinary rules of exchange . The only delicate question related to the American loyalists in the army , whom Cornwallis felt it wrong to leave in the lurch . This point was neatly disposed of by allowing him to send a ship to Sir Henry Clinton , with news of the catastrophe , and to embark in it such troops as he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions asked . On a little matter of etiquette the Americans were more exacting . The practice of playing the enemy 's tunes had always been cherished as an inalienable prerogative of British soldiery ; and at the surrender of Charleston , in token of humiliation , General Lincoln 's army had been expressly forbidden to play any but an American tune . Colonel Laurens , who now conducted the negotiations , directed that Lord Cornwallis 's sword should be received by General Lincoln , and that the army , on marching out to lay down its arms , should play a British or a German air . There was no help for it ; and on the 19th of October , Cornwallis 's army , 7247 in number , with 840 seamen , marched out , with colors furled and cased , while the band played a quaint old English melody , of which the significant title was The World Turned Upside Down ! On the very same day that Cornwallis surrendered , Sir Henry Clinton , having received naval reinforcements , sailed // from New York with twenty-five shipsof-the-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five days brought him to the mouth of the Chesapeake , where he learned that he was too late , as had been the case four years before , when he tried to relieve Burgoyne . A fortnight earlier , this force could hardly have failed to alter the result , for the fleet was strong enough to dispute with Grasse the control over the coast . The French have always taken to themselves the credit of the victory of Yorktown . In the palace of Versailles there is a room the walls of which are covered with huge paintings depicting the innumerable victories of France , from the days of Chlodwig to those of Napoleon . Near the end of the long series , the American visitor can not fail to notice a scene which is labeled " Bataille de Yorcktown " ( misspelled , as is the Frenchman 's wont in dealing with the words of outer barbarians ) , in which General Rochambeau occupies the most commanding position , while General Washington is perforce contented with a subordinate place . This is not correct history , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington . But it should never be forgotten , not only that the 4000 men of Rochambeau and the 3000 of Saint-Simon were necessary for the successful execution of the plan , but also that without the formidable fleet of Grasse the plan could not even have been made . How much longer the war might have dragged out its tedious length , or what might have been its final issue , without this timely assistance , can never be known ; and our debt of gratitude to France for her aid on this supreme occasion is something which can not be too heartily acknowledged . Early on a dark morning of the fourth week in October , an honest old German , slowly pacing the streets of Philadelphia on his night-watch , began shouting , " Basht dree o'glock , und Goruvallis ish dakendt ! " and light sleepers sprang out of bed and threw up their windows . Washington 's courier laid the dispatches before Congress in the forenoon , and after dinner a service of prayer and thanksgiving was held in the Lutheran Church . At New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every village green in the country was ablaze with bonfires . The Duke de Lauzun sailed for France in a swift ship , and on the 27th of November all the houses in Paris were illuminated , and the aisles of Notre Dame resounded with the Te Deum . At noon of November 25th the news was brought to Lord George Germaine , at his house in Pall Mall . Getting into a cab , he drove hastily to the Lord Chancellor 's house in Great Russell Street , Bloomsbury , and took him in ; and then they drove to Lord North 's office in Downing Street . At the staggering news , all the Prime Minister 's wonted gayety forsook him . He walked wildly up and down the room , throwing his arms about and crying , " 0 God ! it is all over ! it is all over ! it is all over ! " A dispatch was sent to the king at Kew , and when Lord George received the answer that evening , at dinner , he observed that his Majesty wrote calmly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing which had never happened before . " The tidings , " says Wraxall , who narrates these incidents , " were calculated to diffuse a gloom over the most convivial society , and opened a wide field for political speculation . " There were many people in England , however , who looked at the matter differently from Lord North . This crushing defeat was just what the Duke of Richmond , at the beginning of the war , had publicly declared he hoped for . Charles Fox always took especial delight in reading about the defeats of invading armies , from Marathon and Salamis downward ; and over the news of Cornwaflis 's sur // render he leaped from his chair and clapped his hands . In a debate in Parlianient , four months before , the youthful William Pitt had denounced the American war as " most accursed , wicked , barbarous , cruel , unnatural , unjust , and diabolical , " which led Burke to observe , " He is not a chip of the ol*l block ; he is the old block itself ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the overthrow of the personal government of George III. , was now close at hand . For a long time the goveminent had been losing favor . In the summer of 1780 the British victories in South Carolina had done something to strengthen it ; yet when , in the autumn of that year , Parliament was dissolved , although the king complained that his expenses for purposes of corruption had been twice as great as ever before , the new Parliament was scarcely more favorable to the ministry than the old one . Misfortunes and perplexities crowded in the path of Lord North and his colleagues . The example of American resistance had told upon Ireland , and it was in the full tide of that agitation which is associated with the names of Flood and Grattan that the news of Cornwallis 's surrender was received . For more than a year there had been war in India , where Hyder Ali , for the moment , was carrying everything before him . France , eager to regain her lost foothold upon Hindustan , sent a strong armament thither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian conquests except Bengal . For a moment England 's great Eastern empire tottered , and was saved only by the superhuman exertions of Warren Hastings , aided by the wonderful military genius of Sir Eyre Coote . In May , 1781 , the Spaniards had taken Pensacola , thus driving the British from their last positicrn in Florida . In February , 1782 , the Spanish fleet captured Minorca , and the siege of Gibraltar , which had been kept up for nearly three years , was pressed . with redoubled energy . During the winter the French recaptured St. Eustatius , and handed it over to Holland ; and Grasse 's great fleet swept away all the British possessions in the West Indies , except Jamaica , Barbadoes , and Antigua . All this time the Northern League kept up its jealous watch upon British cruisers in the narrow seas , and among all the powers of Europe the government of Gcorge III . could not find a single friend . The maritime supremacy of England was , however , impaired but for a moment . Rodney was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April , 1782 , his fleet of thirty-six ships encountered the French near the island of Sainte - Marie - Galante . The battle of eleven hours which ensued , and in which 5000 men were killed or wounded , was one of the most tremendous contests ever witnessed upon the ocean before the time of Nelson . The French were totally defeated , and Grasse was taken prisoner , - the first French comniander-in-chief , by Aea or land , who had fallen into an enemy 's hands since Marshal Tallard gave up his sword to Marlborough , on the terrible day of Blenheim . France could do nothing to repair this crushing disaster . Her naval power was eliminated from the situation at a single blow ; and in the course of the summer the English achieved another great success by overthrowing the Spaniards at Gibraltar , after a struggle which , for dogged tenacity , is scarcely paralleled in the annals of modern warfare . By the autumn of 1782 , England , defeated in the United States , remained victorious and defiant as regarded the other parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late to save the doomed ministry of Lord North . After the surrender of Cornwallis , no one but the king thought of pursuing the war in America any further . Even he gave up all hope of subduing the United States ; but he in- // From King ' 8 liftountain to Yorktown. sisted upon retaining the State of Georgia , with the cities of Charleston and New York ; and he vowed that , rather than acknowledge the independence of the United States , he would abdicate the throne and retire to Hanover . Lord George Germaine was dismissed from office , Sir Henry Clinton was superseded by Sir Guy Carleton , and the king began to dream of a new campaign . But his obstinacy was of no avail . During the winter and spring , General Wayne , acting under Greene 's orders , drove the British from Georgia , while at home the country squires began to go over to the opposition ; and Lord North , utterly discouraged and disgusted , refused any longer to pursue a policy of which he disapproved . The baffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declared that the Americans were a wretched set of knaves , and he was glad to be rid of them . The House of Commons began to talk of a vote of censure on the administration . A motion of Conway 's , petitioning the king to stop the war , was lost by only a single vote ; and at last , on the 20th of March , 1782 , Lord North bowed to the storm , and resigned . The two sections of the Whig party coalesced . Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister , and with him came into office Shelburne , Camden , and Grafton , as well as Fox and Conway , the puke of Richmond , and Lord John Cavendish , - stanch friends of America all of them , whose appointment involved the recognition of the independence of the United States . Lord North observed thathe had often been accused of issuing lying bulletins , but he had never told so big a lle as that with which the new ministry announced its entrance into power ; for in introducing the name of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " His Majesty has been pleased to appoint " ! It was indeed a day of bitter humiliation for George III. , and the men who had been his tools . But , it was a day of happy omen for the English race , in the Old World as well as in the New . For the advent of Lord Rockingham 's ministry meant not merely the independence of the United States ; it meant the downfall of the , only serious danger with which English liberty has been threatened since the expulsion of the Stuarts . The personal government which George III . had . sought to establish , with its wholesale corruption , its shameless violations of public law , and its attacks upon freedom of speech and of the press , became irredeemably discredited , and tottered to its fall ; while the great England of William III. , of Walpole , of Chatham , of the younger Pitt , of Peel , and of* Gladstone was- set free to pursue its no- ' ble career . Such was the priceless boon which the younger nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polit- , ical justice , conferred upon the elder . The decisive battle of freedom in Eng-. land as well as in America , and in all that vast colonial world for which Chat- , ham prophesied the dominion of the future , had now been fought and won . And foremost in accomplishing this glorious work had been the lofty genius of , Washington , and the steadfast valor of the men who suffered with him at Valley Forge , and whom he led to victory at Yorktown.
