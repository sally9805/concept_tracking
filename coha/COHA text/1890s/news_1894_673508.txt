The total registration was 6.455 , and the total vote 5,675 . Although the vote is 810 below the registration , it is larger than the aggregate usually cast at a city election . To-night the Republicans claim that their Success is due to the " haled times . " The Democrats say that the use of money by their opponents contributed to their defeat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things better here than in Troy or in Gravesend or in the " Banner Second " of Manhattan Island . There are no " Bat " Sheas , no , I no Newtons , no Sutherlands , no Divvers , in this town . If there are imitators of Gravesend or Troy or Bowery methods in the " Terrace City " they keep consistently under cover . Whether Bangs or Peene should be Mayor was , of course , the momentous problem today . Yonkers had been considering it nearly a month . There was nothing flippant in the treatment the question commanded . The constituency took it up quite seriously . A Republican Mayor had for two years occupied the executive chair in the old Manor Hall . The Yonkers Democracy resolved on a united effort to wrest a city naturally Democratic from the boastful adversary . Thus John Kendrick Bangs was brought into the fight Mr. Bangs 's availability as a candidate was promptly recognized by his fellow-citizens . The suggestion of his name evoked genuine enthusiasm . Although he was widely known as a huTriorist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . Merriment over the fun in the " Drawer " of Harper 's did not preclude them from recognizing him as a man of solid merit and visible adaptability to local needs . Here was one whom Yonkers knew and liked , a young , alert , and active man , who could be depended on for a capital administration . There were signs of approval on every hand when Mr. Bangs consented to stand . Almost everybody believed he would win . The opposition behaved in real neighborlyfashion toward Mr. Bangs . They even forgave him for being " funny . " They wanted to beat him for party reasons and regretted the necessity of trying on personal grounds . A shallow wag who suggested that Mr. Bangs cherished a special aversion to cats met with the answer that he was inordinately fond of them and it did n't matter anyhow . Yonkers did not intend , in any event , to embark in a cat-teasing enterprise at this stage of municipal history . Cats aside , the Republicans put up a brisk fight . Their candidate , Capt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . Capt . Peene is President of the Ben Franklin Steamboat Company . His family has been running a transportation line to and from New-York since Yonkers was a village . The Captain is fifty years old , as against thirty-one for his competitor . He is simple in speech , bluff in manner , and has a speaking acquaintance with nearly every man , woman , and child in the place . He did not give way to profound emotion on receiving the nomination . He said he would like to win , now that he was in the field , but he thought Mr. Bangs was a first-rate man and his strongest towboat could not draw out a word against him . Equally courteous was the conduct of Mr. , Bangs . His canvass was modest , intelligent , and dignified . His speeches before the Iroquois Club and in various sections of the city were terse , lucid , and wholly free from vituperation or demagogy . They referred pertinently to the material needs of the town and promised , in the event of success , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Election day brought no interruption in the " era of good feeling . " Candidate Bangs was up and about bright and early at his pretty home on North Broadway . As he buttoned his blue overcoat about him on stepping from the porch , he remarked that it might be a " cold day " for somebody . The Mayoralty candidates were not fairly started on their rounds till noon . Mr. Bangs sipped his Mocha at breakfast as unconcernedly as if he were not on the ticket Capt . Peene attended quietly to business at the steamboat dock . They left the skirmishing to the nominees for Aldermen and Supervisors , who managed to get around the city wards with astonishing celerity . After luncheon , the real battle commenced . Mr. Bangs made the tour of the polls in a handsome carriage . Two neighbors accompanied him . He was as cheerful as the sunshine that danced on the Hudson and as breezy as the gusts that swept the Palisades . Everywhere cordial greeting awaited him . The aristocrats of Palisade Avenue , Broadway , and Ashburton Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street and on the " flats . " On the Heights , the women manifested a lively interest in the fight . Mr. Bangs , besides being a social favorite , is a crack tennis player , and his interest in athletic sports was not foreotten . Many a fair Yonkers matron exacted a promise from her sovereign lord and master than he would vote for Bangs before taking train for town . The promise , with rare exceptions , was religiously kept Meantime , the " practical " politicians were not idle . Ex-State Senator Frank P. Trainor , Lawyer Daly , and other experienced party men were hard at work all day getting out the vote . They found some apathy in the manufacturing districts , where about 1,200 persons are out of work , but at nightfall they were not discouraged . It appeared later that the Republicans were in a furtive way trying to make a point of industrial depression . They did not go so far as to charge Mr. Bangs with bringing on hard times . They only said that a Republican Mayor in Yonkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff reform . What the Mayor of Yonkers had to do with the tariff they did not explain . For " heelers " and " strikers " the election was as cold as the weather . There - were not many of them in sight . The police kept them moving , and they were not allowed near any of the polling places . One of them grumbled his complaint in this fashion as he shivered on the sunny side of Main Street : " Times hard in Yonkers ? Well , I should smile . What these reformers have brought us to with their ballot laws is too rough to think of . Why , I can remember when they would give me $4 or $5 for my vote . Now they would n't give me 4 or 5 cents . I would move if there was any place to move to . But there is n't . Look at Coney Island in State prison , Sutherland run away , and the rest in the penitentiary. - Look at Troy . Money put up to raise a monument to Ross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the life 's all gone out of the election business . " Candidate Bangs dined imperturbably at Ws North Broadway residence in the early evening . He declined to talk about the tion further than to say that it would speak for itself when the returns came in . Candidate Feene , after a farewell visit to the polling places , retired to his home on Locust Hill Avenue . The Captain and the smart bay trotter that had drawn him about during the a.fternobn were both a trifle weary .
