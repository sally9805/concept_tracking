txt Q N the greater part of the earth 's surface men may dwell uncoiiiscious of the fact that the earth is a vast laboratory which is day by day accomplishing great constructive work , which in the process of the years and ages brings about revolutions in the forms of land and sea as well as the nature of their climates , and thus alters all the conditions of life . Those who live near active volcanoes , or in lands which arc frequently shaken by earthquakes , now and then have evidence brought to them which shows that this globe is a work-shop wherein much is done ; but in most lands the order of nature is so quiet , and its processes so familiar , that the whole appears merely commonplace . It is otherwise , however , with those who dwell in the peculiar realm where the great reservoir of the waters comes in contact with the land : on the ocean 's shore the processes of change are so marked , man 's combat with them so continued , that all mariners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far more vivid impression of the earth 's activities . All those who would find an easy way to a conception of the facts of geologic science should take up their inquiry on the coast-line : if they understand the processes which are there in operation - they are indeed easily understoodthey will gain a clue to nearly all the great truths of geology . The portion of the earth 's machinery that may there be seen in operation , or may be readily inferred from that which is visible , is of the utmost importance in the development of this sphere . It is only necessary clearly to see what is going on upon this part of the land and ocean , and then to conceive the conditions arising from the accumulation of these effects through the ages of the past , to bring before the mind that picture of the slow yet majestic progress of the earth 's history which it is the peculiar privilege of the geologist to win from his studies .

It is best that the waters should be rich in the life of marine plants and animals , and the land forested to the margin ; for the relation of the earth 's work to living creatures is likewise important to his inquiry . Fortunately the shores of this sort are abundantly provided for the student 's use . The eastern coast of the United States , from th' mouth of the Hudson River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from San Francisco to Behring 's Strait , the northern coast of Britain , from Scarborough on the coast around by the chalk downs on the south , as well as the northern shores of the European continent , afford ideal fields for this class of studies . It is only when the student has become well versed in the great array of actions which he may observe within a few miles journey in any of these fields , that he will have occasion to undertake special journeys to see peculiar aspects of the coast-line , such as are afforded by the coral reefs of Florida , or the singular effects produced where active volcanoes build their cones along the shore or up from the depths of the ocean . Interesting as these special features are , they are only incidental elements in marine work , concerning rather the professional geologist than the amateur . Arriving on a shore such as we have advised the observer to select , he is likely to be at first confounded by the multitude of the facts which this line of interacting land and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the phenoniena of nature , much entangled with each other ; all united in the common features which she always presents to the untrained eye . It is well for the student to remember , as a protection against discouragement , that this blended aspect of the work which is done on the earth , is what appears to all beginners in inquiry . All science indeed has come to exist through the patient labors of students who have slowly done the work of unravelling the tangled web of interlaced actions , some part of which in turn each faithful inquirer must with the teacher 's aid repeat . It is not to be expected that each individual seeker for truth shall go through all the laborious processes of thought which have made the science he seeks to acquire ; it is the part of his guide to show him the road through the wilderness , to keep him from the blind paths which lead to no profit ; but , if he would acquire the strength which can come from his personal activity , he must patiently tread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ask the novice to have in mind certain large truths of geology which may serve as a background upon which he may frame the special conceptions which will come to him from his shore-line studies . He may be assured that all these general conceptions will be more or less verified by the work which he is to do . The first of these concerns the contrast between the essential conditions of the two great divisions of the earth 's surface , the land of the continents and islands , and the water-covered areas of the seafloors . All the land above the level of the oceans which is somewhat unreasonably called dry , for it is everywhere flowed over and leached through by water , is subjected to continual wearing by the action of the elements . Every raindrop as it falls and strikes ground unprotected by vegetation takes away a little of the earth . The streams take much , every spring sends its tribute of mud , sand , or dissolved rocky matter to the sea , and the ocean itself , by its unending assault upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasts save where the coral reefs build effective walls against the waves . All this water of rain-drop , stream , or spring , is sent from the sea through the air for the direct downward attack on the emerged fields of the earth , so that the battle the oceans unendingly wage is so set that it assaults the opposing land in two directions : on the sea face it assails by the surges , and in the interior by the rain , the flowing water , and the glaciers . The result is that the lands are constantly wearing away , while the sea - floor is taking the sediments which the waters have given to it and building them into new deposits . The effect of this action , if it were not // Point Finnin Cal . The view shows the effect of the sea on a shore composed of stratified rock of moderate hardness which dips toward the ocean . The harder fragments of the strata form a shingled heach , the fragments of which in times f storm are driven against the hase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in time the dry parts of the earth would utterly disappear and the seas be in good part filled with the waste they had won from them ; but there are compensations to this action : the lands are constantly growing npward from the action of those forces which elevate mountain-chains , probably also the whole of the vast ridge which constitutes the body of each continent is also characterized by a massive upward growth ; at the same time the ocean basins seem to be ever deepening by the downsinking of their floors . The result of these beautifnl compensating movements is , that although the contest between land and sea is the most ancient , far extended , and unbroken of all the many combats which make up the life of this sphere , neither side is ever victorious or is ever likely to prevail . It is indeed only in a metaphoric way that it can be called a battle at all , for the results of the interaction are profitable to the interests of sea and land alike . On the land the continued wearing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its organic life depends are ever renewed by the destructive processes of erosion . If any considerable time went by without the old soils being swept away , the effete earthy matter would become unfit for the nurture of plants , and plant and animal life alike would fail of support . This waste , in part dissolved in water , nourishes the marine life , and in part in the form of mud is contributed to the strata which in time are to be lifted into the air with the upward growth of the continent from whence it came . Here as elsewhere modern sci Shakespeare Cliff , near Decer England . Showing the effect of heavy waves on rather soft rocks . The steep beach at the base of the cliff is composed of fragments of flint originally scattered through the mass of chalk which forms the headland . In times of heavy storm the sea enters the slight caves which appear in the lower portion of the precipice . Recently fallen masses are shown at the extremity of the headland . // ence has shown that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considered in a large way , is always for the profit of the whole . With such a broad preliminary survey in mind , the observer may well begin his detailed studies of the shore at some point where the sea and land meet in a steep rocky cliff which descends abruptly from its crest into the sea at its foot . It is easiest to inspect such a bit of shore at a time when the sea is quite still ; for then it may be approached in a boat . On the northern coast of the Atlantic , from New York northward , these rocky faces of the shore are generally more or less rounded by the action of the moving sheet of ice which lay upon them during the last glacial period . We are very likely to find the upper portion of the steep , that which is above the level where the waves do their work , still bearing here and there the scratches which so plainly tell of the ice time . Occasionally , when the water at the base of the cliff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm set , is preserved even within the belt where the surges impinge upon it . This fact tells us that the sea has under certain conditions little effect on a shore of this nature . This is made the clearer by the presence on the surface of the stone of a mass of marine animals and plants , algm , sea anemones , etc. , which , firmly adhering to the stones , can resist the blow of the waves . If in times of storm we crawl to the verge of such a cliff we may see the waves surging violently against its base , but we observe that they do not strike an effective blow , but merely swash up and down . As we shall shortly see , their action is impotent as compared to what it is when the cliffs do not descend into deep water , but have something like a beach at their base . The fact is that the ocean waves , when they beat against a rock-bound shore where the firm cliffs descend into deep Yesnabie Castle , Orkney . The view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been separated from the cliff by the longcontinned action of waves and ice . It should be noted that all the debris of the rock between the pinnacle and the shore has been broken np and carried away . The main cliff as well as the detached mass shows distinct joints , and also bedding planes . The latter exhibit in a remarkable manner the phenomena of cross bedding . This shows that they were formed upon or near an ancient shore-line. // water , have very little destructive power . When they strike the shore they may apply a pressure of from one to three tons per square foot of surface against which they run , but this can only break away the masses of stone which have been loosened by the action of frost or the other processes of decay . On a shore which has recently been overridden by the glacial ice , the weaker kinds of rock have been pretty generally worn away , and it is only slowly that they yield to the sea 's assault . Yet , now and then masses tumble from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even on the steepest shores , we find where the debris from the precipices has been sufficient to make a beachlike accumulation such as is shown in the illustration ( page 613 ) . As soon as this mass of dThris comes near enough at last able to do their effective work . We may observe them rolling in from the deep in the form of broad folds of the ocean 's surface ; when the advancing margin of each wave arrives at the shallower water at the outer part of the inclined plane of debris , the friction of the bottom opposes the forward movement , and causes the front of the surf swiftly to rise into the form of a wall the upper part of the mass of the water being less retarded than that at the base , shoots violently forward , and near the shore tumbles over in the manner of the familiar breakers or surf . When the waves break at the foot of cliffs they then strike vastly more effective blows than when they splash against them , as they do when they roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow bottom in Natural Bridge , Santa Cruz , Went Indian . Remnant of a sea cave ; the inland portion of the arch has fallen in and the space has been widened by the waves which roll in beneath the bridge . The horizontal strata are of limestone , and are thus easily dissolved by the waves . The material is much jointed , and so the pebbles on the beach are very small . to the surface to be much affected by the dragging action of the waves as they surge against the steep , the stones are arranged by the waves so that they assume more distinctly the beach form . In this state of the shore the surges are times of heavy storms , they hurl the loose stones , even if they weigh a ton or more , forward against the base of the cliff . The blow these wave-swayed stones can strike is very great ; it is sometimes almost as effective as that // which is delivered by a shot from an ancient battery against a besieged wall . If the student will watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect we are describing , he will note that , both to eyes and ears . the effects are very different from what he observed in the part of the shore where the cliffs descended into deep water . Against the steep cliffs there were no combing breakers , and the waves gave forth only a muffled roar as they struck the steep ; here , however , they rush up the stony beach in a confused white mass of water , air , and stones . As the mass strikes the base of the cliff we hear the roar of the waters , and the keen ear can detect also the crash of the stones as they strike against the base of the cliff . If after the storm has ceased the observer will , at a time of low tide , visit this strand which he could before see only from a distance , he will be able to examine the result of the wave-work . At the base of the cliff where the snrges have beaten , he will generally find that the rocks have been rudely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the upper part of the cliff somewhat overhangs its base ; he may note where great masses of the stone deprived of support have slipped away from their bed places , and fallen to the base . Some of these have been too large for the waves to toss about , and they remain as angular fragments somewhat rounded , it may be on the side toward the sea , by the battering they have received from the pebbles which have been hurled against them . Other and smaller pieces of the bed - rocks which have fallen from the overhanging cliff have been worn against the base until they have had their sharp corners beaten off ; yet others have been ground into spheres by the pounding they have received , looking like the stone cannon-balls which in early times served in siege - guns . Putting these facts together so that their whole meaning is plain , the student perceives that in a single very great storm the face of the cliff may be worn back to the average distance of some inches , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sea on massive but somewhat jointed rock , the base of which lies at no great depth beneath the surface of the sea . The effect of dykes is shown in the deep recesses in the middle distance . A large fragment which has fallen from the nndermined cliff is seen in the foreground . // more steadfastly , but in an inevitable way , as the stones of the overhanging precipice are loosened by frost and decay . We can often trace the distance to which the sea has cut back from the place where it was left at the last change in the level of the land by the broad , rocky shelf leading off to the edge of the deeper water . Sometimes , as in the coast of Yorkshire just south of Whitby , this extends as a flat table of stone at about the line of low tide , to a distance of a mile or more from the base of the cliffs . On this Yorkshire coast the cliffs rise in places to the height of six or eight hundred feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shipwrecked mariners and persons who have been imprisoned against their base by the swift rising tide have to be rescued , if they are saved at all , by means of baskets or ladders lowered from the summit of the escarpment . A similar , though less extensive , wave-worn shelf extends along the southern shore of the island of Anticosti , in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , for the distance of more than one hundred miles . There as elsewhere ships are apt to strike against the margin of the wave-shelf and to go to pieces or fall away and sink in the deep water which borders the ledge . The great distance to the shore , and the wild tumble of waters which a great storm produces on the rocky table , make shipwreck in these conditions peculiarly hopeless for the mariner . Shores of this nature are always formed where the open sea is bordered by hard rocks and has remained for a long geologic time at the same elevation with reference to the assault of the waves . Where a rocky shore does not exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast has been recently changed , that the land has been either lowered or uplifted . It is a feature deserving attention that these wave-benches rarely retain on their surfaces any considerable part of the d6-bris which has been removed from the cliffs : here and there , scattered over their surfaces , we find bits which have been fastened in the crevices of the bench , but except where fresh fragments are supplied by the fall of the cliffs , the wide surface is usually as clean as a floor . This feature is peculiarly well shown on the great Yorkshire wave-terrace , but is noticeable in all similar structure . It is in a word evident that all the matter torn from the receding cliffs is in some way removed to a distance from the place where it falls ; a little consideration and a few observations on the ground will show us the manner and the measure of its removal . Let us first notice that nearly all the detritus at the foot of the cliffs is of a pebbly nature ; in general it consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is evident that a large part of the rock which has been worn from those stones was taken away in the form of powder or sand . We can often , in the case of granite pebbles , see that the surfaces have been crushed by the blows they have received . We readily apprehend the fact that in the mill of the surf at the base of these rocky precipices , the fate of the rocks is to be ground into a very fine grist , which is easily borne away to a distance by the strong currents which exist in times of storm . If the waves rolled directly in at right angles to the face of the cliffs , and the wind blew in the same direction , the only current which would exist on the shore would arise from the reflux of the water and the undertow or current which sets out along the bottom of the sea from a beach on to which the waves are rolling . These movements of the water can however convey the detritus to only a little distance from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves rarely come squarely down upon the coast , but strike it a little obliquely , and the wind generally blows in the same direction in which the waves run . The result is that there is almost always a strong current made by the water which the waves heave and that which the wind blows against the shores , which sets as a river in one or the other direction along the coast . Moreover , the tidal currents more or less combining with these actions , add to the stream . Those who are familiar with the shore and have seen a number of shipwrecks , know that the wreckage and the bodies of the drowned usually do not come ashore just abreast of the stranded vessel , but drift in one direction , often to the distance of miles from // Seashore View . Showing the position of the mantle of sea-weed which protects the rocks from the action of frost and , in a measure , from the assaults of the waves . Note that the smaller fragosents which may he tossed ahout are destitute of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreground against which the hoy is leaning shows the scouring action of the waves which they effect hy means of the sand which they impel. the place of the disaster . Those who have escaped by swimming or floating on spars to the shore , have had an even more impressive experience with this swift storm-born river of the coast . These shore currents are strong enough to sweep away a part of the detritus formed along the shore , even materials as coarse as small pebbles may be borne along by it to the deeper re-entrant angles , where it is accumulated in the beaches which we are in time to study . The coarser pebbles , which are too heavy to be borne along by these currents , Journey in the grasp of the waves more slowly , but ever as certainly , to the beaches . The process by which they travel is this each wave , as it sweeps up and down the slope next the cliff , in most cases runs a little obliquely to the face of the shore , so that with the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it first became rounded into a pebble . With each backward move of the retreating splash it is drawn away from the sea-margin to return with the next surge . With every successive advance and retreat it may journey onward for the distance of a few feet , and so , wearing at every stroke of the wave it moves on . A large part of these rolling stones wear out before . they attain the greater beaches . Before we follow the waste from the point where it is made into pebbles and sand to the part of the shore where we have characteristic beaches , we must return to the cliff section to consider many interesting details of the work which is done there by the waves , tides , and the many other elements of activity which operate in this singular part of the great laboratory of nature . All who are familiar with the rock-bound coasts which are much worn by the waves , have noticed the fact that the coast is very irregularly worn ; rarely indeed is the escarpment of the cliff anywhere near a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bays , and not infrequently presents cavern-like openings which penetrate a considerable distance into the cliff . By carefully noticing the con- // qwq storm , we may see how these depressions are formed . At each of these sea - caves , or other indentations , we generally find that there is some structural feature which weakens the rock , so that it is more easily worn out by the waves . Sometimes there are several lines of open joints which I part the rock and enable the surges to lift the fragments from their bedding places . Again , where the strata have been turned on edge , there sea . may be here and there soft beds which yield readily to the battering action of the stones which the waves hurl against them ; or in other cases , the rock may be riven by dykes and veins , that is , by fissures which have been filled with lava , or materials deposited by the action of water . These deposits may be , indeed most often are , softer than the stone in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched out by the sea and developed into rifts and caverns . As soon as any weak spot on the face of the cliff has been worked back a little way so that the hard bits of stone may gather in it , every wave sends these fragments with energy sufficient to wear the place yet further back into the land . The effect of the boundary walls is to keep the rolling stones in a position to do effective work , and as they are tossed Tantallon Castle and Bass Rock . View showing the result of erosion on the shores of a rocky island of considerable height . The dotted lines indicate the original greater extension of the isle . The beach in the foreground is , in fact , a rocky shelf , the remnant of the cliff which once extended much further out to recesses than along the general face of the cliff , and thus the waves do more effective work here than elsewhere . As the sea cuts only for a little ways up on the face of the steep , the excavation , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of a cavern with a wide portal . As the chamber widens this opening commonly becomes unabk to support its roof , which falls into ruins and is ground up by the waves . The greater part of the permanent caverns which are formed in this general manner are excavated in trap-dykes . These sometimes extend back from the seaface to a distance of one or two hundred feet or more . Most commonly the floor of the chamber rises pretty rapidly as we penetrate from the light of day . In fact , a considerable inclination toward the water is necessary to keep the mming // machinery by which the excavation is made in good working order ; unless the slope is considerable , the inrushing waves will heap large stones in such quantities against the inner end of the opening that the surges can not move the whole mass , and the bed-rock will be preserved from the blows of the bowlders which then expend their force on each other . The result of this steep slope of the cavern floor is , that if the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally attains the surface , and gives the conditions which produce what in New England is called a " spouting horn . " The waves , in time of heavy storm , rush up the crevice with a speed accelerated by the narrowing of the opening in its inner parts , and send a mass of foam high into the air . Another condition which produces an interesting group of spouting caves is found when the cavern has the top of the portal low , and a considerable space within which has no communication with the outer air except by the opening into which the wave sweeps . Rushing into the cavity , the billow energetically compresses the air until the motion of its water is arrested ; this air then expanding , blows the water backward toward the sea , discharging a good part of it like the smoke from a cannon . This group of spouting caverns is less noted than the spouting horns , for the reason that , though they are the more common , it is rarely possible to see them when the waves are high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coign of vantage whence we can look down upon a long stretch of shore , that these peculiar features of wave-action can be well observed . Another group of shore features sufficiently frequent to deserve notice are the coast arches and natural bridges . On our New England shore these features are uncommon , for the reason that the rocks on the coast are generally too hard and too much jointed to favor the formation and preservation of these beautiful structures ; but on the shorelands of northern Britain and at many points along the Mediterranean Sea , these singular rock forms abound . A stone soft enough to be easily assailed VOL . XL-65 by the waves , yet coherent enough to hold together where the joints or natural lines of weakness run in several directions , affords the best conditions for this kind of marine sculpture . On such methods the sea , searching out the paths of least resistance , will often produce very beautiful effects , simulating the noblest results of architecture . On the Atlantic coast the best of this class of hardy product of sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " La Roche Perc6e , " or the pierced rock , a steep-faced isle near the mouth of Gas Harbor , is perhaps the noblest arch of the eastern American coast . Many beautiful fantastic arches and natural tunnels , though never of great size , are found along the shores where coral reefs have been lifted a little way above the sea and exposed to the cutting action of the waves and the solvent work of the streams which flow from the land . A very beautiful small example of these coral reef islands is found on the western shore of the northern part of Biscayne Bay , Fla. , where a little river escapes from the Everglades through the elevated barrier reef beneath a rock arch . Yet another picturesque group of shore structures , sufficiently common to have received a name in the vernacular , are the steep detached masses of stone known as pulpit rocks . This name is commonly given to any pinnacled stones parted from the shore by a space of water no wider than could have been bridged by the voice of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the imagined preacher . On other shores these islets are often so high that the conditions would not admit of the term pulpit-rock : in such cases the isolated mass usually receives some other name with clerical associations . The memories of monks and friars are often thus preserved . At only one place on our American shore do I know of any of those natural monuments which have been associated with the religious orders ; this is the Old Friar , on the northWestern shore of the beautiful island of Campobello , a bit of British ground which forms the seaward wall of Eastport Harbor , Me . Even where the pleasanter religious ax*alogies // do not lead to the names of these striking pictures of the rocky shores , the solemn spirit of the seafaring people who have given them their designations , seems to lead them to choose the appel. lations from the other side of their faith . The Devil and his realm come in for more than a fair share of the titles by which these notable points are designated . His Majesty 's thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all commemorated . These men of the sea appear to have found in their association with it more solemnizing influences than come to their brethren of the inland country who dwell amid milder conditions . The circumstances which lead to the formation of these curious detachments of rock from the parent cliff are substantially as follows : the shore precipice being rent by numerous crevices or joints , it here and there happens that these lines of weakness lie in such positions that they intersect each other . As the excavation is pushed into the land , working as we have seen the waves do more efficiently in these recesses than on the open shore , the intervening mass of the cliff does not recede so rapidly , and so is left as an outlying mass around which the sea washes at low tide . The observer will note that in general these pulpit-rocks have a prow-like projection turned toward the shore . This form is due to the fact that the joints or other lines along which the waves work , intersect each other so as to form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the most ordinary causes of the peculiar wearing which we have to note here arises from the crossing of dykes , or fissures filled with hardened lava , which , like that thrown out by volcanoes , was once molten . These dyke-stones are often composed of very fissured stone which the waves easily disrupt and bear away : it often happens indeed that the material resembles a mass of billets of wood heaped closely together , as in the case of the Giant 's Causeway of northern Ireland . When frost acts with vigor , as it does along most of the shores where the pulpit-rock structure occurs , its effect is greatly to aid the surges in rending away these dyke-stones , while it may have very little influence on the more compact parts of the cliff . The action of freezing and of frozen water along all cliff shores in high latitudes is very great . In such regions indeed the coast line has a very different aspect from what it has in latitudes where water always remains fluid . In the act of freezing water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern shores , when the tide recedes for a considerable distance from the cliffs , the water exposed in the crevices often congeals to the distance of some inches from the face of the rock . Expanding in the opening , it produces an effect like the wedges which the quarryman uses in his art . Every cranny is sought out by the fluid ; many fissures which are not evident to the eye are thus forced open , and so the fragments of the stone which the greater storms have rent from the cliff are brought to a size where the lesser waves can toss them about . In this way the frosted shores are able to present steeper cliffs than those which are not thus affected , and when all the work has to be done by the action of the waves with such slight assistance as the slow chemical decay of the rocks may afford . While the expanding action of the frost is doubtless most efficient in wearing back the face of rock.ciffs , the effect of the ice which gathers along the shore is probably of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the temperature is low enough rapidly to freeze the water next the shore , the ice gathers in extensive fields and often becomes heaped up by the drifting of these areas until it has a thickness of ten feet or more . When the tide is low the stones become fixed in the mass , and by the current , when in this position , are driven as rasping engines against the base of the cliff . In this way the iceimprisoned stones continue the work which the winds have begun and accomplish a great deal of abrasion . The most important influence of the ice-fields , however , is to clear away from the shore the excess of detritus which the waves may have accumulated there . The reader may often observe points where this mass of stones is so great that the waves are fended from the cliff which they are assailing , // except where the tide lifts the surface of the sea to its greatest height . Thus it may be , for a few hours in the twenty-four , they may strike against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enduring frost may so bind this detritus into the ice - field that the tide , aided by a strong wind from off the shore , can drift it all away to be dropped on the bottom of the deep sea possibly mie* from the coast - line . Nearly all the rocky shore of the Atlantic coast , that is as far south as New York , beyond which point to the southward there are no hard rocks facing the sea , is kept , by this peculiar action of the ice-floes , in good shape to be assaulted by the surges . The realm of nature exhibits a conflict of marvellously related operations ; scarce any of her agents are able to act with perfect freedom ; we therefore may not be surprised to find that the work of frost and ice is much qualified by other actions . We note among these conflicting conditions the effect of the coast-line sea-weeds on the effect of frost . From a point a little below high tide to the border of deep water the rocky shore is usually covered with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally so thick that we can not discern any part of the rock . When the tide has a great rise and fall , as in the part of the shore about the eastern coast of Maine and New Brunswick , a journey along the shore at low water will give the student one of the most startling impressions which his studies can afford him . The steep cliffs are hung with a sombre arras of funeral hue made up of those pendant fronds which cover the rocks to a depth of a foot or more . Observing these plants when they are floating in the water , we perceive that they are buoyed up by numerous air - bladders which develop in their obscure leaf - like foliage . These air-bladders , as well as the air entangled in the mass of the matted stems which cover the rock , serve in a measure to keep out the frost when the shore is bared at the retreat of the tide . The coating acts as an excellent non-conductor , and by it our shores in high latitudes are in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freezing water in the rock crevices . In a somewhat similar , but , on the whole , less effective way , protection against frost action is afforded by the coating of animal life which abounds on the rocks of the sea-shore . The barnacles are the commonest of these dwellers of the surges which have by various contrivances managed to withstand the rude blow of the waves and win a profitable place amid this field of dangers ; but the numerous shells termed limpets , and a host of other delicate but exquisitely adjusted creatures , maintain a foothold there . The fact is that the fiercely contending waters of a rocky coast-line afford a singularly favorable place for animals to find food . Every stroke of the waves rends away bits of sea-weed from the rocks and grinds the fragments into bits which may be seized on by the expectant mouths . The winds drift vast quantities of organic matter from the deeper sea , which receives like treatment from the mill of the surf . The result is that the water next the shore is a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal life . On sandy shores there is no foothold for such creatures ; if they were placed there the first wave would cast them into the mill , but on the firm set rocks they can , by various most ingenious devices , manage to make avail of this chance for subsistence . One may judge how wellspread is this table of the shore by taking a glass of water from the turmoil of the surf : we see that it is crowded with the debris of animals and plants , all of which is good nutrition for these marine creatures . To win security against the waves , and thus to be able to get safety and feed at this richly furnished board , the shore animals have for ages been most assiduously contriving ways of securing themselves to the rock . Thus the barnacles , whose remote ancestors were free - swimming creatures somewhat like the shrimps , began by adhering by their head - parts to floating timber or rocks not much exposed to the waves , and gradually , by one change after another , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearly perfect reconciliation with the condi // tions which surround them . Their original form is no longer recognizable , for they are now cased in a cone formed of stony plates , and only these parts fairly anchored to the rock on which they rest . Their net-like fringe of arms can , whenever for a moment the sea is still , sweep the water about them , and when the surge is about to strike , withdrawing in their shells , which by their shape part the wave , they are perfectly protected . So , too , the limpets have converted the ordinary snail-like shell into a stout buckler , which when lifted as the wave withdraws , admits the seawater with its nutriment . As the water closes down on it the edge of the shield comes upon the surface of the rock and is held there by the short muscle which forms a large part of the animal 's body . Animals and plants pay with infinite toil and pains for their chance to secure food in places where they are fairly protected against organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best provisioned part of the sea ; it is free from creatures which can prey upon its inhabitants , and to gain a place in it it is worth while for any creature to make many sacrifices . While the effect of this organic life , both animal and vegetable , is mainly protective , by fending off the frost , and to a certain extent diminishing chemical decay , there are certain animals which themselves assail the rocks and , in a measure , hasten their destruction . A whole group of shell-fish related to our common mytilus , the sea - muscles of the vernacular , are known as lithodomes or rock-house makers . They , in some way not yet well known , but probably by the rasping action of their shells , cut out little chambers in soft rock which sometimes attain a depth of several inches . Where these creatures are numerous they honeycomb the stone and make it so frail that the waves can break it up . Certain of our echini , or sea-urchins , have in yet greater measure this ability to bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their frail-looking spines tunnel downward in materials as hard as granite ; as their bodies are larger than the lithodomi , they bore much greater holes . These chambers are often as much as two inches in diameter with a depth of a foot or more , and afford one of the most remarkable evidences of the effort which organic forms make to avail themselves of the profit which the shore conditions afford . So far as has been observed , this habit of rock-boring on the part of the sea-urchins is not known among our American species , though it is common among their kindred on the shores of Europe . Hitherto we have been considering the action of the ocean waves and currents on shores where the harder kinds of rock meet the sea . Although this is the commoner condition of the coast in its cliffbordered sections , there are many steeps formed by the frailer rocks , such as are afforded by the glacial deposits of northern countries or the incoherent strata of the newer geological formations , when the bits of such beds have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find them in most old deposits . Along the coast of the Atlantic , from the mouth of the Hudson to Greenland , particularly in the southern portion of this shoreland , are hundreds of miles of steeps where the sea beats directly against these yielding materials ; operating on these cliffs the sea-waves do not have much difficulty in breaking down the strata ; at every stroke they give way along the face of the cliff , and the frail overhanging mass quickly drops down to the shore . There are of course no sea-caverns , no penetrating chasms , or other irregularities which indicate the slow and difficult siege of the sea against the stony walls of the hard battlemented shores . Such coast-lines are usually straight and present little that is picturesque , except , as at Gay Head , Mass. , and at Alum Bay , in the Isle of Wight , the soft strata are of varied colors and perhaps tilted and folded in complicated ways ; in such cases the cliffs may have a marvellous beauty of hue to redeem their lack of variety in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapid conquest of these soft cliffs arises from the task of clearing the waste accumulation of debris which comes to them from the yielding rock . Except where the beds contain large numbers of great bowlders , as is often the case with glacial deposits , there is no // such difficulty as arises from the need of grinding up the rock into bits which the currents can carry away , for it comes to the waves in a comminuted form . The burthen of this work of destruction falls upon the currents , and the speed with which the cliff is worn away depends upon their ability to remove the fallen material from the point where the waves have delivered it to the sea . It is rare indeed that these currents can in their work keep pace with that of the waves : in large measure this debris remains just to the seaward of the shore-line , and is only slowly removed to a distance , to the neighboring beaches or to the deeper parts of the water : in this position next the shore , it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a distance from the face of the cliff and only the lighter splash waves attain its base . Gradually the undertow of the breaker drags the debris to seaward , and the varying currents produced by the tides and storms remove it from the precipitous shores to the pocket beaches , where , as we shall see hereafter , it is ground to powder . The result of these causes is one of the many beautiful adjustments of activities which the study of the shore brings to our attention . The waves excavate only what the currents can take away ; if at any time they cut out more debris than is removed , their energy is diminished by the shoaling of the water next the shelf ; if the currents clear away more of the waste , the surges are for a time free to act and deliver more sand and gravel to the sea . Thus the works of excavation and carriage become accurately balanced with each other . It is on these soft - rock shores , where strong currents operate , that we find the swiftest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-rock cliffs the erosion rarely forces the cliffs inward at a greater average rate than a fraction of an inch a year , while on gravelly or sandy shores the rate often exceeds a yard per annum . Thus , on the coast of Cape Cod , near Chatham , the shore is retreating into the land at the rate of at least a foot each year . On the southern shore of Martha 's Vineyard , the recession of cliffs which are about one hundred feet high , has been , on an average of forty years , about three feet , and on the southern face of Nantucket , near Surfside , the retreat of the escarpment has been as much as six feet in a single year . Although composed of somewhat harder materials , the Island of Heligoland , in the north of Germany , near the mouth of the Elbe , exhibits a similarly rapid proeess of destruction ; though within the historic period it was a tole*ably extensive land , it has shrunk before the surges of the sea until it has an area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete effacement within another century . So , too , the Goodwin Sands , now only a dangerous shoal at the eastern end of the English Channel , probably was in the early Christian centuries an island of soft rock which the sea wore away until its waves closed over the place where it had been . If the historic period of North America were as great as that of Europe , we should doubtless have many instances of such vanished lands . As it is , we can see that many capes and isles on the northeastern shore of this continent are impending on destruction . No Man 's Land , a lonely island of glacial drift on the Massachusetts shore , south of Martha 's Vineyard , is rapidly wasting before the attack of the stormy sea to which it is exposed ; it seems likely that in less than a century this shred of land will have disappeared . The same is the case with Sable Island , near the entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence , where the remnant of a mass of debris left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frontal moraine , is rapidly giving way before the waves and currents which are carrying its sands to the neighboring deep sea . In fact , all such islands are liable to very rapid destruction , for the reason that the waves find less difficulty in removjng the debris than they do on the continental shores . Around an island of inconsiderable size the debris is readily borne away by the strong currents , and is quickly cast into deep water , so that it does not , for any considerable time , obstruct the work of the waves . On the long continental strands , however , the waste from yielding cliffs does not so easily escape from the shore ; the greater part of it is forced to creep // along the coast-line until it passes from the district of cliffs , and finds its way into the pocket , beaches . Before leaving the zone of the coast where the sea is working the cliff backward into land , we must not fail to consider the action of the tides on such a shore . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean waters ; we must now look upon their larger manifestations , and consider how they affect the processes of the shore . As is well known to the reader , the tidal movement is due to the attraction of the sun and moon upon the mass of the earth ; in fact , every star in space pulls upon the earth ; but the moon , because of its nearness , and the sun , because of its magnitude , and as compared to the fixed stars its relative propinquity to our sphere , pull with enough energy to raise the sea above its prevailing level . The attractions of these bodies tend to divert the whole mass of the earth , and if it were completely fluid in its depths , as geologists once supposed , the sea and the land would alike rise in a low tidal-wave , and we should notice no movement of the oceans . Because of certain features in this puiiug action of sun and moon , there are two tides corresponding to each of the attracting bodies . If the earth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tides would be approximately under the sun or satellite , and the other on the opposite side of the earth . Owing , however , to the irregular form of the lands , these tidal waves have to chase around the earth , rushing up the narrow spaces between the lands , and so fall behind their due place . Moreover , because the solar and lunar tides are sometimes in the same place and sometimes far apart from each other , these two waves now and then conjoin their volume and again oppose each other . The result is that the tides , though they have a certain regularity , are , as regards their rise and fall , rather irregular phenomena . Furthermore , they are more or less affected by the action of the wind ; a heavy storm blowing off the shore will cause the tide to retreat farther , and advance less far than when the wind is blowing violently toward the shore . These varying conditions much affect the action of the tidal waves on most coast-lines . The form of every coast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they operate upon it . In the open sea the rise and fall of the tide is slight , probably not exceeding a foot or fifteen inches . If the shores of the continents were straight shore walls parallel to each other , with the sea very deep at their bases , the tidal swing would be no greater than it is in the middle of the great Southern Ocean ; but , as we know , the coast abounds in re-entrant and salient angles , deep bays , and strong promontories , and in this complication of paths which they open to the waters the tide is curiously affected . Wherever an ocean or bay opens a wide mouth to the entering tide and narrows its shores at the head of the re-entrant , the swift-running broad wave moving inward , usually at the rate of several hundred miles an hour , is compressed in the narrowing channel and forced to rise to a greater height than in the open sea . Thus in the North Atlantic , the shores of which converge toward the North Pole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise to several times the height it had in the more open water . So , too , when a bay is more broad-mouthed and tapers to a sharp head , as is the case in the Bay of Fundy or the mouth of the Severn , the tidal wave is yet further constrained and forced up , it may be , to an elevation of fifty feet or more above the lowest level of the sea . Every considerable variation in the form of the shore has its effect upon the rise of the tide . Thus in passing north from Cape Florida to the St. Lawrence , the well-trained student of the tides would be able to determine in a general way the shape of the shore by the rise and fall of the sea . It is easy to conceive how the average of the tidal currents depends , in the most intimate way , upon the altitude the wave attains in the diurnal movement . When , as on the coast of Florida , the rise and fall is probably not on the average much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by the tidal swing ; in the region about // the Bay of Fundy , where the rise is fifty feet or more , the streams have a swiftness and energy comparable to those exhibited by the greater cataracts . The capacity of the tidal cnrrents , like that of all streams , their power to scour and convey sediments , depends immediately on the speed with which they move . When , as on the eastern coast of Maine , they often flow at the rate of six or eight miles an hour , a speed nowhere attained by the waters of the Mississippi , they strip all the shores on which they impinge of all their fine detritus which may have accumulated there , and thus expose the rock to the effective action of the waves . For the reason that these tidal currents are most energetic when they are confined as in a wedge-shaped bay , they exert their maximum influence not on the open coast , but in the recesses of the shore . The waves of the ocean tend to force the detritus they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring bay , thus in time destroying all the inlets and bringing the shore to a uniformity of outline ; but where the sun and moon pull the water* about and send them whirling into the bays and harbors , the currents which are thereby produced scour out the sand , clay , and pebbles which the waves have imported into these recesses and remove them again into the open sea.
