txt The chapter of the Greater New York barter relating to the Department of 1 : ( lucatic.o , as it comes trim the Comenittee en Draft , appears to be a cornprcanise with the demands of the Brooklyn Board of Education , and yet it does not satisfy the Brooklyn members of the commission , who seem to be possessed ' Wan the idea that there is something superior in the present Brooklyn system which that borough should be allowed to eel aM . The fact of the matter is that : lie Brooklyn " system " is a bad one in Itself  --  much worse than that of New ' fork  --  while its better administration Ind the better management of the ehools are due to a competent Superin , endent who is not seriously hampered . It is certain that an administrative board of fifteen members is much more edleient for purposes of administration than one of forty-five , but the members the Brooklyn Board undertake a kind oi ? personal supervision of schools , each taking direct oversight of one or more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trustees . It is not desirable to keep up that kind of relation , and supervision and visitation , to bo ' useful , should be exercised by paid Superintendents who are expert in matters of education and school management , and not by Commissioners who are merely interested laymen . The wisdom of the committee 's compromise scherre is open to question , and seems to us to be justifiable , if at all , only as a means of transition from the various systems now in operation to a unified and centralized system to be attained ultimately . There is a duality of functions and a division of responsibility in it which does not strike one as calculated to produce the best results . The centralizing of authority and fixing of responsibility ie a single person or a single body controllable by a majority afford the surest means of attaining efficiency . There is in the proposed plan an ultimate responsibility of great weight imposed upon the Mayor of the enlarged city , for he would appoint the members of all the Borough School Boards , fifteen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boroughs of the Bronx , Queens , and Richmond , or forty-five in all , and the Presidents of these boards , together with tour delegates chosen by that of Manhattan , three chosen by that of Brooklyn , and one by that of the Bronx Borough , would constitute the Board of Education of the Greater New York . These delegates would not necessarily be chosen from the membership of the boards , but they probably would be as a matter of fact , so that the Board of Education would be a sort of central agency of the fairough School Boards , and not a centre. / authority over them . This seems to us to be a reversal of the proper direction of authority in an administrative system , which should have a central source and proceed thence to pubordinate agencies . ? The Board of Education being thus irtade the creature of the Borough School .7- Boards , is vested with control of what the committee calls the " physical side Or ttithe school system , " that is to say , it has charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' department . To be sure , it would have the appointment of a City 8uperin ; - tendent of Schools , as well as the Superintendent of School Building and the Superintendent of Supplies , but his functions would be mainly those of visitation , inquiry , and recommendation . Ile would have no real power over the conduct of any part of the educational system , and the Board of Education would have practically none . The real management of the schools would be under the control of the Borough Superintendents , acting under the appointment and authority of the Borough School Boards . It is provided that the Board of Education shall upon the recommendation of the City Superintendent determine the minimum grades of certificates or licenses to teach , and the Superintendent is to examine applicants under regulations of the Board of Education and issue the eertificatee to qualified teachers . But ever , this important function of ascertaining the qualifications of teachers and certifying to their eligibility for employment in the schools . as well as their actual employment , is subject to the borough authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the City Superintendent can not issue a license to teach in any borough " to any person rot certified by the Borough Superintendent as meeting the standard of requirements adopted by such borough . " In reality the control of educational matters and the management of schools is vested in the School Board in each borough , and these five School Boards del ermine the membership of the Board of Education of the whole city , which ? is made to exercise certain business functions subsidiary and auxiliary to the real work of affording instruction through the public schools . Whether there shall be inspection and supervision by means of District Inspectors appointed by the eia3-or is made io depend upon the action of the School Boards . In fact , what is provided for is not a centralized system of education for the whole city , but an independent system for each borough , with the five loosely associated together through the Board of Education and the City Superintendent , and provided with funds and business management through a central ' agency of their own creation   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
