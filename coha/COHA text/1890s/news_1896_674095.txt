txt English Diplomats Have Borrowed " Thalweg " from the German . From The Edinburgh Scotsman . A good deal of discussion has been excited by the recent use of the German word " thalweg , " and objection has been taken to its introduction into diplomatic phraseology . But it Is by no means a new-corner in international agreements , although its exact meaning does not generally appear to be very clearly realized . It has been translated as " river valley , " and generally an impression seems to have gained ground that it signifies the drainage area of a river . What it does , In fact , signify is the middle line of a river , and as water tends naturally to the lowest available level , a river flowing through a valley may be taken as the dividing line of the valley . An imaginary line drawn down the the centre of the river is , therefore , supposed to mark the boundary between two States , each owning one side of the valley , and this 1 magin.a.ry line is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous use in international agreements , the case may be quoted of the protocol signed at Brussels in April , 18S7 , defining the boundaries between the French Congo colony and the Congo Free State . By that instrument It was provided that the Congo Free State was not to exercise any political influence on the right bank of the Oubanghi River , nor France on the left bank , " the thalweg forming in both cases the separation . " This imaginary line exactly corresponds to what in English law is known as ' the middle thread of the stream , " the rights of an owner of property situate on the banks of a river extending , in the old Latin phrase , " ad medium filum aquae " ; but we have . unfortunately , no single word which expresses this idea , and , since the Germans have , there is no apparent reason why it should not be employed .
