txt A gleam of encouragement to the Republicans in the Senate is discovered by those who learn that there is some chance that the silver Republicans and the Populists , who were inclined to make an alliance with the Democrats , have lost patience at the continued inability of the Democrats to contrive a plan of union which commands Populistic and silver Republican confidence . Up to this time the Republicans have managed to get along in the Senate with lame committees , some of them so short of members as to be considered illegal , but while the Populists , original and converted , have been ready at any time to lend their aid to bring about a revolution in the body , the Democrats have appeared to be suffering from paralysis and have done nothing . After this condition of things has gone on a little longer and developed more emphatic dissatisfaction among the handful of men who are indifferent to either Republicans oft Democrats , it will not be surprising to hear of an arrangement by which a sufficient number of Populist votes will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any business they may decide to take up .

Kyle of South Dakota is already given up by the Democrats . and the fact that he is a frequent visitor to the White House , and that the suspicion is breathed against him that he has been permitted to suggest nominations is some ground for the Democratic fear that he feels more friendly to the Republicans than to the Democrats , As for Senator Kyle himself , he does not explain , and he does not appear to worry because the Democrats wonder .
