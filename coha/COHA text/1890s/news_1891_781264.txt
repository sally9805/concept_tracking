txt Interesting proceedings have occupied the attention of the Town Board of Orangetown , Rockland County , all this afternoon . The cause was a contest over one of the results of last Tuesday 's election , and it may yet be necessary for the Supreme Court to settle the matter . The strife is over the Collectorship of the town . Henry E. Smith of Nyack was the Republican candidate for the office of Collector , and Philip Doersohe was the Democratic candidate . On the face of the returns sent into the Town Board on Wednesday the vote for the men named was a tie . When certain circumstances in the ease became known , however , Mr. Smith resolved to inquire into the matter further and secured counsel . In addition to the vote regularly counted for him at one poll and which made a tie , he found four votes , undoubtedly intended for him , counted separately for " H. Smith , " which name they bore . In addition to this Mr. Smith ascertained that a ballot containing the name " Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law required , but had been counted for Philip Doersch , the Democratic candidate . The Town Clerk 's office was crowded . this afternoon with interested spectators . Mr. Smith 's counsel consisted of Clarence Lexow of South Nyack and ex-Assemblyman Arthur S. Tompkins . Mr. Tompkins argued before the board in the matter of the four ballots which were for " H. Smith , " he claiming that they rightfully belonged to Henry E. Smith and should be so counted . Mr. Lexow spoke at length concerning the ballot marked " Phil Doer , " which had been counted for Philip Doersoh , and made a clear , concise argument to prove that it was the duty of the board to have that vote counted separately . He cited several decisions of the higher courts to prove his argument . If that vote is taken from Mr. Doersoh'e count , Mr. Smith will be elected by a majority of one . If Mr. Smith is also given the four votes which were polled for " H. Smith " he will have a majority of five . The board will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . it is well known by the people here to-night that a mandamus , to use if necessary , has already been obtained from the Supreme Court , but it is thought this will not be required .
