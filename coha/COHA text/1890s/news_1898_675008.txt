Waring assembled at 201 East Fourth Street . and , headed by their President , Reuben S. Simons , marched to Cooper Union to the music of a fife and drum corps . The leagues are composed entirely of boys and girls . Seth Low was speaking when they arrived at the hall , and they interrupted him with their cheering . Five hundred members of the junior leagues were present . In the audience also were members of the City Club , the Authors ' Club , the Century Association , and the Chamber of Commerce , all of which organizations joined in making arrangements for the meeting . Horace E. Deming acted as secretary , and read several letters from citizens who were unable to be present . Col. Roosevelt wrote : " The City of New York owes him a great debt , and no less a debt is owed him by the friends of ' good government in all cities of the Union . ' Archbishop Corrigan wrote that the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his footsteps . The Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott sent word that " among all the splendid illustrations of the spirit of self-sacrifice Which leads man to lay down his life for his brother afforded by the recent war , none seems to be more splendid than that furnished by the death of Col. Waring . " Letters were also read from Abram S. Hewitt , the Rev. Father F. A. Elliott . Miss Josephine Shaw-Lowell , and Jacob Schiff . Mr. Schiff wrote in behalf of the Chamber of Commerce , stating that the committee appointed by that body had received assurances for 4123,14.10 toward the fund for the support of Col. Waring 's widow and daughter , and he believed that there would he no difficulty in increasing the amount to 5100 , - 000 . Seth Low , the first speaker , said that it had not been his pleasure to know Col. Waring intimately . He did know , however , of the condition of the streets and the Department of Street Cleaning , before Col. Waring had taken charge of them , and ho also knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the brat time in history gave New York clean streets . This had been a benefit to the entire community . He referred to the prejudice at first manifested against Col. Waring , and the subsequent respect entertained for him by all classes of the community regardless of politics or station in society . in the administration of his office he had known no politics , but had cleaned the streets and made the force at his command self-respecting and respected . Prof. Felix Adler said that he felt there was something of solemnity attached to the meeting . Owing to the circumstances attending Col. Waring 's death , it had been impossible for the friends to attend his funeral . The speaker said his only surpris3 was that there was not a. larger proportion of New York present , as the people should consider it an honor and a privilege to attend such a meeting . He dwelt upon the character of Col. Waring in public and private life and told how he had sought to give dignity to the men in his department . The white uniform had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also taken the discord out of - the relations between employers and employes . He was the advance guard of a new race of civic servants . Horace E. Deming read a set of resolutions . which were received with loud applause . They said in part : His interest in humanity , his desire to benefit his kind . was ever a controlling motive . A hundred times he risked his own life to save the lives of others , or to bring comfort to those unknown to him and to whom he was himself unknown . He died a hero 's death , not upon the Held of battle  --  although he had proved his courage upon many such fields  --  but , as he would have preferred to die , in the effort to rescue a great city from infection and disease . Such a death of such a man , following so soon upon the great triumph he achieved in this city for health and cleanly living , has served to emphasize as perhaps was in no other way possible the immensity of the debt due to Cul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Simons , who had brought in the children , as their Marshal , was then introduced and greeted by wild cheers from his youthful constituents . He spoke at length in praise of Col. Waring , and told many anecdotes of his generosity and kindheartedness . Ex-Mayor Strong , who spate next , was heartily welcomed . A number of the children were on the move at this juncture , evidently regarding Mr. Simons 's address as having been the main feature of the evening , and the Mayor had to wait until the aspect of the meeting became a little more settled . He then spoke of the influence of Mrs. Kinnicutt , who , said he , was the person alio induced him to appoint Col. Waring , and he also said that he had urged on the Colonel , before making the appointment , the advisability of keeping the streets clear of trucks . " I 'm going to tell a little anecdote about the trucks , " said the Mayor . " Shortly after the Colonel went into office an old lady about as wide as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and said , ' Mr. Mayor , your Commissioner of Street Cleaning has got our horse and wagon . We ca n't earn a dollar without them , and it costs k5 to get them out of his pound , and we have n't got it . ' Well , I gave ' em the Sa . Four or five days after that they came in again with the same story , and I gave them S : : again . In about a week the same pair came in again , laughter. and I thought I 'd give ' em one more chance and gave them the money . As they were going out Col. Waring was coming in and recognized them . C said to him when he came in . ' Colonel . I 've spent about $lf1 on those people . and I wish that you would just let them keep their horse in your pound and save me . ' Well , shortly after that he came into my office with the last $5 I had given them and said : Mr. Mayor . you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've arranged to let her keep her horse and wagon in my pound every night . ' " The Mayor then read the resolutions in eulogy of Col. Waring recently passed at a meeting of the men Who were heads of departments in his administration . Carl Schurz made an eloquent address in eulogy of Col. Waring , which included an appeal to the generous and patriotic public to provide for the dear ones he left . He said in part : " Col. Waring did not affect to despise wealth , and would have liked the enjoyments it brings , but he never permitted the feeling to interfere with his singleness of purpose . In his official position he had many opportunities for picking up money by occasional stretches of conscience . We may not saythat Col. Waring passed unscathed through this temptation , but we may say that for such a character as his the temptation did not exist . He retired from office successful . trusted . beloved , proud , and poor . " Jacob A. RI's. the last speaker , said that Col. Waring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobwebs out of our civic conscience as well . " and saved more lives by his broom than were lost on both sides in the recent war with Spain .
