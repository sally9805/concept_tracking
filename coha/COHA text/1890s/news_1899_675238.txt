txt Senator Joseph Benson Foraker paid his respects to the National Administration to-day for the first time since he made some bitter references to the fate of Col. Harry Clay Egbert at the unveiling of the tablet at Fort Thomas , on July 1 . Senator Foraker said , in speaking of Alger 's resignation : " I think , under the circumstances , it was a wise step for Gen. Alger to talc . While I think he has , no doubt , made some mistakes , yet . I know 1-fis intentions have been good , and that he has been , in the main , very unjustly criticised . I happen to know , as do all others who have been much about Washington , that most of the important matters on account of which Gen. Alger has been attacked , have been matters in which he acted wi , h the approval and by the direction of the President . Throughout the war and subsequently he was almost constantly in conference with the President , submitting to him all important matters , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rf them . " The attacks upon Gen. Alger evidently have been intended for the President . and I do not believe that Gen. Alger 's resignation will stop them . No matter who succeeds him , there will be mistakes in the future , as there have been in the past , and there will be attacks and criticisms and complaints . Such has been and always will be the case . But Alger will be out and free from future assaults , and I very-much doubt if hereafter they will be confined to his successor . Emboldened by the success in driving Alger out of the Cabinet , the enemies of the Administration will hereafter strike higher , and aim directly at the President himself . But , of course , all this is speculation . " In speaking of the action taken on the correspondents ' " round robin , " Mr. Foraker said ; " I have no doubt of the truth of all the correspondents say in their round robin , and conceding the truth of their statements , I think it was all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what has ? been transpiring in the Philippines . It Is idle to say such a communication will be ignored . It has not been ignored , and will not be . On the contrary , the Administration has aireadwy corrected the abuses of which the correspondents complain . "
