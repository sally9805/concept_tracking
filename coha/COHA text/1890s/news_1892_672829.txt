txt When the editor of the Evening Post goes out of town , why does he leave in his place a man who is addicted to " journalism " in its most loathsome form ? This person , whoever he may be , seems to take a fiendish pleasure in openly practicing all those revolting vices that the editor , when he edits , is accustomed violently ' to condemn .

Of course , nobody can fail to see that this consideration was important from the point of view of Great Britain . She would like to have us remain a fourth-rate naval power , and for that reason she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post 's " journalist , " probably with a hideous grin , reprints the remarks about the navy , and wickedly omitting all mention of Great Britain , declares that THE TIMES makes " a deliberate proposal to slaughter thousands of men , and lay waste a small country just emerging from a great civil commotion , in order to help the policy of naval construction , ' and popularize the navy , ' and . give an impulse to nayal development .
