txt We perform a public service of no small ' value , we think , in laying before the people of this city an elaborate defense of Tammany administration prepared for publication by Mayor Gilroy . We publish it without change or abridgthent . We assume that it is the best defense that Tammany has to offer , that it is a full and matured exposition of the benefits of Tammany rule . Coming from the Tammany Mayor it is authoritative . Coming in the midst of a campaign for the overthrow of Tammany it is timely . It enlightens the public by showing what Tammany thinks of itself . It will furnish to all the opponents of Tammany , from the most eminent financier in the Committee of Seventy to the youngest enthusiast of the Good Government Clubs , abundant stores of ammunition to keep up the fusilade from now until the day of election . If Tammany 's defense is not unshakable and convincing it will become the spoil of the enemy as material of war . We find it neither unshakable nor convincing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is Practically destructive of his conclusions , is that in order to formulate a comparison between past reform extravagance and present Tammany economy he goes back to Mayor Havemeyer 's time , in 1875 , and shows that with a population of only 1,041,886 in that year the city 's gross appropriations were $36,271,472 , against $38,664,257 this year , with a population increased to 1,951,452 ; that , after deducting the charges for State taxes , redemption of the city debt , and interest thereon , the amount spent for municipal administration purposes in 1875 was $17,504,323 , or $16.80 per capita , against $27,540,792 in 1894 , or $14.07 per capita , a showing that . in his opinion is " enorMously in favor " of Tammany rule and must confound the ignorant and malicious " per capita critics . " It wo n't , and for the best of reasons . In choosing 1875 as a point of comparison Mr. Gilroy has simply gone back to anotherTammany period . Appropriations were heavy in Havemeyer 's administration because he inherited from the Tammany Tweed ring a tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debts run up by Tammany in 1870 . The city expenditures reached 32,822,391 in 1874 , ran up to $36.271,472 in 1875  --  the amount was fixed by Mayor Havemeyer 's Board of Estimate in 1874 ? but thereafter plunged downward , with but one upward turn , until in 1882 they stood at $29,434,031 . Why does n't Mayor Gilroy cipher out his comparisons with that ear ? It was in Mayor Grace 's first term , and Mr. Gilroy claims Mr. Grace as a " Tammany Mayor , " since he was voted for by the organization . It was not until 1888 that the city budget again reached the level of 1875. - It is only too ' evident why the Mayor . goes Iiiielli twenty iiarts fa i 111 ; 311:ant of CoM. ? parison . The year 1888 is too near in time , and economical administrations in the dozen Preceding years made them quite unaVailable for his purpose . The expenditures of 1882. and Of 1894 are ill adapted to a per Capita. demonstration of Tammany econonay . Moreover , Mr. Gilroy assumes ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a like ratio of increase , which is not at all the case . But if his comparisons of per capita tax burdens and of tax rates fall to the ground when his choice of factors of comparison is examined , what must be said of his table of increase in bonded indebtedness during what he calls the reform period , 1885-88 , and the Tammany period , 1889-93 ? Mr. Grace and Mr. Hewitt were the Mayors of the first period , and Mr. Grant and Mr. Gilroy of the second . In the Grace-Hewitt period bonds were issued amounting to $30,325 , - 215 , against $43,837,693 in the Grant-Gilroy period ; while in the former period the net decrease of the city debt was $2,983,094 , and in the latter its net increase was $7,572,516 . Whereupon Mr. Gilroy observes that " if this nearly forty-four millions of bonds were issued with a net increase of only $7,000,000 , It proves that more permanent betterment was accomplished with the city 's revenues from 1889 to 1892 than was accomplished during the former period from 1885 to 1888 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt was decreased by less than $3,000,000 . " That observation can never become true until a minus quantity can be made equal to a plus quantity . An increase in debt compared with a decrease does not prove economy , and the whole table of comparisons is absolutely worthless because it does not show for either period how much of the proceeds of the bonds was wasted or stolen . In dealing with Tammany expenditures , that point is vital . But the deceptiveness of the Mayor 's comment on the table is exhibited in his remark that it would have made a far better showing for Tammany had the nine millions of bonds for the new parks been charged to the Grace-Hewitt period , in which the expenditure was authorized . If that would be fair , then of course the greater part of the twenty millions of additional water bonds should be deducted from the Grace-Hewitt total . Nevertheless , Mayor Gilroy does not scruple to credit Tammany with the increase in water supply and water rents , due entirely to the new aqueduct and reservoirs , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrations . The vice that makes this statement of bond issues worthless for the Mayor 's purpose runs through the entire interview . Mr. Gilroy declares that 17 piers , built in the " reform " period of 1884-88 , cost an average of $50,025 apiece , while 50 piers , built under Tammany auspices in 1888-94 , cost only $40,150 . What kind of piers were they in each case and where situated ? Mr. Grace may have in his library a Persian rug containing 15 square feet that - cost him a thousand dollars , and Mr. Gilroy may have one in his library containing 56 square feet that cost him fifty-six dollars  --  does that prove that Mr. Gilroy is a more astute buyer of Oriental rugs than Mr. Grace ? Nevertheless , the piers of the Tammany period may have cost less per square foot , may actually and fairly have been built cheaper than the piers of Mayors Grace and Hewitt . Again , the Mayor says that the sewer openings have now been carried out to the pierheads , where they discharge into the tidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pier , at Fortysecond Street ? The great sewer there discharges under the bulkhead into the basin , and the foul stuff smells to heaven from one year 's end to another . That is a sample . of Tammany efficiency in administration . Upon well-nigh every point touched on in. the Mayor 's voluminous interview either the falsity of his method or the irrelevance of his evidence robs it of all force as a defense of Tammany . It is impudent for him to claim for Tammany the credit of increments in wealth and revenues that are due chiefly or altogether to the growth of the city in population and trade . It is useless for him to base comparisons of valuations and tax rates on figures and assessments under the unchecked control of Tammany manipulators . And it is a waste of time for him to put forth any statement that does not deal with the scandals of Tammany rule more satisfactorily than that chapter of this interview in which he disclaims for Tammany any share of the exposed corruption and abuses of the Police Department because , forsooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin was appointed to the Police Board , that Tammany really " got its hooks into " that department ! Inasmuch as everybody in town knows that Nichols was a Tammany man , and that Stephen B. French and McClave , though Republicans , were Tammany to the backbone , this disclaimer will scarcely move the doubtful voter . The public indignation that Tammany 's rottenness has aroused will not be allayed nor diminished by the Mayor 's utterances . He avoids where he should defend , and juggles where he ought to justify .
