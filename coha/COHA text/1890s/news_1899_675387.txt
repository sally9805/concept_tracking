txt Senator M. A. Hanna , arrived here this morning , leaving the city for Cleveland to-night . The Senator said : " The country is in excellent shape and prosperity will continue . It is not possible to always arrange to meet a speculative scare , Mit there is money sufficient to accommodate the business world . The present trouble has nothing whatever to do with the actual conditions . It is simply a result of over speculation and will not be serious . It can not be any way attributed to the Republican policy . " The Senate will pass the Currency bill . and I do not think will require very much time . On our side there are not many speeches to be made , and I do not think the Democrats will undertake to delay action . " I do not think the salient features of the financial bill as it left the House will be altered , but I regard the Senate bill as the better measure . " The Philadelphia convention will be harmonious and the outlook for the next campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention meets . Who will be selected I can not say . " I do not care to discuss the Quay case . There is no truth in the report that the Administration is anxious to intervene to end the fight . I do not believe the Administration is taking any interest in the matter . There is no truth that the delay in the action of the Senate Committee was secured by Quay 's friends . The committee must have time to consider the ease and the arguments made before it . Under no circumstances could it have reported until after the holiday recess . " When asked about the Vice Presidency , the Senator said . " I see some of the newspapers say that I am malting the whole ticket . and that the convention should just delegate that action to me and not meet . However , I guess the Republican Party can get along all right . "
