txt The vote upon the second reading of the Heine Rule bill was a distinct and , in its extent , probably an unexpected triumph for the Liberals . Of the total membership of the House of Commons-970-051 members voted , a fact which of itself tells of the strenuous endeavors made by each side to got out all its available forces . Nothing short of desperate illness would excuse a member of the House , in the judgment of his party , for absenting himself from such a division . The Liberal majority of the members returned , including the Nationalists , and excluding the Liberal Unionists , is 39 . The vote upon the second reading was 347 for and 304 againstonaking 4 more than the normal majority of the GladstonMOS . This vote shows that neither the debate nor the " Ulster scare " has produced any perceptible effect upon the minds of the members , and that the majority of Mr. GLADSTONE , smaller upon the Home Rule bill as it was expected to be than upon any other test question , is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working majority . The action of the House of Peers upon the bill will be awaited with interest . The members of that body , as they are well aware , are fighting with halters round their necks , and the question for them to consider is whether public opinion , as represented by the vote of the Commons , will sustain Mr. GLAns-roxE in " swamping " them with new peers to secure the enactment of home rule , or justify him in the more heroic course of proposing to abolish them . It is , after all , possible that the aged Liberal leader , for whom the triumph of his party is a wonderful personal triumph , may live to see the success of the cause to which ho has devoted the last decade of his life .
