txt The stories of the speed of the Shamrock are probably causing a good deal of needless alarm among the faint-hearted . As the time for the great contests for the America 's Cup draws near , the anxiety of those who are in'erested in the struggle for it , and they are a legion , naturally increases . This anxiety is not likely to be diminished by the confident talk and bearing of the hearty knight who has brought his yacht to our shores with the fond hope of taking the cup away . It will be remembered that the owners of the Thistle , which was so badly beaten by the Volunteer , were just as confident . But , as Mr. KIPLING is wont to remark , that is another story . There be those who say that the confidence of the Shamrock party , compared to that of the Thistle people , was as the gentle murmur of the Summer breeze to the wild tumult of the Winter storm . But pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall . Lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , let us hasten to say that the Shamrock is , indeed , a for ' midable craft ; and it looks as if she might come nearer to " lifting " the cup than any of her unfortunate predecessors . Nevertheless the reports of her wonderful speed under short sail are probably exaggerated . These reports are largely the result of excited statements on the part of tugboat Captains . These gentlemen are in the habit of claiming for their boats the ability to make 12 knots an hour . It is really very hard to find a tugboat Captain who will say that his boat can not do 12 knots air hour . Indeed , it is almost as-hard as it is to find a tugboat which can go that speed . There are perhaps six tugs in this harbor which can make 12 knots an hour . There are not less than sixty tugboat Captains who can talk much faster than that . When , therefore , the Shamrock 's speed is measured by the conversation of some tug Captain who is running alongside of her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , because she is safe to beat the tug , if there is a good sailing breeze . In the days of the Puritan , now fourteen years behind us , the tugboat Captains gave the defender of the cup a speed of 11 knots by the simple process of saying , " We are doing 10 knots , - and she is heating us . " But when the cup defender had sailed from the Southwest Spit Buoy to the Sandy Hook Lightship , the watch showed that she had made the ten miles in something over an hour and ten minutes . The reporters have at last begun to understand the low cunning of the tugboat expert , and the other day they timed the Shamrock over a measured distance . It was from the Scotland Lightship to the Sandy Hook Lightship , and the Shamrock made the distance in ten seconds over nineteen minutes . The distance is 43 ) /8 miles , and the Shamrock 's speed was calculated to be about 13 knots an hour . This , to be sure , is fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lated on the possession of a yacht which can go so smartly through the water . If he had not such a yacht , it were better for him that a millstone were tied about his neck and he were cast into the sea to sail for the cup in one of his own Ceylon " tea wagons . " Why ? Because the Valkyrie III . was also one of those fliers which , when they are alone , or accompanied only by the unerring tugboat , make anything from 12 to 14 knots an hour . She was a veritable terror of the sea until she met a yacht called Defender in the waters off Sandy Hook , and then for some mysterious reason she became a Plain , ordinary , every-day ten-knot sloop , and the Defender was just a shade better . Now , it is generally believed by the experts that the Defender is some three or four minutes faster this year than she was in 1895 , and yet she is wholly outclassed by the new creation of the Herreshoff shops , the Columbia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that we have always been just one boat ahead of our cousins across the sea . No doubt the Shamrock would administer a sound beating to the Defender , and that is what the Columbia can do . But when the wind sits in the shoulder of her sail the Columbia , too , can leave all the " twelve-knot " tugs far , far astern , and for that reason there should be no fear , but abundant confidence in the hearts of all good Americans . The Shamrock may be a wonder , but if she is , then there are two .
