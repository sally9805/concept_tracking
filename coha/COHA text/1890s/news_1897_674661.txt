txt After the moment of crash and splash , during which woodwork was torn , splintered , and ground into bits , and iron and steel were rent , twisted and broken , the waters closed silently and swiftly over the engine , the express car , and the combination car , while the first three sleeping cars , half submerged , were slowly sinking . Back on the track were the ? three remaining sleeping cars , one with its fore trucks caught by the spread and twisted track . It was held just on the brink of the chasm , and held the other two back . There was a. moment of awful silence and then from the cars on the track came shrieks of terror . Passengers , men and women , all undressed , and some of them bleeding from slight wounds , wrenched open the vestibule doors and rushed out upon the track . A porter on one of the cars on the track was the first to recover his presence of mind . As soon as he reached the track he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crash had awakened Mr. Carr , and , as he stood there dazed , the porter screamed to him : " Our train is in the river and the passengers are drowning . For Christ 's sake get a boat , oh , get a boat ! " Mr. Carr , without waiting to dress himself , ran to his boat at the little point south of the wreck , and rowed back with all his strength . Found the Cars Floating* . As he turned into the little bay he met the express car and combination car , torn from their heavy trucks , floating sluggishly down , but sinking deeper every minute . Smith , the express messenger , was rescued from his car , and an effort was made to save some of the passengers of the combination car , but it was impossible . A. Pug Boat Aids . While Mr. Carr was working with the aid of the porter , the tugboat Chase , which had been passing when the accident occurred , came across at racing speed , and her crew started to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , muffled blows were heard from the inside of the sleeping cars , and at last , with the aid of an axe , a hole was broken in the roof of the car and the passengers taken out . They Were wet and bruised , but were wrapped in blankets . So soon as they recovered sufficiently they told their experiences . Frank J. Degan , a wood finisher of 269 West Thirty-fourth Street , New York , was in the day coach . His left eye was cut by broken glass , and his body was slightly bruised . Mr. Degan spoke as follows : " With my friend , W. H. G. Myers , who was killed in the car from which I escaped . I had been to Poughkeepsie . We boarded the train at that place and took a seat in the coach . Three other persons got on at Poughkeepsie . One was a woman and the two others were men , one of whom looked like a railroad employe . As near as I can judge , there were eighteen persons in the coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all were asleep . Myers and I sat in the middle of the car . " When the crash came the car gave a great lurch , and rolled over on its side . The water rushed in and almost instantly the lights went out . I knew we were in the river , and the car seemed to plough through the water for some time after it was submerged . " The car was tilted over on one side and I managed to reach the fanlight overhead and cling to it until help came . " Browned Like Rats . " I heard people in the back part of the car groaning as if they were pinned fast . It was so dark that I could see no one , and I think the passengers must have been drowned like rats . After a while  --  it seemed an age  --  I heard people on top of the car and an axe crashed through the roof . The noise of the axe in the splintered timbers made the sweetest music I ever heard in my life . " Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out through it . A man and a boy ( father and son ) were also rescued in the same way , but I know of no other occupants or the coach escaping . The car at this time was floating , but fast filling with water , and we were put ashore in a rowboat . I am surd that my friend Myers was drowned . "
