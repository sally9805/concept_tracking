txt The contest of the will of ex-Judge Henry Hilton instituted by his son , Henry G. Hilton , who was cut off with the interest of $25,000 , which he was to share with his wife , has been abandoned . This was learned on indisputable authority last night . Mr. Hilton 's attorneys , A. H. Hummel and John R. Dos Passos , have effected a settlement on his behalf with the other heirs , by the terms of which he withdraws his objection to the probate of his father 's will . The necessary steps to carry out the agreement will be promptly taken , and the witnesses to the document  --  Henry H. Rice , Robert G. Smyth , and Herbert Anstey  --  will present their affidavits , and nothing will then stand in the way of the proving of the will . Thus litigation over the distribution of the Hilton millions is no longer in prospect . The terms of the settlement , which end this contest , are at present withheld , and it is no means unlikely that they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G , Hilton 's wish , the lawyers in the case refuse to discuss this matter . It is a subject for conjecture merely whether Mr. Hilton has to content himself with a few thousands more than the sum left him by the terms of the will , or whether he gets anything like that share in his father 's estate of $0,000,000 which he has emphatically claimed was his due . Ex-Judge Horace Russell , son-in-law of the late Judge Hilton , and one of the executors of the will  --  Edward D. Harris being the other  --  is also counsel for the members of the Hilton family outside of Henry G. Hilton . Judge Russell adinitted last night that an agreement had been effected and the contest called off , evidencing some surprise that the facts had been made known . He absolutely refused to say a word about the terms of the settlement , and declared that he never would disclose them . John R. Dos Passos also , as intimated , declined to state the terms , or even whether or not his client was to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an agreement which ended the contest . " I never discuss professional affairs , " said he . Mr. Hilton himself is at present ill- at his home on Sedgwick Avenue . near East One Hundred and Seventy-seventh Street , and not in condition to receive visitors . The estate of Judge Hilton was valued at $6,000,000 , of which $5,000,000 was in real estate and $1,000,040 in personal property , according to a statement accompanying the will , when it was filed for probate on Sept. 1 . The document was notable particularly for three things : It was devoid of any charitable bequest , it left the entire estate in trust , and it cut off Henry G. Hilton , whose previous career had not been pleasing to his father , it was said , with the sum of $25.000 , to be held in trust for Kim and his wife . Furthermore , it was provided that the executors might distribute the use of this sum between Henry G. Hilton and his wife , Agnes , in just such proportions as they saw fit . The will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  eernelia H. Hughes . Josephine H. Russell , . Edward B. Hilton . and Albert B. Hilton , and $10,000 to each of his grandchildren . To the testator 's brother . J. H. Hilton of Iowa , $5,000 was left , while one of his sisters , Mary A , - Brown . got $5,000 , and Eliza Hilton , the other , got 510,000 . The residue of the estate was divided into tweive parts , of which four went to his daughter , Josephine H. Russell . four to his son , Albert B. Hilton , two to his daughter , Cornelia H. Hughes . and two to his son , Edward E. Hilton The document was in the testator 's own handwriting , and it contained the provision that any one of the heirs who should contest the will was to lose his or her share . which was then to go to the children of the testator 's daughter , Josephine H .. and of his son Albert . Henry G. Hilton . who is about forty-two years old , met his wife , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishing goods store . in 1881 . Their court-hip was brief , and Judge Hilton gave them a good-sized check with which to start their married life . Later he was forced to retire from the firm of Hilton . Hughes &; Co. , receiving 5125,000 for his share . He was once for a short time special partner in a Wall Street firm . When the terms of the will were announced . and it was found that Henry G. Hilton was cut off with a small/l.equest , he lost no time in declaring his intention to make a fight . It was thought at first that the prevision of the will cutting off entirely the heir who should contest it . and which was alleged to be aimed directly at him , would deter him from instituting litigation . But that did not welch with hint . " I would rather he c.ut off without a dollar , " said he , as reported , " than take $25.000 . I do not want to make a contest unless I 'm forced to .
