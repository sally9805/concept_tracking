txt Mr. Alfred Roosevelt , who is in the banking business at 33 Wall Street , this city , was very seriously injured while attempting to hoard a moving train at Mamaroneck Station on the New-York , New-Haven and Hartford Railroad at 8:14 o'clock yesterday morning . Mr. Roosevelt has been a resident of Mamaroneck about a month , having taken a lease for the Summer of the old Mitchell homestead , which belongs to the estate of Charles Osborne . Mr. Roosevelt loft his house , as he supposed , in ample time to catch the 8 : 14 train for New York . The distance to the statio ? is about two miles . The coachman drove leisurely until he got within sight of the station . Perceiving that the New-York train was about to start , he whipped up his horses and drove under the iron road bridge , which is a few hundred feet above the station , and halted at the lower end of the station . Mr. Roosevelt jumped from his carriage and ran for the train , which was . under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears and endeavored to pull himself upon the step . Being near-sighted , he miscalculated the distance and his feet missed the step . Still clinging to the car he was carried along to the iron bridge and dashed with much force against the iron railing . The force of the blow compelled him to release his hold and he was thrown partly under the oars . The trainmen who had observed Mr. Roosevelt 's attempt to get aboard promptly pulled the bell cord and stopped the tram . Half a dozen men hastened to the assistance of the prostrate man and found him terribly bruised and out but still conscious . Two wheels of the oar had passed over his right leg just above the ankle . There was a severe cut in his head from striking against the ? iron railing of the bridge , and his right shoulder and hip were badly bruised . He was carried into the baggage room of the station , and Drs . Joseph Hoffman and J. F. Hunter wore summoned . He was placed on a platform wagon and conveyed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone message had been sent , meeting him on the road .

Roosevelt , the injured man 's father . It was the opinion of the doctors that Mr. Roosevelt was suffering severely from shook . The mangled condition of his leg rendered an operation necessary , and late in the afternoon his foot was amputated a few inches above the ankle by Dr. Hunter . After Dr. MoBurney and his assistants arrived at the house a consultation of all the doctors was held , and it was decided that another operation would be necessary , an amputation nearer the knee being regarded as necessary for the safety of the patient , Mr. Roosevelt , however , was so weak that it was resolved to defer the operation for the present At last accounts Mr. Roosevelt was resting well , but his ease was regarded by his physicians as .. very serious .

If the steamer Alaska arrives on the- other , side of the Atlantic at the time expected , Mr. James Reilly of Greenville , N. J. , will reach London on Sunday , and will at once devote his attention to settling the affairs of the late James . Mr. Reilly has been for more than twenty-five years the close friend , of Mr. . For that length of time he has been one of Mr. MoHenry 's . financial agents , and since Mr. went to London to live Mr. Reilly has been his representative in business affairs in this country . Tinder the terms of Mr. Mellen= ry 's will he will receive one-fourth of his estate .. When Mr. Reilly reaches London and begins his work , the friends of Mr. and Mr. Reilly expect that some fresh information will be had as to . the recent stories of the death of Mr. , which will disprove the sensational portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known oltizen of Greenville . His noose is at New-York Bay Shore . He is a bachelor , and two nieces live with him . One of these nieces , Miss Speoht. who is well informed as to her uncle 's business affairs , said last night that many mistakes had been made in the published reports relating to Mr. MoHonry 's death . " Mr. Reilly will be in London Sunday . " she said , " and expects to devote a month to the settlement of the estate . He had heard of the terms of Mr. 's will before he went away , last I Saturday . " Mrs. John B. Cox who is to receive I one-fourth of the estate , lives In Philadelphia . Miss Ann Boyd who gets one-fourth is a distant relative , and the Mr. and Mr. Boyd who get an eighth each are two of his exeontors . " Mr. Reilly has had charge of Mr. MoHenry 's business interests in this country for many years . He has been in London and visited Mr. , who had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that city . I do not think any one can say how much Mr. MoHenry 's estate is worth . It involves many interests , and when Mr. Reilly went away I do not think he knew what amount of property would come to him or to any of the legatees . " I wish Tug Tiaras would correct the report as to Mr. 's being poisoned . Mr. was not poisoned . Those stories are nonsense . Physicians of repute , whose names are sufficient to give reliability to their statements , attended him . He was suffering from a complication of diseases which would have killed any man . Mr. Reilly knows that his physicians were reliable men , and does not believe a wordUof the stories of poisoning . As to the insurance which hole said to have had upon his life I do not think there is any truth in that rumor . Mr. Reilly expects to stay in London until he has settled up the estate . He does not know how long that may be . " Miss Spooht said that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family . His wife and eleven children were buried in London , she said .
