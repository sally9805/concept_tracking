AUTUMN IN FRANCONIA . I. FIVE or six hdurs of pleasant railway travel , up the course of one river valley after another , - the Merrimac , the Pemigewasset , the Baker , the Connecticut , and finally the Ammonoosuc , - not to forget the best hour of all , on the shores of Lake Winnipisaukee , the spacious blue water now lying full in the sun , now half concealed by a fringe of woods , with mountains and hills , Chocorua , Pangus , and the rest , shifting their places beyond it , appearing and disappearing as the train follows the winding track , - five or six hours of this delightful panoramic journey , and we leave the cars at Littleton . Then a few miles in a carriage up a long , steep hill through a glorious autumn - scented forest , the horses pausing for breath as one waterbar after another is surmounted , and we are at the height of land , where two or three highland farmers have cleared some rocky acres , built houses and painted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happy clearing all the mountains stand facing us on the horizon , and below , between us and Lafayette , lies the valley of Franconia , toward which , again through stretches of forest , we rapidly descend . At the bottom of the way Gale River comes dancing to meet us , babbling among its boulders , - more boulders than water at this end of the summer heats , - in its cheerful uphill progress . Its uphill progress , I say , and repeat it ; and if any reader disputes the word , then he has never been there and seen the water for himself , or else he is an unfortunate who has lost his child 's heart ( without which there is no kingdom of heaven for a man ) , and no longer lives by faith in his own senses . On the spot I have called the attention of many to it , and they have every one agreed with me . Mountain rivers have attributes of their own ; or , possibly , the mountains themselves lay some spell upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as it may , Lafayette all the while draws nearer and nearer , we going one way and Gale River the other , until , after leaving the village houses behind us , we alight almost at its base . Solemn and magnificent , it is yet most companionable , standing thus in front of one 's door , the first thing to be looked at in the morning , and the last at night . The last thing to be thought of at night is the weather , - the weather and what goes with it and depends upon it , the question of the next day 's programme . In a hill country meteorological prognostications are proverbially difficult ; but we have learned to " hit it right " once in a while ; and , right or wrong , we never omit our evening forecast . " It looks like a fair day to-morrow , " says one . " Well , " answers the other , with no thought of discourtesy in the use of the subjunctive particle , " if it is , what say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , and taking in Mount Agassiz on our return after dinner ? " Or the prophet speaks more doubtfully , and the other says , " Oh well , if it is cloudy and threatening , we will go the Landaff Valley round , and see what birds are in the larch swamp . If it seems to have set in for a steady rain , we can try the Butter Hill road . " And so it goes . In Franconia it must be a very bad half day indeed when we fail to stretch our legs with a five or six mile jaunt . I speak of those of us who foot it . The more ease-loving , or less uneasy members of the party , who keep their carriage , are naturally less independent of outside conditions . When it rains they amuse themselves indoors ; // Autumn in a pitch of sensibleness which the rest of us may sometimes regard with a shade of envy , perhaps , though we have nevei* admitted as much to each other , much less to any one else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit before a fire ; and we leave the question of reasonableness and animal comfort on one side . Time is short , and we decline to waste it on theoretical considerations . Our company , as I say , is divided : carriage people and pedestrians , we may call them ; or , if you like , drivers and footmen . The walkers are now no more than the others . Formerly- till this pre . sent autumn - they were three . Now , alas , one of them walks no longer on earth . The bills that knew him so well know him no more . The asters and goldenrods bloom , but he comes not to gather them . The maples redden , but he comes not to see them . Yet in a better and truer sense he is with us still ; for we remember him , and continually talk of him . If we pass a sphagnum bog , we think how at this point he used to turn aside and put a few mosses into his box . Some professor in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to collect additional specimens . In those days of his sphagnum absorption we called him sometimes the " sphagnostic . " If we come down a certain steep pitch in the road from Garnet Hill , we remind each other that here he always stopped to look for Aster Lindicyanus , telling us meanwhile how problematical the identity of the plant really was . Professor So-and-So had pronounced it Lindleyanus , but Doctor Somebody-Else believed it to be only an odd form of a commoner species . In the Wallace Hill woods , I remember how we spent an afternoon there , he and I , only two years ago , searching for an orchid which just then had come newly under discussion among hotanists , and how pleased he was when for once my eyes were luckier than his . If we are on the Landaff Franconia. road , my companion asks , " Do you remember the Sunday noon when we went home and told E- that this wood was full of his rare willow ? And how he posted over here by himself , directly after dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tone of whimsical entreaty , Please do n't find it anywhere else ; we must n't let it become too commons ? " Oh yes , I remember ; and my companion knows he has no need to remind me of it ; but he loves to talk of the absent , - and he knows I love to hear him . That willow I can never see anywhere without thinking of the man who first told me about it . Whether I pass the single small specimen between Franconia and the Profile House , so close upon the highway that the road-menders are continually cutting it back , or the one on the Bethlehem road , or the great cluster of stems on Wallace Hill , it will always be his willow . Amid indeed this whole beautiful hill country is his . How happy he was in it ! I used sometimes to talk to him about the glories of our Southern mountains , - Tennessee , North Carolina , Virginia ; but he was never to be enticed away even in thought . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he would answer , with a smile ; and he never did , though in his youth he had traveled more widely than I am ever likely to do . The very roadsides here must miss him , and wonder why he no longer passes , with his botanical box slung over his shoulder and an opera-glass in his hand , - equally ready for a plant or a bird . He was always looking for something , and always finding it . With his happiness , his goodness , his gentle dignity , his philosophic temper , his knowledge of his own mind , his love of all things beautiful , he has made Franconia a dear place for all of us who knew him here . To me , as to all of us , it is dear also for its own sake . This season I returned to it alone , - with no walking // mate , I mean to say . He was to join me later , but for eight or ten days I was to follow the road by myself . At night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay out my own morrow . The first day was one of the good ones , fair and still . As I came out upon the piazza before breakfast and looked up at Lafayette , a solitary vireo was phrasing sweetly from the bushes on one side of the house , and two or three vesper sparrows were remembering the summer from the open fields on the other side . It was the 22d of September , and by this time the birds knew how to appreciate a day of brightness and warmth . Seeing them in such a mood , I determined to spend the forenoon in their society . I would take the road to Sinclair 's Mills , - a woodsy jaunt , yet not too much in the forest , always birdy from one end to the other . " This is living ! " I found myself repeating aloud , as I went up the longish hill to the plateau above Gale River , on the Bethlehem road . " This is living ! No more books , no more manuscripts , - my own or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . How good the air was ! How glorious the mountains , unclouded , but hazy ! How fragrant the ripening herbage in the shelter of the woods ! - an odor caught for an instant , and then gone again ; something that came of itself , not to be detected , much less traced to its source , by any effort or waiting . The forests were still green , - I had to look closely to find here and there the first touch of red or yellow ; but the flowering season was mostly over , a few ragged asters and goldenrods being the chief brighteners of the wayside . About the sunnier patches of them , about the asters especially , insects were hovering , still drinking honey before it should be too late : yellow butterflies , bumble-bees ( of some northern kind , apparently , marked with orange , and not so large as our common Massachusetts fellow ) , with swarms of smaller creatures of many sorts . If I stopped to attend to it , each aster bunch was a world by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no haste ; I had chosen my route partly with a view to just such idling ; and the birds were , and were likely to be , nothing but old favorites . And they proved to be not many , after all . The best of them were the winter wrens , which I thought I had never seen more numerous ; every one fretting , tut , tut , in their characteristic manner , without a note of song . On my way back , the sun being higher , there were many butterflies in the road , fiat on the sand , with wings outspread . If ever there is comfort in the world , the butterfly feels it at such times . Here and there half a dozen or more of yellow ones would be huddled about a damp spot . There were mourning-cloaks , also , and many small angle-wings , some species of Grapta , I knew not which , of a peculiarly bright red . Once or twice , wishing a name for them , I essayed to catch a specimen under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which I was only half ashamed to find myself grown inexpert . The forenoon was not without its tragedy , nevertheless . As I came out into the open , on my return from the river woods toward the Bethlehem road , a carriage stopped across the field ; a man jumped out , gun in hand , ran up to an unoccupied house standing there by itself , with a tract of low meadow behind it , peeped cautiously round the corner , lifted his gun , leveled it upon something with the quickness of a practiced marksman , and fired . Then down the grassy slope he went on the run out of sight , and in a minute reappeared , holding a crow by its claw . He took the trophy into the carriage with him , - two ladies and a second man occupying the other seats , - and as I emerged from the pine wood , fifteen minutes afterward , I found it lying in the middle of the road . Its shining feathers would // fly no more ; but its death had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creation . What happier fate could a crow ask for ? One of my first desires , this time ( there is always something in particular on my mind when I go to Franconia ) , was to revisit Lonesome Lake , a romantic sheet of water lying deep in the wilderness on the back side of Mount Cannon , at an elevation of perhaps twentyeight hundred feet , or something less than a thousand feet above the level of Profile Notch . One of its two owners , fortunately , is of our Franconia company ; and when I spoke of my intention of visiting it again , he bade me drive up with his man , who would be going that way within a day or two . Late as the season was getting , he still went up to the lake once or twice a week , it appeared , keeping watch over the cabin , boat - house , and so forth . The plan suited my convenience perfectly . We drove to the foot of the bridle path , off the Notch road ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I followed on foot . The climb is longer or shorter , as the climber may elect . A pedestrian would do it in thirty minutes , or a little less , I suppose ; a nature-loving stroller may profitably be two hours about it . There must be at least a hundred trees along the path , which a sensitive man might be glad to stop and commune with : ancient birches , beeches , and spruces , any one of which , if it could talk , or rather if we had ears to hear it , would tell us things not to be read in any book . Hundreds of years many of the spruces must have stood there . Some of them , in all likelihood , were of a good height long before any white man set foot on this continent . Many of them were already old before they ever saw a paleface . What dwarfs and weaklings these restless creatures are , that once in a while come puffing up the hillside , halting every few minutes to get their breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , that they have no home , no abiding-place , where they can stay and get their growth ? It is a precious and solemn stillness that falls upon a nian in these lofty woods . Across the narrow pass , as he looks through the branches , are the long , rugged upper slopes of Lafayette , torn with slides and gashed into deep ravines . Far over his head soar the trees , tall , branchless trunks pushing upward and upward , seeking the sun . In their leafy tops the wind murmurs , and here and there a bird is stirring . Now a chickadee lisps , or a nuthatch calls to his fellow . Out of the tangled , round-leaved hobble-bushes underneath an occasional robin may start with a quick note of surprise , or a flock of white-throats or snowbirds will fly up one by one to gaze at the intruder . In one place I hear the faint smooth - voiced signals of a group of Swainson thrushes and the chuck of a hermit . A few siskins ( rarer than usual this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their curious , long-drawn whistle , as if they were blowing through a fine-toothed comb . Further up , I stand still at the tapping of a woodpecker just before me . Yes , there he is , on a dead spruce . A sapsucker , I call him at the first glance . But I raise my glass . No , it is not a sapsucker , but a bird of one of the three-toed species ; a male , for I see his yellow crownepatch . His back is black . And now , of a sudden , a second one joins him . I am in great luck . This is a bird I have never seen before except once , and that many years ago on Mount Washington , in Tuckerman 's Ravine . The pair are gone too soon , and , patiently as I linger about the spot , I see no more of them . A pity they could not have broken silence . It is little we know of a bird or of a man till we hear him speak . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not water birds , for the most part , - though I steal forward // quietly at the last , hoping to surprise a duck or two , or a few sandpipers , as sometimes I have done , - but birds of the woods . The water makes a break in the wilderness , - a natural rendezvous , as we may say ; it lets in the sun , also , and attracts insects ; and birds of many kinds seem to enjoy its neighborhood . I do not wonder . To-day I notice first a large flock of white-throats , and a smaller flock of cedar-birds . The latter , when I first discover them , are in the conical tops of the tall spruces , whence they rise into the air , one after another , with a peculiar motion , as if a hand had tossed them aloft . They are catching insects , a business at which no bird can be more graceful , I think , though some may have been at it longer and more exclusively . Their behavior is suggestive of play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are snowbirds , and in the firs by the lakeside chickadees are stirring , among which , to my great satisfaction , I presently hear a few Hudsonian voices . Sick-a-day-day , they call , and soon a little brown-headed fellow is directly at my elbow . I stretch out my hand , and chirp encouragingly . He comes within three or four feet of it , and looks and looks at me , but is not to be coaxed nearer . Sick-a-day-day-day , he calls again ( " I do n't like strangers , " he means to tell me ) , and away he flits . He is almost always here , and right glad I am to see him on my annual visit . I have never been favored with a sight of him further south . The lake is like a mirror , and I sit in the boat with the sun on my back ( as comfortable as a butterfly ) , listening and looking . What else can I do ? I have pulled out far enough to bring the top of Lafayette into view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The birds are mostly invisible . Chickadees can be heard talking among themselves , a flicker calls wicker , wicker , whatever that means , and once a kingfisher springs his 61 rattle . Red squirrels seem to be ubiquitous , full of sauciness and chatter . How very often their clocks need winding ! A few big dragon-flies are still shooting over the water . But the best thing of all is the place itself : the solitude , the brooding sky ( the lake 's own , it seems to be ) , the solemn mountain top , the encircling forest , the musical woodsy stillness . The rowan trees were never so bright with berries . Here and there one still holds full of green leaves , with the ripe red clusters shining everywhere among them . After luncheon I must sit for a while in the forest itself . Every breath in the treetops , unfelt at my level , brings down a sprinkling of yellow birch leaves , each with a faint rustle , like a whispered good-by , as it strikes against the twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I know the text , - " We all do fade . " May the rest of us be as happy as the leaves , and fade only when the time is ripe . A nuthatch , busy with his day 's work , passes near me . Small as he is , I hear his wing-beats . A squirrel jumps upon the very log on which I am seated , but is off in a jiffy on catching sight of so unexpected a neighbor . So short a log is not big enough for two of us , he thinks . By and by I hear a bird stirring on a branch overhead , and look up to find him a red-eyed vireo . One of the belated , he must be , according to my almanac . He peers down at me with inquisitive , sidelong glances . A man ! - in such a place ! - and sitting still ! I like to believe that he , as well as I , feels a pleasurable surprise at the unlooked-for encounter . We call him the preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falling leaves have taken the words out of his mouth . It is one of the best things about a place like this that it gives a man a most unusual feeling of remoteness and isolation . To be here is not the same as to be in some equally wild and silent spot nearer to human habitations . The // sense of the climb we have made , of the wilderness we have traversed , still folds us about . The fever and the fret , so constant with us as to be mostly unrealized or taken for the normal state of man , are for the moment gone , and peace settles upon the heart . For myself , at least , there is an unspeakable sweetness in such an hour . I could stay here forever , I think , till I became a tree . That feeling I have often had , - a state of ravishment , a kind of absorption into the life of things about me . It will not last , and I know it will not ; but it is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a foretaste , perhaps , of the true Nirvana . Yet to - day - so self - contradictory a creature is man - there were some things I missed . The dreamer was still a hobbyist , and the hobbyist had been in the Lonesome Lake woods before ; and he wondered what had become of the crossbills . The common red ones were always here , I should have said , and on more than one visit I had found the rarer and lovelier white-winged species . Now , in all the forest chorus , not a crossbill 's note was audible . One day , bright like this , I was sitting at luncheon on the sunny stoop of the cabin , facing the water , when I caught a sudden glimpse of a white-wing , as I felt sure , about some small decaying gray logs on the edge of the lake just before me , the remains of a disused landing . The next moment the bird dropped out of sight between two of them . I sat motionless , glass in hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) upon the spot where he had disappeared . I fancied he was at his bath . Minute after minute elapsed . There was no sign of him , and at last I left my seat and made my way stealthily down to the shore . Nothing rose . I tramped over the logs , with no result . It was like magic , - the work of some evil spirit . I began almost to believe that my eyes had been made the fools of the other senses . If I had seen a Franconia. bird there , where in the name of reason could it have gone ? It could not have dropped into the water , seeking winter quarters in the mud at the bottom , according to the notions of our old-time ornithologists Half an hour afterward , having finished my luncheon , I went into the woods along the path ; and there , presently , I discovered a mixed flock of crossbills , - red ones and white-wings , - feeding so quietly that till now I had not suspected their presence . My waterside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been fixed upon the place of his disappearance quite so uninterruptedly as I had imagined . It was not the first time that such a thing had happened to me . How frequently have we all seen a bird dart into a bit of cover , and never come out ! If we are watchful and clever , we are not the only ones . Luck has no little to do with a birdlover 's success or failure in any particular walk . If we go and go , patience will have its wages ; but if we can go but once or twice , we must take what Fortune sends , be it little or much . So it had been with me and the three-toed woodpeckers , that morning . I had chanced to arrive at that precise point in the path just at the moment when they chanced to alight upon that dead spruce , - one tree among a million . What had been there ten minutes before , and what came ten minutes after , I shall never know . So it was again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , for love of the woods and for the hope of what I might find in them . I was perhaps halfway down when I heard thrush calls near by : the whistle of an oliveback and the chuck of a hermit , both strongly characteristic , slight as they seem . I halted , of course , and on the instant some large bird flew past me and perched in full sight , only a few rods away . There he sat facing me , a barred owl , his black eyes staring straight into // mine . How big and solemn they looked ! Never tell me that the barred owl can not see by daylight . The thrushes had followed him . It was he , and not a human intruder , to whom they had been addressing themselves . Soon the owl flew a little furtlier away ( it was wonderful how large he looked in the air ) , the thrushes still after him ; and in a few minutes more he took wing again . This time several robins joined the hermit and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably the pursuers were largely reinforced as the chase proceeded , and I imagined the big fellow pretty thoroughly mobbed before he got safely away . Every small bird has his opinion of an owl . What interested me as much as anything connected with the whole affair was the fact that the olive-back , even in his excitement , made use of nothing but his mellow staccato whistle , such as he employs against the most inoffensive of chance human disturbers . Like the chickadee , and perhaps some other birds , he is musical , and not over-emphatic , even in his anger . Again and again I rested to admire the glory of Mount Lafayette , which loomed more grandly than ever , I was ready to declare , seen thus partially and from this point of vantage . Twice , at least , I had been on its summit in such a fall day , - once on the lst of October , and again , the year afterward , on a date two days earlier . That October day was one of the fairest I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rare thing , try as we may to speak nothing but good of the doings of Providence ) and in the pleasure it brought me . For the next year 's ascent , which I remember more in detail , we chose - a brother Franconian and myself - a morning when the tops of the mountains , as seen from the valley lands , were white with frost or snow . We wished to find out for ourselves which it was , and just how the mountain looked under such wintry conditions . The spectacle would have repaid us for a harder climb . A cold northwest wind ( it was still blowing ) had swept over the summit and coated everything it struck , foliage and rocks alike , with a thick frost ( half an inch or more in dep*h , if my memory is to be trusted ) , white as snow , but almost as hard as ice . The effect was strangely beautiful . A dwarf fir tree , for instance , would be snow white on one side and bright green on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to the South Peak , so called ( the very ridge at the face of which I was now gazing from the Lonesome Lake path ) , one slope was white , the other green . Summer and winter were divided by an inch . We nestled in the shelter of the rocks , on the south side of the summit , courting the sun and avoiding the wind , and lay there for two hours , exulting in the prospect , and between times nibbling our luncheon , which latter we " topped off " with a famous dessert of berries , gathered on the spot : three sorts of blueberries , and , for a sour , the mountain cranberry . The blueberries were Vaccinium uliginosam , V. aespitosum , and V. Pennsylvanicum ( there is no doing without the Latin names ) , their comparative abundance being in the order given . The first two were really plentiful . All of them , of course , grew on dwarf bushes , matting the ground between the boulders . At that exposed height not even a blueberry bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cnespitosum , was both a surprise and a luxury , the small berries having a most deliciously rich fruity flavor , like the choicest of bananas ! Probably no botanical writer has ever . mentioned the point , and I have great satisfaction in supplying the deficiency , apprehending no rush of epicures to the place in consequence . About the fact itself there can be no manner of doubt . My companion fully agreed with me , // and he is not only a botanist of international repute , but a most capable gastronomer . Much the poorest berry of the three was the Pennsylvanian , the common low blueberry of Massachusetts . " Strawberry huckleberry " it used to be called in my day by Old Colony children , with a double disregard of scientific proprieties . Even thus late in the season the Greenland sandwort was in perfectly fresh bloom ; but the high cold wind made it a poor " bird day , " though I remember a white-throated sparrow singing cheerily near Eagle Lake , and a large hawk or eagle floating high over the summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " My heart leaps up when I behold An eagle in the sky . " On that point , as concerning the fine qualities of the cespitose blueberry , we were fully agreed . Even in Franconia , however , most of our days are spent , not in mountain paths , but in the valley and lower hill roads . We keep out of the mountains , partly because we love to look at them , and partly , perhaps , because the paths to their summits have seemed to fall out of repair , and even to become steeper , with the lapse of years . One of my good trips , this autumn , was over the road toward Littleton , and then back in the direction of Bethlehem as far as the end of the Indian Brook road . That , as I planned it , would be no more than six or seven miles , at the most , and there I was to be met by the driving members of the club , who would bring me home for the midday meal , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to spare , so that one can dally along , fearful only of arriving at the end of the way too soon . Such was now my favored condition , and I made the most of it . If I crossed a brook , I stayed awhile to listen to it and moralize its song . If a flock of bluebirds and sparrows were twittering about a farmer 's barn , I lingered a little to watch their Autumn in Franconta. doings . When a white - crowned sparrow or a partridge showed itself in the road in advance of me , that was reason enough for another halt . It is a pretty picture : a partridge caught unexpectedly in the open , its ruff erect , and its tail , fully spread , snapping nervously with every quick , furtive step . And the fine old trees in the Littleton hill woods were of themselves sufficient , on a warm day like this , to detain any one who was neither a worldling nor a man sent for the doctor . They detained me , at all events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once for a good season with them . And so the hours passed . At the top of the road , in the clearing by the farms , I met a pale , straight-backed young fellow under a military hat . " You look like a man from Cuba or from Chickamauga , " I ventured to say . " Chickamauga , " he answered laconically , and marched on . Whether it was typhoid fever or simple " malaria " that had whitened his face there was no chance to inquire . He was munching an apple , which at that moment was also my own occupation . I had just stopped under a promising-looking tree , whose generous branches spilled their crop over the roadside wall , - excellent " common fruit , " as Franconians say , mellow , but with a lively , ungrafted tang . Here in this sunny stretch of road were more of my small Grapta butterflies , and presently I came upon a splendid tortoise-shell ( Vanessa Milberti ) . That I would certainly have captured had I been armed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , to the surprise of my friends the carriage people , ardent entomological collectors both of them . They had found not a single specimen the whole season through . " There are some advantages in beating out the miles on foot , " I said to myself . I have never seen this strikingly handsome butterfly in Massachusetts , as I once did its rival in beauty , the banded purple ( Arthemis ) ; and even here in the hill country it is never so // common as to lose that precious bloom which rarity puts upon whatever it touches* As I turned down the Bethlehem road , the valley and hill prospects on the left became increasingly beautiful . Here I passed hermit thrushes ( it was good to see them already so numerous again , after the destruction that had wasted them a few winters ago ) , a catbird or two , and a few ruby-crowned kinglets , - some of them singing , - and before long found myself within the limits of a rich man 's red farm ; fences , houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted of the same deep color , as if to say , " All this is mine . " I remembered the estate well , and have never grudged the owner of it his lordly possessions . I enjoy them , also , in my own way . He keeps his roads in apple - pie order , without meddling with their natural beauty ( I wish our Massachusetts " highway surveyors " all worked under his orders , or were endowed with his taste ) , and is at pains to save his woods from the hands of the spoiler* " Please do not peel bark from the birch trees , " - so the signs read ; and I say Amen . He has splendid flower gardens , too , and plants them well out upon the wayside for all men to enjoy . Long may it be before his soul is required of him . By this time I was in the very prettiest of the red - farm woods . Hermit thrushes were there , also , standing upright in the middle of the road , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real champion for the loudness of his tone . How full of glory the place was , with the sunlight sifting through the bright leaves and flickering upon the shining birch trunks ! If I were an artist , I think I would paint wood interiors . My forenoon 's walk was ended . Another turn in the road , and I saw the carriage before me , the driver minding the horses , and the passengers ' seat vacant . The entomologists had gone into the woods looking for specimens , and there I joined them . They were in search of beetles , they said , and had no objection to my assistance ; I had better look for decaying toadstools . This was easy work , I thought ; but , as is always the way with my efforts at insect collecting , I could find nothing to the purpose . The best I could do was to bring mushrooms full of maggots ( larvre , the carrier of the cyanide and alcohol bottles called them ) , and what was desired was the beetles which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the bottle-holder said , No , it was not a spider , but a mite ; and there was no disputing an expert , who had published a list of Franconia spiders , - one hundred and forty - nine species ! ( She had wished very much for one more name , she told me , but her friend and assistant had remarked that the odd number would look more honest ! ) However , it is a poor sort of man who can not enjoy the sight of another 's learning , and the exposure of his own ignorance . It was worth something to see a first-rate , thoroughly equipped " insectarian " at work and to hear her talk . I should have been proud even to hold one of her smaller phials , but they were all adjusted beyond the need , or even the comfortable possibility , of such assistance . There was nothing for it but to play the looker-on and listener . In that part I hope I was less of a failure . The enthusiastic pursuit of special knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well worth study as the song and nesting habits of a thrush or a sparrow ; and I gladly put myself to school , not only this forenoon , but as often as I found the opportunity . One day my mentor told me that she hoped she had discovered a new flea ! She kept , as I knew , a couple of pet deermice , and it seemed that some almost microscopic fleas had left them for a bunch of cotton wherein the mice were accustomed to roll themselves up in the daytime . These minute creatures the entomologist had pounced upon , clapped // into a bottle , and sent off straightway to the American flea specialist , who lived somewhere in Alabama . In a few days she should hear from him , and perhaps , if the species were undescribed , there would be a flea named in her honor.1 Distinctions of that nature are almost every-day matters with her . How many species already bear her name she has never told me . I suspect they are so numerous and so frequent that she herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of walking about the earth and being able to say , as an insect chirps , " Listen ! that is one of my species , - named after me , you know . " Such specifto honors , I say , are common in her case , - common almost to satiety . But to have a genus named for her , - that was glory of a different rank , glory that can never fall to the same person but once ; for generic names are unique . Once given , they are patented , as it were . They can never be used again - for genera , that is - in any branch of natural science . To our Franconia entomologist this honor came , by what seemed a poetic justice , in the Lepidoptera , the order in which she began her researches . Hers is a genus of moths . I trust they are not of the kind that " corrupt . " Thinking how above measure I should be exalted in such circumstances , I am surprised that she wears her laurels so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she is as happy over her genus , perhaps , as over the new tion de luxe of her most famous story ; The species was not new . A Maine collector had anticipated her , I believe . Whether for an entomologist may be also a novelist , if she has a mind to be , as Charles Lamb would have said ; but she knows how to carry it off lightly . She and the botanist of the party , my " walking mate , " who , I am proud to say , is similarly distinguished , often laugh together about their generic namesakes ( his is of the large and noble Composita* family ) ; and then , sometimes , the lady will turn to me . " It is too bad you can never have a genus , " she will say in her bantering tone ; " the name is already taken up , you know . " " Yes , indeed , I know it , " I answer her .

When I was in Florida I took pains to see the tree , - the family evergreen , we may call it . Though it is said to have an ill smell , it is handsome , and we count it an honor . " But then , perhaps you would never have had a genus named for you , anyhow , " the entomologist continues , still bent upon mischief . And there we leave the matter . Let the shoemaker stick to his last . Some of us were not born to shine at badinage , or as collectors of beetles . For myself , in this bright September weather I have no ambitions . It is enough , I think , to be a follower of the road , breathing the breath of life and seeing the beauty of the world .
