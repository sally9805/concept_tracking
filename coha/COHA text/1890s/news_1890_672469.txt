txt It seems that the three forces upon which Speaker REED chiefly relies for his opportunity of representing the First District of Maine is vote buying in the country towns , activity in the Kittery Navy Yard at election time , and the alliance of the Republican Party with the liquor sellers of Portland . The latter alone is sufficient to turn the scale , and that accounts for the fact that commendation of a candidate for Sheriff in the Cumberland . County Convention as a man who would enforce the prohibitory law and close up the saloons was instantly fatal to his nomination . There are said to be 150 liquor sellers in Portland who control from five to ten times as many votes , and they are kept on the Republican side in politics by a distinct understanding that the law shall not be enforced against them . To make sure of the Bargain the Mayor and City Marshal of Portland and the Sheriff of Cumberland County are always made acceptable to the liquor interest . Otherwise they might not be Republicans at all , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surely Democratic . This alliance with the liquor sellers would not be so bad if it were not for the disgusting hypocrisy of the Republicans of Maine in sticking to the prohibition policy and pretending to be in favor of its enforcement . The fact is that they use it to control a considerable vote that would otherwise be Democratic by a species of blackmail through the liquor saloons.
