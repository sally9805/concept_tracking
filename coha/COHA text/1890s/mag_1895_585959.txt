txt MY acquaintance with Mr. Huxley began in 1876 . We were fellow passengers on the White Star Steamship Germanic from Liverpool to New York . It was not , I think , our first meeting , but I date from that voyage our real acquaintance and the friendship which followed . The friendship , cemented by some common interests and by a long-continued and close relationship between his family and mine , lasted without a break to the day of his death ; and lasts still . It was in some respects so intimate that to write anything at all about him seems ahuost a breach of the confidence he gave me . On the other hand , to write nothing is to be untrue to him and to his memory - to the memory of one of the truest men who ever lived , one of the manliest , and in all points one of the noblest . I believe I should say the same thing if I had never known him , or known him but slightly , for I have known also many of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them did I ever heai* a word questioning his loyalty or truthfulness of nature . What may have been said in controversy does not count . Most men will say strong things when hard pushed , and Mr. Huxley was all his life long in the thick of some conflict or other , and endured the usual hardships of conflicts very stoically . These , or most of these , may nevertheless be passed over . The records of them are all in print . No doubt he will pass into history as a born fighter . The combative instinct was in him , but it was very far from being merely pugnacity . He fought for that which he thought to be true and right . On no other terms could you engage him in any conflict whatever . It is impossible to conceive of Huxley as a mercenary , as taking pay for anything in which his heart was not , as upholding an opinion in which he did not believe . His sincerity was often tested . He came into active life at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence , which it has since won ; and won in a very considerable degree by Huxley 's help . You remember the fate which befell Colenso . That arithmetical bishop was persecuted because he could not accept as historical all that he found in the Pentateuch . Who accepts it all now ? If you did not then believe in the Mosaic cosmogony , or in that theory of creation and of the ordering of the world to which Huxley , with great controversial adroitness , once gave the name Miltonic , you were anathema . When Darwin published the " Origin of Species " he was denounced from every orthodox pulpit in England as an infidel . That was in 1859 , not two generations ago . Huxley , who had already made a name in science , took his stand at once by Darwin . He did not affirm - he was never much given to affirming anything except that two and two made four - that Darwin 's hypothesis had been made out . It was enough for him that the theory of evolution or of natural selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its side . It explained the hitherto unexplained origin of species more satisfactorily than any preceding theory . It gave , to say the least , a rational and not a merely mythological account of things , and for Huxley the use of the reason was the first condition of an approach to the truth . Until a more rational theory , better supported by facts , should be advanced he stood by this , and was content to work and that others should work on the lines Darwin had laid down . Darwin and Darwinism held the field . They hold it still . Twenty-one years later Huxley delivered , at the Royal Institution in London , a lecture on the coming of age of the Darwinian theory . He had very little to alter or modify . It is because Huxley has been to such an extent identified with Darwinism that his achievements in original research have brought him less renown // Thomas Henry Huxley . From a photograph by Elliott &amp; Fry , London . qwq tice from the Royal Society . It was his researches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned . Not that Huxley himself coveted them . He valued them when they came , but to covet was not in his nature . Yet I imagine that when Huxley 's place in the Victorian era comes to be finally assigned him , a hundred years hence or more , what he did in a field apart from pure science will be held one of his chief titles to permanent fame as a benefactor of the human race . What he did was to break down the ecclesiastical barrier between human reason and the exercise of it on some of those great questions which most nearly concern the human race . I do not mean that he alone did it , but that he was , on the whole , the foremost figure in that momentous struggle . The struggle is not yet over , but there is no longer much doubt on which side victory is to rest . And I would ask anybody who knows much of the intellectual history of this period , to ask himself what it would be with Huxley left out . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Religion . It was the religionists who gave it that name . The conflict was never with religion , but with dogma , with the Church , perhaps , in so far as it made itself a champion of dogma ; with orthodoxy in any one of its innumerable forms , and with the spirit of tradition and of authority . Huxley made no attack on religion , and religion none on him . But the Scribes and Pharisees encompassed him about . The self-constituted defenders of the old order of things assailed him . He claimed the right to think for himself on subjects as to which Rome and , following Rome , the Church of England as her spiritual or apostolic successor , had delivered to the world a final decree . That was offence enough . Call him an infidel at once , as Darwin had been called . The result was to engage Huxley in a series of discussions on the mixed and always debatable ground which the Church claims as its private domains and upon which free thought had steadily encroached . I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for scientific experts tell you that he was at his best in pure science , or in the exposition of pure science . But I will say he was better than anybody else . Whom will you put beside him ? Who met and vanquished so many very eminent antagonists ? Mr. Gladstone , Ward , Dr. Wall , the Duke of Argyll , Mr. Frederic Harrison-these are but a few of the most distinguished men who attacked Huxley and were worsted . Ecclesiastical thunders rolled harmlessly about his head . Theology and biblical criticism , cried his opponents , are not Mr. Huxley 's ground ; why does he intrude on our pastures ? The answer is to be found in the published volumes which contain the essays and discourses on these subjects . It is to be found not less clearly in the existing state of public opinion , due as it is so largely to these very encounters . The emancipation of thought-that is Huxley 's legacy to his century-that was his continual lesson of intellectual honesty . In truth he was a very expert metaphysician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy . When he set forth in his trenchant way some of the absurdities of Auguste Comte , Mr. Frederic Harrison , one of the high priests of Positivism in England , replied that Mr. Huxley had evidently never read Comte . Huxley took the trouble to explain that he had early mastered the six volumes of the " Philosophic Positive , " and had reread them for the purposes of that discussion , and much besides . I speaL of Mr. Frederic Harrison as one of the high priests of Positivism . The sect in England consists almost exclusively of high priests , like the regiment which Artemus Ward proposed to recruit , entirely of brigadier-generals . But the Positivists are only a corporal 's guard , not a regiment . Huxley was a student and more than a student of Descartes . He has written the best short book in existence on Hume . He was a pupil of Aristotle , and therefore not a Platonist . Hobbes taught him much ; Berkeley was to him a great thinker ; Locke , Butler , and the short list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while among // the great Germans there was , I think , none whom he did not know wellKant , Hegel , Fichte , and all that illustrious line , not excepting Schopenhaner , long before he became the fashion among a little group of Englishmen and Englishwomen , who like playing with high subjects and dipping into books of which the depths are beyond their mental stature . There was-perhaps there still is-in England a Metaphysical Club , of which Huxley and many other eminent persons were members . They met once a month to discourse of these high matters . Mr. Gladstone was one . There is no known subject on which the great Parliamentarian is not ready to enlarge with copious confidence . He did on metaphysics at the club and elsewhere . Mr. Huxley was once asked whether Mr. Gladstone was an expert metaphysician . " An expert in metaphysics ? He does not know the meaning of the word , " was the rather startling answer . Between Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Huxley no love , in truth , was ever lost . Their relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men do in England , amicably and civilly , no matter how much they differ in public , there was and could be no cordiality . Mr. Gladstone is a hardened disputant with a tough skin , but even he must have winced under Mr. Huxley 's exposure of his controversial methods . On the point of orthodoxy , moreover , Mr. Gladstone is inflexible , or almost inflexible . If you are not a Churchman you are in outer darkness . He does not follow scientific movements very carefully , but he knew very well what tremendous inroads Mr. Huxley was making upon ecelesiasticism , and he could not forgive him . One of Mr. Gladstone 's most faithful henchmen once remarked that he thought it an act of presumption in a man who did not know Hebrew to discuss the Old Testament . What he really meant was that it was an act of presumption to crumple up Mr. Gladstone in a public debate . Though no man , as I said , has done more to modernize the niethods of thought of his own time , Huxley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 54 teachings of elder days . With Lord Kenyon , but in better Latin , he would take his stand supra antiquas vias . He liked to refer the germ of those great discoveries and processes of which the nineteenth century is apt to consider itself the author to earlier times and men . He did full justice to Harvey . He acknowledged Aristotle as his master ; in Aristotle , he considered , was to be found the idea which lies at the root of modern thought . In naturalists like Buffon , who is commonly spoken of as out of date , he found high merit . He would not join with the Germans in disparaging Bacon . The sentiment of justice was strong in him ; these and others should have their due . So was the tie that knit him to men whom he considered his intellectual ancestors . He liked to think of himself as the heir of all the ages . He had come into a noble inheritance ; it was his business , his discharge of the obligation these early benefactors had laid upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up English claims to a share in all the improvements in science , in arts , and in literature which have illuminated and adorned the modern world , he assigned as one main cause of this improvement " our not despising the patrimony of knowledge which was left us by our forefathers . " Burke and Huxley were two very different men , but they may shake hands across the intervening century . Mr. Huxley 's relations with his friends were of a kind which may be called affectionate . It was a pleasure to see him among them and among his own family . During many years while he lived in London , I saw him often in these agreeable circumstances . His house was in Marlborough Place , St. John 's Wood , a neighborhood which , though esteemed a little remote and well out of touch with the merely fashionable world , had attractions of its own . There is a St. John 's Wood " set " of artists , Mr. Alma Tadema then and now at the head of them . There is , or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure was George Eliot . Then comes a very miscellaneous company of people who liked the district because it has air and space // and is not too dear . Mr. Huxley 's house stood in its own grounds , of moderate size ; the house itself roomy enough , well but plainly furnished . Here there used to be , every Sunday evening , a dinner , followed by a reception . You would be wrong if you supposed that these terms implied state or ceremony . There was none , though the number of people who. sat down at dinner was often as many as sixteen or eighteen , sometimes more . Mr. and Mrs. Tyndall were among the most frequent . Tyndall and Huxley were as brothers . The public looked on them as rivals , and so perhaps in a sense they were , but the rivalry , if it existed consciously to either , never affected their relations to each other . They were comrades ; coworkers in a great common cause , and they loved each other . Mr. Herbert Spencer came less often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much dining out , even with intimate friends . When he came , there was almost always a discussion of high matters relating to science or philosophy , which commonly , or at least often , on Mr. Spencer 's part , degenerated into argument . To that also his health was unequal , and a sleepless night was the penalty he paid . But there was in Mr. Spencer 's loyalty to his convictions , and in his belief that in all circumstances the right opinion , which of course was his own , must be defended and the wrong combated , something pathetic . The gallantry of his struggle against physical weakness touched you . It touched Mr. Huxley , who never forgot that he was host . At his own table , he avoided arguments when he could . Others , or all others , did not . Mr. Huxley sat there with a serenity and patience which were admirable , joining in discussions in a way to mitigate their severity ; he himself , too , of a nature averse to all compromise , but keeping under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when too eager disputants seemed in danger of taking some other . Sir Henry Maine was often a guest ; a man too little remembered , though his books have guided modern thought on some great questions . He was Mr. Huxley 's ally , and he too knew how to put aside dif ficulties and cut short a controversy , and introduce a fresh and less dangerous topic . If I were to name all those who used to assemble in this easy way in the reception-rooms of the house in Marlborough Place , it would be a long catalogue . But I ought not to omit men like Lord Arthur Russell , who , not himself a man of science , was a man of accomplishments who liked all cultivated society , and when he could overcome his shyness , contributed much to the conversation . Lady Arthur came with him . Mr. Norman Lockyer was another ; he had both science and social gifts  --  a combination perhaps not too common , but seen in its most perfect form in Huxley himself . Lord and Lady Reay were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of a high intelligence . The artists came ; art and science found they had a common ground in Mr. and Mrs. Huxley 's drawing-roomindeed , the whole house became a drawing-room and people wandered about as they liked , and paired off and formed groups at will . Mr. and Mrs. Tadema were among the most constant ; between the two houses there was an intimate relation , and the guests of one were welcomed at the other . We all know Mr. Tadema as an artist ; some of his best pictures are in America , and many Americans who have visited London know him a little personally . He is as interesting as are his pictures , and equally far removed from the commonplace . Sir Frederic Leighton came , a distinguished figure ; Sir Edward BurneJones oftener still ; the two alike remarkable for the wide range of their reading and accomplishments and admirable conversation-each in a different way . Lord Wolseley , then Sir Garnet , was there sometimes ; always alert , energetic , copious , and sparkling . The shrewd benignity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen , and there were other churchmen who did not hold aloof from the great agnostic , but knew and valued him , whatever they might think of his views on ecelesiasticism . Nor did difference on politics banish politicians . Mr. Huxley was a Unionist , but Sir William Harcourt did not feel bound // to stay away on that account . Mr. Henry Stanley came , a man who fills every room he enters with his knowledge , energy , and force of character , yet so quiet in manner that you might overlook him if you did not notice the head , cast in a mould which would turn out cannon-balls , and with eyes that burnt their way through everything . It is pleasant to remember that on the same evenings came the young lady whom he was afterward to marry , Miss Tennant , with her mother , and with a sister , the brilliant girl of whom Sir John Millais painted a brilliant portrait , now Mrs. Frederick Myers . There were , of course , numerous notabilities of science , Mr. Spottiswoode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Rayleigh , and Lord Kelvin . There was Mr. Justice Stephen , one of the most eminent of English judges , and I will name last of all Lady Stanley of Alderley , a venerable and admirable woman who died this year at eighty-seven years of age , a masterful personality to the end . There were guests-no , not guests , but members of the family-who were never absent from these or any other domestic occasions . They were his three cats . Like all men of gentle mind , Mr. Huxley liked this gentle race ; liked their coaxing ways , their intelligence , their unlikeness to that human kind with which they have nevertheless a sympathy so strong , when the human sympathy and intelligence . are equal to theirs . Not to everyone is it given to understand these beautiful creatures or their true nature , or to live with them on terms of mutual respect and affection ; the only terms on which they will accept you at alL Him they accepted as he accepted them , and their intimacy was charming to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sometimes more than one , for they were superior to feelings of mere jealousy . He was never too busy to give them the recognition they sought , and their friendship was one of the things he valued . On the terrace behind the house they walked up and down with him , as he strolled there in his favorite old soft black felt hat which no entreaties could induce him to discard , or sat upon the wall or on chairs and gravely watched him as he moved , and then came tumbling about his legs , awaiting the caress which they knew he was waiting to give . I loved him the more because he loved them , and they him . I may seem to have described these dinners as if they were devoted to dialectics , but that was not so at all . It was only now and then , and almost always after the ladies had left , that these debates were held . Then sometimes there was what Carlyle would call a tobacco Parliament , like old Friedrich 's . Neither Tyndall nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would never admit that tobacco in moderation could hurt anybody . He rallied me when I gave it up , as if to abandon this consolation of life were to confess a defeat ; and I suppose it was . But he was not a man to generalize about individuals . He was a physiologist , and a very great one , with , in that as in everything else , the infusion of common-sense which saved him from over-confidence . Each must judge for himself what suits him was his maxim . In his own case he carried it very far . His life was almost ascetic . Tobacco was perhaps his one indulgence . A great part of the work by which the world knows him was done after dinner , and after a hard day 's work in the lecture-room and laboratory . He never spared himself . Often and often have I known him leave the circle of family and friends , of which he was the life , very early in the evening and betake himself to his library ; a room of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or appealed to for another half-hour , he would only shake his head . There was something to be done . And it would be midnight or one or two o'clock before it was done , and then he was up at seven in the morning . I sometimes thought he had no higher happiness than work ; perhaps nobody has . He would dine on a little soup and a bit of fish ; more than that was a clog on his mind . " The great secret , " he said , " is to preserv* the power of working continuously sixteen hours a day if need be . If you can not do that you may be caught out any time . " // An infinite capacity of taking painsthat , I think , he valued himself on . His literary work shows it in a degree not less than his scientific . He must be placed very high among contemporary writers . Contrast his style with that of the ordinary writer on science , who has no style , or with a very extraordinary man 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote admirably , with perhaps an exuberance of rhetoric , inevitable to an Irishman . But Huxley dealt in the simplest , most lucid , most effective manner with the most difficult subjects . You were never at a loss for his meaning ; if you were , it was your fault , not his . He had a sobriety of ornament which was more to his taste and more to his readers ' than the Corinthian style . He had vigor , and that imaginative use of language without which the full value of words is never brought out . He hated writing and forced himself to write , and also taught himself . Somewhere he tells how on his return , I think from the Rattlesnake voyage , he had all his material ready , which had cost him ten times more labor than the writing it out would require . But he could not bring himself to*write . He early conquered that repugnance , though I doubt whether he ever wrote fluently or easily . I once asked him . " Oh , I can write fast enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but if it is anything important I take as much time as I need . " A letter of his had just appeared in The Times , an important one on a controverted topic . I asked how much trouble he had taken with it . " Why , I wrote that over three times . " The quality he valued most in style was , perhaps , precision . That and perfect clearness and perfect sincerity . About style as a separate quality of his writing he thought little . Subject and style were interfused . He had a certain declaration to make , a certain argument to conduct , a certain account to give of some matter which he thought important . Into the doing of this he put his whole souL It was not enough to be accurate , he felt it his duty to say what had*to be said in the way best calculated to appeal to the minds of his readers . He would not deliver his message , whatever it might be , in a halting or slipshod way . The impulse of sincerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long practice and unwearied effort , made him the admirable writer he was . On the platform Mr. Huxley was a commanding figure . He had in him the gift of oratory , had he cared to cultivate it . Of course he was at home in the lecture-room ; he had spent half his life in it . Some of his appearances there will be forever memorable . There have been few evenings in the well-like auditorium of the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street comparable to that when Huxley delivered his discourse on the Coming of Age of Darwinism . Many a brilliant audience has that hall seen-it is the meeting-ground of Science and Society-perhaps never one which surpassed this . It was known that he had chosen this subject ; it was inferred that he would review the controversy in which he had been a foremost champion , and there was an expectation , not to be disappointed , that he would fight some of his many battles o'er again . So Society , ever on the alert for a fresh sensation , thronged to the scene . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Huxley made his entry on great occasions . He hated anything like display , and would have none of it . At the Royal Institution , more than almost anywhere else , the lecturer , on whom the concentric circles of spectators in their steep am* phitheatre look down , focuses the gaze . Huxley never seemed aware that anybody was looking at him . From sglfconsciousness he was , here as elsewhere , singularly free , as from self-assertion . He walked in through the door on the left , as if he were entering his own laboratory . In these days he bore scarcely a mark of age . He was in the full vigor of mature manhood and looked the man he was . Faultlessly dressed  --  the rule in the Royal Institution is evening costume-with a firm step and easy-bearing , he took his place apparently without a thought of the people who were cheering him . To him it was an anniversary . He looked , and he probably was , the master . Surrounded as he was by the celebrities of // science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had quite the same kind of intellectual ascendancy which belonged to him . The square forehead , the square jaw , the tense lines of the mouth , the deep flashing dark eyes , the impression of something more than strength he gave you , an impression of sincerity , of solid force , of immovability , yet of the gentleness arising from the serene consciousness of his strength - all this belonged to Huxley and to him alone . The first glance magnetized his audience . The eyes were those of one accustomed to command , of on* having authority , and not fearing on occasion to use it . The hair swept carelessly away from the broad forehead and grew rather long behind , yet the length did not suggest , as it often does , effemi - nacy . He was masculine in everything - look , gesture , speech . Sparing of gesture , sparing of emphasis , careless of mere rhetorical or oratorical art , he had nevertheless the secret of the highest art of all , whether in oratory or whatever else-he had simplicity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he needed no other . The voice was rather deep , low , but quite audible , at times sonorous , and always full . He used the chest - notes . His manner here , in the presence of this select and rather limited audience-for the theatre of the Royal Institution holds , I think , less than a thousand people-was exactly the same as before a great company whom he addressed at Bristol , as President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science . I remember going late to that , and having to sit far back , yet hearing every word easily ; and there too the feeling was the same , that he had mastered his audience , taken possession of them , and held them to the end in an unrelaxing grip , as a great actor at his best does . There was nothing of the actor about him , except that he knew how to stand still , but masterful he ever was . Unlike so many men whose lives are given mostly to science , Mr. Huxley eared for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for literature in its broadest sense . He gave his eldest son a double university education , first at St. Andrew 's and then at Baliol College , Oxford , of which Dr. Jowett was at that time , and until his death , Master . The eldest son graduated with the highest honors in classics . The great biologist was himself a scholar , a linguist , and widely read . Latin , German , and French he read fluently , and had some Greek , much history and general learning . I do not know why I mention it in such a connection-unless it be for the reason which the incomparable Colonel Neweome was always giving , which is a good reason  --  but he had humor in the highest degree and in the highest sense . It comes out in his writings . It came out still more freely in his daily life , and was one of his most delightful qualities . You could not be long with him without seeing the gleam of it in his eyes . It irradiated his face and his life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toleration to his judgments , otherwise always kindly and t*lerant ; and his strong dark face grew beautiful in the soft brilliancy of this humorous expression . It came out in every circumstance . There was once a question of no real consequence between some of his family and one of his and their friends . He was told of it . " It is not worth considering , " was his characteristic answer , " but if it has to be considered you know my motto must be , my country , right or wrong . " The misunderstanding melted away at once beneath that sunshine . Mr. Huxley stood on the deck of the Germanic as she steamed np the harbor of New York , and he enjoyed to the full that marvellous panorama . At all times he was on intimate terms with Nature and also with the joint work of Nature and Man ; Man 's place in Nature being to him interesting from more points of view than one . As we drew near the city - this was in 1876 , you will rememberhe asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the two most conspicuous objects . I told him the Tribune and the Western Union Telegraph buildings . " Ah , " he said , " that is interesting ; that is American . In the Old World the first things // you see as you approach a great city are steeples ; here you see , first , centres of intelligence . " Next to those the tugboats seemed to attract him as they tore fiercely up and down and across the bay . He looked long at them and finally said , " If I were not a man I think I should like to be a tug . " They seemed to him the condensation and complete expression of the energy and force in which he delighted . I quoted some years ago what " the most accomplished of the Queen 's daughters " said of him : " I like to talk with Mr. Huxley because he talks to me exactly as he would to any other woman . " I see no reason whyl may not now say that this lady was the Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare , and in London would be thought much more remarkable than here , for it is in London more than anywhere else that conversation takes on a different tone in the presence of royalty , often a tone of constraint . Mr. Huxley , it may be said , was exactly the same in all companies . Jiis position brought him a good deal into contact with royalties and with other people of high degree . But he said : " I am a plebeian , and I stand by my order . " That remark , which is very characteristic of him , was made in connection with a different subject , but it denotes his attitude in society and everywhere else . You hear the trumpet-note in it and a certain proud humility which was a part of his nature . He was not humble in the presence of men or women ; but in the presence of nature , of science , of whatever is noble and honorable in the abstract . He was anybody 's equal , and his perfect simplicity of manner showed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was never a trace , nor of self-assertion . He had no occasion to assert himself . I saw him unveil the statue of Darwin , in the South Kensington Museum , the Prince of Wales and the Archbishop of Canterbury assisting at the ceremony . It was the homage of royalty to Darwin , which had never thought of him in life , nor attended his funeral in Westminster Abbey , and of the Church in the person of its episcopal head , which , during Darwin 's life , had heaped anathemas upon him . Mr. Hux ley was intensely conscious of the mean- ing of all this , but he never betrayed it . He felt himself , as it were , the host , and the courtesy of the host to his guests was his . You might meet him wandering about the lawns of Marlborough House at a garden-party , where he was a guest . Again his bearing was the same . He had admirable manners . He was an accomplished man of the world as well as of science , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete account of Mr. Huxley as a talker I should soon exhaust my space . It may be enough to say that he ranked with the best . If he had a fault from the social point of view it was perhaps his readiness to accept a challenge and enter upon an argument at a time when lighter matters were in season . Even this he did rarely , and his chivalry to an opponent was such that there was never much danger of superheating the atmosphere . Once in company with the late Mr. John Bright at dinner the talk turned on India ; on which Mr. Huxley expressed a pretty strong opinion , from the Imperialist point of view , that India had been won by the sword and was to be kept by the sword . Mr. Bright turned on him with that warlike energy which he always showed in behalf of peace , contradicted him , and for two or three minutes poured out a passionate and eloquent protest against empire and conquest , and the whole policy which has made England what she is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were frequent with him . His soul blazed out ; he spoke as one having authority and inspiration . When he ended , Mr. Huxley , impressed like the rest of us with Bright 's sincerity , and not caring for an argument on a question where he had nothing in common with his opponent , sat silent . Somebody turned the conversation and the incident ended . As we went upstairs I said to Mr. Huxley that I thought Mr. Bright had gone rather far . He stopped , turned round , leaned against the hand-rail , the quaint humorous look so frequent with him came into his face , and he said : " Well , I never before understood how thoroughly a man might enjoy being told that he was a fool . " // I will give you a different example . When Mr. Roscoe Conkling was in London Mr. Huxley met him at dinner , and the two talked much together . After a while , whether because he knew or did not know Mr. Conkling 's views , expressed long before him by Marcy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he asked the eminent senator from New York what he thought of Civil Service Reform . The question was powder to the nostrils of that fiery war-horse . Mr. Conkling started off with a denunciation of Civil Service Reform as all cant and humbug , a thing impracticable , undesirable , totally unfitted to the political condition of things in America , the crotchet of men who did not understand affairs , winding up with an elaborate vindication of the existing system . He took possession of the table and talked long ; it was almost an oration , and would have done no discredit , as a rhetorical effort , to the Senate chamber itself . Mr. Huxley was asked what he thought of this performance . " I think it , " he answered , " the most brilliant defence I ever heardof a perfectly indefensible thing . " And then also there was peace . When Mr. Huxley retired from the public service , he retired , like other civil servants , with a pension . The champions of orthodoxy thought they saw a chance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other agreeable church livings , cried out against him as a scientific pluralist . It was quite true thtit although obliged to elect between salaries which came from the Treasury , of which he retained only one , he had other appointments and emoluments . I remember making a calculation at the time of the clamor-there really was not much clamor  --  and finding the total , on which anybody had a right to comment , about seven thousand five hundred dollars . There was no cause for criticism from any point of view . Mr. Huxley , of course , took no notice of what was said , but his friends resented , naturally and rightly , so shabby an attempt to discredit him . His reward for a long life passed in the public service was ludicrously moderate . There is in England a great deal of genuine public spirit , which leads men , both rich and poor , to give much of their time to public duties without pay . Mr. Huxley , who could ill afford it , gave much ; serving on fishery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what he prized most , time . The Government paid travelling expenses and required a detailed account to be sent in . The Treasury audited these accounts , and the Treasury is a notorious screw . One of these accounts was returned to Mr. Huxley with the remark that a charge of one pound for hotel lodgings ( $5 ) seemed irregular because , as far as they could make out , he had been travelling that night by train . As , however , there might be a doubt on the point , " My Lords " were willing to give him the benefit of it and made no deduction . Forthwith Mr. Huxley sat down and wrote " My Lords " a letter - with his best ink-of which I heard him say he much regretted that he kept no copy-first explaining that his original charge was strictly correct , and represented cash out of pocket ; second , entirely declining to avail himself of the lenity they were disposed to show ; and thirdly , inclosing a check for the sum they had queried . For a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a letter from the Treasury , saying in the official manner that they had made every effort to discover some person who was authorized to receive the sum for which Mr. Huxley had drawn his check , but in vain . No official , no department , had power to accept the money , and the check was therefore returned . It was covered all over , said Mr. Huxley , face and back , with indorsements , names , memoranda of every kind by all the people through whose bands it had passed . " I shall frame it , " he said , " and keep it , and hand it down to my descendants in memory of the liberality of the Treasury to an unpaid public servant . " It was the condition of Mr. Huxley 's health which drove him to resign his various appointments and obliged him to leave London . This was in 1885 , and he went to Eastbourne , that city by the sea which less than a generation ago was a village . The Duke of Devonshire // created it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huxley established himself there in a villa which he built , by the road to the splendid cliff which towers above the English Channel , and is known as Beachy Head . The grounds in which it stood were a bare expanse of untilled soil when he settled there . It was his delight to cultivate them . He turned it all into lawn and garden , and the later years of his life were spent in great part among shrubs and flowers . Never had he been happier , he said , than in going back to Adam 's occupation . His Eden was christened Hoddeslea , a local name which he always insisted was the early and true form of Huxley . It was one of the griefs of these later years that the borders of box which he transplanted and set out along his avenues were killed by the Eastbourne frosts . He would not be consoled . But his pride in his horticultural successes was as outspoken as his lament over this one failure . There was some surprise when it was known that Mr. Huxley had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying with it the title Right Honorable . It was on Lord Salisbury 's advice that the Queen called the man of science to her Council . If any dignity was to be conferred this was the one to which least exception could be taken . Privy counsellorships are not flung to the first comer , as some other decorative distinctions are . They are given rather seldom and with careful discrimination . For this reason they are among the most coveted honors . They are still a mark of the personal confidence of the Sovereign , and the Sovereign is still in the English view the fountain of honor . It need not be thought that Mr. Huxley derogated in accepting it , whatever incongruity there might seem to be between his proud plebeianship and the title of Right Honorable by which henceforth he was to be called . It was a recognition of the claims of science as well as of his own claims . He bore it , of course , with the modesty which always characterized him . In the minds of the multitude it emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tributes or recognitions from ro'yalty to science were never numerous . It will very likely be forgotten with time . He will be remembered as the great physiologist , the great student , the great controversialist , the great thinker and writer , not as the privy councillor . That he will be remembered need not be doubted . The world , it may still be said , does not willingly let die the memory of those who have made it a better world to live in , whose lives as well as whose teaching*s have been lessons of devotion , of high aims , of wide accomplishments , of honorable purpose ; whose achievements are written imperishably in the annals of their own time . Huxley was one of these , and his monument is his life 's endeavor . There will be no need to inscribe Right Honorable upon his tomb . The name he bore through life will serve both for ' epitaph and eulogy.
