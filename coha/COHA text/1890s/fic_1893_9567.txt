Main text Footnote : 1Kb The scene is in the summer cottage of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Roberts , in a Boston suburb , and the space where they encounter from opposite doors at the moment the action opens is a square hallway , with the stairs climbing out of one corner of it , and a fireplace in the other , after a fashion no longer very novel in the architecture of summer cottages . It is rather a close morning in August , but all the windows are shut , and a fire is briskly burning on the hearth . ROBERTS , at sight of his wife : Well , Agnes ? MRS . ROBERTS , at sight of her husband : Well , Edward ? ROBERTS : How is the child ? MRS . ROBERTS : Where is the doctor ? ROBERTS : He was n't at home . MRS . ROBERTS : Not at home ! Oh ! then I 'm sure you 'll approve of what I 've done . And I was so afraid I had made a mistake . ROBERTS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . He was in such a violent perspiration that I could n't help being alarmed about him , though of course I know that perspiration is generally a very good thing . But it simply rolls off him , and he keeps begging for something to eat . ROBERTS : The doctor ? MRS . ROBERTS : The doctor ! No ! Have n't you just told me he was n't at home ? ROBERTS : Yes , but I left word for him to come as soon as he could , and I thought perhaps he had got my message and run . The perspiration , you know ! MRS . ROBERTS : Yes , poor little Rob , he 's in a perfect drip , and he keeps wanting to have his clothes on . But you 're perspiring yourself , Edward ; and you 've been running . I do n't know what I shall do ! I 've made the fire , here , so as to keep Robby from taking cold ; and I do n't dare to put the window up , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply expiring . Why did you run so , dear ? ROBERTS : I did n't run . But it 's like an oven , out-of-doors . And I walked rather fast , for I wanted to get back and see how the child was , especially when I found the doctor was n't at home . MRS . ROBERTS : Yes , you did just as I should have done , and I 'm so glad now that I telephoned for Dr. Lawton . ROBERTS : Dr. Lawton ? MRS . ROBERTS : Yes ; as soon as this terrible perspiration set in I felt that we ought n't to wait another instant , for it might be a case of life and death , and I knew you would n't want to take any risks ; and when I remembered that you might n't find Dr. Williams at home , I was perfectly wild , and I telephoned at once for Dr. Lawton to come instantly ; and it was very well I did so , for he was n't at home , either . But Lou Bemis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as soon as her father came in she would send him flying . Did you leave word for Dr. Williams to hurry ? ROBERTS : Yes , I left a very urgent message on his slate . I  --  MRS . ROBERTS : I hope you underlined it , Edward ! You never will underline things , even the most important ! ROBERTS : Well , I underlined this , my dear . MRS . ROBERTS : How many times ? Three times ? ROBERTS : I think it was three times  --  MRS . ROBERTS : Because if you do n't do it three times , it is n't the least use in the world . Are you sure it was three times ? ROBERTS : Yes , I think so  --  MRS . ROBERTS : And did you put an exclamation after it ? Three ? ROBERTS : I do n't know  --  MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , how could you be so careless , Edward ? If you did n't put three exclamations , you might as well not have gone . He 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a collapse by the time he gets here . He 's furious now . Listen ! A WRATHFUL VOICE , from above : I want to get up ! I want to have my clothes on ! I want my breakfast ! MRS . ROBERTS : There , that 's the way he 's been going on the whole time since you left ! Dear , dear ! I wish the doctor would come . I do n't see what keeps them all ! It 's as much as Amy can do to hold him in bed . He 's as strong as a lion , and I know it 's just his delirium . They 're always so when they 're delirious . THE WRATHFUL VOICE , again : No , I do n't love you a bit , and you 're a hateful old thing ! And I want my clothes . I wo n't have the doctor ! I ai n't sick , and I 'm going to get up ! I am , too ! When Uncle Willis comes , I 'll tell him how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my breakfast ! MRS . ROBERTS : There ! ROBERTS : I 'll go up to him  --  MRS . ROBERTS : No , no , Edward ! You 'll be sure to give way to him , and Amy can manage him nicely . And I want you to be here to receive the doctor . I 'll run back and relieve Amy ; she must be perfectly worn out , poor thing . He fights so . ROBERTS : But if he 's in a perspiration , Agnes  --  MRS . ROBERTS : But it is n't a common perspiration , Edward ! Of course if it were any other time , and they were not quarantining everybody everywhere , and almost firing on them in New York , Footnote : 1Kb I might think it was a very good thing ; but as it is , I ca n't do anything till the doctor comes ; and if he does n't come pretty soon , I do n't know what we shall do with the child . I wish you had put three exclamations after the hurry ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've kindled the fire here , and shut every window in the house , so that the heat can all go up into his room , and I 've got the flannels all ready heating in the oven , so that if the collapse does come , I can swathe him in them from head to foot : and I do n't see how you could be so heartless , Edward , as not to put three exclamations , when you were about it ! ROBERTS : Well , perhaps Dr. Lawton will get here at once  --  MRS . ROBERTS : Yes , and it 's fortunate I happened to think of him ! I do n't know what would happen , if I did n't keep my mind on everything and everywhere at once . I do n't mean to reproach you , Edward ; and I know that you 're perfectly devoted to the children , but if you only could have had the forethought to put three excla  --  THE FURIOUS VOICE : Ya-a-a-a ! I will , I will , I will ! You sha' n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want my breakfast ! I want my Poppa ! MRS . ROBERTS : Yes , dear  --  ROBERTS : Yes , Bob  --  MRS . ROBERTS , in an awful voice : Edward , I 'm astonished at you ! Just when we had got him nicely quieted down , and he 's in the wildest delirium ! THE FURIOUS VOICE : I want my Poppa ! ROBERTS : But the child is calling me ! What shall I do , Agnes ? MRS . ROBERTS : Do ! Stay where you are , Edward , if you are half a father ! You must be here , and receive the doctor . And be sure to keep him , so that I can come down and tell him the history of the case before he sees Robby , or he 'll be all prejudiced , especially if it 's Dr. Lawton ; you know how headstrong he always is , and wants to see the patient before you can get in a word . Oh , dear ! I almost wish I had n't called him . ROBERTS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : Oh , how good you are , Edward , and how thoughtful ! Of course he 'll be here first , and I never thought of it . THE FURIOUS VOICE : Poppa ! Poppa ! Poppa ! I want my Poppa ! MRS . ROBERTS : Yes , darling ! in a moment ! Papa 's coming ! Oh , Edward , how can you let me lie so to the poor darling , and perhaps he 's in the last stages ! ROBERTS , in a stifled voice : But what shall I do , Agnes ? You wo n't let me go to him , or answer him ; and  --  MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , yes , put it all on me , dear ! And when I 've been through so much already  --  There ! ( At the sound of a step on the veranda Mrs. Roberts shrinks together for flight , and with one foot on the stair and her skirts gathered in her hand , she turns to her husband with a stage-whisper . ) It 's the doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must keep him here till I can make Robby a little presentable and throw on something so that I sha' n't be such a perfect fright , and dash the comb through my hair . Do n't let him come till I send Amy down to let you know when . I 'm not going to have the doctor find her there , and pretending to care more for the child then his own mother ; she 'd like to , well enough . Do n't wait for Bella to open the door . Open it yourself , and  --  U-u-u-gh ! ( This cry feebly represents the emotion of Mrs. Roberts as the steps on the veranda approach , and the door is flung open without any pull at the bell , revealing the face and figure of Mr. Willis Campbell . ) Willis ! How could you ? CAMPBELL : Could what ? MRS . ROBERTS : I thought it was the doctor ! I was sure it was ! CAMPBELL : Well , perhaps it is . What do you want with the doctor ? Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  CAMPBELL : What 's the matter with Bob , this time ? Cholera ? MRS . ROBERTS , whimpering : Oh , there you are ! I do n't see how you can say such a thing . He 's been in the most frightful agony , and he 's had a nap since , and now he 's all in a cold perspiration , and he insists upon getting up and putting on his clothes and having his breakfast , and it 's as much as Amy and I can do to manage him : he struggles like a maniac . She 's almost exhausted , poor thing . CAMPBELL : What 's she doing ? THE WRATHFUL VOICE , from above : She 's holding me in bed , Uncle Willis , and she 's keeping me from having my clothes on , and getting any breakfast ! Oh , uncle , uncle ! Come up here and make her stop ! CAMPBELL : I ca n't make her stop , Bob  --  MRS . ROBERTS : ' Sh ! for shame , Willis , spoiling everything ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do a thing with him , and we must keep him in bed , now , till the doctor comes , or it may be as much as his life is worth . CAMPBELL : What doctor have you sent for ? ROBERTS : I 've just been to get Dr. Williams , but he was n't at home , and I left word  --  MRS . ROBERTS : And I got so anxious that I could n't wait any longer , and I telephoned for Dr. Lawton , and Lou Bemis is going to send him the instant he comes in . They can consult together , if the case is very dangerous , and I 'm sure I never saw anything like it : perfectly bathed in an ice-cold perspiration , rolling off him in great beads . CAMPBELL : Who ? MRS . ROBERTS : Robby ! CAMPBELL : I thought you meant Roberts . He looks as if he was ready to float away . What have you got a fire for on a day like this ? MRS . ROBERTS : It 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his taking cold , in the perspiration . CAMPBELL : Well , if you want to send the heat up into his room , why do n't you open the doors and windows down here , and make a draught ? MRS . ROBERTS : Do you think that would do it ? CAMPBELL : Of course it would ; and besides , it 's a great deal hotter outside than it is here . What 's the matter with Bob , anyway ? Been eating something ? MRS . ROBERTS : He 's been eating everything ! MRS . CAMPBELL , from above : Agnes ! Agnes ! I ca n't manage this boy any longer ! MRS . ROBERTS , flying up the stairs : I 'm coming , Amy ! I do n't see how I could be so heartless as to leave you alone with him so long , anyway . But I had to stop and ask Edward about the doctor , and tell him about the case so that he could explain it ; and then Willis came in , and I 've been advising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , and I 'm thoroughly ashamed of myself , and I shall never be grateful enough to you for it , the longest day I  --  Her voice gradually loses itself in the regions above , which she vanishes into before it becomes wholly inaudible . CAMPBELL , calling after her : I 'll stay here with Roberts and help him explain when the doctors come . We 'll have a doctor apiece to explain to , if they happen to come together . ROBERTS : Good heavens , Willis ! You do n't suppose they 'll come together ? CAMPBELL : Well , I do n't know what 's to prevent them . ROBERTS : But would n't it be rather awkward ? CAMPBELL : It would be deucedly awkward , my dear fellow ; but you ought to have thought of that before you called them both . If they happen here together , and the case turns out to be a rather simple one not calling for a consultation of physicians , the doctors may be a little bit put out about it . You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : Is he ? I did n't know  --  CAMPBELL : And I suppose he 'll wonder why you should have called in a stranger , when your old family physician was in the neighborhood . Lawton will be hurt . But you can easily make it right with him . You can tell him you prefer homeopathy for your children : some people do , you know ; it 's milder . ROBERTS : Do you think that would do , Willis ? CAMPBELL : Yes ; it 's the only way ; and I 'll tackle Williams . I 'll tell him it was such a trifling case , you thought you would n't call in a regular practitioner . That 'll give him confidence in himself . ROBERTS : I do n't think that would do , Willis  --  CAMPBELL : Well , perhaps it would n't . Perhaps we 'd better trust to inspiration . But we 've got to take one apiece , and see what Providence will do for us . What makes Agnes think Bob is so very bad ? ROBERTS : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a good deal of pain , when I left , and now he 's in a profuse perspiration . CAMPBELL : Well , that sounds rather threatening , but I think when the doctor comes you 'd better not give him the history of the case . I think you 'd better devote yourself to explaining why you called another doctor . Now , if they both come together , which doctor do you think you had better take ? Do you think you could manage best with that cranky old Lawton , with his punctilious medical etiquette , and his contempt of homeopathy , or little Williams , with his sensitiveness , and conceit , and quick temper , and his  --  ROBERTS : I  --  I do n't know which I had better take , Willis . CAMPBELL : I 'd willingly take old Lawton , but he never believes a word I say : and I 'd take Williams , but he 's got a notion that I 'm always laughing at him . I 'm afraid I ca n't be of much use to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're not going to back out altogether ? CAMPBELL : No , not back out . I 'll stay by , and throw in a word or two , when I see it 's needed . You 'll get on swimmingly . ( To Mrs. Campbell , who appears on the stairs somewhat disheveled and very heated-looking ) Hello , Amy ! Mrs. Campbell descends the stairs , and reaches the level of the hallway while she is speaking . MRS . CAMPBELL : What is that you are trying to put Edward up to , Willis ? I insist upon knowing . CAMPBELL : What 's the matter , Amy ? You look as though you had been having a little flirtation with a cyclone . MRS . CAMPBELL : Never mind how I look , or what I 've been flirting with . What have you been putting Edward up to ? CAMPBELL : Oh , very well , if you do n't want him to do what I say , you can take the case in hand yourself . The simple fact is that he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the two doctors are going to arrive here together as mad as hornets , and I was just telling Roberts how to manage them . But I do n't want to force my advice on any one . MRS . CAMPBELL : How do you know they 'll arrive together , and be as mad as hornets ? CAMPBELL : Well , my dear , as soon as you see them arrive together , you watch out whether they 're as mad as hornets or not . That 's all ! What do you want Roberts here to say to them when they both come in together ? MRS . CAMPBELL : They wo n't both come together . ( She goes to one of the windows and looks out . ) There , I knew they would n't ! There comes Dr. Williams , and he 's quite alone . There 's not another soul in sight , and he 's hurrying like everything . CAMPBELL : Well , then , you must smuggle him out of the way , as quick as he gets into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps old Lawton has n't started at all , yet , and you can stop him . Ca n't you call up Mrs. Bemis , and tell her that Rob is all right , and her father need n't come ? MRS . CAMPBELL : But what if he is n't all right ? CAMPBELL : Why , then , here 's Dr. Williams to make him so ! MRS . CAMPBELL : That is so  --  ROBERTS : Yes , do speak to her , Amy , and Willis and I will meet Dr. Williams here  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : Well , I will if you wish it , Edward , but I 'm not sure . ( She goes to the telephone in another room and is heard ringing , and then conducting the one-sided dialogue of the telephone . ) Is that you , Lou ? Yes , well ! It 's Mrs. Bemis I want . Are you Mrs. Bemis ? Yes , well ! This is Mrs. Campbell  --  Mrs. Willis Campbell . Amy , you know . Well , I 'm speaking for Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and if your father has n't started yet  --  What ? Is that you , Mrs. Bemis ! Hello ! Who is that ! Lou ? Yes , well ! If Dr. Lawton has n't started yet , Mrs. Roberts thinks it is n't worth while for him to come , and  --  What ? Oh , my goodness , Willis !  --  ( she rushes into the hallway again as she pronounces the dreadful words ) he 's started as fast as he can drive , and he 'll be here before we can turn round . What shall we do ? CAMPBELL : Well , then , I 'll tell you what ! Roberts , here , has got to use a little  --  finesse , a little diplomacy . MRS . CAMPBELL : You know he ca n't ! ROBERTS : You know I 'm never up to that sort of thing , Willis . I really ca n't help thinking , although I value your kindness so much , Willis , and appreciate your wish to help me , that perhaps it would be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMPBELL : How , frankly ? ROBERTS : Why , simply tell both of the doctors , when they come , that we called one because we did n't think the other would get here in time , and  --  and  --  throw ourselves on their mercy , do n't you know . CAMPBELL : Oh , a nice time you would have on old Lawton 's mercy ! It would never do in the world , Roberts . You would make the most fearful mess of it . ROBERTS : I 'm afraid we should make a fearfuler mess of it the other way . I do indeed . I 'm not at all equal to it , Willis . You know how to carry these things off naturally , but I  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : And I think you are quite right , Edward . It 's much better to be honest about things . CAMPBELL : You would n't know how to be honest about a thing if you tried , Amy . You leave Roberts to me . ROBERTS : No , Willis , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , in this instance , you have simply got to ; or you 'll have the awfulest row  --  By George , Amy , why should n't you use the finesse , or the diplomacy ? You 'd be the very one for a thing of that kind . I do n't say it to flatter you , but when it comes to a little fibbing  --  in a good cause , of course  --  MRS . CAMPBELL , after a moment of apparent fascination with the notion : No , I shall have nothing to do with it . I should n't mind the fibbing  --  for the cause is good  --  but I should know that you had something underhanded in it , and were just trying to get me into a scrape . No , Willis , I ca n't trust you , even in a case of life and death . CAMPBELL : Well , better put up your hair , anyway , Amy ; and there 's something stringing out of your neck  --  ' Sh ! There 's his step on the piazza ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallway , and hastily reorders her dress and hair , and turns again to her husband . MRS . CAMPBELL : Will that do ? CAMPBELL , laughing : Perfectly . MRS . CAMPBELL : I do n't believe it ; unless you 're just laughing to tease me . CAMPBELL : I 'm not , Amy , indeed . And now as soon as he rings , Roberts and I will get out of this , and let you receive him , and then you 'll know that I have n't put up any job on you . Now my plan is that Roberts shall stay in the library , on one side of the hall , here , and I 'll stay in the dining-room on the other side . If old Lawton comes before you get Williams out of the house , I 'll receive him in the dining-room , and prime him with a little sherry , and talk round him , and keep him amused till Williams is gone . And you must smuggle him down the back way , and Roberts will be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I 'll steal out , and get up stairs with Lawton , and then Roberts can open the door , and hustle the other fellow out , and get him into his buggy , and have him off , and old Lawton will never suspect anything . ( He glances out of the window . ) By George , there comes Lawton down the road now , and there is n't an instant to lose ! Poke Williams right into the library there with Roberts , the instant he appears , and shut the door on them , and  --  ' Sh ! There 's his step ! He 's crossing the veranda ! He 's ringing ! ( The bell is heard . ) Come , Roberts ! ( Roberts starts to follow Campbell into the dining-room . ) No , no ! You 're to be in the library , you know . ( He turns Roberts about in the right direction by main force . ) And remember , you 're to take him up out of the door at the other end of the library , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back stairs . He closes the library door upon Roberts , and retreats to the dining-room . At the same moment Mrs. Campbell opens the hall door to Dr. Williams . MRS . CAMPBELL : We do n't stand upon ceremony this morning , doctor ; I do n't know where the maids all are . We 've been terribly frightened about poor little Robby , and I do n't know what you 'll think of him . But we 've kept him in bed till you came , though he 's been perfectly furious to get up and have his clothes on . DR . WILLIAMS , standing with his hat in one hand , and his case of medicines in the other : Get up and have his clothes on ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes ; his mother is afraid he may be a little delirious . But wo n't you just step in here , and speak with Mr. Roberts ? He would like to see you first . She throws open the library door , and Dr. Williams disappears within , looking mystified . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell shows himself at the dining-room door , and addresses her in a stage-whisper . CAMPBELL : Splendid , Amy ! I could n't have done it better myself . Now , if you 'll only manage old Lawton half as well , our lives will be saved . MRS . CAMPBELL , whispering : Dr. Lawton will be more difficult . Willis , I believe I shall let you receive Dr. Lawton . CAMPBELL : No , no ! You mus n't think of it . You are doing magnificently , Amy ! It will be such a joke on old Lawton when we 're all safely out of it ! Say the first thing that comes into your head , and it will be right . ( He runs to the window , and peeps . ) He 's there ! He 's hitching his horse , and he 'll be at the door in half a minute . Courage , Amy , and luck to you . MRS . CAMPBELL : No , Willis ! Do n't leave me ! You know I shall be perfectly helpless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is if he suspects anything . CAMPBELL : Old Lawton ? Well , Amy , if you could n't manage old Lawton ! All you have got to do is to send him in to me , and I 'll keep him from going up stairs till Edward gets the other fellow out of the house , and the coast is clear . MRS . CAMPBELL : Willis , you must n't go . Stay and receive him with me . CAMPBELL : I tell you I ca n't . It will spoil everything . He 'll be sure to smell a rat if I 'm with you . MRS . CAMPBELL , in a lamentable voice : He always smells a rat ! CAMPBELL : Well , he wo n't this time . There he is , coming up the veranda steps . Now , keep your wits about you , Amy , do ! And send him right in here to me . He retreats toward the dining-room door . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , how can you be so cruel , unkind , and inconsiderate ! Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage , and I shall just be glad of it if I make a mess of the whole thing . ( The bell rings , and she pulls the door open , and admits Dr. Lawton . ) Oh , how very kind of you , doctor ! Agnes has been worried to death , asking you to come in your vacation . But poor little Rob has been acting so strangely that she could n't help feeling alarmed , and she knew there was no one like you , and she telephoned you on the impulse of the moment ; and it 's so good of you to come . ( She glances round at the dining-room door , and catches a glimpse of Campbell making frantic gestures of approval and encouragement . ) Wo n't you sit down a moment , and I 'll go and tell  --  DR . LAWTON : No . I 'd better see the patient at once , if he 's in an alarming condition . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , he is ! But had n't I better get you a fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very warm this morning . DR . LAWTON : I should think it was  --  in here . What have you got a fire for this morning ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Why , Agnes kindled it . She thought that Rob might take cold , he 's in such a drip of perspiration , and she did n't realize how hot it was outdoors . She wanted to send the heat up into his room . DR . LAWTON , throwing open the windows : Well she has n't succeeded , then . And it 's a very good thing she has n't . It 's enough to kill the child , let alone the doctor . By-the-way , whose horse is that out there ? MRS . CAMPBELL , with dismay , which she tries to make pass for astonishment : Horse ? DR . LAWTON : Yes ; I did n't say cow , Mrs. Campbell . MRS . CAMPBELL , looking resolutely away from the window in the direction of the dining-room door , which Campbell closes : Is there any horse besides yours , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is another doctor 's horse . The signs are unmistakable . Who 's in the dining-room , there ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Dining-room ? Why , I suppose the maids  --  DR . LAWTON , darting suddenly upon her : Is n't Mr. Campbell in there ? ( As she hesitates , he smiles , and continues in a rapid whisper . ) I see . They called another doctor first , and when he did n't come at once , they telephoned to me . That is all perfectly natural , and all perfectly right . I suppose you 're afraid I shall be vexed at finding another doctor here . I think it 's the jolliest kind of fix for Roberts , but I have n't the heart to tease him about it . If it was your husband , Mrs. Campbell , I should n't mind doing it . He 's always teasing somebody . Tell me , now , what 's his little game at present ? Concealment is impossible , you know , and you might as well be honest as not . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really might . She whispers throughout , and so does Dr. Lawton . DR . LAWTON : Better . What is he up to , in there ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Will you ever tell him I told you ? DR . LAWTON : Never ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Well , it would really be such a good joke on Willis , and I should like to see him come up with , once . DR . LAWTON : Dear lady , if you will only tell me , he shall be come up with as he never was in his life before ! MRS . CAMPBELL : But would n't it be a little wrong , doctor ? I should n't want you to tease him very much ! DR . LAWTON : Not so as to injure him , of course ; but just to give him a little lesson . You can safely trust me . I am your family physician , you know , and I will be responsible for the result . MRS . CAMPBELL , reflectively : That is true . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for leaving me here to take the brunt of it with you , and to try to keep you in the dark . DR . LAWTON : It would be your duty , Mrs. Campbell , in an event of that kind . MRS . CAMPBELL : And perhaps it would cure him of his teasing , if he could feel how it was himself . DR . LAWTON : It would be the saving of him . It would bring out all his good and noble qualities . What is his game ? MRS . CAMPBELL : I have the greatest mind in the world to tell you , only I do n't like to do anything that a man would think underhand . DR . LAWTON : A man would think it the frankest kind of a thing . A woman might think it underhand , but  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , I do n't care what a woman would think . And it would be such a good joke on Willis ! Well , you see  --  you see  --  DR . LAWTON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Williams  --  DR . LAWTON : Oh ; little pills ! Footnote : 1Kb Well , he is n't such a bad sort of fellow . Go on ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Agnes sent for him , and then , while Edward was gone , Robby broke into such a profuse perspiration that she got frightened , and telephoned for you . And when Willis found out what they had done , he began to tease , and to try to make them believe it was something awful , and that you would both be so angry that you would never forgive it  --  DR . LAWTON , rubbing his hands : Capital ! Just as I suspected . Oh , I 'll fool him to the top of his bent ! Footnote : 1Kb Go on ! MRS . CAMPBELL : And poor Edward wanted to tell the truth about it , as soon as you came , and Willis would n't let him . And he said Edward must go into the library , and receive Dr. Williams , and let him see the child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be waiting in the dining-room , and I was to show you in there to him  --  DR . LAWTON : Glorious ! Oh , young man , how I will block your game ! MRS . CAMPBELL : And he would keep you amused there till Dr. Williams was safely out of the house , and then let you go up stairs , and you would never know anything about it . DR . LAWTON : Oh , wo n't I ? Well , Mrs. Campbell , now I 'm going to begin . You say , Just step into the dining-room , doctor , and I 'll call Mr. Roberts . MRS . CAMPBELL , aloud : Yes , Mr. Roberts would like to see you first , and if you 'll step into the dining-room a moment out of this terrible heat , and wo n't mind its being in a little disorder  --  DR . LAWTON , whispering : Is any one in the library now ? MRS . CAMPBELL , opening the door , to peep in : No . DR . LAWTON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wait in the library , if you please , and look at a word I want to see in Roberts 's dictionary . He goes into the library , and closes the door after him , and at the same instant Campbell flings open the dining-room door , and flies out upon his wife . CAMPBELL : Great heavens , Amy , what in the world are you up to ? Do n't you know that Roberts is in there with Dr. Williams ? You showed them in there yourself , half a minute ago . Campbell is obliged to speak in an impassioned whisper , so that he shall not be heard in the library . MRS . CAMPBELL : Why , so I did ! What shall I do ? CAMPBELL : Oh , do ! You ca n't do anything now . The die is cast , the jig is up , the fat 's in the fire , the milk 's spilt . MRS . CAMPBELL , mysteriously : I do n't believe it is . CAMPBELL : Do n't believe it is ! What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willis , I have a great mind to tell you something . CAMPBELL : Tell me something ? MRS . CAMPBELL : ' Sh ! Yes , it would be such a joke on Dr. Lawton ! CAMPBELL : On Lawton ! Out with it , Amy ! I 'm round paying a heavy premium for jokes on Lawton . MRS . CAMPBELL : What will you give me if I tell you ? CAMPBELL : Oh , anything ! Everything ! A kiss . MRS . CAMPBELL : Stuff ! Will you ever let any human being know that I told you ? CAMPBELL : Red-hot pincers could n't get it out of me . MRS . CAMPBELL : Well , I peeped before I let him go in , and made sure Dr. Williams had gone up stairs . He wants to block your game , Willis . But I do n't think it was very nice of him to try to get a wife to join against her husband ; do you ? CAMPBELL : Oh , that was very wrong indeed ! I wonder at Lawton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMPBELL : If it was n't for that , I do n't believe I should tell you . CAMPBELL : I know you would n't , Amy . It 's your sense of duty that obliges you to speak . MRS . CAMPBELL : If I were sure that it was my sense of duty  --  CAMPBELL : You may bet anything it is , Amy . I can tell when you 're doing a thing because you 're mad , and when you 're doing it from a sense of duty . You look altogether different . MRS . CAMPBELL : And it is n't at all for the joke  --  CAMPBELL : Joke , Amy ? You joke ! You would rather perish . You would n't know how , even if you wanted to . What is it ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , then you think women have no sense of humor ? CAMPBELL : I ? I think they are so truly humorrous that they need n't joke to show it , and that if you saw anything funny in giving Dr. Lawton away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprobate up to , Amy ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Well , then , I 'll tell you , if you wo n't give me away , as you call it . CAMPBELL : Amy ! MRS . CAMPBELL : He made me confess  --  or the same as confess  --  that there was another doctor here , and you were going to keep it from him , till we could get Dr. Williams out of the house , and then let him go up and see Rob , and he would never know anything about it . And I know he 's going to bounce out of the library in a minute , and pretend to be furious , and block your game , as he calls it . CAMPBELL : Oh , is he ! I guess two can play at blocking that game ! MRS . CAMPBELL : And I 'm not going to stay , Willis , and you may get out of the boggle the best way you can . CAMPBELL : You are an angel , Amy , and nothing proves it more than your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got two men into . Angels of your description always do that . MRS . CAMPBELL : Well , if that 's the way you talk , Willis , I 'll take back everything I 've said . Dr. Lawton does n't know anything about my telling you . Now , how do you feel ? CAMPBELL : Terribly . But I think I 'll act just as if he did . Go , my love ; leave me to my fate . MRS . CAMPBELL : I shall not do it , now , because I see that you really wish me to . I shall stay , and see what a miserable mess you will make of it . I shall stay , and triumph over both of you . And I shall laugh and laugh . Oh , how I shall la  --  Wo-o-o ! Oh , my goodness , he 's coming ? At the sound of the knob turning in the library door Mrs. Campbell starts in fright , and with a backward glance at Dr. Lawton as he emerges , she flies from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! DR . LAWTON , grimly : Ah , Mr. Campbell ! CAMPBELL : Awfully good of you to let them disturb you in your vacation , this way . Roberts will be down in a moment . He wants to see you before you go up to Rob . Agnes wants him to explain the case to you . It 's rather a peculiar case  --  DR . LAWTON : I do n't think I 'll wait to see Mr. Roberts , Mr. Campbell . I will ask you to say to Mrs. Roberts that I preferred not to wait  --  simply that . CAMPBELL , with affected consternation : Why , Dr. Lawton , I hope you do n't mind having had to wait a few moments for Roberts . I 'll run right up stairs for him . I know he 'll be extremely mortified and distressed . DR . LAWTON , as before : The waiting is nothing . I do n't mind the waiting  --  CAMPBELL , with affected humility : Then may I ask  --  DR . LAWTON , as before : Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest objection to answering . Another physician has been called here , before me . CAMPBELL : Oh , but , Dr. Lawton , I assure you  --  DR . LAWTON , always with the greatest sternness : Do n't attempt to trifle with me , sir . When I hitched my horse before the door , I found another doctor 's horse hitched there : an unmistakable doctor 's horse , chewing the top of the post , and drowsing as peacefully as the flies would let him . He turns aside to conceal a laugh . CAMPBELL : Well , I recognize the type , doctor , but I think you must be mistaken  --  DR . LAWTON : No , sir . I am not mistaken . How should I be mistaken ? CAMPBELL : Well , the grocer 's horse behaves that way , too , I believe . DR . LAWTON : But grocers do n't drive round in top-buggies ! CAMPBELL : That is true . He appears to fall into extreme dejection . DR . LAWTON : Besides , the motive for this delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for on the ground that Mr. Roberts wishes to explain a case to me that I can judge of a great deal better than he can . No , sir ! They have another doctor up there with the patient , and they are waiting to smuggle him out of the house before they let me go up . I suspect your hand in this , Mr. Campbell , and I will not suffer you to trifle with me . You are keeping me here until Dr. Williams can be got out of the house , and then you are to let me go through the farce of prescribing for the patient . CAMPBELL , with simulated deprecation : Now , Dr. Lawton  --  DR . LAWTON , with every token of suppressed fury : Well , sir ? CAMPBELL : If I were to give you my honor that there was not another doctor in this house ? DR . LAWTON : I advise you not to do so . ( He seizes Campbell by the arm , and pulls him to the window . ) Look there , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my horse hitched at one end of that rail , out there , and do you see Dr. Williams 's horse hitched at the other end of the rail ? What do you say to that ? CAMPBELL : Why , Dr. Lawton , if you force me to be frank , I say that I did n't suppose you began so early in the morning . I do n't object to a modest eye-opener , but if a man takes so many as to make him see double  --  DR . LAWTON : Do n't prevaricate , Mr. Campbell ! Do you see two doctors ' horses there , or do n't you ? CAMPBELL : I see one doctor 's horse , there . DR . LAWTON , releasing him , and anxiously scanning his face : Ah ! my poor young friend ! This is worse than the simple drunkenness you accuse me of . Are you aware that there is a very serious brain disorder which causes the victim to see but half of a given object , and of two objects to see but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better get another doctor to judge between us , or appeal from Philip after to Philip before his second eye-opener . Come , now , doctor , had n't you better go home ! I 'll excuse you to the family , and account for you some way . I do n't believe Amy noticed anything ; and when you get back , you can sleep it off , and nobody will be the wiser . It is n't habitual with you , and we can hush it up for this once if you 'll only go  --  DR . LAWTON , with a fresh access of pretended rage : No , sir , I will not go ! I insist upon seeing Mr. Roberts , and upon verifying the presence of another doctor in this house . CAMPBELL , with a shrug : Well , I suppose if you see double there 's nothing to prevent you from thinking double . But if the solemn assurance of one of your oldest and truest friends  --  THE VOICE FROM OVERHEAD , making itself heard through the closed door : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I do n't want any medicine ! I know it 's nasty . Go away , doctor ! I ai n't sick ! The voice dies away into the indistinct murmur of other persuasive and menacing voices , and the sound of a struggle , terminating in a wild yell . DR . LAWTON : There , sir , what do you say to that ? CAMPBELL : Say to what ? DR . LAWTON : To that outcry , that uproar , that plain proclamation of Dr. Williams 's presence ! CAMPBELL : Why , did you hear anything , doctor ? DR . LAWTON , with a compassionate shake of his head : Hearing affected , too ! This is very interesting . Will you let me examine your eye , Mr. Campbell ? CAMPBELL : Oh , certainly . ( After the doctor has lifted the lid , and peered earnestly into his eye ) Anything green , there ? DR . LAWTON : What do you mean , sir ? CAMPBELL : Oh , nothing , only I think you are doing it splendidly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate it . My game is completely blocked . Go on ! DR . LAWTON , after a moment : Who told you ? CAMPBELL : Amy . DR . LAWTON , with mock tragedy : Then I have been betrayed . CAMPBELL : I 've been betrayed , too . She told you that I was going to put up a job on you . DR . LAWTON : She did . Mrs. Campbell is truth itself . CAMPBELL : I should say deceit personified . DR . LAWTON : You are Mrs. Campbell 's husband . What shall we do now ? CAMPBELL , offering his hand : Shake . DR . LAWTON , taking it : And then ? CAMPBELL : Keep the thing up with increased fervor . Bite the biter ; deceive the deceiver ; outshine the truth itself in candor . DR . LAWTON : Ah , that might be difficult  --  for some of us ! But still I think we had better make the attempt . But first : there is n't anything serious the matter with Rob , is there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remark that I heard him make . DR . LAWTON : That 's a trouble that can always be reached , happily , in our condition of life . Well , where did we leave off ? CAMPBELL : Oh , I think at Rob 's giving Dr. Williams 's presence away . DR . LAWTON : I remember ! Well , here goes , then ! ( He bursts out furiously . ) No , sir , I will not be put off with any such excuse . It is a matter which touches my personal and professional dignity . Where is Mr. Roberts , I say ? ( In a natural tone ) How will that do ? CAMPBELL : First rate ! Perhaps it was a little too emphatic . I 'm afraid Amy will begin to suspect something . Now I 'll reply in persuasive accents : My dear Dr. Lawton , you know that Roberts is incapable of offering you a personal or a professional affront . If you will give me a little time , I can explain  --  DR . LAWTON : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biting sarcasm : I fancy you will not only want a little time ; you will want a little eternity to explain a thing like this . But if Mr. Roberts will not come to me , I will go to Mr. Roberts ! CAMPBELL , naturally : Oh , that 's capital ! That will fetch them . ' Sh ! They 're opening the door a little . That 's Agnes . I suppose Roberts must have got Williams down the back stairs . Now I 'll throw myself in your way , here , and attempt to prevent your going up . That will simply madden you . I 'll place myself at the foot of the stairs , with folded arms , and say , in a voice choked with a sense of duty , Dr. Lawton , if you so far forget yourself as to attempt to mount a single step toward the room where my poor nephew lies in a drip of perspiration , I will  --  Now , you go on , in a perfect frenzy . DR . LAWTON : You will what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will use physical force to prevent me ? ( Naturally ) How will that do ? CAMPBELL : The very thing ! Now I 'll come in : I do n't know what you call it , but I shall keep you from going up stairs . DR . LAWTON , dramatically : Stand aside , sir ! CAMPBELL : Not so loud , quite . They 're listening . I 'll give you the right pitch : I will not stand aside . If you mount these stairs , it will be over my body , dead or alive . About like that , you know . Now , we must both stamp our feet , and that will bring them . They both stamp their feet , and a sound of swishing dresses and suppressed voices is heard on the little gallery that looks down into the hallway from above . The dresses and the voices are those of Mrs. Roberts and Mrs. Campbell ; Mrs. Campbell restrains Mrs. Roberts by main force from rushing down and interfering with the quarrel of the men . MRS . CAMPBELL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes ! I tell you they 're just trying to fool each other . Oh , dear ! I wish I had n't put them up to it ! This comes from not sticking to the exact truth . Edward 's way is the best ; yes , it is , and I shall always stick to it after this , if it kills me . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , but are you sure they 're trying to fool each other , Amy ? Perhaps you 're not telling the truth , now ! If they should be in earnest , I should surely die ! ( The men continue to dramatize a struggle on the floor below . ) Oh , look at them ! I ca n't bear to look at them ! Oh , are you sure you 're not mistaken , Amy ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Do n't I tell you I put them up to it myself ? MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , I wish Edward would come back , and separate them ! I do n't see what he 's doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the excuse of the garden when he took him down the back way , but he could have shown him every leaf in it by this time , I should think . Amy , I ca n't think they 're joking . They do struggle so fearfully . There ! They 've let each other go , at last , but it 's simply from exhaustion ! CAMPBELL , proudly placing himself at the foot of the stairs again , and addressing Dr. Lawton , with feigned hauteur : I think you are satisfied now , that you ca n't go up stairs , Dr. Lawton . DR . LAWTON , dramatically : We will see , Mr. Campbell . I have kept one little argument in reserve . He advances upon Campbell with lifted hand , as if to strike . CAMPBELL , dramatically : What ! A blow , Dr. Lawton ? DR . LAWTON , dramatically : Several , Mr. Campbell , if you insist upon it . Will you stand aside ? CAMPBELL , dramatically putting himself into a posture of self-defence : Never ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but I will not be answerable for the consequences if you strike me . I will not take a blow from you , much as I respect you , and would like to gratify you . I allow no one to strike me but Mrs. Campbell . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , Amy ! Is it true ? Do you ever strike poor Willis ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Do n't be a goose , Agnes ! Does n't that show you that he 's just making fun . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , do you think he is ? If I could only believe you , Amy , I should bless you , the longest day you lived . Is Dr. Lawton making fun , too ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes , up to a certain point . But he does n't seem to be making as much fun as Willis is . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , I 'm sure he 's in the bitterest earnest . See , he 's just struck at Willis ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : Oh , do n't look ! ( She hides her eyes in her hands . ) What are they doing now ? MRS . CAMPBELL : He keeps striking at Willis , and Willis wards off his blows , without returning one of them . Oh , is n't he glorious ! That 's his fencing . He can outfence anybody , Willis can . He must n't strike him , but if he lets him strike HIM , I will never speak to him again ! MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , stop them , somebody , do ! Oh , Willis  --  DR . LAWTON , advancing with lifted hand : I demand to see Mr. Roberts ! MRS . ROBERTS , in wild appeal : Oh , but he is n't here , Dr. Lawton ! Indeed he is n't ! He 's out in the garden with Dr. Williams , and as soon as he can get rid of him he 'll come right back and explain everything . It all happened through my being so anxious , and telephoning for you after he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb you in your vaca  --  Oh , my goodness , he does n't hear a word I say ! ( The men renew their struggle . ) Oh , Amy , do you think they 're still in fun ? MRS . CAMPBELL , with misgiving : I do n't believe they 're as much in fun as they were at first . I  --  MRS . ROBERTS , wringing her hands : Oh , well , then , speak to Willis , do , and see if you can make him hear you ! MRS . CAMPBELL , with great but faltering sternness : Willis ! Willis ! I want you to stop that absurd nonsense ! You will give me a nervous headache if you keep on . You know that Dr. Lawton does n't mean anything , and you 're just trying to frighten us , and I think it 's a shame . Stop , Willis ! Oh , dear ! he does n't hear me , or he just pretends he does n't . I do n't know what I shall do . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as loud as ever we can scream . MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes , that 's the only thing we can do now . They both scream at the tops of their voices . Campbell and Dr. Lawton desist , and look smilingly up at them , with an air of great apparent surprise and interest . At the same moment Roberts and Dr. Williams burst wildly in through the door from the veranda . ROBERTS , with shuddering dismay : What 's the matter ? What are you screaming for ? Is Robby in a relapse ? Willis  --  Dr. Lawton  --  what is it ? CAMPBELL , with great calm : What is what ? Have you noticed anything , Dr. Lawton ? DR . LAWTON , with kindly serenity : I 'm sure I could n't say . Has there been anything unusual going on ? MRS . ROBERTS AND MRS . CAMPBELL : They have been struggling violently together , and we screamed . MRS . ROBERTS : Dr. Lawton was trying to come up stairs to speak with you , and Willis would n't let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I will settle with Willis when we get home . MRS . ROBERTS : We were terribly frightened . MRS . CAMPBELL : I was not frightened , but I was never so indignant in my life . CAMPBELL : Do you understand all this , Dr. Lawton ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Willis ! I will not stand this any longer , and if you keep it up , I shall go into hysterics . Now you just tell Edward the truth ! CAMPBELL : Well , Amy , I will . You see , Roberts , that as soon as Dr. Lawton got here he suspected another physician , and he taxed Amy with it when she let him in , and instead of confessing at once , as any one else would have done , that he had been called simply because Roberts had n't found Dr. Williams at home  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh ! CAMPBELL :  --  she invented a cock and bull story , and then , because it would n't work , she told him that I was trying to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would let me do it  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : And I think I was perfectly justifiable . You 're always doing such things to me . DR . LAWTON : You were simply acting for his best good , Mrs. Campbell . CAMPBELL : Then she gave Lawton away to me , the first chance she had . But as soon as Lawton and I got together we saw through each other in a minute , and we concluded to let her have as much of her game as she wanted . That 's all . Sorry to disturb Agnes , but that could n't be helped . Of course we had to make some noise in the course of our little drama  --  ROBERTS : Fortunately , Dr. Williams had n't driven away ; and when I heard the alarming uproar here , I called him in again . I thought Robby might  --  CAMPBELL : Well , that 's pretty rough on Dr. Lawton . DR . LAWTON : Yes , Roberts , you might have remembered I was here . Well , I forgive you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if our patient is in a relapse ? He offers Dr. Williams his hand . DR . WILLIAMS , taking it , and meaning to say something civil : I think I can safely leave him to you , now , doctor . There 's nothing really the matter  --  DR . LAWTON : Oh , you 're very good ! CAMPBELL : You seem to be getting compliments on all hands , Lawton . What 's the matter with a few words of modest praise for your fellow-conspirator ? MRS . ROBERTS , to the waitress , who looks out from the dining-room door . What is it , Bella ? Breakfast ? Well , now , you must both stay to breakfast with us , and if you decide that Robby can have something , and will only consult together and say what he shall have  --  DR . LAWTON , looking up the stairs at a forlorn little figure , very much dishevelled and imperfectly attired , which appears on the landing : Suppose we let Robby decide for himself ! Would you like some watermelon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAWTON : Or August sweetings ? DR . WILLIAMS : Or soda-water ? DR . LAWTON : Or candy ? DR . WILLIAMS : Or peaches and cream ? CAMPBELL : Or all together ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Ah , do n't tease the child ! ROBBY , looking wistfully from one to the other as he descends to the floor , and fixing his eyes on his mother at last : If you 'll let me come to the table , mamma  --  I could n't find all my clothes  --  I 'd like a little milk-toast and tea . MRS . ROBERTS , stooping and putting his arms round her neck : Oh , you poor little dirty angel ! You shall have anything you want on the table . You wo n't mind his coming just as he is ? She turns with Robby to her guests , who take him into their arms one after another . DR . LAWTON : If Rob had another rag on him , I should n't feel good enough for his company . DR . WILLIAMS : I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMPBELL : And I will never hold him in bed again ! ROBBY , after a moment : You could n't . CAMPBELL , catching him up on his shoulder , and dancing into the dining-room with him : I knew she was just shamming when she pretended to do it .
