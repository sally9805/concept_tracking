txt Superintendent Byrnes was feeling happy yesterday over- the results obtained in his efforts to compel the liquor sellers to keep Within the law and not sell during the prohibitive hours . There were 240 arrests for violation of the excise law on Sunday , as told in The New-York Times yesterday . When asked about the results , the Superintendent declined to talk , beyond stating that the records were a sufficient answer . He said that he did not care what the saloon keepers said about the matter ; that their declarations were entirely immaterial to him . His attention was called to the statement of John G. Boyd , President of the New York Citizens ' Alliance , that the " sPY resolution did not prevent policemen in citizens ' clothes from obtaining evidence against excise violators . He replied : " do n't care what Mr. Boyd says or thinks . I know what my duty is , and I am going to perform it . The work begun will be kept up on the same lines . " Including arrests for other reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all on Sunday  --  the greatest ? umber in one day in the history of the Police Department . Vagrants were locked up in squads . In every precinct in the city policemen in plain clothes were out looking for violators of the law from midnight Saturday until 5 o'clock Monday morning . The Inspectors were all busily engaged in the work , and will continue at it in the future . Special policemen will be out nightly to arrest all who keep open after hours . Superintendent Byrnes had two Sergeants of police from each precinct before him yesterday , to whom and to the Inspectors he talked for nearly half an hour on the general discipline and conduct of the force . He assured them that he would hold them strictly accountable for all shortcomings . Police Justice Voorhis , now sitting in the Jefferson Market Court . is evidently of the opinion that Superintendent Byrnes is doing nothing improper or unwarranted in the methods he is employing . Yesterday he held a majority of the prisoners who were brought before him charged with keeping their saloons open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners whose cases Justice Hogan refused to pass upon . As Justice Hogan has gone away on a two weeks ' vacation , there will be no further clash between him and the Central Office for some days at least , and the offenders will appear before Justices who do not construe the law as Justice Hogan does . The policemen have gained the confidence that the saloon keepers lost after learning of Justice Voorhis 's method in handling the cases , and they felt yesterday that they can enforce the law ? at any rate that where evidence is procured the offenders will be properly dealt with . Justice Simms , sitting in the Essex Market Police Court yesterday , also held the excise law violators brought before him . When asked his opinion on Justice Hogan 's contention that between the hours of 1 and 5 o'clock saloons are closed to all intents and purposes , he said : " They might be closed to all intents and purposes and yet be open . The law does not look to the manner in which the evidence is obtained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a policeman 's duty to make an arrest at any hour , day or night , if he sees a law violated .
