Esculapius Scalpel You 'll have enough to do to take care of yourself . ( Aside . ) I 'll bet he will never want to sleep another night in a medical college . I 'll put up a job upon him that he will remember as long as he lives . Good night ! Exits r. h. 1 e . George George Arrowroot ( laughs ) . He thought he was going to scare me , but he did n't ( laughs loud , and the laugh is rechoed outside in sepulchral tones . The subject in the bag laughs and moves head .

George Arrowroot That 's the same way I came in . Peleg . Peleg Venture Ai n't you afraid of lightning ? George . George Arrowroot No ; I 'm used to it . What do you want here , any way ? Peleg . Peleg Venture I was standing under an awning over on the corner , and the wind blew it down , so I saw a light over in this window , and I thought I 'd come over and see who lived here . George . George Arrowroot You 'd better get out of this house . Have n't you heard anything about this place ? Peleg . Peleg Venture No ; I just come over here . George .

Peleg . Peleg Venture You stop fooling ; let me alone . George . George Arrowroot This place is full of ghosts .

( Kicks Peleg . ) You 'd better get out . Oh ! I must cut you up . I 've got to cut you up any way ! Peleg . Peleg Venture Have you got any proof that the house is haunted ? Did you see anything ? George . George Arrowroot Come here . ( Grabs Peleg and takes him over to subject on plank . ) Do you see that ? That 's one of them ( shows Peleg the bag ) , and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stage . ) Peleg . Peleg Venture What 's the matter with them ? Are they asleep ? George . George Arrowroot No ; they 're dead . ( Pistol shot in wings . Peleg and George fall to the floor and lie perfectly still , having thrown carpet bag , etc. , upwards . George lies with legs upwards . Peleg raises head and finally arises , trembling , and stoops to pick up his carpet bag . A loud rap is heard in wing as he does so . He starts , trembling , with hair erect . As he picks up his hat another rap is heard  --  bus . ad lib . As he picks up his umbrella a loud crash is heard , and Peleg bolts for the door . George rises . ) George . George Arrowroot Stop ! Where are you going ? Peleg . Peleg Venture I 'm going back under that awning . ( Goes toward r. h . ) George . George Arrowroot Look out ; do n't go in that room ; that 's where I cut up people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venture I do n't want to stay in this house . There 's too much noise in here , and I 'm awful nervous . George . George Arrowroot That 's the reason you want to lay down and rest . Take a sleep and you 'll feel better ; let 's go to bed . There 's nothing wrong with the house ; I was only fooling you . Peleg Peleg Venture ( looking around ) . Where 's the bed ? I do n't see any . George . George Arrowroot Why , right down here . ( Points to floor . ) It 's a nice feather bed ! Peleg Peleg Venture ( feeling the floor ) . I guess they took the feathers out and let the chickens get in . George . George Arrowroot There 's nice slats in this bed . Peleg . Peleg Venture If we roll out of bed it wo n't hurt us much . But I always go fixed when I 'm out among strangers . ( Opens carpet bag and takes out a very small pillow . ) George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peleg Venture That 's my pillow . ( Places it on floor . ) George George Arrowroot ( picking it up ) . It looks like a pin cushion . I 'm afraid that pillow will get into my ear . ( While speaking he fastens the fish hook into the pillow and places pillow on floor ; it is then ready to be drawn off into wing . George is about to lie down upon it . ) Peleg . Peleg Venture Hold on ! do n't get into bed yet . Wait until I fix the blanket . ( He takes out a handkerchief from carpet bag and spreads it upon the floor . ) George . George Arrowroot That 's the thinnest blanket I ever saw . Come , get into bed . ( As he is about to place his head upon the pillow it is slowly drawn off towards l. h . George raises head and observes it . ) There goes the pillow ! Quick , get the candle ! get the candle ! ( Bus . Peleg takes candle from the table , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab it , when it is suddenly pulled into wing , l. h. 2 e . George turns to look for Peleg , going to c. of stage , as Peleg comes behind him and approaches wing l. h. 2 e . A form is seen to dart out of this wing and blow out Peleg 's candle , then dart back again . ) Peleg . Peleg Venture Somebody blew out my candle . George . George Arrowroot I never see such a feller as you are . Where are you ? Bring the candle over here ( groping in the dark ) . Peleg . Peleg Venture Whistle , so I 'll know where you are . ( They run into each other , and George takes the candle from Peleg . ) George . George Arrowroot Go over to the table and get a match . Peleg . Peleg Venture Where 's the table ? ( Finds table , and feeling around finds skull . ) Here 's the match box ! George George Arrowroot ( feeling in pockets ) . Well , bring it over here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Strikes a light as Peleg comes over with the skull ; as he comes towards the light he sees the skull he is holding and hastily replaces it upon the table , trembling . ) Peleg . Peleg Venture That 's a funny match box ! George . George Arrowroot If you do n't stop your fooling I 'll have to cut you up ! Lay down now and see if you ca n't sleep . ( They lie down upon the floor , George using his bundle for a pillow . ) Look out there , no yamping the blankets ! ( A deep groan is heard . Peleg raises his head as the subject on the plank raises his left leg and lowers it . Peleg jumps up , and as he comes towards the subject in the bag an arm is seen to issue from the bag and clutch at Peleg , who , trembling in every limb , runs to George , who is sound asleep , and repeatedly kicks him . ) Peleg . Peleg Venture George ! George ! George ! Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over on the mantlepiece wants a drink of water . George ! ( George snores . ) Oh ! hear him draw his breath . Well , I ca n't sleep ; I 'm too nervous . So I 'll sit up on the edge of the bed and tell stories all night . ( Sits down in front of George and opens carpet bag . ) I think I 'll eat a piece of ginger cake . ( Bus . As he takes the cake from carpet bag and is about to eat it a dark ghostly form comes from l. h. 1 e. and snatches the cake from him and exits with it r. h. 1 e . Peleg starts up and again kicks George until he wakes him . ) George . George Arrowroot What did you wake me for ? Peleg . Peleg Venture I had my table all set , and the landlord came up just now and cleaned away all the provisions . George . George Arrowroot So you 've been eating while I was asleep , and would n't wake me to give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Peleg . Peleg Venture Well , I did n't have enough to go around . George . George Arrowroot You 've got me in the humor of eating . Let us search and see if we ca n't find something to eat . You look over there and I 'll look over this way . ( Peleg goes over to the bag . ) Peleg . Peleg Venture Here 's a bag of mock oranges . ( Puts his hand into it , but hastily draws it out , trembling . ) There 's nothing in that good to eat . ( George finds lunch in wing , r. h. 2 e. and returns with dish of smear kase and spoon , loaf of bread , knife and bottle . ) George . George Arrowroot Oh ! see what I 've found . Oh ! supper . Supper for one . Peleg . Peleg Venture Oh ! supper . Supper for two ! ( They place it upon table and seat themselves r. and l. of table . The subject in the bag moves over and stands directly behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the bread , turns and sees the bag . ) George . George Arrowroot Hello ! how did that bag get over there ? Peleg . Peleg Venture I 'm blamed if I know ! Let 's eat ; I 'm awful hungry . ( The subject in the bag pokes his head out of bag  --  the head covered with a skeleton mask . Peleg turns and sees the hideous face ; he arises and runs , trembling , to r. h . George . George Arrowroot Come over and get some bread and smear kase . ( Cuts slice of bread . ) Peleg . Peleg Venture No , I ai n't a bit hungry ; it makes me nervous to eat at night . I imagine I see things . George . George Arrowroot Come over . ( With spoon he places large amount of smear kase on the slice of bread . ) Oh ! look at this nice smear kase , and watch me eat it . ( As he is about to eat it the subject in the bag reaches out his hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with the stuff that is on the bread . George rises and comes front . ) Peleg Peleg Venture ( laughs ) . Oh ! look at your face . You 're too greedy . ( He goes over to George . ) George . George Arrowroot You pushed that into my face . I 'll fix you as soon as I get it out of my eye . ( The subject in the bag comes down between them , exposes his head and yells at Peleg , who rushes toward 1 e. , r. h. , to escape . There he is met by a flash of fire . George turns and sees the skeleton head of the subject in the bag . George rushes over to 1 e. , l. h. , and there he is also met by a flash of fire . Two figures , robed in white , with flash boxes , come from 1 e. , r. and l. , and follow Peleg and George , who are staggering and falling , to centre of stage . These figures use the flash boxes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag seizes George by the throat , holding him down . The subject upon the plank leaps from it and seizes Peleg in the same way .

Light green fire in wings at first appearance of the phantoms with the flash boxes . Picture of horror ! Back matter Curtain .
