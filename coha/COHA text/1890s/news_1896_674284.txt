txt Chairman Jones of the Democratic National Committee was so filled with indignation on his return last night to find the widespread reports of his intended resignation in favor of Gorman , and of the alleged deal to withdraw Sewall from the ticket , that this morning he instructed the following to be issued front the bulletin department : " Chairman Jones of the National Democratic Executive Committee returned from Washington last night and resumed work at headquarters this morning . Chairman Jones . characterizes the reports appearing in a Chicago morning paper to the effect that Senator Gorman will from now on be the I practical head of the National Democratic i Committee as an unfounded and malicious falSehood , knotin to be a falsehood ? when It was published . There is no foundation whatever for the report that Chairman Jones is to retire from the active management of the campaign ; that Mr. Bryan 's programme is to be changed ; that Mr. Sewall is to be withdrawn , and that the campaign in the Eastern States is to be abandoned . " In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington and printed in the Chicago paper alluded to are , Chairman Jones , says , a pack of lies , manufactured out of whole cloth " In Chairman Jones 's opinion , the only construction that can be placed upon the course of a certain Chicago newspaper in printing such base falsehoods is that these articles are the effect of their desperation and the desperation of the Hanna managers . Fortunately the public is no longer deceived by these wild statements , and anything that such papers may say is at once set down as a canard manufactured out of whole cloth . " Chairman Jones and the managers of the National Democratic campaign are perfectly willing to withhold all information so far as these headquarters are concerned from such newspapers , as it violates every principle of common courtesy and persists in printing statements which the originators well know are not true . Hereafter the promulgation of political news from these headquarters will be confined to those papers who are inclined to treat such information fairly and impartially.
