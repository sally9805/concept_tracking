A BUSINESS TRIP SEVENTY YEARS AGO . From the lournal of Chandler Holbrook , Edited by Herbert Elmer Mills . HE changes in methods of transportation , travel , communication and conduct of business , which have been part of our century 's industrial revolution , have been described and commented upon to a degree almost tiresome ; but in spite of all that has been said , perhaps many of us do not fully appreciate these changes , because we have no contact with the life of the past , no adequate comprehension of that which has been supplanted . The mere sight of a canal boat or an old stagecoach is often more instructive and suggestive than pages of *description and statistics . A few pages of Arthur Young illuminate and make real to us much that we are told by economic historians . There has recently fallen into my hands through the kindness of Mr. Henry Booth of Poughkeepsie a manuscript account of a business trip made seventy years ago , that is similarly instructive , because such a graphic picture of the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general economic development of the // country , and the condition of the factory operatives in the early part of this century , that are worthy of record . In 827-28 Chandler Holbrook of Poughkeepsie was sent by the Manhattan Fire Insurance Company of New York to make a survey of the textile factories in the greater part of the eastern United States . It might be assumed that he was not appointed without some qualifications for the work , and we have his own statement : " I have been somewhat acquainted with manufactures for eighteen years . " He continually shows himself a careful , independent and trained observer . The manuscript consists of his private diary and of copies of letters sent to the president of the company . The first record in his diary is October 27 , 1827 , and the last letter is dated October 3 , 1828 . " I left the city on the 26th of October , 1827 . Arriving at Poughkeepsie , I took my horse and gig and proceeded to Sharon in Connecticut . and in a direction through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut Rivcr to Northfield , where I crossed into New Hanipshire . Then , visiting every factory of any notoriety in that state , I proceeded to Saco in Maine , and on to Winthrop , about ten miles above Hallowell , on the Kennebec . Returning through Portland , Portsmouth and Boston , I then bent my way to Thompson in Connecticut and , pursuing a circuitous route , I again found myself in Worcester County in Massachusetts , and after a stay of several days among the manufactures there I again returned to Connecticut and by way of Hartford , New Haven , etc. , returned to New York . My next tour was up the east side of the Hudson to Troy and Schaghticoke , from thence to Bennington , Vermont , then to Glens Falls on the Hudson and down to Waterford , thence to Schenectady and westward to Oneida County , northward to Watertown and Browuville , then to Auburn and west to Rochester . From this place I went to the- falls of Niagara and returned to Rochester and , by way of Manlius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otsego County and down the west side of the Hudson through the counties of Greene , Ulster , Orange and Rockland to New York . " My last journey was direct to Baltimore , and after visiting all the factories within twenty miles of that city , which comprise all of any notoriety in Maryland , I returned and made similar examinations in Delaware and Pennsylvania . Except those in Trenton , I have seen none in New Jersey . Thus I have been through the various parts of the states of Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware and Maryland , and also crossed the Niagara River into Canada . By reference to my journal of courses and distances I find that I have travelled 4,628 miles . . . . The number of factories visited is of cotton 143 and of woollen 28 . " This itinerary is significant because it indicates roughly the textile manufacturing districts of the country at that time . His average daily journey , omitting Sundays , was only about sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been because of many delays on account of the weather and because of one or two short vacations . Still his usual day 's journey , when he was actually at work , was not over twenty or thirty miles . Nor was this due to idleness , for he was a most industrious worker , often writing until after eleven o'clock until eyes or candles gave out . The entire work done in the year could be done now in a few weeks , probably . Another inconvenience was the slowness of communication , waiting for directions being not infrequent and letters always uncertain in their arrival . Nearly all the journey was made by means of his own horse and gig . His accounts of the roads recall the emphatic language of Arthur Young 's Tours . " Intolerable rough , " " tremcn // dous bad , " " most awful bad " are common descriptions , while " Mechanicsyule to Waterford is the worst road I have ever seen , " and the road from Rochester , New York , to Whitesboro is " intolerably bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixtyeight miles between New York and Matteawan in February . Saturday , May 3 , " Left Onandagua and rode to Syracuse to breakfast . This being a rainy day , as usual for many days past , put up for the day . The constant bad roads for a long distance and hard driving have fairly beat out my poor little horse . He is as poor as a snake and his spirits have entirely failed him , in addition to which his back and breast are badly galled . The roads from Rochester to this place have been intolerable . " No wonder he wrote his employer : " Until there is a new coinage of words , I shall be unable to find any one that will convey any idea of the bad roads that I have had to encounter . " Occasional mention of a log road is made , and one near Rome , New York , was twenty miles long . Two or three times he took advantage of steamboats , as between Troy and Albany , Baltimore and Philadelphia , and Philadelphia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he mentions it casually , althou*gh possibly it was regarded as a somewhat dangerous means of conveyance , for he says : " After dinner took the steamboat for Philadelphia , where I arrived . " Once or twice , as at Morristoxvn , New Jersey , the canal boat was available . Holbrook took the stage from New York at six in the morning and reached Philadelphia at nine or ten in the evening ; but the return was not so expeditious , for he says : " Left Philadelphia for New York about eleven A. M. Before we arrived at Princeton we capsized our coach with seven passengers-one was badly hurt . Poor I again got my head bruised . We lodged that night at Princeton . Sunday at seven we left Princeton  --  the travelling very bad-did not arrive in New York until nearly eight P. M. " Accidents were perhaps not so serious as in these days of railroad travel , but they were frequent in proportion to the distance travelled . " My horse got loose and ran about a mile over a rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped by a man and brought back . The cushion was lost , but no other damage appears to have befallen us , that is , me and my horse and gig-no upsetting or breaking anything . My cushion was returned me in the evening . My expense for bringing back horse , gig and cushion , seventy-nine cents . " " In leaving Falmouth , it being very dark and slippery , I unfortunately capsized my gig and came with my head to the ground and was somewhat bruised and three slight cuts nearly through the skin on my temple . With much difficulty my horse was extricated , and not being able to ascertain how much damage was sustained and my head bleeding , I concluded to remain there for the night . . . . My capsize has caused me some pain and I have felt quite indisposed all day . My damage was in a pecuniary point but seventyfive cents , but how long I shall go with my head bound up is uncertain . I shall leave Maine without regret . " Town streets were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets of Lansingburgh , my horse suddenly started , and down came Pil Garlic ' where the mud was almost knee deep . Never was a more awful predicament seen . I was fiat on my back , my horse jumping , one foot in the stirrup , which soon came to the ground or rather the mud . Keeping fast hold the bridle , I supported myself , and found when I was fairly up I had not been fairly in the mud . I let my horse take care of himself and I sculled to the shore or rather pavement . " There were other hindrances . " In crossing the Androscoggin I was detained an hour and one-quarter , exposed to severe cold , and it was dangerous getting in and out of the // boat " ; and at another ferry in Maine , " it was very difficult to get on board the scow on account of the ice . " On January 21 he was not able to cross the Connecticut on account of floating ice . Occasionally he lost his way . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to a " publick house . " In York , Maine , he wrote : " This I can say with truth was the most indifferent public house I have found since I left home . " On January i6 he " put up at the United States Hotel " in Hartford , Connecticut , but the next day went to the City Hotel ; " the United States Hotel charges too high for me . One dollar twelve one-hundredths more than I paid for the same time and better accommodation in Portsmouth , N. H. " As already indicated , Mr. Holbrook was not fond of Maine . In one letter indicating his route , he says : " Into Maine and out of it as soon as convenient . " Again , " I can not hear of much in Maine , and am doubtful whether a journey below Saco will be of any advantage " ; and finally , " I am much pleased with your request to leave this part of the country , and shall start immediately . " But there was a brighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , notwithstanding the bad roads , he had made 650 miles in the four weeks past . Sometimes the roads were very good ' ' or quite tolerable . ' ' " I rode on to Wells , nine miles , the most of the way in view of the blue waves of ocean . At Wells is a beautiful view of the water , the waves rolling in upon the beach in the most sublime grandeur . A few fishing boats were riding apparently at ease . Fish are here caught in abundance-the finest of rock cod . From this place commenced a good road ; and from this place to Kennebunk , io miles , I rode in one hour . At Kennebunk I stopped and had an excellent dinner ; remained an hour and a half and left for Saco , distance ten miles , which I rode in one and a quarter hours . " " Left the Syracuse House-one of the most elegant hotels in the United States . The main building is four stories , standing on a corner of the intersection of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle . These are two stories . The whole is of brick painted white . On both fronts of the main building is a portico and railing for each story ; on the roof a handsome balustrade , and on the top of the building a cupola with a bell . The rooms are well furnished and the hotel well kept and charges moderate . " Courtesy to strangers seems to have been frequently lacking . In Newmarket , New Hampshire , " a gentleman observing I was a stranger accosted me at the door and invited me to walk into the reading-room opposite . I cordially accepted his invitation and tendered him my most hearty thanks for such unusual politeness . " But Mr. Holbrook seems to have had little time for pleasures . " This evening for a great variety was spent in social intercourse with an elderly gentleman " ; and after two months ' travel his diary says , " Passed an hour or two very pleasantly , being the only social hours I have spent with one exception . " But in February , while examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Was very politely requested to dine with Mr. Wild , who also requested my staying with him as long as I shall stay in the village . The same request was made by Mr. Baldwin , with whom I took supper . I have never met with such particular attention since I commenced my peregrinations . " At Watertown he " went for a short time into the ballroom , where was music and dancing " ; and at Rochester " went to the circus , where was a very full house . " In Windham , Connecticut , New Year s day , 1828 , he " in the evening went down to the ballroom for a short time , and was very politely received by the company , a good list provided for me , politely urged to partake of the supper and other refreshments . This was a large party , nearly one hundred // ladies being present . Wrote this night till one-half past twelve . " Two or three days after he writes : " Loaned my gig in the evening to a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms on which I lent him the gig were he was to kiss the pretty girl for me , ' which he promised faithfully to do , and produced a certificate to that effect in the morning . " Bnt the change in methods of travel was at hand , and by a happy coincidence our traveller was present on one important occasion marking the inception of railroad transportation . His account is of some historic interest . Baltimore , July 4 , 1828 : " Had a view of the splendid procession which was formed of all the mechanics , trades and occupations in the city to lay the corner stone of the Ohio and Baltimore Railroad . This was the most splendid procession ever witnessed in this city . . . . Among the rest and upon whom devolved the duty of laying the corner stone was the venerable Charles Carroll of Carrollton , now in his 92d year and the last survivor of the signers of the Declaration of Independence of these United States . His appearance does not indicate more than seventy years . The day passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order everywhere prevailed . Among other things which attracted attention were two wagons from the Union Cotton Factory loaded with the females from that establishment ; one wagon had sixty , and the other forty , females . The day was unusually fine , the evening was uncomfortably cold . Through the day and evening I saw but one individual intoxicated . " There are comparatively few political references , and these concern the fierce struggle then going on over protection . It will be remembered that this winter was marked by the consideration and passage of the " tariff of abominations , " which among other things doubled the duties on woollen goods . In a letter of the 21st of January , 1828 , he speaks of the " universal complaint of the unproductiveness of the woollen business . " On October 27 , 1827 , at Germond 's in Washington , Dutchess County , New York , he chanced upon a " Grand Convention " of " professing Republicans " for the nomination of candidates for the Assembly ; and on February i8 , 1828 , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of passing resolutions against a revision of the tariff and opposed to any further protection on woollen goods . It was attended by the relatives and friends of Mr. J. J. Oakley , representative in Congress , and if these personal friends were stricken from the roll of those who cried aye , * any man would say it was a word illegible convention . " In November , 1827 , he was refused information about a factory in Nashua , New Hampshire , " until after the tariff has passed , " and he was evidently considered a spy . The woollen industry generally was not flourishing , while the cotton industry was most prosperous . New cotton mills were going up , and some woollen factories were being changed to cotton . The cotton manufacturers evidently looked upon the protective system with less favor , for one of them in Peterboro , New Hampshire , complained that the commodities consumed by the 253 operatives in his mill paid the government a duty of $1,500 . On February 17 , services in memory of Clinton were held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poughkeepsie , where he chanced to be : " This day was appointed to deliver sermons on the death of Mr. Clinton , governor of the state of New York . Every pulpit was draped in mourning-black broadcloth sufficient to make a full suit for each clergyman , one Episcopalian , one Presbyterian , one Dutch Reformed , one Methodist , one Baptist . The services were performed in the Dutch church . In the morning , sermon from the Rev. Mr. Cuyler from this text : Hear the rod and him who bath ap // pointed it . ' In the afternoon by Dr. Reed of the Episcopalian church from this text : A time to mourn . ' In the evening by Rev. Mr. Welton of the Presbyterian church from this text : How are the mighty fallen ! ' or something like it-I do n't remember exactly . The church was crowded to overflowing during the three services . Mr. Hutchinson of the Baptist church made a prayer before and after noon , and Mr. Richardson of the Methodist church in the evening , " - after all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton . Incidentally we have in the diary descriptions of many places . Among the New England towns are " Portland , which is now the third in point of tonnage in the Union . Here appears an activity in business quite in contrast with the town of Portsmouth , New Hampshire . There are now about 14,000 inhabitants " ; Brunswick , Maine : " This appears a flourishing village , the college consisting of three handsome brick buildings at the west end of the town . This place carries on a considerable lumber trade , receiving their logs for 150 to 200 miles up the river . They have 28 saws in operation , but no other manufactory of any note . " Of more interest are brief accounts of some New York places . Watertown was growing rapidly , having increased thirty per cent in a year . In Sackett 's Harbor " everything has a temporary appearance . The place owes its present size to the late war , and the cause being removed which gave it birth , almost everything has the appearance of dilapidation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our enemy are now sunk in the lake or are in the more peaceful employment of the merchant in the carrying trade of the lake . The mammoth ship now on the stocks having a house over it was designed for 120 guns . The fine stone barracks near the shore of the lake make a very handsome and beautiful appearance and are undoubtedly the handsomest in the United States . " " Oswego will undoubtedly be a place of importance , being connected with the Erie Canal and also lying on the lake shore . " " Rochester far exceeds all that I have ever heard of its growth and business . There are here now about 13,000 inhabitants , eight places for religious worship , twelve fiouring mills having fifty run of stone , a great variety of other mills , etc . In 1812 only one house stood where is now the bustle and business of a city . ' ' Lockport " is increasing with wonderful rapidity and will shortly be a place of much importance . " Fort Niagara " is the oldest military post in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 130 years . There are here no troops stationed . The colonel Jewett has charge of the fort and the property belonging to the government . The situation is without a superior for pleasantness and one of the finest places for fishing and fowling in the country . There I was shown the magazine in which t is said Morgan was confined and murdered . ' The colonel is now indicted for being accessory to the doleful deed , ' of which in my opinion he knows nothing. ** " The immense quantity of salt here Syracuse manufactured is truly astonishing to one unacquainted with the business . The salt duty paid to the state last year was $i i6 , ooo . Apparently more than ioo acres are covered by the evaporating vats besides the immense number of boilers . " The Auburn state prison was established in i8i6 . " This is a splendid pile of buildings , displaying much neatness and good regulation . Nearly 6oo convicts are here at constant labor , carrying on all kinds of mechanical labor . The expense of feeding and clothing each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the weavers are employed for the Auburn factory at twenty-five cents per day , who make 6-4 and 7-8 bedtick and wove in March 3,700 yards of 6-4 and 4,200 yards 7-8 bedtick and 1,200 yards jeans . " // The evidence of this observer as to the manufacturing industries can be of value only cumulatively , reinforcing and perhaps supplementing other accounts . It concerns only the cotton and woollen industries , with incidental reference to others . But the materials for the economic history of the United States yet to be written are in some fields scant , and all that may add to our knowledge is worth preserving . Negative evidence is of slight value , and it is not safe to infer that there were no textile establishments outside of the districts visited by Holbrook , although it is probable that he visited nearly all the regions where cotton and woollen factories existed in any numbers . These were the southwestern corner of Maine , the Merrimac Valley , the Connecticut Valley to Bellows Falls , the northeast corner of Connecticut , the Hudson Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls along the line of the " old road " of the New York Central system , the region just east of Lake Ontario , the vicinity of Philadelphia and of Wilmington , Delaware , and especially the vicinity of Baltimore . The growth of Manayunk near Philadelphia had been very rapid . " The factories in the neighborhood of Baltimore are scattered in every direction . T is difficult to find two in the same direction . " " I have particular surveys of seventeen factories ( and one woollen ) in the neighborhood of Baltimore , several of which are very extensive in their operations . Those that I have particularly surveyed have in operation 45 ,  - -  032 spindles , 788 looms , and employ 2,500 persons . " Of others he took no survey , but from Maryland he writes : " I do not find that neatness of appearance and apparent comfort around the dwellings that I have frequently admired in my northern and eastern tour. ** Although the factories were all in the New England and Middle States , there was no such localization as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars capital , were scattered all over this region . Such concentration as did exist was due to the water power . Our textile industries passed through the same stages as the textile industries of England . The first effect of the introduction of machinery driven by water was to build up the factories away from cities where power could be had . Power could not be brought to the people in the towns , but the people could be taken to the waterfall . The introduction of steam has changed this tendency . One or two large factories are mentioned , as one in Ware , Massachusetts , with a capital of $525,000 and a product of 15 , ooo to i8 , ooo yards a week , and one at Saco costing $300,000 to $400,000 . As in England , the cotton industry developed the large factory much sooner than did the woollen industry . The woollen factories mentioned by Mr. Holbrook employed 40 to 70 hands . The cotton factories were generally larger . One is mentioned which employed 700 people , and those at Ware and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have employed soo and over 8oo respectively . Improvements in cotton machinery were being made continually , and the cost of a suit of machinery from the picker to the loom was from $14 to $25 per spindle . The output was very different in different factories . In one case about 5* yards per loom per week for " fine goods No. 32 to 40 " ; in another 130 per loom per week of No. 25 ; and in another case , fineness not given , 107 yards per loom weekly . The cotton factories ran about 35 to 38 spindles to the loom . " Silk manufacture is carried on in Mansfield , Connecticut more extensively than in any other town in the states . The last season has been unfavorable , and the quantity made is only 2,629 pounds . The j-nanufacture is wholly domestic , and one person can make about twenty pounds with sufficient worms and trees . Two hun- // 30 dred and sixty families are engaged in this business in a greater or less degree ; the most made by any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is reeled and spun in families and sold in quantities to merchants and others , who have it colored and prepared for market . The price of the raw silk is about $* per pound , but when finished it is not sold by weight . When well spun it is said to be superior to any other silk for strength . The culture of silk appears confined to the town of Mansfield . " Although Holbrook visited other factories , he says little about them and little about industrial processes . Mention is made of " an extensive nail factory " in Ramapo , New Jersey , " consuming about 900 tons of iron annually " ; and he describes a " method of bleaching or rather a finish of their white flannels by brimstone smoke . A room in the rear addition is appropriated to this . A small quantity of brimstone is put into an iron vessel of coals , which is then put into this room and the door closed to retain the smoke . " There is naturally a great deal of information about mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that this agent was then emphasizing the importance of certain points in modern mill construction . The most important information , however , is that upon the condition of the mill operatives . It brings additional testimony , but of a somewhat earlier period than usual , in support of the statement that , in marked contrast with contemporaneous English conditions , there was comparatively little cause for criticism of the treatment of factory hands in America . In Newmarket , New Hampshire , were " girls , well dressed , cultivating some flowers , and what was somewhat remarkable , one weaver was also knitting . " In a factory near Peterboro , New Hampshire , he notes in his diary : " Some flowers observed in the factory windows , a small library in the counting-room for the use of the persons employed , " and also in a factory in Peterbciro : " Here I found many flowers cultivated by the girls and some shrubbery round the building . A collection of valuable and interesting books for the use of the hands gratis . " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apparent exception that " they employ a large number of children , and they do not appear to be under the best regulation ; consequently their rooms are not in that clean order that I have been gratified in observing heretofore . " A letter written his employer at the conclusion of his tour gives a most interesting and valuable accoi*nt of what he had observed in this connection : " Presuming that a few observations relative to the moral character and condition of the manufacturers taken as a community will be gratifying to you , I herewith furnish you with that which from personal observation and inquiry I obtained while on my late journey for the Manhattan Fire Insurance Company . I regret that I did not at first make inquiries concerning Sabbath schools , but I have no memorandums of any until I commenced my journey in this state . While in New Hampshire I generally had conversation with the proprietors respecting the characters of the persons employed and of the tendency of their establishments to the advancing or otherwise of moral principles . On this subject I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable one . " In New Hampshire they do not employ many children , finding it more advantageous to have grown persons . These are mostly females of families from the neighboring towns . In many of the factories they require that the applicant shall produce satisfactory recommendations of a good moral character before employment is given . I have in some instances found very handsome libraries left in the counting-room , and any persons employed by the company have the privilege of // taking any book for perusal gratis . They also discountenance the use of ardent spirits and do not allow its use in the workshops . The attentions of the managers not only extend to the persons while employed , but also to the boarding- houses , in order that no persons of immoral habits should locate themselves on their premises and by bad example or precept lead others astray . " In the state of Connecticut I found many more children at work in the factories than I did in other states . This is partly owing to the vast number of factories in Massachusetts and Rhode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grown persons can not be obtained for the various branches of the establishments . There is another reason : poor persons with large families of children resort there for work and are anxious that as soon as a child is able to earn anything it should go into the mill , and as it affords some relief to the parents they are received ; but as far as I could learn , it is a kind of labor not desired on the score of economy by the proprietors . At Humphreysville I was told by Dr. Deforest that several of the girls in his employ had the preceding summer been engaged as teachers of schools in the neighboring towns and were also re-engaged for the coming season . In this state New York I have memorandums of twenty Sabbath schools where the children of the factories regularly attend ; some of them are exclusively for the factory children , others are in the neighborhood . Where the establishments are small and remote from a town or neighborhood , the number of children that could be brought together has been considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disposition manifested among the children to attend school , and in some instances it is a part of the contract that they must do so . At Manlius I was told that twenty of the girls in that mill were attending a school for writing only . In Pennsylvania I found the same attention paid to the subject , and also at several mills in Delaware . I have memorandums of six schools near Philadelphia , three on the Brandywine and six near Baltimore . At the Savage factory they have lately commenced their school . They have a large proportion of grown help , and a great many of these can not read or write . They are gratified in having an opportunity to go to school , and a very good effect is anticipated from this school . They have a large room very appropriately fitted up for public worship at this place , and clergymen of various denominations frequently officiate there . Many persons have deprecated the increase of manufacturing establishments in this country , believing it will have a tendency to vice and immorality . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every section of the country which I have visited and my personal observation , I do not hesitate to say that in a moral point of view the manufacturers will not suffer in comparison with any other class in the community , and if we look into our cotinty courts , magistrates ' offices , poorhouses , jails and penitentiaries , and say from whence do all these people come ? I say they do not come from our mannfactories . At the New York mills in Oneida County I was told by a person who had been in their employ for nearly two years that he had not heard a profane expression by any person in their employ durino that time . " That the condition of persons employed in our manufactories is benefited , is obvious to the most casual observer . If reasons were required , enough are at hand to satisfy the most scrupulous . The most prominent is constant employment and good wages . Casual employment leaves the person much leisure time , which requires occasional disbursements from previous earnings , and he soon finds more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are // pernicious , and ruin and poverty are too often found treading in the footsteps of those who depend on occasional employment . To see the benefit that has arisen to those who removed to our manufactories it would be necessary to have looked into their dwellings and around their premises previously to their removal . But it is sufficient now to look at those in similar situations to what these were in , to see the contrast . We see the manufacturers well fed and genteelly clothed . Often have I been told , when inquiring if all their children went to Sunday school , that a family had been lately employed whose children had not clothes suitable to appear in , but they would soon have them well clothed , when they would attend . I have frequently been told of persons who entered an establishment when first able to earn anything and who have constantly worked at the same establishment . Some have saved a few hundred , and some a few thousand dollars ; their education has not been neglected ; habits of industry are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society . These people are from what we call the laboring classes of the community , and it is with other laboring people that I compare them . " Much has been said relative to the characters of the females employed in the factories . The information I have obtained on this subject is highly gratifying . I have often been told of mills which have been in operation for many years , and there had never been an instance known of unchaste or improper conduct . There prevails among the females an ambition to sustain a good moral character . There is a watchfulness among them , and they quickly detect an immoral intruder when sometimes the proprietors have , been negligent or deceived . The introduction of the power loom by bringing more imme diately together so many girls of larger growth and the high wages that have been obtained have contributed more than any other thing to form their character for good conduct . The work is not laborious . From the wages received , being more than could be obtained by the hitherto ordinary occupations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taste . The occupation has been daily becoming more respectable and we find among the most deserving of the laboring community . I do not mean to say that these observations will apply universally , but generally as far as my observations have gone and from personal inquiry I believe they are correct . I have been somewhat acquainted with man ufactories for eighteen years , and am highly gratified in finding such great improvement in the appearance and condition of the operatives . . From all I have seen and heard , I am happy to say , and I say it with sincerity , that our manufactorieg as now conducted have a tendency to improve the morals of the laboring people , that they will be more industrious and more intelligent-consequently more happy and better citizens . Perhaps we can not better leave this traveller of seventy years ago than by quoting from his diary of January 2 , 1828 : " Forty-one years bygone , saith my mother , came I-poor I-into this troublesome world . My sun has past its meridian and is fast descending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for and very little to show on a settlement . Forty-one years gone never to return . Soon , very soon , it will be said , C.H. is dead ! and what does he leave to tell he ever lived ? Children he has none ! Several persons he esteems as his friends , a wife lie loves , parents he reveres , is thankful for favors received , and supplicates heaven for a continuance of its mercies .
