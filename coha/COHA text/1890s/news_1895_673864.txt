txt There are sufficient reasons to believe that the United States has a complete and definite understanding with England upon a joint course of policy and action in the far East , and that they stand together at Japan 's back . It is impossible to hint at the sources of this information , or , rather , suggestion , but they are such as to warrant entire faith , in my mind at At the beginning of the war , and for some months after , England was both commercially and officially disposed to take China 's side . Her interests seemed to point that way and led her inclinations captive . It was at this stage that she went to the length of trying to form a European concert to set a limit to Japan 's invasion and conquests , and announced in the Queen 's speech that Russia was in entire accord with this policy . Then came two developments which altered everything . Prince Lobanoff became the Czar 's official adviser in foreign affairs , and immediately set up an ideal of close relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same time the English Foreign Office began to get a lot of valuable information from shrewd observers on the spot , all pointing to the conclusion that its pro-Chinese attitude was a profound mistake . These agents agreed in saying , in substance , " There is no such thing as China ; it is a purely geographical expression ; it has no central force , no workable machinery radiating from a centre , no power to help itself or be helped by others ; its only conceivable destiny is to be ruled and developed slowly by Japan , as English rule is to develop India . The realization of this will clash with what Russia supposes to be her interests on the Pacific , but it can not possibly conflict with British interests ; therefore it will be good business policy for England to execute a sharp pirouette and turn up as Japan 's disinterested and powerful friend . " This excellent advice has been taken . It creates a situation which is not without perils and which is discussed with gravity and at length by the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is discussed the plainer it is that England has no reason to regret her position . As these dispatches pointed out at the time , Prince Lobanoff 's accession to power meant a potential revival of the Dreikaiserbund . He can command the acquiescence of Berlin and Vienna for whatever witain reason he wants to do , and they can rely upon him for a quid pro quo whenever their own affairs demand it . All three Emperors have in mind , primarily , the suppression of dengerous social movements , but their tacit partnership involves international politics as well . Hence , if Russia had really needed Austria 's adhesion in this matter of vetoing Japan 's treaty claims , she no doubt would have had it , but Austria is hardly even a name in the East , and such action would have only stirred up rows tin the already restless Parliaments at Vienna and Buda-Pesth , and so it was not worth while . German support is a different matter , and Prince Lobanoff secured it for the asking . France stood on another footing . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is England , but she wanted to figure in the thing as Russia 's natural and sworn ally , and it quite suited the Berlin book that she should be allowed to do so . Each day 's reflection , however , shoves the French people more clearly what a foolish position this false step has put them in . Except for two or three Ministerial organs , the whole Parisian press is turning against the thing . La Republique Francaise , La Justice , Le Figaro , Le Soleil , L'Univers , L'Autorite , and La Libert ? , differing infinitely in politics as they do , all stoutly oppose what M. Hanotaux has done . It may be accepted as certain that if Russia pushed matters to the point of force France would immediately withdraw from the whole affair . I think that this might be predicted with fair warrant of Germany as well , for domestic affairs in the Fatherland are running none too smoothly at best , and the spectacle of German powder burned and German blood spilled in order that Russia might expand her boundaries on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This feeling is especially strong , I am told , in the German Army , where great and pardonable pride is felt in the triumphs of the German-taught Japanese commanders and soldiers . There remain the questions , therefore , whether Japan will yield to Russia alone , for that is what it practically comes to , and , if not , whether Russia will try force . To the first question the bestinformed people here do not hesitate to answer no . It is confidently believed ' that Japan will stand by her guns . As to the second question , it is all in the air . Nobody can possibly tell what Russia will do ; still less is it possible to forecast what , in the event of Russian hostilities , the powers which are supporting Japan would do . The week has cleared up a great many uncertain points in this menacing imbroglio , but these problems go over as a legacy to the immediate future . Nothing has been more interesting in the whole course of this involved business than to note the entire confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their Foreign Office was acting for the best , even when they were most in the dark as to What was being done . The old notion of dividing furiously on matters of foreign politics which so dominated England in Disraeli 's time has quite disappeared , and that this has immensely strengthened England 's hands is at once apparent . No foreign critic so much as hints that there is a minority in England which may hamper the action of the nation as a whole , or , getting suddenly into power , ' change its course . One can not help wishing that our own people would see a useful lesson in this . Puzzled Englishmen are continually coming to me with extraordinary clippings from American papers which have founded in their minds the conviction that the whole American people is clamoring for an immediate declaration of war upon Great Britain . These were plentiful enough during the Hawaiian trouble , and they run tropical riot now under the impetus of the Nicaragua business . There is a certain humiliation in explaining that these really do not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score an advertising advantage for themselves by vilifying the English and accusing the Administration of basely truckling to them . When they reply that it may be good politics , but it is not quite good kinsmanship , you know that there really seems to be nothing to say . The success of the Nationalists in holding East Wicklow comes to the succor of the Ministry at a very desperate moment . The loss of Mid-Norfolk had been a heavy blow , and the Gladstonians were depressed enough to talk openly of scuttling the ship and going to the country in sheer despair . This Irish victory , won against exceptional odds , restores their courage a trifle , and they will stagger on under their burden . Lord Rosebery 's failure to get well begins to cause comment , some of it unpleasant Sir William Harcourt 's infatuation with his Local Option Drink bill is also a cause of much unhappiness . Liberal agents ascribe the loss of Norfolk to it , and gloomily predict that it will cost a score of other seats if persisted in , but Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to force it to a second reading , on which , it is said to be morally certain , it and the Government will be beaten . This Ministry has been beaten so often in anticipation , however , and somehow scraped through unhurt , that no prediction of specific disaster now wholly convinces people . Mr. Balfour has publicly dried Mr. Chamberlain 's tears and kissed him , and it is announced that the Tories and Ilnionistselove , each other more than ever . All the same , they . are not able to agree on a candidate at Leamington , and it will be plainly impossible for the Unionists to maintain a separate organization much longer . We are getting excited bulletins almost daily now of the progress of the silver agitation in America , and it is no doubt this , rather than any domestic concern on the subject , which decided the monometallists here to begin an active public propaganda . An association of prominent bankers , merchants , and economists is to be promptly incorporated , and the first of a series of meetings will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority in Parliament and in the financial circles was all right , there has been a disposition to let the bimetallist orators talk as much as they pleased , and merely give the public to understand that they were harmless cranks , whom it was not worth the while to take seriously ; but Balfour and Goschen are men of too much weight in the popular estimation to make that course any longer safe . They , in fact , have been increasing in number of followers , especially in Lancashire and other sections interested in the Indian trade , until it is high time the other side took sharp issue with them and threshed the whole question out If the present Government manages to remain in office , it is likely that the present year will witness a remarkable organization and reform of the British prison system . A departmental committee of the Home Office has been inquiring into the subject , and its unanimous report almost takes the most sanguine philanthropist 's breath away . The report declares the existing system to be inhuman and vicious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch . It urges that prisoners be better treated and fed , allowed a certain degree of intercourse with their fellows and with books , be taught trades or put intelligently at work ae- the craft that they know , and be helped when released . It also warmly recommends some plan for not imprisoning young offenders at all , and a special treatment for habitual drunkards . The report as a whole is an exceedingly important document in philanthropic literature , and , if Asquith and Herbert Gladstone continue in the Home Office , it is certain to bear fruit speedily . The trouble with any possible Tory successors would be not that they are less humane men , but that the matter has been made a party questimbby certain foolish Tory papers , who have been treating Sir Edmund Du Cane , the dismissed Surveyor General of Prisons , as a martyr to partisan rancor , whereas he was really put out because he was chiefly to blame for the mismanagement and savage barbarity which have marked the English prison administration under his long rule . The long-expected " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear today in two large volumes . About half of the contents was never published before , including much interesting Wordsworth correspondence , and also a curious episode of the poet 's early love affair with Mary Evans . The book will have great value for historians and students of the British literary groups of the first quarter of our century , but it is anything except pleasant ? general reading ; being chiefly a record of Graleridge 's sustained bad health and insufferably peevish and quarrelsome evil temper . Nearly $1,500 was paid yesterday at auction for the original manuscript of Gilbert White 's " Selborne , " containing numerous passages which were never printed . The manuscript till now has been in the possession of his family . An instructive contrast was afforded earlier in the week by the sale of seven of Wilkie Collins 's book manuscripts , which brought an average of a little over $2 each . The English are to have the first chance at a single volume " Trilby , " with pictures , in June , before which time Beerbohm Tree will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that these slow islanders will then reluctantly succumb to the epidemic whose ravages in America have so astounded everybody here , as they once before did in the case of " H. M. S. Pinafore , " but I doubt it . Herbert Spencer , in great travail of body , has been able to complete another installment of his vast work which is to begin publication in the next Contemporary Review under the title of " Professional Institutions , " and forming Part VII . of his " Principles of Sociology . " This is almost certainly the end , for he is said at last to recognize it as hopeless for him to attempt , in his broken health and old age , the part on " Industrial Institutions " with which he had thought to complete the whole . It seems not unlikely that the New Gallery , this year , will run the Royal Academy show very hard , if not beat it , in critical estimation . At any rate , its exhibition is far ahead of those of previous years . Sargent 's daring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , and already opinions are sharply divided about it . Bu'ne-Jones is in great strength , and so are Holman Hunt , Tadema , Watts , and other established notabilities , and La Thangue 's study of a cottage mother hearing her children 's evening prayers is undoubtedly one of the chief pictures of the season . Reports from Paris give rather mixed impressions of the first of Puvis de Chavanne 's panels for the Boston Library , which is exhibited at the Champ de Mars Salon . It is described as full of nobility and sweetness and grace of flowing line , but as also ridiculously drawn and wishywashy in color . There is a great number of foreign exhibitors there this year , among whom American and English artists have a full share of honors . It is said that we must abandon the pleasing and deep-rooted belief that Charles Martel was so called because he was a hammer of the Saracens .
