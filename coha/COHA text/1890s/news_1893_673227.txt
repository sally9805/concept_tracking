txt The rector of St. George 's contributes to the current number of the North American Review au interesting and suggestive article . which is the most deliberate and careful exposition that has been made of his plan for ameliorating the liquor traffic . Indeed , it is scarcely fair to describe as a plan what is but the suggestion of a lin 0 of policy founded on observation of the actual conditions of life in a great American town . When Dr. RAINSFORD undertook to expound his views in a public lecture , he had the misfortune of having them boisterously approved by gentleman who superfluously announced that he was in an advanced stage of intoxication . Necessarily support of this kind was regarded as very injurious , if not altogether fatal , to a scheme of temperance reform . and in the inextinguishable mirth aroused by the incident time merits of the subject under discussion were altogether lost sight of . An equal injustice has been done to Dr. RAINsronD by describing his project as a project for the establishment of " church saloons . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point . " Of course I do not advocate , " ho says , " nor have I over advocated , the churches , as corporations , going into the liquor business . This would be both absurd and impossible . " What Dr. RAINSFORD has to say upon the subject is , however , both true and pregnant . If we may suannarize it in our o-wn way , his point is that while the appetite for alcohol is so general as to be incapable of eradication by laws or regulations , it is nevertheless true that the saloon is the poor man 's club , and that the purpose for which he resorts to it is primarily social , and the drinking is with him incidental . With the saloon keeper , ou the other hand , as saloon keeping now goes , what is essential is the selling of the greatest number of drinks , and the social purpose that brings the majority of his customers is incidental . He does not provide for their social enjoyment , but leaves that to themselves . They can attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar and conversing , but if they fail to order drinks freely and frequently they are given to understand that they are net wanted . If food , non-alcoholic beverages , seats , music , and games were provided , there would be much more social enjoyment and much less drinking . The point is to establish poor men 's clubs in which the drinking is as incidental as it is in rich men 's clubs , and this can be done only by making it the object and interest of the keeper of the place to entertain his customers , rather than to induce them to drink . Everybody except the bigoted and impracticable prohibitionists whom Dr. R.A.ixsFonn dismisses with a , just statement of the irrelevancy of their efforts to any practical reform in the drink traffic . The practical reform , he insists , can be brought about only ' by the establishment of saloons in which drinking is as much an incident to the keepers as it is to those who frequent them . By such saloons he means saloons that are to be conducted on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none others are practicable . We do not wholly share the belief thus implied . It is possible that men who now pay the price of three or four drinks for the . privilege of an hour 's conversation with their friends , standing , in a warm and light and . decorated room , might be willing to pay something for that privilege with more comfortable accessories , in a place in which food . and music and games were also provided , and to which their wives and daughters were also admitted . This is a fair description of the old-fashioned German beer garden or beer cellar , and we admit that the gradual supersedence of those institutions by the mere " barroom " is discouraging to the belief that they can be sustained upon the principle of supply and demand . But the experiment of reviving and . extending it is very well worth trying , and the worst that could happen in case of its failure would be that the philanthropic projectors would have to meet a comparatively small deficit . But , in any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a public benefit if Dr. RAINSFORD 'S appeals insure the trying of it on an extensive scale .
