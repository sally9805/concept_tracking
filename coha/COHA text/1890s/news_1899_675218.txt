txt The anti-imperialist campaign at home has fortified the Filipinos in their resistance to our troops and our authority . The writings and speeches of the active opponents of the Administration 's policy have been eagerly seized on and skillfully employed by AGIIINALDO 'S agents to create the belief among his followers that if they keep up the fighting a little while longer , harass our troops constantly , and kill as many of them as possible , they will attain the objects of the war and their independence through the effect of the rising anger of the American people in compelling the Administration to withdraw its forces and grant the native demands . It is no longer possible to doubt the truth of this charge against the antiimperialists . The testimony of Mr. JouN BARRETT before the Boston Chamber of Commerce supports it . He declares from personal knowledge and observation that the Filipinos are encouraged to hold out by the news they get from this country . It leads them to believe that the greater part of the American people look upon the war as unprovoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the demand of the people will shortly be withdrawn . From Admiral DEWEY down t ! r officers deplore the giving of this substantial aid and comfort to the enemyby our own people . The Independenela , the newspaper organ of the Filipinos , prints reports of meetings held or alleged to have been held in this country at which the war was denounced , and says that if the fighting is continued until the neat Presidential election there will be a chanae which will cause the troops to hi , withdrawn . We do n. , : s however , that anything can be done or need ho done about this state of affairs . It is unfortunate : it is deplorable . The work our s , ildi. ' re have to do in those dreadful swamps ought not to is- nI it more ditli , ? ult and perilous because some of their fellow-citizens at home sympathize with their enemies and not with them . It is shocking that officers and men of our army must be killed in a war that might have ended long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston and elsewhere who disagree with the Administration . Hut under no theory of government that has ever been entertained in this country can a remedy be found for the evil . It is a condition , not a theory , that confronts Mr. . He must carry on the war in Luzon as he carried it on in Cuba . with the American people exercising their privilege of entire freedom of opinion and of speech . Some of them violently denounce his policy , and their denunciations aid the enemy , no doubt . But the President can not turn to Mr. ATKINSON and say : " It is your fault that I have so far been unable to put clown these insurgent natives . " Criticism , blame , denunciation , and hard names at home are a part of the known conditions under which he has to carry on the war . His preparations should be adequate to overcome the native resistance even when augmented and sustained by the open sympathy of the antiimperialists . It pay be argued that when the forces of the Nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which there can be no withdrawal without disaster and disgrace , good and patriotic citizens should cease their opposition and no longer embarrass the Government by factious activities . THE TrAtEs is of that opinion . The course of Mr. CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS and Mr. CHARLES J. BoNAPARTE , both of whom are convinced opponents of " expansion , " in refusing to engage further in the work of the AntiImperialistic League , is honorable and ? high-minded . We wish it might be followed by other members of the league . But the minds of all men do not work in that way in this free country . The abolitionists were warned that if they continued their agitation they would surely plunge the country into civil war . They paid no heed to the warning , not even those among them who must have known that war was the end of their labors , not even when they saw war close at hand . Their conviction that they were right , added to the fact that they actually were right , confirmed them in the resolve never to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-imperialistic agitation doubtless burn with the fervor of the same conviction and yield to an impulse that they can not resist and believe to be divine . It is the American way . The spirit of fanatical devotion to an idea in the face of majority opinion probably works more good than harm in the long run . At any rate , we must reckon with it , for it can not be controlled . It would be better that the Philippines should be the scene of a ten years ' war , or that their traublesome people should be left to cut each other 's throats at their own bloody pleasure , than that freedom of opinion should be ain.:1-dged in this Republic . President , Ey knows very well that the vast majority of the American people will give their firm support to his policy of restoring order an-.1 fulfilling our National obligations in tLe Philippines . He must endure the crit ; , cisms of those who dissent and overco-n , e the embarrassments they cause . He is not the first President to be thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars that were called wicked by a considerable part of the people , and carried them on successfully .
