txt The result of the city elections just held in the West moire than confirms the evidence of local elections previously held in the East that a decided political reaction has already set in . Such a reaction was inevitable in any case , but if the leaders of the party which carried the Presidential election last November had been sagacious , they would have done all they could to guard against it , instead of pursuing a course which was sure to stimulate and accelerate it . Some degree of reaction was inevitable because an expectation was raised with regard to improved conditions as the result of the election which could not be realized , even by the most judicious course on the part of the successful party . This expectation was unduly excited during the campaign , but it could not have been prevented , and the conseauent disappointment could not be avoided . But it was possible to avoid the irritation , the exasperation , that has produced such a marked reaction in such a short time The cause of it is not far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party victory in the strict sense of the term . It was won by the Republican Party with the help of Democrats who resarded the maintenance of the currency on a sound basis as paramount to all other issues and who believed that the . , : aith of the Government and the stability of our whole monetary system were at stale . Their help was welcomed , and it was effective . The issue upon which they were seriously at variance with the Republican Party was thrown into the background , and men want to the polls for sound money and not for the protective tariff . The Democrats without whose votes MCKINLEY could not have been elected , and a large proportion of the Republicans as well , deprecated a tearing up of the tariff and a renewed agitation in behalf of high protection . Nothing was so sure to beget a violent reaction as abandoning the reform of the currency and taking up the cause si high protection and forcing it through ongress at this time . Political sagacity dictated that such a course be strenuously avoided and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust and uncertainty , and encourage the revival of industryand trade , which was struggling to begin . Instead of taking the course calculated to retain the strength which had been brought to the party by the sound-money sentiment , the Republican leaders at Washington and to some extent at State capitals , and especially at the capital of this State , iave used the advantage of a victory which was largely non-partisan to carry out designs of the most partisan character . It is needless to specify , but that which is embodied in the Dingley Tariff bill is enough in itself to account for the political reaction . ? The situation Is greatly to be regretted because it is full of peril . Men are voting against the Republican candidates in /war elections out of disappointment , resentment , and distrust , and not because CA , Democratic Party , which went so outrageously wrong last year , shows any disposition to go- right now . There is as yet no substantial promise of Democratic regeneration , and the danger is that the evil forces which have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havoc with the interests of the country in the future . The Republicans in Congress and at Albany have been doing everything in their power to throw the control of affairs into the hands of their opponents regardless of their fitness to exercise it . We may cherish a hope that the better and wiser part of the Democratic Party will gain direction of that organization , we may revive the long-deferred hope thatthe two old parties will go to pieces and the better part of both be drawn into a new organization supported by the sound sense and conscience of the country , or we may pray that something will happen to prevent Dingleylsm from putting us at the mercy of Bryanism , but in the meantime our towns and cities are in danger of suffering from the consequences of the political reaction . It reanimates party feeling and party conflicts , and makes doubly difficult the effort to rescue local government from the ' curse of partisan control . The bill defeated a promising effort to secure a reform municipal government in this city in 1890 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tammany this year it will be mainly due to Plattisra at Albany and Ding-leyism at Washington
