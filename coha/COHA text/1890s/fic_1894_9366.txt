TO " MUMSY " TO WHOM I OWE EVERYTHING FROM THE LITTLE BEGINNING OF MY LIFE NEW YORK 1897 Main text I Divorce . Tom Barnes , age ten , whose mother , Mrs. Barnes , having divorced his father , her second husband , has since remarried , and is now Mrs. Jenley . Claire Worthing , age seven , whose mother , Mrs. Worthing , having divorced her Father to marry the divorced Mr. Barnes , is now Mrs. Barnes . Scene , a Fashionable Dancing School in New York . A quadrille has been announced . Master Barnes goes up to Miss Claire and bowing somewhat stiffly , mumbles some not altogether intelligible words . Miss Claire , sliding down from her chair , says " Thank you , " with perfect composure and a conventional smile , as , taking his arm , they choose a position in the dance . Tom . Tom . Shall we stop here in this set ? Claire . Claire . No ! Becky Twines ' dress would ruin mine . And she made her maid give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what I was going to wear . But I do n't care . I heard mama say , yesterday , her mother , in spite of all her money , had n't been able to buy her way into several houses . I do n't think she ought to have been invited to join our dancing class at all . When people buy their way into other people 's houses like that , how do they do it do you suppose ? Does the butler sell tickets at the door , do you think ? Tom . Tom . Perhaps so ! Butlers look like that . My ! I 'd jolly like to be a butler ! ( They have moved on to another set . ) Shall we stop here ? Claire . Claire . Oh , no , not here ! Teddy Jones always mixes us up . He treads on our toes . Tom . To m . Yes , and squeezes the girls ' hands , too . Claire . Claire . Oh , that we do n't mind ! Would you like to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer it herself . ) Tom . Tom . No , let 's dance . Come on , this is a good place . Claire . Claire . As you please . Do you like kissing games ? Tom . Tom . ( Red in the face . ) No ; do you ? ( He does . ) Claire . Claire . Oh , I do n't mind . ( An embarrassed pause . ) Tom . T om . I like football and those kind of games . Claire . Claire . They are all very well for boys . But I do n't much care for games myself , and , besides , I do n't have the time . Tom . Tom . What do girls do with themselves all the time ? Claire . Claire . Oh ! I have my lessons , and I walk out with my maid every morning , and I dress three times a day , and then I have visits to make on other little girls . Tom . Tom . You 've got a new father , have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married two weeks ago . Tom . Tom . How do you like him ? Claire . Claire . Oh , very much ! Tom . Tom . You take my word for it , he 's a brick . I know ! He used to be my father once . The music starts up , and the couples bow . II Birth Elsie , age 6 . Teresa , age 8 . Bob , age 7 . ( They are sitting on the steps of the large piazza of a beautiful country house , the two little girls affectionately close , the boy at an awkward distance . There has been a pause in the conversation , which the boy breaks . ) Bob . Bob . We 've got a new baby at our house ! ( Splendid effect ! ) Elsie , Tteresa . Elsie , Tteresa . ( Together . ) Oh ! ( Their eyes are suddenly bright and their faces glow with a sort of awed curiosity and pleasure , not unmixed with envy . ) Elsie . Elsi e . What kind ? Teresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? Bob . Bob . ( Proudly . ) A boy , of course ! ( The two little girls ' faces fall for a second , and they are silent , but not for long . ) Elsie . Elsi e . Of course there have to be boys sometimes . Teresa . Tere sa . Yes , to make a change . Elsie . Elsie . Is n't it funny where babies come from ! Bob . Bob . Yes , you find them in cabbages . Elsie . Elsie . Oh , no ! They come down in rainstorms . Teresa . Teresa . No , no ! They come out of the flowers . Bob . Bob . Stuff ! Elsie . Elsie . They do come from the skies , because you know the stars are little babies waiting to be picked . Teresa . Teresa . I thought the stars were the places where God put his fingers through . Bob . Bob . They are n't any such thing ; they 're the gold tacks that fasten on the carpet of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have eleven babies , because I have eleven favorite names , and I shall have them all at once , so they can have nice , happy times playing together , and there wo n't have to be any horrid older brother and sister , always getting the best of everything . Teresa . Ter esa . And I 'll tell you what ! I 'll have eleven children too , to marry yours . Bob . Bob . No , I 'll marry one of them . Elsie . Elsie . No , you must marry one of us . Bob . Bob . Which one ? Elsie . Elsie . Well , I think it would be best for you to marry me and be father for my eleven children . I want them to have a father . I love my father . Teresa . Teresa . Yes ; but then who 'll be a father to my children ? Elsie . Elsie . Yours can be sort of orphans ; they need n't ever have had any father . Teresa . Teresa . ( Approaching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Let 's play Indians , and I 'll scalp you two girls ! Elsie . Elsie . No , that 's too rough . We 'll play husband and wife . Bob and I will get married , and , Teresa , you must be the minister and a bridesmaid . ( They retire into the house , where , with the aid of a wrapper , a night dress , a bouquet , and a black mackintosh , the ceremony is properly performed . ) Elsie . Elsie . Now we 'll have a little girl baby , and ( to Teresa ) you must be it . Teresa . Teresa . No , I want to be the wife now , and you be the baby . Elsie . Elsie . No , I 'll be the husband , and let Bob be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the baby ! Teresa . Teresa . Anyway , it is n't polite for a little baby to come right away like that . They never do . Elsie . Elsie . That 's so ; you have to wait till the news that they want one gets up to the skies . III Death Teddy and Elsie are in the drawing-room , which is shadowy and sad with the drawn curtains . The children speak in half whispers , and with an air of importance . Teddy . Teddy . It 's going to be in here . Elsie . Elsie . Is n't it awful . ( Sobs . ) Teddy . Teddy . Papa was a brick ! Elsie . Elsie . ( Sob . ) Now he 's an angel . Teddy . Teddy . ( Thoughtfully . ) Do you really think papa would like being an angel ? Elsie . Elsie . Everybody likes to be an angel . Teddy . Teddy . I do n't . Elsie . Elsie . O Teddy ! Teddy . Teddy . It sounds stupid to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any office there , and what 'll he do without an office ? Elsie . Elsie . Is n't it awful . ( Sob . ) Poor papa ! Teddy . Teddy . ( Swallowing a lump . ) Do n't cry ! There is a slight noise overhead . Elsie . E lsie . O Teddy ! What was that ? Teddy . Teddy . ( Trembling . ) Do n't be afraid ! ( He puts his arm comfortingly around her , and they sit in a huge arm-chair together . ) Elsie . Elsie . What is it like to be dead . Teddy . Teddy . It 's like school all the time , never letting out , and no recess . Elsie . Elsie . ( With another sob . ) Poor papa ! Are you afraid of him now ? Teddy . Teddy . No  --  Elsie . Elsie . Do you want to go up and see him ? Teddy . Teddy . No . That is n't him anyway upstairs ! Elsie . Elsie . Yes , it 's him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you believe it ? Say , if that 's true , how did his soul get out ? Elsie . Elsie . I 've thought of that . This is what I believe : When people die , God kisses them , and their soul comes right out of their lips to God 's . Teddy . Teddy . I 'll never play be dead with you , anymore . Elsie . Elsie . No , I do n't want to , either . Teddy . Teddy . God might think I really was dead , and I might lose my soul . Elsie . Elsie . You ca n't make believe with God . Teddy . Teddy . That 's so ; I forgot . I say , Elsie , I 'm never going to be wicked again in all my life . Elsie . Elsie . Nor I. Teddy . Teddy . Oh ! girls never are wicked . I believe when we die Death comes along and pulls us by our feet ; that 's why our souls go out . They 're afraid of Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . ) Teddy . T eddy . Do n't be afraid ; I wo n't let him catch you . Elsie . Elsie . Poor mama , she cries all the time . Teddy . Teddy . And she wo n't eat . Elsie . Elsie . I know where there are some little cakes . Teddy . Teddy . ( Eagerly . ) Could you get them ? Elsie . Elsie . Not alone . I 'm afraid . Teddy . Teddy . I 'll go with you . ( They get down out of the big chair . ) Do we go to school the next day after it ? Elsie . Elsie . Yes ; and wear all black . ( Sobs . ) Poor Teddy . Teddy . ( Choking . ) Do n't cry . Elsie . Elsie . You 're crying too . Teddy . Teddy . No , I ai n't ! ( Crying . ) ( She kisses him . He is comforted , but very much ashamed . ) Elsie . E lsie . Do you think we can go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teddy . I do n't care about circuses now . Elsie . Elsie . Neither do I. I do n't want to go anyway . Let 's find the cakes . Teddy . Teddy . And then we 'll make a coach out of the chairs , and you 'll drive me four in hand . They go out of the room smiling .
