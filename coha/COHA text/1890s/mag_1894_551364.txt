or eight years ago the Sultan of Morocco sent a select detachment of his high officials on a mission to the Court of Spain .

Everything possi ble was done for the entertainment of the visitors , and all the sights Madrid has to offer were shown to them in turn . One day the Spanish hosts thought they would surprise and mystify their African visitors . XVith much flowery prelude they introduced them to a telephone in one of the government offices . To the chagrin of the Spaniards , the chief of the Moors re*marked as soon as he saw the instrument , " Oh , I have had a telephone in my house at Tangier for more than a year ! " Nothing more was 4S1 THE TELEPHONE OF TO-DAY . By Ferber !

During the past year many reviews have been made of the period from the Centennial to the XVorld 's Fair . In all industry there is nothing that marks that period so signally gs the rise and extension of commercial telephony . At the Centennial th , e telephone was a scientific wonder ; at the World 's Fair it was exhibited as a necessity of industrial and social life . At the Centennial it would speak from one room to another in the same building ; at the World 's Fair the rooms were a thousand miles apart . At the Centennial you could tell what the telephone was saying if you knew beforehand what it was going to say ; at the World 's Fair the voice of the speaker in New York came as loud and clear as if he had been at your elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fifteen years ago there was not a telephone exchange in the United States . To-day there are nearly fourteen hundred exchanges , employing ten thousand persons , and furnishing service to nearly a quarter of a million of telephone subscribers . Each subscriber uses the telephone fifteen to sixteen times a day on an average , so that every working day there are nearly two million conversations held over telephone exchange lines in the United States . How is it all done ? The question is not at all an easy one to answer without becoming technical , and consequently obscure . In the large cities , like Ne* York , Chicago and Boston , which each boasts of nine or ten thousand subscribers and eight or ten exchanges , the telephone systems are the most complicated collections of wires and apparatus possible to imagine . The impression made on the layman when he inspects them is that the wonderful part of it all is , not that the results are sometimes unsatisfactory , but that there ever can be obtained any satisfactory results at all . If you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have surely used one at some time or other , will follow me on a little journey from your telephone to the one at the other end of the line , you will see many strange things . We shall look into dark boxes and damp cells ; we shall climb over the housetops and skim through the air ; we shall crawl into vaults and manholes , creep under the streets , and even dive beneath the rivers ; we shall wander through the mysterious halls of " central , " so often heard of but so seldom seen . We shall bring up finally against a little iron plate , somewhat larger than a silver dollar and a good deal thinner than a dime . And if then we are left with any power to reflect , we shall reflect with astonishment that the whole vast array of ingenious appliances depends on the production of an imperceptible trembling , an infinitesimal vibration of that little iron plate . That was what Prof. Bell did : he made a little iron plate tremble . But it trembled as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the electrical transmission of articulate speech . The principal parts of the standard telephone set are the transmitter and the receiver . The transmitter converts the sound waves produced by the voice into electric waves , and sends them out to the line . The receiver takes up the electric waves and converts them back into sound waves , which are delivered to the ear . Every telephone subscriber has also a bell for calling the central office . When the receiver is hanging on the hook , the transmitter battery is cut off and the bell is connected to the line . The subscriber can then either ring up " central " or be rung up by " central . " When he turns the crank at the side of the bell case , the subscriber revolves a little dynamo , consisting of a coil of fine wire turning within the influence of powerful steel magnets . Revolving the coil causes currents to be set up in it , and these will ring a bell at the other end of the line , or will give a signal at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook , both it and the transmitter are automatically connected to the line and the battery is brought into play . Having explored the subscriber 's telephone set , let us journey on to the exchange . For a short distance we may go , via two copper wires , over the housetops or along a pole line ; but only for a very short distance , for in a big city we shall , very shortly after leaving the subscriber 's station , have to dive below the streets and travel underground the rest of the way . We shall find in a two-inch leaden pipe a hundred fine copper wires , each covered with a wrapping of specially prepared paper . The covered wires are taken in couples and twisted together , a twisted pair of wires being used for each subscriber 's line . This twisting is done to neutralize the effects of induction . If straight wires were used , the currents would stray from one line into another , and whenever several subscribers having neighboring lines were talking at the TERMINALS OF UNDERGROUND CABLES . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hum of conversation in a crowded room , only more so . The cables are drawn into iron pipes laid under the streets . They radiate from the exchanges in all directions and terminate in all sorts of places , - inside buildings , on housetops , on poles , wherever a number of subscribers can be reached by short lengths of separate wires . The end of every cable is enclosed in an air-tight box , called a cable-bead . Each head is l ) ierced at the sides for a hundred ears , and to the inner end of each ear is attached , before the box is sealed up , its corresponding nerve , or cable conductor . The wires to the subscribers ' stations can then be attached to the outer ends of these metal ears or binding posts , whenever a connection is required . Telephone cables are delicate and expensive things . They require extreme care in manufacture and in maintenance . Any mistake in twisting and laying up the wires will give rise to trouble when the cable is put to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contact with moist air will quickly ruin a cable , for the paper insulation absorbs moisture with avidity . Materials having waterproof properties , such as rubber and gutta-percha , can not be used for insulating telephone cables , for reasons too technical to state here . The influence such materials have is to deaden and choke the delicate voice currents . This effect , present to a certain extent in cables of all classes , is the great obstacle to telephoning underground to any distance , and especially to telephoning through underground cables . In spite of every difficulty , however , the art of ma nu f ac turing telephone cables has made rapid strides , and the use of them has developed enormously during the past five years . In Boston , Brooklyn , Chicago , New York , Philadelphia and other large cities there are many hundreds of miles of conduit occupied by telephone cables . York telephone subways there are about 250 miles of cable in use , containing upwards of 30,000 miles of copper wire . These cables represent an investment of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restricted and cheerless quarters they occupy under the streets is a quarter of a million . At the central office buildings the cables all lay their heads together in one ( lepartment , called the terminal room . This is one of the great nerve centres of In the New ***-*1 /1 // the system , only surpassed in complication by the switchboard itself . Thousands and tens of thousands of wires , spreading out beyond in every direction , are here massed together . Opposite them are thousands of others which lead to the switchboard . The two sets must be connected together , and there is nothing very difficult about that , if that were all . But it is not all . At this pointthe junction of the line wires with the switchboard wires - every line must be available for testing , to " locate " defects ; every line must be provided with apparatus to protect the delicate coils and appliances in the exchange from the inroads of lightning and of other powerful foreign currents ; and further , every connection must be arranged systematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or discontinued or a new connection made . The medium by which these conditions are obtained is a large iron frame , on one side of which all the cable wires are terminated , and on the other side all the switchboard wires . The wires on each side are brought to serried rows of little metal clips . A pair of clips on one side belongs to a pair of wires which end at some point perhaps a mile or more away from the exchange ; a pair on the other side corresponds to a certain indicator or " drop , " as it is called , in the switchboard . ito coml ) lete the circuit  --  to join any given subscriber 's line to any given number in the switchboard-a pair of wires is run through the framework , and the ends are connected to the required pair or clips on each side . Complete records are kept of the position of every wire , and the men in charge can l ) ick out at once the line of any subscriber whenever it is necessary to inspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into trouble , it can be tested from the crossconnecting frame in both directions , - back to the switchboard and out toward the subscriber 's station . At every exchange there is an official called the " wire chief , " whose special duty is to overlook the making of connections between the subscribers ' lines and the switchboard , to DI5TR BUFf N ( ; If()A RI ) . // inspect the wires and to test them electrically , in order to determine the position of any defect that may occur in a subscriber 's line or instruments . The wire chief sits at a special desk from which wires run to various parts of the system , and he is provided with electrical instruments with which to make tests on lines that develop " trouble . " He is the ambulance surgeon of the telephone plant , and his wires give him the advantage of being truly ubiquitous . He receives complaints and reports of " trouble , " and enters on special slips every " trouble " reported or discovered . These slips are handed to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding it , apply the proper remedy ; they then enter an account of what they found and what they did , on the slip , and return it . In this way a close and comprehensive check is kept on the operation of the telephone plant , which , on account of its complexity and of the number of small parts that go to make it up , is peculiarly liable to trifling but troublesome defects . Returns are made up periodically from the " trouble slips , " and these foi*m a continuous record of the efficiency both of the plant and of those immediately in charge of it . From the terminal room it is but a step to the operating-room. the portion of the system of which the subscriber hears most - " central " - manifested to the public only through a voice . Although to the telephone subscriber " central " is a voice and nothing more , when we enter the actual realms whence the voice emanates we find an imposing array of mechanism and humanity . Even to those most familiar with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wonder and mystery . There is aroused within one something more than mere interest in a technical appliance , as one watches rows of young women pressing little *brasstipped pegs into little brasslined sockets , and tries to conceive that spoken words are trembling at the tips of those little brass pegs , - electrified words , imprisoned for an instant in a metal track and eager to travel on through the sinuous wires that extend beyond , to emerge again into the air . It is difficult to imagine that that inert erection of wood and brass and iron is absolutely alive with speech ; that coursing through the masses of copper threads behind are hundreds of conversations of talkers who are scattered near and far , up town , down town , across t , he river , in the next state , on the sho ries of Lake Michigan . If an old switchboard could recount some of the talks it has assisted swITcHBoARD - FRONT . // at , what strange tales could it not tell ! If the plugs and cords and the switches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - never quite silent in a city telephone exchange , but quiet enough for intimate confidences , - what strange comments might they not make on human nature ! The modern telephone switchboard is really a number of switchboards joined together in one system . An upright framework of wood and iron supports in front myriads of little switches and thousands of little indicators , whose shutters fall in response to the current sent by the subscriber when he rings . Along the whole length of the switchboard runs a narrow shelf or table , which holds the plugs and cords for making connections and the keys or push buttons by which the operator rings up the subscriber and connects her own telephone in the circuit . The wires by which the subscribers are connected to the switches and indicator drops are run behind the switchboard , out of sight . The little switches are called spring-jacks or , more generally , simply " jacks . " They are little tubular sockets with a brass lining for part of their length , and two little springs to which the wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springjacks of two lines for a conversation is made by means of a cord containing a pair of wires and terminating at each end in a plug with brass shank and tip . When a plug is inserted in each springjack , contact is made between the shank of the plug and the socket and between the tip and one of the little springs of the jack ; the two lines are thus made into one continuous line through the cord . Watch a single operator and see how she makes a connection . An indicator shutter falls , disclosing a number . She picks up a plug and thrusts it into the proper spring-jack . The indicator shutter or " drop " flies back to its normal position as if by magic . At the same moment the operator presses down a little cam lever , - the listening key which connects her own telephone set with the paiticular cord she is using . She is then in communication with the subscriber who has called , and inquires , " What number ? " He gives the number . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five two , Cortlandt . " She picks up the other cord of the plug and , spying out among the compact rows of spring-jacks above the one belonging to 4752 , taps the plug on its socket . This is a reconnoissance . If 4752 is already talking to some one else , the operator gets a loud click in her head telephone . That means that 4752 is " busy , " and the subscriber who has called for him is told iWl ' 1CI-tBUAKD - BACK . // so . It is the privilege of telel ) hone sul ) - scribers to believe that no other telephone subscriber can possibly be " busy " when they want to talk to him . They generally know for a fact that he is not , and so they seldom believe the operator 's report . The operator , however , merely rel ) eats what the switchboard tells her ; and the switchboard , being a mechanical ( levice , not a human being , is eminently truthful . The widespread disbelief in the " busy " report is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switchboard tells the operator that a subscriber is " busy , " or , rather , that two subscribers are busy , - for that a subscriber is busy in the telel ) honic sense means that be is talking with another subscriber , - is rather an interesting point . An analogy will explain it better than a technical description . Imagine a business man open to receive calls from nine or ten thousand people . He has at his office one special door guarded by a special attendant , who , on signal from him , brings immediately into his presence any one of the nine thousand peol ) le . To make it convenient also for them to reach him when they call on their own initiative , there are thirty or forty other doors by which bis office can be entered . When receiving a caller the occupant of the room with the many doors wishes to be alone with him , so matters are arranged that after a caller has entered by any one of the doors the act of closing it causes all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lisengaged any one of them can be opened . Under this system it naturally happens that the doors are often locked when a caller tries at one of them . Then he has to call again . In the telephone exchange the spring-jacks correspond to the doors . Each subscriber 's line is connected to a number of springjacks . At one his calls are answered and the connections he asks for are made . The others are to enable connections to be made with his line by operators all along the switchboard . When once a connection is made , every spring-jack on the line is in a state corresponding to the locked doors ; if touched with a plug by an operator who wants to connect , it will give a sharp click in her head telephone . POWER PLANT . // That click means " busy " just as plainly as a locked door does . If no click sounds in her head telephone when the operator touches the plug to the spring-jack of the number wanted , she simply pushes the plug in and calls up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to an electric generator kept constantly g&amp;ing . When the answer comes the operator tells the calling subscriber that his correspondent is on the line , or rings him up if he has hung the receiver on the hook after giving the call . ( The experienced telephone subscriber keeps his receiver to the ear after asking for a connection , and so often saves himself much valuable time . ) The connection is then complete , and the operator cuts herself out of circuit and is free to attend to other calls . Each operator has from ten to fifteen pairs of cords and plugs , and can therefore put up as many connections at once . To each pair of cords is connected a special indicator drop called the " clearing-out drop . " This is thrown by the ring-off signal , when subscribers make it , and the falling of the clearing-out drop gives notice to the operator to take down the connection and so disengage the two lines . Often neither subscriber rings off ; and then the operator has to " listen in " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , to discover if talking is still going on or not . If she hears nothing she asks , " Are you through ? " and , getting no reply , concludes that you are through and takes down the plugs . As many subscribers fail to ring off ; operators frequently have to listen in , and occasionally they strike a pause in the talk and ask , " Are you through ? " just at the moment when you have something very important half-way between your brain and the transmitter . Of course that is exasperating , and you are an exceptionally even-tempered man if you do not let fly an enthusiastic remark of a tenor quite apart from the thread of your conversation . One remedy for this sort of thing - which is bound to happen now and again in a system that depends so much on human agency - is to form the habit of reli giously " ringing off " when you are through . Users of the telephone are apt to ignore the fact that they really form a part of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical public of a luxurious age hurls at all public services rightly belongs to them . In any telephone conversation the subscribers do two thirds of the work , and the operator one third . The two talkers operate the instruments while the telephone employee LIGHTNING PROTECTORS. // merely makes the connection between the two lines . The talkers , then , ought to be good operators , as well as the employee , if the service is to be good all round . *Io the frequent user of the telephone the following questions are pertinent ; only the experienced users can say yes to all of them . Do you speak close into the transmitter and in clear tones , so that your correspondent may hear you clearly ? Do you hold your receiver firmly to your ear , so that you may hear him well ? Do you , when you have asked for a connection , listen at your receiver so as to catch your correspondent directly the operator has called him up ? Do you , when you have finished talking , hang up your receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearingout signal ? If you do not attend to these little points , you are not getting as good service as you might , and you are preventing others from getting good service . The operator is always the scapegoat , or else the telephone company impersonally , but the telephone is a scientific instru ment needing scientific use , and the user of it should bear that in mind , if he wishes it to serve him well , as of course he does . The operators have a busy time of it , especially during the " rush " hours of the day , which are a couple in the morning and a couple in the afternoon , when everybody wants to talk to everybody else all at once . It would seem at first glance as if the operators were under no supervision ; LONG-DISTANCE TELEPHONE- DESK STAND SET , but this is not so .. As they do their work by telephone , so they are supervised , or rather , " superaudited , " by telephone . Each exchange has its quota of monitor operators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These functionaries have desks provided with telephones and with lines running to different parts of the switchboard . They can connect themselves in circuit with any operator and overhear what is going on . They help the oVrators out of any // little difficulties that may crop up , receive complaints , and attend to all cases outside the routine work of answering and making calls and putting up connections . The operators devote themselves exclusively to the straightforward work of operating the switchboard all cornplaining , conversational and argumentative callers are turned over to the momtor , a trained diplomatist as well as telephonist . A peculiarity of the daily work of a telephone exchange is its fluctuating character . In all the large cities of the United States the service is available dur switchboards , the trunk wires between exchanges , and the number of operators must all be arranged to cope with the traffic during the hour when it reaches its top notch . Averages are no guide . Statistics may show that each subscriber in a given system demands eight or ten connections daily . I3ut this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a thousand subscribers who do not call once , while there are others that call twenty , thirty , fifty , and over a hundred times . If each and every subscriber called eight or ten times daily , say once an hour from eight to six , the conditions ing the whole twenty-four hours ; and although but a very small percentage of the traffic is done after the business day is over , the exchanges are kept open all night . In the big centres of population more than ninety-five per cent of the telephone traffic is between the hours of eight in the morning and six in the evening . Even during these ten hours the business is by no means evenly distributed , but there are two high-pressure periods of about a couple of hours each , - one in the morning from ten to twelve , the other in the afternoon from two to four . These are peculiarly exacting conditions to meet , as in such a service time is every thing , and the busiest hour sets the pattern for a great part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be widely different from what they are , and , compared with the actual fluctuations of traffic , would be easy to meet . In the large cities the telephone system consists of a number of exchanges , each exchange serving a district of its own , but all connected together by direct trunk wires to l ) rovide for the intercommunication among all the subscribers . There is always a great deal of this trunk traffic , and , as a rule , the larger proportion of the traffic of any exchange is with the other 1I*L 7I* - A NEW YORK ciTY ENEILANGE. // exchanges , chiefly with the one situated in the " down-town " district . In New York , for instance , there are some eight exchanges strung along Manhattan Island , from Broad Street to 125th Street . About fifty per cent of the daily traffic of each up-town exchange is with the downtown district . This trunk traffic requires methods of handling that are interesting as showing the ingenious arrangements devised to secure rapid service . Between every two exchanges there are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trunk lines are worked on the double-track system , a certain number being used for messages in one direction and a certain number for messages in the opposite direction . At the exchanges they are called outgoing and incoming trunks , the outgoing at one exchange becoming the incoming at the other . The outgoing trunks can be reached by the operators much in the same way as the subscribers ' lines , and each operator has access to a certain number of trunk ; leading to the other exchanges . The incoming trunks are all grouped at certain sections of the switchboard , at which only trunk connections are made . The trunk lines , instead of being connected with spring-jacks and indicator drops like the subscribers ' lines , are terminated in cords and plugs , similar to those used for putting up local connections . In front of these trunk sections of the switchboard are operators whose sole duty it is to make connections between the plugs in which the trunk lines terminate and the spring-jacks of the subscribers ' lines in the switchboard above . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SN NEW yORK , OF THE CHICAGO-NEW YORK TELEPHONE LINE , OCT. s8 , s892. // operators in the distant exchanges at which the trunk wires originate . When an operator gets a call for a subscriber in another exchange , she connects the wire of the calling subscriber to a trunk wire leading to the exchange called for and then by telephone orders the trunk operator at the distant exchange to make the connection , giving the number of the subscriber wanted and the number of the trunk wire to which she has connected her subscriber . The trunk operator first finds out if the subscriber wanted is busy , and , if not , plugs the trunk line into the spring-jack , when the connection is complete . If the subscriber called for is busy , the trunk operator , who does no talking , but simply receives orders by telephone and executes them as quickly as possible , sends a signal back to the first operator , who informs the calling subscriber . When two subscribers of different exchanges are connected together by a trunk wire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty and seventy different points at which another connection could be made to the line . Each one of these points is carefully guarded by the busy signal , which stands ready at every one of them to give the warning click that means " keep off . " No operator is so callous as to disregard the " busy " signal , and of all varieties of telephone " troubles " that of joining three subscribers together is one of the very rarest and most unusual . A trunk connection generally takes longer to make than a local connection . It really consists of two connections , and two operators take part in making . Where suburban and long-distance connections are concerned , the line may have to pass through several different switchboards , at each of which co-operation on the part of the operator is required to complete the connection . All this takes up time , and as a large proportion of the traffic of every city exchange is trunk traffic , that is , connections either with subscribers in other city exchanges or with out-of-town subscribers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time taken in making trunk connections . The plan of using distinct sets of trunk wires for calls bound PART OF A 5000-WIRE sWITcHBOARD . // in each direction , and of devoting separate circuits exclusively to the use of the operator for giving orders for connections , obviously secures the greatest economy of time . The economy in time is gained at the sacrifice of wires , and this method of working is practicable only when the traffic is heavy and continuous . The operators who so deftly carry on all this work - xvork requiring deftness of touch , quickness of eye and ear , and clearness of head , to say nothing of nimbleness of tongue , which is proverbially a natural gift of the fair sex - are well paid and well treated .

In every exchange airy and comfortably furnished rooms are set apart for the exclusive use of the operators when off duty . Here they retire in detachments during the day for periods of rest and refreshment .

In technical matters a small army , carefully organized , is required to handle the mass of details involved in the construction and keeping-up of a plant in which the wires and appliances mount up into the hundreds of thousands . A skilled staff is constantly employed in laying underground cables in the subways that honeycomb the streets , in connecting them with the switchboards and house wires , and in maintaining them in working order . Another department is kept busy in placing and removing subscribers ' instruments , running the interior wiring , and taking care of switchboard connections . Still a third finds ample work for a large number of men in periodical inspections of subscribers ' lines and instruments , maintaining all in good order , tightening up the " loose screws , " replenishing the exhausted batteries , removing incipient defects , - taking generally the stitch in time that saves nine .

" The other six hundred are divided up among executive staff and the various technical departments . As America is the birthplace of the telephone , so the telephonic industry has reached its most robust development here . American apparatus and methods are the models for the telephone systems of other countries , and the achievements of long-distance telephony in the United States always arouse the admiration of foreign technical visitors . The extension of telephony to interurban communication began about eight years ago , when a line was opened between New York and Philadelphia . It was looked on by many experience ( 1 people as a risky experiment , but the experiment was a brilliant success , and in a few years all the principal towns and cities of New York , New Jersey and the New England states were on speaking terms with each other . Up to a little more than a year ago , some four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking was done ; but in 1892 the slender copper wires were pushed out to the shores of Lake Michigan , and now the Chicagoan can hear at one ear the steam whistles in New York blowing high noon , while with the other he listens to his office clock striking eleven . The rapid extension of long-distance telephony during recent years , and the increasing demand among local telephone subscribers for facilities to make the best use of the long-distance service , have had one curious result , - a result that is distinctively American . In Europe there are long-distance telephone lines , as between London and Paris , Paris and Brussels , and Vienna and Buda-Pesth ; but if you want to use them , although you may be a subscriber to the local service , you have to go to the public station at the terminus of the line . At some of the places named you may hire , for a substantial extra rate , a special equipment that will enable you to talk over the longdistance circuits . Here the equipment of every subscriber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard type required for long-distance talking . The New-Yorker who has a metallic circuit line to his house on the West Side can talk to a Chicago subscriber as easily as he can to his office down town . This improvement in the lines and instruments of city telephone subscribers , amounting to the remodelling of the entire system , has been going on steadily in all parts of the country for some years past , and in the course of another year or so the whole of the country north of Mason and Dixon 's line and east of the Mississippi River will be interlaced by one vast national exchange , a telephonic federation so to speak , in which any two of over 100,000 subscribers will be able to talk together directly from their own offices or houses . Many refinements in overhead line construction have been necessary to render long-distance talking a success . // Whoever talks from New York to Chicago sends his voice vibrating through four hundred tons of copper wire . This copper wire forms part of a line erected on the most scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof against all disturbances short of an earthquake or a tornado . Each circuit is a complete metallic loop or double wire , as nothing short of that will give a quiet long-distance telephone line . Such lines are peculiarly susceptible to the incursions of foreign currents which emanate from the powerfully charged electric light and power wires in use all over the country . These vagrant currents wander dissolutely through the atmosphere , seeking out the nice , bright , copper wires provided as a path for the delicate voice vibrations . They insidiously induce themselves where they have no right to travel , and , like most trespassers and vagrants , bring trouble and disturbance in their track . They can not always be avoided , but their evil effects are neutralized by so arranging the telephone lines that the foreign currents take opposite directions in each wire of a telephone circuit , so that they oppose and destroy each other , like the Kilkenny cats , leaving the right of way clear to the legitimate occupant of the line . This necessitates an extremely scientific arrangement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each circuit are crossed or transposed at stated intervals all along the line ; and it is only by this method that each circuit can be kept free from outside disturbances . It is evident that the telephone instrument itself is but a small item of the organization of a large system of telephonic communication ; but as the foundation of a gigantic industry it demands one 's interest and attention . As a scientific marvel of never-failing charm , it compels the admiration both of layman and of scientist . The magnet telephone , the " receiver " of the subscriber 's telephone set , is a very simple instrument . It contains within the polished hard rubber case a steel magnet with a small coil of fine wire mounted at one end , and a thin iron disk clamped securely opposite the magnet , a small fraction of an inch away from its face or " pole . " When the iron disk is vibrated by the voice , minute changes are effected in the strength of the magnet , for the disk is normally attracted by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly separated from it . These changes in the strength of the magnet cause currents to be set up in the coil of wire . Connect the ends of the coil of wire to the ends of a similar coil mounted on a similar magnet with a similar iron disk in front , and the currents flowing through the second coil will cause identical changes of strength in the second magnet ; its attraction for the iron disk will be varied accordingly , and the disk will perform vibrations exactly similar to those of the first disk . The result is the transmission of articulate speech with all its minute variations and delicate inflections . The impulse one has when the simplicity of the idea is apparent is to exclaim , " How extremely simple it is ! What a marvel that nobody invented it before 1 " The telephone is at once the most simple and the most sensitive instrument known to electrical science . It is precisely in those qualities that its charm and its wonder lie . The simplicity of the magnet telephone is obvious ; its sensitiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will produce no effect on the most delicate measuring instrument - will give a perfectly audible sound in the telephone . Although as a receiver the magnet telephone leaves nothing to be desired , the development of telephony on a commercial scale required a more powerful instrument as a transmitter . The carbon b3ttery telephone supplied the want . In the magnet telephone the vibrations set up by the voice are the sole motive power for producing the currents that are sent out to line to operate the instrument at the distant end . The amount of energy developed by the human voice is extremely small , and the currents generated by it will not carry very far . In the microphone transmitter a battery furnishes the current , and the voice vibrations are directed at a controlling device which varies the strength of the current // with every variation in the pressure applied . This arrangement has made talking over a thousand miles of wire an everyday matter . If we penetrate into the inner recesses of a subscriber 's telephone we find that the voice is directed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest disturbance of the air surrounding it . The vibrations of the diaphragm are communicated to a carbon resistance forming part of the battery circuit . Carbon is used , because of all materials capable of conducting electricity , it is the one whose conducting powers are most sensitive to the effect of variation in pressure . Sometimes the carbon is in the form of a button on which a little metal spring presses , sometimes it is in a fine powder enclosed in a small chamber of which the diaphragm is one wall . The battery is connected to the carbon resistance and to one winding of an induction coil , and the current simply circulates around through the coil and the carbon resistance and back to the battery ; the battery current never goes out of the subscriber 's station . What does go out and what carries the voice to the distant instrument is an induced current set up in the second winding of the induction coil . An induction coil consists simply of two separate insulated wires wound on an iron core . When a current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the other , and every change in the original or primary current will be faithfully reproduced in the secondary or induced current . This mysterious electrical phenomenon , called induction , is a great aid to the telephone engineer , and it is also a great hindrance to him . Guiding himself by its known principles , he is able to construct many useful and beautiful instruments ; but by the same token many misguided and unprincipled currents get into his wires by induction , and make their presence known in unpleasant ways . The telel ) hone subscriber also knows something of this , though far less than he used to . In the telephone transmitter , then , the battery current passes through one wire of the induction coil and through the carbon resistance . When the diaphragm is vibrated by the voice , the carbon also vibrates , its resistance changes with every microscopic movement , and the current undergoes corresponding changes . These changes are impressed upon the induced current in the second winding of the induction coil , and this quavering , wavering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect electrical reproduction of the sound waves of the human voice . At the distant end of the line the current circulates through the coil on the receiver magnet ; the strength of the magnet changes for every tiny change in the current , the diaphragm vibrates and the voice is given out again . Such is the action of the modern telephone , more ingenious , more beautiful , and more wonderful than words can describe it . It is right perhaps for New England to claim the honor of the telephone , as she does of the telegraph . Morse was a native of Massachusetts . Bell was not ; but it was in Boston that his great experiments were made and his invention perfected . Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh , Scotland , March 3 , 1847 . His father and grandfather were both teachers of languages , and when quite a child Mr. Bell acquired a strong bent for the study of all subjects connected with human speech . He even , when a mere lad , constructed a speaking machine and succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was of age he determined to follow up Helmholtz 's synthetical experiments in the reproduction of sound by attempting to transmit speech electrically . During the following years he made numerous electrical inventions and resolved to push his work , which was aimed at a method of harmonic telegraphy , to a practical system . Although he was working at telegraphic inventions , the idea of transmitting articulate speech frequently occurred to him , and even before 1870 he stated his belief that we should one day speak by telegraph . In 1870 the Bell family emigrated to Brantford , Canada , and in the following year Mr. Bell went to Boston to carry on exl ) erilnents with his father 's system of " visible speech . " While in Boston he // carried on his electrical work , and his numerous discoveries finally culminated in the invention of the speaking telephone , in 1876 . His first public lecture on the telephone was delivered before the Society of Arts at Boston , May 25 , 1876 ; but the first time that speech was transmitted electrically over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the same year . the telephone was exhibited at the Centennial , where a display of its speaking powers was made before a distin guished gathering of scientists . Since the invention and successful introduction of the telephone , Professor Bell has conducted a large number of experiments at the Volta Laboratory , which he established in Washington with the proceeds of the French Volta prize , awarded him for the invention of the telephone . During late years he has mainly devoted himself to his original pursuit , namely , the study of the deaf and dumb in connection with his father 's system of " visible speech . "
