txt The criticisms upon the award of the contract for carrying home the Spanish prisoners of war to a Spanish steamship company lack merit and point . It was really a very fortunate opportunity that offered itself to us to show that we are not carrying on this war in a spirit of hate . The business reasons for awarding the contract to this company were sufficient , but they gained force from the ' novelty and strangeness of the transaction . It is something of a solecism ? in war to hire the enemy 's shipowners ' to carry home the enemy 's soldiers who have become our prisoners , but it is a good business transaction and a valuable precedent . The objection urged by some of the disappointed bidders that the Compania Trasatlantica Espanola has played a sharp game on the Government by mak ing a contract which will enable it to bring its ships out of their hiding places and send them home without risk of being captured as prizes by us , and that will enable the Spanish Government to arm these vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded . Most of the ships to be used as transports are in Spanish waters now . The time has gone by when Spain can gain anything by fitting out merchant vessels as crullers . If her warships run to cover at the first hint of a visit from an American fleet to the Spanish coasts , what advantage would be gained by adding converted steamships fb her navy ? But even if these ships do enter the Spanish service their owners have at least the justification of selling their steamers for the defense of their own country . The transaction would not be altogether sordid , for patriotism would enter into it . In selling its ships to its own Government the Trasatlantica Company would be in a very different position from the North German Lloyd Steamship Company , for instance , which sold the Havel to Spain to be used as a war vessel against the United States . The business of the North German Lloyd is principally , almost wholly , with the United States . An en- , / lightened business judgment would have decided that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be employed in destroying the commerce and the property of the best customer was bad policy , for the company . The maintenance of a neutral position was the very least recognition this company could in decency give of the obligations of its business relations with the United States . Yet it showed great eagerness to make the sale . as if it were actuated not merely by the wish to make a good bargain , but by a lively desire to help Spain , the enemy of the United States . The conduct of the Compania Trasatlantica Espanola is straightforward and businesslike . The sale of the Havel to Spain by the North German Lloyd was a very stupid and short-sighted business policy , to say the least . If the North German Lloyd really felt so deep a sympathy with Spain , and so ardently desired that the Spaniards should triumph over its own best customer , it would have been more prudent to make a large private money contribution to the Spanish Treasury .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
