txt The big retail ' Shoe store of Alfred J. Cammeyer , corner of Sixth Avenue and Twentieth Street , known to all New York as " Cammeyer 's , " was almost destroyed by fire last night . Flames started somewhere in the basement , probably , Mr. Cammeyer says , from defective insulation of electric wires , shortly before 9 o'clock , and before the firemen could get the blaze under control it had destroyed stock to the value of about $250,000 , and had done damage to the building estimated at from $100,000 to $250. - 000 . The stock lost is fully covered by insurance , and it is understood that the.building is also fully insured . The fire burned steadily until after midnight . Just as it was reaching the third floor of the building the streams from two towers and seventeen engines turned the mass of flame into clouds of smoke , and then Chief Bonner said that it had done its worst . When Cammeyer 's store was closed for the night , shortly before 8 o'clock , every one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schack . They began to sweep out the ground floor , and had been working about an hour when they noticed smoke issuing from the stairway leading to the basement . They tried to I make their way to the lower floor to discover ' the extent of the fire , but were driven back by the smoke , and hurried to the street to turn in an alarm . P. J. Buckley , the watchman for O'Neill &; Co. , and Patrick Daly , watchman for Simpson , Crawford &; Simpson , two large dry goods esestablishments on Sixth Avenue , opposIte Cammeyer 's , had noticed the smoke before Moore and Schack reached the street . and had turned in the alarm . A few minutes later Patrolman George Reid entered the building , saw that the smoke was increas-. ing , and turned in two more alarms . When the engines arrived the firemen could see no flames . Nothing but a dense volume of smoke poured from the sixth Avenue door , and found its way to the floors above . The ground floor was so black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and force their way through , Chief Bonner gave orders to smash the large plate glass panes in the show windows and to break through the basement skylights on the Twentieth Street sidewalk . The last undertaking only bewildered the firemen the more , for with every aperture that was made the smoke gushed forth , and soon the men began to fight what is known as a blind fire . EXCITEMENT ON THE STREET . The rattte and clang of the engines brought crowds of , people who blocked the street ; in the neighborhood and steed in the way of the firemen . Capt . Price of the Tenderloin Precinct came rushing down from the dizzy whirl of the Cercle Frangais de l'Harrnonie - ball at Madison Square Garden to take charge of the police , and with two large squads ne soon drove the crowds back as far as Eighteenth and Twenty-second Streets . In the meantime Policeman George Reid made a hurried tour of the building to see if any of the occupants were still there . Every room was empty except that of Mme. Pool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounded on the door and a voice answered . He hastened in to find Mrs. Margaret Lynett of 1.425 Seventh Avenue , Mme. Pool 's manager , diligently sewing and unconscious of the fire . Reid told her to hurry down stairs . They went together , but the thick smoke overpowered Mrs. Lynett before she had reached the first floor . She fainted , and Reid made a gallant rescue by carrying the woman to the street , where she was resuscitated . The continuous streams of water which were being poured into the cellar seemed to have no effect on the fire , and firemen were groping around ' in the darkness chopping away partitions nere and there , trying to locate the blaze . Shortly before 9:30 o'clock a flame burst up in the basement close to the east wall . It caught the woodwork and began to spread with fury , and then Chief Bonner summoned more help . All streams were aimed at the blaze , and the fight against destruction began in earnest . A sharp wind blew down Twentieth Street from the east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every part of the ground floor and the basement . Chief Bonner 's object was to keep the fire from reaching the second floor , so when the extra engines arrived he ordered eight streams to flood this and the other upper floors while the remaining streams were turned into the basement . Finally the flames turned into smoke again , and great volumes poured out on Twentieth Street . the chief point from which the fire was being fought . Somehow the street lamps were extinguished and the men left to work in the darkness and choking smoke . Line after line of hose burst ; people ran helter skelter to escape a drenching , and for a while the scene around the building was one of wild excitement . A great flood of water was poured into the clouds of smoke that rolled up from the temporary inferno . Chief Bonner looked at it and remarked : " Well , this puzzles me . " It was nearly 11 o'clock , and seeing that no headway had been gained , he sent in a fifth alarm . and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of the engines arrived than the /lames burst through the floor of the second story , ant for a moment it looked as if the building was doomed . THE FIRE CHECKED . Quick as a dash Chief Bonner lined up two towers and eight ordinary streams on Twentieth Street , and turned them into the second floor . It was a splendid manoeuvre and quickly executed . Glass , partitions , and woodwork came crashing to the ground under the weight of the water , and at length all danger of the fire spreading higher was averted . The basement , first , fifth , and sixth floors of the building were occupied by the Cammeyer shoe establishment . The third floor was vacant , and the second and fourth floors were occupied by K. S. Carey &; Co. , dressmakers ' supplies ; Mine . Pool corset maker ; Dr. D. M. Oxley , dentist ; S. Rauh , dealer in overgaiters ; F. W. Dodge , building materials , the American Publishing Company , Nathan Krauskof. infants ' wear , and Ward &; Co. , envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the building and contents were totally destroyed . This covered everything , he said . " r am fully insured , " he added , " and believe the other tenants are likewise proteoted . I can give no cause for the origin of the fire . There was no fire in the basement . The elevators were run by electricity . I think it must have been caused by defective insulation . " Chief Bonner said the loss would not be under $500,000 , in any event , and he was inclined to believe it could not be correctly estimated . George T. Patterson of the insurance firm of Patterson &; Clark estimated It at $350.000 . Victor Hure , a jeweler , whose place is on the second floor , says that he had $250,000 worth of diamonds and jewelry in his vaults . He declared , however , that he was sure his property had not been endangered .

At different times firemen were overcome by the dense smoke and had to stop work , but in every case they recovered quickly and went back to battle . The flames made the dwell.ng at 48 West Twentieth Street uninhabitable , and Its owner and tenant , Mrs. H. R. Stanfield , and her son and daughter , were obliged to vacate . Tney managed to get most of their furniture into vans and out of danger . The Episcopal Church of the Holy Communion , of which the Rev. Dr. Henry Mot- tet is pastor , is at Twentieth Street and Sixth Avenue , just across from the Cammeyer store . Several times burning brands menaced the church , but the vigilance of the firemen prevented any damage to that structure . , The surface cars on Sixth Avenue were blocked during the fire . but the elevated trains ran without interruption throughout . At 1 A. M. the fire appeared to be under control , although Chief Bonner would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the flames from spreading further if nothing extraordinary happened . Andrew Alexander , proprietor of the large shoe store adjoining the Cammeyer establishment , on Nineteenth Street and Sixth Avenue , arrived at the fire about midnight . He said there was a four-foot brick wall between his building and the one on fire . and ' he did not expect to lose at all , unless in a small way from water . Several lines of hose had been run through Alexander 's building at the third floor so as to reach the south wall of the Cammeyer Building , there being a narrow court between the two buildings . The Cammeyer Building was erected on the site of a house once occupied by Lillian Schofield . It was in her house that Nathaniel Hatch , a Wall Street broker , met his death several years ago . He was supposed to have been thrown from an upper window and killed . The Schofield woman was tried and acquitted . The present building is owned by the Rhinelander estate , and is six stories high .
