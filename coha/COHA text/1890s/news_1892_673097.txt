txt The message from Mr. HENRY W. CANNON , which will be found in another column , is extremely interesting and . may have some effect on the proceedings of the conference . It is , in substance , a plain statement that , if no agreement can be reached as to the relative value of gold and silver , this country must stop its purchases Of silver , strengthen its gold reserve , and prepare to defend its interests in international trade . This is undoubtedly the view of the great body of conservative and wellinformed financiers in the United States . It was not absolutely necessary to hold a monetary conference to make it Plain that this was the only safe course for Republic , or even to discover that the alternative ? an international agreement as to ratio  --  was impracticable , but the conference will probably make generally clear what was already to be seen by close observers . It has been generally supposed to require considerable influence or " inducement " of some kind to obtain valuable privileges from the Board of Aldermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . The other day the board granted to a concern calling itself the New-York Power Company the right to tear np the streets and lay mains and pipes for the distribution of salt water , compressed air , electricity , and such like commodities for purposes unknown . Nothing seemed to be clearly known about the corporation , its backers , or its purposes , and the only exAjanation of the extraordinary action of the Aldermen was that the resolution was handed to one of them by Dock Commissioner CRAM , who desired to have it adopted . But Mr. CRAM has disclaimed all interest in the matter and all knowledge of the company and its schemes . There is something queer in the business , but the queerest thing is the readiness of the Aldermen to grant a franchise about which they knew nothing at the mere request of somebody they know only as a Tammany official . The Treasury statement for yesterday shows a slight increase in the " cash in the Treasury " and also a somewhat larger increase in the debt .

The receipts have ? increased by about $15,000,000 and the expenses by $17,000,000 .

The entire increase in the expenditures is covered by that in pensions , which were $48.200,458 in 1891 and $65,481,795 this year . Tho other changes are unimportant and ofliset each other . The monthly payments in pensions have advanced to $13,431,871 , and are still advancing . Commenting upon a " corner " in broom eonn and the making of a combination by the broom makers in Wisconsin , the Philadelphia Record says : " The curse of monopoly has struck its roots so deeply into this Trust-ridden country that the promoters of these sneaking and nefarious schemes of plunder not only sec nothing wrong in them , but think themselves entitled to admiration as excessively smart fellows .

" It was the unanimous opinion of the physicians and sanitary experts examined by the Senate Committee on Immigration yesterday that there is not only an apprehension of a visitation of cholera in this country next Spring or Summer , but actual danger of it . They ' were equally agreed that the danger of its coming and the difficulty of keeping it out will be due chiefly to immigration , and that if there was no immigration of the class known as steerage passengers the danger and the difficulty would be very slight . The only difference of opinion related to the expediency or practicability of suspending immigration as a measure of protection , but that is hardly a question for the doctors to decide . The alternative will be a rigid and costly system of quarantine which will interfere seriously with commerce , and which may not be effectual after alL The Senate committee seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholera is a sufficient ground for suspending immigration and that the suspension of immi gra lion is the only sure safeguard against the cholera .
