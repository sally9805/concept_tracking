txt It took the Secretary of the Senate an hour to read the report of the Senate Committee on Elections this afternoon . There had been rumors that , after all , the longdisputed phair that Hudson County holds in the Senate would . not be awarded to-day . But Senator Gardner set all the rumors at rest when he arose in his seat , half an hour after the opening of the afternoon session , with a scroll of tapebound paper in his hand and sent it to the Secretary 's desk . " The Committee on Elections , " he announced as the page took the scroll , " desires to submit a report . " ? Clerk Honeyman had not read ten words before it was seen that the paper was the report on the contested elections case . It would fin three columns of THE Naw-Yonu TIMES with the details of the disooveeles made by the committee in the famous ineestigations just brought to a close . The report declare &; that it was seen at the very outset that the frauds covered so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Method as to show a monster conspiracy ; and that the evidence produced at the sittings was a condensed recital of crime after crime . The difficulties the committee encountered in its efforts to secuire the ballots and the capture of them on the eve of the time when the law would have permitted their destruction are referred to . In ten of the precincts , the report goes on to say , there was a willful miscount of the vote , and in all the ? precincts this was done in the interest of Senator . In twenty-eight pre1 eincts 1,764 Democratic ballots found in the boxes had been milled and stamped . and punctured by other machinery than that of the boxes ; 1,505 were on light thin paper . The committee has no hesitation in declaring them all to be fraudulent . The fact that the election officers reported no excess of ballots in the boxes shows , the report alleges , that the election officers were in league with those who procured and deposited these fraudulent votes . Others of the ballots bear marks indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of dead persons , absentees , and fictitious persons was so universal as to lead the committee to the conclusion that the registry lists are kept from year to year for fraudulent use . One man , who died fifteen years ago , is on last Fall 's poll list . lei one precinct 115 persons were voted from canal and tug boats . - . Cone canalboat , with a crew of three , furnished nine names to the poll list . The names of honest voters were repeated on the list to cover fraudulent votes . Some evidence before the committee indicated the importation of repeaters from New-York Bowery lodging houses . Ballots were substituted , and there were gross acts of violence at the polls . Ruffians presided at the boxes , and in some of the precincts the police stood at their elbows . " The management of the elections in Hudson , " the committee adds , " is in the hands of brutal , violent men , who drive decent men from the polls , but readily receive the suffrages of loafers whom no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held on the Democratic side last Fall in pursuance of a- mammoth conspiracy , with some directing head , and a band of unwhipped criminals aiding at the ballot boxes . It describes the Hudson County Democratic Committee as the tool of three or four leaders , with Robert Davis , Sheriff , in as complete control of tie gang as is a Colonel of his regiment , and picture% the scene at the committee rooms on the night before election , when Davis sat at the table distributing packages of ballots . and other packages of money to the poll workers as the roll of their names was called , and still other packages of " joker ballots " to those who would take them . The report calls attention to the fact that the ring had first paved the way for the commission of the villanies by securing the repeal of the personal registration law , making possible the use of the swollen registiy lists , and of the jury commission law , enabling the , protection of the electidnofficers from indictment , and to the startling fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sent poll workers , 864 " joker ballots " were discovered . The committee is convinced that , by the various methods of ballot-box stuffing , repeating , false registration , miscounting , and intimidation resorted to by the unwhipped criminals who served in the polling booths , 's vote was swollen with 10,000 fraudulent votes , and , from comparison with the vote of previous years , the committee argues that the real vote of the county did not exceed . 35,000 . The committee assumes that , as the frauds were all in Democratic interests , every vote allowed by the election Pascals to Stuhr , the fusion candidate for Senator , belonged to him , and that afforded a solid basis of about 16,000 to begin on . Add 2,000 votes to represent Stuhr ballots abstracted . from the boxes and for which 2,000 irregular ballots were substituted , and Mr. Stulir has a clear majority of the lawful vote . The committee makes reference to the late charter election in Jersey City , and declares that frauds were as rampant then as at the Fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senatorial contest and to order a new one is only to invite a repetition of the frauds , and so the committee's. resolution which accompanies the report unseats Mr. and gives his chair to Stuhr . Senator Adrain claimed the attention of the President as soon as the report had been read . He desired , he said , to make an argument . that he wished to have regarded as his minority report , submitted by him as the Democratic member of the investigating committee . He argued that the move against Senate ' . was purely a political one inspired by State Controller Anderson and State Treasurer Tolley to keep their places in the State House . He intimated pretty loudly that Senator Gardner was acting in their interest , and that Stuhr had bought the favor of the committee by entering into a deal with it . He declared that the only frauds discovered were those which were revealed by an examination of the ballots . There were 1,706 " jokers . " Admitting that these represented 1,706 votes stolen from Stuhr and given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,332 left , and throwing out all the tainted precincts was yet backed by a majority of 2,673 . Senator Gardner rose to resent the insinuations cast by Mr. Adram upon State officera who , because they had no desk on the floor , were linable to defend themselves . He denied that the State Treasurership. and the State Controllership had entered into consideration in the slightest degree in preparing the report , or that Mr. Stulir had become a party to any deal . Then ho paid his respects to Mr. Adrain 's argument . If the committee had sat a little longer , he was persuaded , a unanimous report might have been presented . Mr. Adrain , when the examination of the boxes had been concluded , declared that nothing had been found . Now he owned up to a fraud of 1,700 votes . He was gradually approaching a sensible view of the case . The Senator had much more to say in reply to the Middlesex Senator , but it was all in the line of the argument that tile report follows . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing desks with Senator Mallon so as to be able to speak from the centre aisle , asked the attention of the.Chair . He spoke in his own defense for nearly an hour . He declared that he bad been elected Senator by a majority of the honest voters of Hudson County , and said that no man deplored . the frauds that had been revealed more than he did . He had felt that he was under a. cloud from the  --  day he . - was sworn in , and. , if he could , he would have resigned his seat and gone back to the paople.of . Hudson ? Countya where the question properly belongs ; - He ' said that his coming displacement was a political move , and that he entertained no personal feelings against the Senators for the step they were about to take . " But I propose to convince you , " .. he said , " thatI was elected State Senator . If , when I have convinced you , you still adhere to your determination to wrong your conscience in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then argued the questions involved in the case , and traversed the allegations in the committee 's report . it was 8 o'clock when he finished . No one had anything further to say . The Secretary called the roll . Senators Martin and Miller answered with decisive yeas in favor of the committee 's report . Their fellow-Republicans voted with them . The report was declared carried by a party vote of 11 to 9 , and Mr. ceased . to represent Hudson in the Senate of Ne-w-Jersay . Mr. Stuhr will be sworn in tomorrow . Assistant Sergeant at Arms Ross , who had been sent yesterday to apprehend Chairman Trier of the Municipal Corporations Committee for failure to turn into the House , as ordered , the Newark Elevated Railroad bin , returned this morning without either the Chairman or the bill . It is understood that Mr. Trier has gone to Cincinnati , Ohio . A telegram from him inquires whether Mr. Fagan of the same committee has received the bill , Trier asserting that he mailed it in Newark two days ago . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ross says he could . get no trace of the bill . To-night Assemblyman Mullone offered a resolution in the House censuring the Senatedor the unseating of Mr. , but it was ruled out of order . Assemblyman Snyder offered . a resolution ens nailing Mr. Trier from membership in the Legislature owing to his action with respect to the missing Newark Elevated Railroad bill , but after a heated . debate the resolution was laid over until to-morrow , pending an explanation from Mr. Trier.
