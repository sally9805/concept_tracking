Last year 220,460 pounds of these shells were imported for use in the United States , and the best of them sell for $4.82 a thousand . As each shell lasts till somebody breaks it in his rage at failure to make any impression with his teeth on one of the pencil tips , no proof stronger than these figures provide could possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation is willing and able to pay for pleasures purely aesthetic .
