txt Mayor Gleason is not at all worried at the charges made against him by the speakers at the meeting held in Long Island City Monday night . He is too busy arranging his plans for capturing votes at the coming election of a Mayor for the Greater New York to care what his political enemies say of him . The charge that he bribed State Superintendent , of Insurance Payn with $60,000 worth of stock in the Woodside Water Company to engineer certain Long Island City bills through the Legislature he considers far less worthy of comment than his chances of obtaining a big vote in the election . The charge in question , reported in THE NEW YORK TIMES yesterday , was made , among a number of almost equally serious ones , by Matthew J. Smith , a lawyer and a member of the Citizens ' Committee of Long Island City . After an exhaustive review of Mr. Gleason 's administration , in which he found nothing to praise , Mr. Smith said that , failing to secure local support for the measures he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There , " continued Mr. Smith , " he obtained the aid of an influential Republican leader , to whom he gave $00,000 worth of bonds of the Woodside Water Company , but the bill is not law , and Mr. Payn will now , I am sure , be glad to return the stock . " A reporter for THE NEW YORK TIMES yesterday asked Mr. Smith if he cuuld substantiate the charges he had made against the Mayor and Superintendent Payn . " I think I have said all I care to say on the subject , " was his reply . " I have nothing to retract . " " Can you prove your statements correct ? " " There are many things , " said Mr. Smith , shaking his forefinger in the air , " said at public meetings that , while absolutely true , are not susceptible to proof . I said what I had to say , and do not care to discuss the matter further . " An Interview with Ply . Gleason . When the statement was shown to Mayor Gleason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked what he was expected to say . " Say if it be true or not , " suggested the reporter . " That statement of Smith 's ? " said the Mayor , musingly . " Well , it does n't matter much what anybody says . I do n't Care . I 've got lots of friends . I 'm going to run for Mayor of the Greater New York as an independent candidate . The petition on which I shall get my name on the ticket is now being signed " That statement of Smith 's ? Oh , yes . As I was saying , I do n't see why I should not be elected . I always used the workingmen well , and they 'll stick by me . Tammany Hall ca n't win with its present leaders , and the silver question popping up , as it is bound to do ; the Republicans have no show in the face of the Raines law and the fool measures they have adopted , and the Citizens ' Union will nominate some wealthy aristocrat , too swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who " About what Smith said ? Well , it 's a lie ; and he knew it was a lie when he said it . Any one who knows Long Island City and was told Smith had said something would know the something was false without asking what it was he had said . Mr. Payn had nothing to do with those bills . The statement is absurd on its face . The bills were passed by a Republican Legislature because they were so evidently for the good of the city that there was no excuse for refusing to pass them . " None of the speakers at Monday 's meeting amounted to anything . Knapp , Park , Smith , and Madden combined do not own $1,000 of property , and have no real interest in the city 's welfare . Park is a minister , whose motives are like Smith 's . Both are seeking advertising . Park for his church , and Smith for a saloon just around the corner . Madden accuses me of assaulting him , and speaks against me because he believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not annoy me a bit . " Mr Smith Contradicted . " The statement connecting Mr. Payn 's name with those bills is a deliberate lie . I do not believe I have spoken to Mr. Payn three times in my life , and I do not own or control $00,000 of the Woodside Water Company 's stock . " " I can prove that , " intarrupted Edward M. Tyrell , President of the company , who was present during the interview . " Well , as I ' was saying , " went on Mr. Gleason , " it will not surprise me if I am elected to sit in that office just across the park fnom the Tombs building . I 'm going to make the other candidates hustle to beat me . " Oh yes , about Smith . There is not anything more to say . Those Aldermen did not do much explaining at Monday 's meeting . Every thing I have done has been above board . If it had not been it would not have been their affection for me that would have stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is not anything else to say , except to repeat that I 'll poll a big vote for Mayor of the greater city . People will be surprised when it is counted . "
