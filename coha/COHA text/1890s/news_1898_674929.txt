txt A pleasure party of eleven members met a terrible fate in a grade-crossing collision early this evening , with the result that four of the party were killed outright , the crossing boy killed , and all the others on the buckboard more or less injured , three being very seriously hurt , one of them so badly that he will die in a few hours . The first intimation of the terrible affair was brought by the train due here at 6:30 o'clock , which had the victims on board . The bodies of the dead were left in the baggage car of the train , awaiting the Medical Examiner , while the wounded were taken to the Town Hall , where the surgeons worked over , them . The dead are : GEORGE WHITING , aged fifty . Mrs. WHITING . JESSIE WHITING , his daughter , aged eighteen . SADIE WHITING , another daughter , aged twenty . A BOY , who flagged the crossing , ( name unknown . ) The seriously injured are : GEORGE WHITING . Jr. , fatally . HAROLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MILDRED SCOTT , aged four . Mrs. HOUGHTON , both legs broken . BERTHA RICH , aged sixteen . The pleasure party was made up of the Whiting family and some of their immediate friends of Bondville , and they were going from their home in Bondville to Forest Lake , a picnic grove about one mile away , in a covered barge drawn by four horses . The accident occurred at Whiting 's Crossing , in Palmer , on the Central Massachusetts branch of the Boston and Maine Railroad . On one side of the crossing there is quite a steep hill running right down to the tracks . It is explained that as the barge came over the crest of the hill and started down toward the railroad track , the flag boy at the foot of the hill was seen to come out of his station to flag an approaching train . The barge had considerable headway and the four horses were not easily held ; in fact , the momentum of the vehicle on the steep grade was so great that it went by the flagboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ware accommodation train for Ware came along . The engine struck the barge about in the middle , tossing the occupants on all sides , killing the horses , and demolishing the vehicle . ' The train was stopped , and tender hands at once went to the aid of the victims . Five bodies were picked up in a- terribly mangled condition , one , that of a boy , being decapitated . The latter was , the substitute crossing tender ; the regular flagman , having been called away , put the boy on to flag this train . May Not Survive . George Whiting , Jr. , the most seriously hurt of the survivors , is not expected to survive the night . Mrs. Haughton had both legs broken , and is internally hurt . The others are badly cut and bruised , but the surgeons in attendance are unable to state definitely the extent of their injuries . The escape from more serious injuries and even death for the other members of the party is accounted for by the fact that the engine 's co ; vcatche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been placed on the train and the injured given emergency attention the train came to this town , where surgical aid was sent for . The bodies were left in the baggage car , and they presented a fearful sight . Surgeons in town were summoned , and among those who responded were Drs . Spencer , Miner , Ryan , Pearson , and Auger , and later others from neighboring towns were called in . It was thought advisable to remove the injured from their gruesome surroundings , and so they were taken over to the Town Hall . Two members of the party were only slightly hurt , and they quickly left to communicate with friends and make arrangements for the care of the bodies . The medical examiner was summoned , but , pending his arrival ; it was thought best to leave the bodies in the baggage car , which was side-tracked here .
