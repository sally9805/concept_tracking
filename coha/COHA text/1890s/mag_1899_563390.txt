txt I* entering upon the discussion of this topic , I may assist myself and my readers ill what I have to say , by attempting , first of all , to define it by an illustration . The illustration is furnished to us by the two powers which , I suppose it may be said with justice , have as much , if not more , to do with the peace and wellbeing of Christendom than any other two powers in the world . One of them is England , the other is Russia , and they constitute what may be called a territorial illustration of my theme . I am speaking now of England and not of its colonies , and of Russia without its colonies . How insigmiificant England is compared with Russia ! The enormous disparity in territory is matched by an almost equally enormous disparity in population , but , when that has been said , the distinction as to greatness and bigness only seems to be emphasized .

There can be no difference of judgment on these points . The little seagirt island has managed , somehow or other , by the development of ideas along a line which began with the time of King John and the Barons , to create a civilization with which , in its intensive and extensive intellectual and * It is due to my readers to say that this pa*ier was delivered , originally , as a wholly unwritten address ; to which fact any defects of literary form should be at tributed .

C P. // moral fe&amp;tnres , nothing in Russia can at all be compared . Such a contrast , we may wisely remember when we are beckoned by the lure of bigness and contemplate , for the first time in our history , the enlargement of our great domain by the acquisition of terntory and populations and opportunities of various kinds which are supposed to follow in the train of the accession to a nation or an empire of what we are wont to call colonial possessions . And , in that connection , we may wisely ask ourselves , What , on the one hand , are the gains which we arc supposed to get from such an accession of territory and populations ; and then , What , on the other , are the perils ? I suppose it will be said , in the first place , that the gain of most consequence , and which translates itself most intelligently to the average American mind , is the gain which comes from commercial opportunities . The remarkable fact , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the commercial world , has not been acquired under any conditions such as the possession of extra-continental territory , by the acquisition of colonies , or of anything which stands for a colony . To-day , the United States of America , unless I have been misinformed , sends twenty-seven per cent . of its whole product of grain to other countries , in no one of which does it own a foot of land . It sends more than forty per cent . of its product of oil in the same way . It sends nearly seventy per cent . of its product of cotton in the same way . Here , then , are three great representative values in which the export business of the country has already attained such a vest proportion , and this proportion has been achieved , from the beginning until now , without the extension in order to achieve it of a single territorial foot of possession beyond the American continent . It may be said , however , that what we want is not merely an accession of territory , but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and the quality of the peoples that are likely to be acquired by such a policy of expansion as is urged upon us in somn* quarters to-day . What are the relatiens of the peoples , the various and heterogeneous races that will be included under our government , if we should acquire ultimately the title , not only to the near islands which are now in discussion , but to that group of 1,200 islands with some eleven millions of people , which lies almost on the other side of the globe ? What homogeneity have they ? What promise of productiveness have // 435 they ? What characteristics have they , that promise , in any near or remote moment , that they and we can sustain any mutually belpful and beneficial organic relation ? On the other hand , the moment we consider the great questions which confront our country in connection with the extraterritorial policy of the United States , we are compelled to look in the face the enormous perils which such a policy must inevitably involve . It must involve , in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , standing army . Intelligent men will not easily be persuaded that an army of fifty thousand men , or a hundred thousand men , will be able to handle the colossal and most intricate problem of the proper government and administration of these alien , and , in some instances , utterly uncivilized peoples . But if we are to have only a hundred thousand men , or one hundred and fifty thousand men , the question arises , what will the new policy cost the country ? The revenue of the United Stales Government for the month of January , 1899 , in spite of recent legislation , had entirely failed to bring the revenue of the Government np to the requirements of the administration , and there was , for the month of January , a deficit of several millions of dollars . This is a time of peace , and yet the curious fact confronts us that tbe army appears to be costing us more in a time of peace than it cost us a little while ago , in the time of war . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are " other explanations . " The trouble is that there will always be other explanations , and , accompanying those explanations , there will be those illustrations of individual cupidity , of personal neglect , of manifold inconvenience , which unfortunately marked our late war . I confess for myself that when I contemplate the organization of a great army , which is to be created , and , above all , is to be officered upon the basis of the policy which has obtained during the last year in this country , in connection with the appointment of persons to positions of considerable and often of very great responsibility , I confront it with the utmost dismay . The splendid contrast between the army and the navy , in which the friends of the navy rejoice , is that the navy is free from scandals which have disfigured the history of the army and its administration . But that fact will not secure the maintenance of the navy , by any less costly means than are required for a great army ; and it is impossible to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have taken , without a great navy to support it . In modern warfare and in international affairs to-day the navy is a far more important , as it must be a far more costly , factor than the army . So much for the vulgar aspect of my subject-that of material interest . What is to be the result of the creation of a great civil service which must be behind and beyond both the army and the navy ? We have not been very successful at that task at home . Those of us who have fought for the principle of civil service and have got it , feel like a sailor out on the yard-arm in a storm , who holds on to the sheet , which he is striving to reef , with his teeth as well as with his hands and his feet ! Every now and then some cloud appears in the sky , that makes us feel that everything we had fought for and won in the great struggle for civil service is in danger of being imperilled , if not of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soundness of the principles of civil service wabbles about , so to speak , in such a way as creates in the hearts of many of us the keenest apprehension . Now , then , open the doors of such vast opportunities of government and of plunder , as will be opened should we adopt the responsibility of ruling eleven millions of people and twelve hundred different islandseach one of which , I have no doubt it will be contemplated , shall have a governor of its own and a staff and all the rest  --  and then we get a picture of the realm of appointments into which the modern legislator will enter with keen and new delight . And w'hat of us who are behind him , who have to pay the bills ? Ah , yes ; not merely that , but who have to feel the reflex influence of a condition of things in which a vast body of men discharge a responisibihity , under conditions so remote and so unobserved by the public eye that it will practically be utterly impossible for us to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their own reports . If we could export the body of newspaper correspondents to the Philippines ; if we could transfer two or three journals that we have in New York , of the yellow character , to that yellow climate , and have them send back pictures of the lives of these gentlemen who are to hold office there under the Government of the United States , we should doubtless have a good deal of picturesque and interesting , but not very encouraging , reading . But , as a matter of fact , we shall have a situation precisely such as that // which existed in India a hundred years ago , with its enormo*us vices and enormous corruptions . Yes , it may be said , but that is a most infelicitous allusion ; for England , in its colonial administration , cleared itself of the stains which disfigured its early history in India and elsewhere . So it did . But it did so because it had behind it the steady growth of a public sentiment , which made official unfaithfulness under such conditions , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question which I ask myself , with doubt and apprehension , is , whether we may dare to hope that we shall develop a public opinion of that kind , and whether the experience which we have had already affords us the smallest encouragement to anticipate any such result ? Then , what relations are these peoples in the future to sustain to us ? I shall not attempt to touch the question of the immediate problems which will confront us , if we undertake the possesssion and the government , say , of the Philippine Islands . Whether we hold them or let them go , undoubtedly , for a time , we shall be obliged to keep order there . But if we hold them permanently , we can only hold them under one condition , and that a condition incorporated in our constitutional law , which is , that every man born within the territory of the United States is a citizen of the United States . In three generations , in other words , we shall have in the Philippine Islands twelve millions of citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in New York or San Francisco , unless we reconstruct the foundations of our republic so as to have a vassal class who shall be in us but not of us ; who , though they are born on our soil , shall be denied what is the irrefmagable right of everybody else who is born on it . When we have got these twelve millions or thirteen millions , or so , of citizens , it will be an extremely interesting question to ask , What effect are they going to have upon the future civilization of the country ? We have been talking a great deal about the " open door " lately , and I confess I have n't yet got a satisfactory definition of it . There is one fact , however , about the open door that is undoubtedly true , and that is , that it is a door that will swing bout ways It will not only let people out of the United States into the Philippine Islands-perhaps , under especially favorable and exceptional conditions-hut it will let people out of the Philippine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies *Thi* , that vast empire , with its teeming populations and // its tremendous possibilities of interference in the history of the future . I do not believe that as yet we have at all calculated those possibilities . I was crossing the Mediterranean a few years ago with an English officer , who was coming home on leave from India , and we were talking one day about China . Said he , " Did you ever realize what a menace China is to European civilization ? " I said , " No . " " Well , " said he , " China has been shut within its four walls , so to speak , for all these centuries , but they are tumbling down now . It is building railroads ; it is going to build more ; it has n't got on as far or as fast as the Japanese , but it is beginning to learn Western ways , and it is likely to go on learning them . Now , then , there are four hundred millions of people in China . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to do it , and had the manufactories of arms with which to do it , and the men trained as they might easily be trained , as they are being trained to-day , you know , in Turkey , by European officers , with whom to do it-China could put uudcr arms ? Have you ever stopped to consider what it would require , in the shape ol an armed force , to resist the invasion of Europe by China over the Tartar steppes into Iiussia , and so on down into Germany , if once the Chinese could make up their minds to come ? We talk of the armies of Germany , and of iRussia , and of France ; but , if you lump them all together , and add the troops of England and America to them , the Chinese could put into the field , for they have the human beings-which , after all , is the last requirementan army that could wipe out the whole crowd . " Now , we are putting ourselves , when we take hold of the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Oriental power , and it is our duty to consider , before we do it , what the door is that we are about to open in this way , and what that is which will come through that door when it is opened . I do not think that that is the path along which Providence beckons us to walk . It may be the path of bigness , but it is not the path of greatness . What is the path of greatness ? It is the path of great ideas ; government of the people , by the people and for the people . " A just government is that which exists with the consent of the governed , " is our historic definition . But neither of these things could we possibly have under the conditions of the populations that occupy the Philippine Islands to-day . On the other hand , // NATIONAL BiGNESS OR GREATNESS-WhICH ? 439 what is it that has mgde us great , not alone here , but in the eyes of all the world ? First of all , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our defects we have furnished to the world so fine and high an illustration of the ideal of government by the people . We have , so to speak , destroyed the monarchical concept of government in the minds of the great mass of intelligent people all around the world , and that Engand exists to-day as a monarchy is true , not because England is a monarchy in fact , but a monarchy only in name . It sounds like a tremendous exaggeration , but it is absolutely true that the sovereign who sits upon the throne of that great empire does not begin to have the personal power and authority with which the American people , under the principle of our form of government and under the experience of a century or more , are willing to entrust to their own President . Nothing could be finer than the demonstration of the faith of a great people iii a great system which we have given during these hundred years . By what we have been and what we have achieved we have vindicated the republican idea , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constantly increasing and prosperous and peaceful possessions . But a nation does not touch other nations alone by its forms of government , or by that exemplary method , so to speak , by means of which it illustrates what is excellent in its principles of government . It does so , also , in other ways , which as yet we ourselves , I think , have only imperfectly recognized . It does so by what it achieves in the domains of commerce and of letters and of art , and the like . And who in these things , in some of them most certainly , is the teacher of the world to-day ? Was there ever a people , since the world began , that has demonstrated such an astonishing ingenuity for the surmounting of all problems and obstacles , as has been illustrated in the history of the United States of America ? Go where we will , all around the world , we shall find the world acknowledging its indebtedness to the ingenuty of American engineers and inventors and constructors of every type and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around the world , wherever men know English speech and read English written books , we shall find the footprints of our American literature . Let an American get out at a little station anywhere along the road , on the IRhine , or in Austria , or wherever he may be , and he will find that delightful and charming series of publications // 440 known as the " Tauchnitz " editions , which those of us who are not familiar with foreign tongues welcome so eagerly in our long and lonely journeys ; and he may note the constantly increasing proportion of American literature which is represented in that various and most valuable collection ot good reading . Who was it who asked in England little more than a quarter of a century ago , " Who reads an American book ? " The question is to-day , " Who does n't read an American book ? " And the charm , the freshness , the fidelity , the interest , the picturesqueness of our American literature , its educative quality in the realm of the imagination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge wherever I have met scholars , and wherever we have discussed the question of English letters . Let us now go up into the domain of morals , of conduct . We regard the peace and the safety of the individual in different nations as the standard of the prevalence of high ideas of law . Is it not a notable fact that , from sea to seas and from extremest north to extremest south , we have nowhere anybody who is patroling a castle , or guarding a house , or protecting a family , or a railway station , or anything else , with a musket and a bayonet ? The moment one goes on to the continent of Europe , one is struck with the great fact of militarism . One goes into Italy , and one finds the country roads patrolled by bands of military , and one is told that the traveler would not be safe without such protection . But in this country we have made life and property so secure that with the assistance  --  the very dubious assistance , I confess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are both at peace and in safety . And then , in another way , as a witness to our standards in commercial matters , look at the history of our American products . How much the integrity of our work in those deptirtments has had to do with establishing standards in other parts ot the world ! Not a great while ago , there sat in London a commission of gentlemen appointed by royal authority , whose business it was to make a collection of the food products prepared for shipment and for transportation all around the globe-what we should call canned goods , I suppose , and prepared meats and so on -- which were manufactured and put up by the people of four or five great countries . One of them was England , one France , one Germany , one Holland , and one the United States . Americ*ns might well be proud of the report of that commissbrn . First , in the // standard of deterioration or of adulteration , rather , there came H olland ; next France , next Germany , next England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of the United States of America . That was soniething which translated itself , as an indication of our standards of honesty , all around the world . Wherever a man got a package of prepared food from the United States of America , he found the product what it professed to be. * These are the ways , and ways like them-commerce , literature , conduct , tradein which I see our sphere for a true expansion . Then , finally , I may call attention to the splendid work which has been done by Americans , in various lands and of various names and coinmunions , in the way of missions  --  the unselfishness of it , the heroism of it . The little band , and their successors , who went out front under the apple tree at Williams College ; Judson 's work in Burmah ; and the work of American men in China and Africa-these are the things which have interpreted us to the rest of the world , and these are the things which are the true niotes of a nation 's greatness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is all very well for the past . But what are we going to do now ? Whether we were wise or not in getting some sort of a grip upon these distant possessions , wc can not let them go ; we can not abandon them to their fate ; we can not turn our backs upon them and let them perish . " Here I wish to present an idea which may appear very bold , but which is the one suggestion which I should like to make in view of the existing situation . We have certainly achieved a position , in our relations to the rest of the world , which is absolutely unprecedented in our history . It may be almost said that we are in a position to dictate terms to individual nations , and that , if we should affiliate ourselves with that power beyond the sea in whose land are the roots of a great many of our people , we should certainly be able to dictate terms to most of the rest of the world . The Anglo-American alliance has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can readily understand that , to one who looks at the question fronm a purely selfish standpoint , it would seem to be the best possible thing that we could do to-day . But I think there is another and a better view above it . What we want all around the world is a system of international government . What // we want to create to-day is the highest court of appeal , that court of appeal to which nations could take their differences and their problems for final adjudication . In a very remarkable little book , entitled " World Politics , " is a line of historic criticism and suggestion which impresses me as singularly original , and in which occurs something of that which I have in mind . Go over the histcry of the development of government out of the primitive and aboriginal forms of society . See how it climbed up from the club and brutal force , both in the community and in the state , to some kind of organized life , and something that represented order . See bow this ascended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hand of brute power , but which acquiesced in rulings and judgments which were the voice of an authority created by the state itself . We have got that far ; and now , I believe , with our prestige and our position entirely outside the local quarrels of the rest of the civilized world , we are so situated as to be able to propose a still higher step to the rest of the world ; to say to them : " Men and brethren , you have been settling your differences for a long time by what might be called the Queensberry ilules . " These are , I believe , the rules which regulate the force , and the conditions , and the frequency and the places and things , in and with which one pugilist may hit another . Now , I am at a loss to distinguish any essential difference between that and the mo4ern concept of war . They are both equally brutal ; and they both aim at substantially the same results , except that war is infinitely more destructive and appalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the history of the world when we can go up above that ? Have we not reached the stage when it will be worth while for some great nation , so great that her suggestions and proposals shall command respect , to say to the other nations of the world : " Let us have done with the business of butchery . Let us see if we can not , somehow or other , constitute a tribunal , to which questions of the kind which have been settled hitherto by slaughtering men and burning towns a destroying property , shall be referred for adjudication ; and now , as evidence of our sinceritv in making that proposition , when you with us have created such a tribunal , let us bring to it this question of the Philippines . It is far more your business than ours . You have got a great deal more to do with it , from your geographical proximity , from your trade interests , from your relations of populations and colonies // and the like , than we have . Come and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , how we shall share the responsibility of administering this sacred trust , if we will so regard it , for the best interests of those whose well being we are to guard and promote . " " Ah , " replies somebody , " that is all very fine . But it is absolutely visionary . " It is not visionary . It i*-what we have been doing already . In 1814 , when the Congress of Paris uttered the deliverance in regard to the infamy of human slavery , it struck the first note , as I believe , in that great movement in England and in France which issued in the emancipation of the slave . Consider , again , what has been done by tribunals of arbitration in the matter of the extradition of criminals , which has resulted in one of the most remarkable steps in the interest of international justice which have ever been taken by the world , and which fixes the fact that , so far as this extradition treaty is recognized , no criminal can outrun the law or the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in precisely the same way . Take another and very practical illustration-what is called the Postal Union . Here was something which seemed inconceivably difficult at the beginning . Take the one element of the division of returns . When that was discussed in the Postal Union , a gentleman in England who was concerned in it told me that the question which perplexed tbe most , after they had got so far as to believe that the thing was at all practicable by reason of the willingness of nations to ecucur in it , was the question of how they should make returns to the different nations , on some basis of equity-how they should keep the international accounts of postage , and so on . They cut the knot very simply , at last , by deciding that every nation should keep , much or little , the money that it took , and they said that they believed that the principle of the Postal Union was worth a pecuniary sacrifice of that sort . It was . It was worth it , because it was such a splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many interests , can do if they choose to do it , for the common good . T rejoice to remember that , in some respects , the most picturesque illustration of this principle that has been had in modern times , or in any time , was had in our own Washington in the year 1889 . The great international maritime congress settled , finally , the rule of the road at sea , determined what lights should be carried ; what rules should regulate // dealing with derelicts , with ships that were in danger ; what general principles should govern the commerce and the communications of nations , by means of ships of whatever sort in whatever sea , all around the world . When we did that in Washington we showed over those dark waters the way for the rest of the world . I believe we have reached a point , in connection with the great and grave question which confronts us to-day , when we may flash out our signals , and light the pathway down the glowing track of the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
