Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : SONG OF THE FREE . from The poetical works of John Greenleaf Whittier 1891 Pride of New England ! Soul of our fathers ! Shrink we all craven-like , When the storm gathers ? What though the tempest be Over us lowering , Where 's the New-Englander Shamefully cowering ? Graves green and holy Around us are lying ,  --  Free were the sleepers all , Living and dying ! Back with the Southerner 's Padlocks and scourges ! Go ,  --  let him fetter down Ocean 's free surges ! Go ,  --  let him silence Winds , clouds , and waters , Never New England 's own Free sons and daughters ! Free as our rivers are Ocean-ward going ,  --  Free as the breezes are Over us blowing . Up to our altars , then , Haste we , and summon Courage and loveliness , Manhood and woman ! Deep let our pledges be : Freedom forever ! Truce with oppression , Never , oh ! never ! By our own birthright-gift , Granted of Heaven ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If we have whispered truth , Whisper no longer ; Speak as the tempest does , Sterner and stronger ; Still be the tones of truth Louder and firmer , Startling the haughty South With the deep murmur ; God and our charter 's right , Freedom forever ! Truce with oppression , Never , oh ! never !
