CHEERFUL YESTERDAYS . VII . KANSAS AND JOHN BROWN . COMING into Boston Harbor in September , 1856 , after a long and stormy passage in a sailing vessel from the island of Fayal , the passengers , of whom I was one , awaited with eager interest the arrival of the pilot . He proved to be one of the most stolid and reticent of his tribe , as impenetrable to our curiosity as were his own canvas garments to raindrops . At last , as if to shake us off , he tugged from some remote pocket a torn fragment of a daily newspaper , large enough to set before our eyes at a glance the momentous news of the assault on Charles Sumner in the United States Senate , and of the blockading of the Missouri River against Free State emigrants . Arrived on shore , my immediate party went at once to Worcester ; and the public meeting held by my friends to welcome me back became also a summons to call out volunteer emigrants for Kansas . Worcester had been thoroughly wakened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emigrant Aid Society , which had done much good by directing public attention to the opportunities offered by Kansas , though the enterprise had already lost some momentum by the obvious limitations of its method of " organized emigration . " It had been shown that it was easy to get people to go together to a new colony , but hard to keep them united after they got there , since they could not readily escape the American impulse to disregard organization and go to work , each for himself ; this desire being as promptly visible in the leaders as in anybody else . Moreover , it seemed necessary to arm any party of colonists more openly and thoroughly than had been the policy of the Emigrant Aid Society ; and so a new movement became needful . A committee was appointed , of which I was secretary , with a view to sending a series of parties from Worcester ; and of these we in the end furnished three . First , however , I was sent to St. Louis to nicet a party of Massachusetts emigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the river by the Missourians , or " Border Ruffians , " as they had then begun to be called . I was charged with funds to meet the necessities of this body , and was also to report on the practicability of either breaking the river blockade or flanking it . A little inquiry served to show that only the latter method would as yet be available . Events moved rapidly ; a national committee was soon formed , with headquarters at Chicago , and it was decided to send all future emigrants across Iowa and Nebraska , fighting their way , if necessary , into Kansas . Our three parties , accordingly , went by that route ; the men being provided with rifles , revolvers , and camp equipage . Two of these parties made their rendezvous in Worcester , one under command of my friend Stowell ; the third party was formed largely of Maine lumbermen , recruited in a body for the service . I never saw thirty men of finer physique , as they strode through Boston in their red shirts and rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been kindly lent us for the purpose . The rest of the men came to us singly , from all over New England , some of the best being from Vermont , including William Thompson , afterwards John Brown 's son - in - law , killed at Harper 's Ferry . I have never ceased to regret that all the correspondence relating to these companies , though most carefully preserved for years , was // finally lost through a casualty , and they must go forever unrecorded ; hut it was all really a rehearsal in advance of the great enlistments of the Civil War . The men were personally of as high a grade as the later recruits , perhaps even higher ; they were of course mostly undisciplined , and those who had known something of military service - as in the Mexican War , for instance - were usually the hardest to manage , save and except the stalwart lumbermen , who were from the beginning a thorn in the flesh to the worthy Orthodox Congregational clergyman whom it became necessary to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to me that if I had any lingering doubts of the doctrine of total depravity , I had better organize another party of Maine lumbermen and pilot them to Kansas . Sympathy was certainly due to him ; and yet I should have liked to try the experiment . Being appointed as an agent of the National Kansas Committee , I went out in September , 1856 , to meet and direct this very party , and others - including several hundred men - which had been collected on the Nebraska border . The events of the six weeks following were described by me in a series of letters , signed " Worcester , " in the New York Tribune , and later collected in a pamphlet entitled A Ride through Kansas . It was a period when history was being made very rapidly , - a period which saw a policy of active oppression at last put down and defeated , although backed by the action or sustained by the vacillation of the national government . The essential difference between the Northern and the Southern forces in Kansas at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fide settlers , and the Southerners mainly to break up elections and so make it a Slave Territory . Every member of our Worcester parties signed a pledge to settle in Kansas , and nearly all kept it . On the other hand , the parties from South Carolina and Virginia , whom I afterwards encountered , had gone there situply on a lark , meaning to return home when it was over , as they freely admitted . This difference of material , rather than any superiority of organization , was what finally gave Kansas to freedom . The end of Western railway communication was then Iowa City , in Iowa , and those who would reach Kansas had six hundred miles farther to walk or ride . I myself rode across Iowa for four days and nights on the top of a stagecoach , in the path of my emigrants , - watching the sun go down blazing , and sometimes pear-shaped , over the prairie horizon , just as it goes down beyond the ocean , and then seeing it rise in the same way . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed as if I had crossed the continent . The village bearing this sonorous name had been known as Council Bluffs until within a short time , and in my school geography had figured as the very outpost of the nation . Once arrived there , I felt as bewildered as a little boy on the Canadian railway who , when the conductor announced the small village called London , waked from a doze and exclaimed in my hearing , " Do we really pass through London , that great city ? " One of the first needful duties was to visit our party of lumbermen and restore peace , if possible , between them and their officers . For this purpose I made my first stump speech , in a literal sense , standing on a simple pedestal of that description , and reasoning with the mutineers to the best of my ability . They had behaved so like grown-up children that I fear my discourse was somewhat in the line adopted in later years by a brilliant woman of my acquaintance , whose son had got into a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter over with him ? " " Certainly , " she said eagerly . " I reasoned with him . I said to him , L , you are a great fool ! ' " It was not necessary to be quite so plain-spoken in this case ; and as // I was fortified by the fact of having all their means of subsistence in a moneybelt about my waist , the advantage was clearly on my side , and some order was finally brought out of chaos . Soon after arriving I had to drive from Nebraska City to Tabor , over about twenty miles of debatable ground , absolutely alone , on an errand . It had been swept by the hostile parties of both factions ; there was no more law than in the Scottish Highlands ; every swell of the rolling prairie offered a possible surprise , and I had some of the stirring sensations of a moss-trooper . Never before in my life had I been , distinctively and unequivocally , outside of the world of human law ; it had been ready to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ceased to exist ; my Sharp 's rifle , my revolvers , - or , these failing , my own ingenuity and ready wit , - were all the protection I had . It was a delightful sensation ; I could quote to myself from Browning 's magnificent soliloquy in Colombe 's Birthday : - " When is man strong until he feels alone ? " and there came to mind some thrilling passages from Mackay 's Ballads of the Cavaliers and Roundheads or from the Jacobite Minstrelsy . On this very track a carrier had been waylaid and killed by the Missourians only a few days before . The clear air , the fresh breeze , gave an invigorating delight , impaired by nothing but the yellow and muddy streams of that region , which seemed to my New England eye such a poor accompaniment for the land of the free . Tabor itself was then known far and wide as a Free State town from the warm sympathy of its people for the struggles of their neighbors , and I met there with the heartiest encouragement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nebraska City was miserable enough ; the beds being fearfully dirty , the food indigestible , and the table eagerly beset by three successive relays of men . One day a commotion took place in the street : people ran out to the doors ; and some thirty rough-riders came cantering up to the hostelry . They might have been border raiders , for all appearance of cavalry order : some rode horses , some mules ; some had bridles , others had lariats of rope ; one man had on a slight semblance of uniform , and seemed a sort of lieutenant . The leader was a thin man of middle age , in a gray woolen shirt , with keen eyes , smooth tongue , and a suggestion of courteous and even fascinating manners ; a sort of Prince Rupert of humbler grade . This was the then celebrated Jim Lane , afterwards Senator James H. Lane , of the United States Congress ; at this time calling himself only " Major - General commanding the Free State Forces of Kansas . " He was now retreating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders of the new United States governor , Geary , who was making an attempt , more or less serious , to clear Kansas of all armed bands . Lane stopped two days in Nebraska City , and I did something towards renewing the clothing of his band . He made a speech to the citizens of the town , - they being then half balanced between anti-slavery and pro-slavery sympathies , - and I have seldom heard eloquence more thrilling , more tactful , better adjusted to the occasion . Mr. R. W. Emerson , I remember , was much impressed by a report of this speech as sent by me to some Boston newspaper . Lane went with me , I think , to see our emigrants , encamped near by ; gave me some capital suggestions as to our march into the Territory ; and ended by handing me a bit of crumpled paper , appointing me a member of his staff with the rank of brigadier-general . As I rode out of Nebraska City on the march , next day , my companion , Samuel F. Tappan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually a similar bit of paper in his own possession ; and we thus found that the Kansas guerrilla // leader carried out the habit of partisan chiefs in all history , who have usually made up in titles and honors what they could not bestow in actual emoluments . After this discovery Tappan and I rode on in conscious inward importance , a sort of dignity &amp; deux , yet not knowing but that at any moment some third brigadier-general might cross our path . We accompanied and partially directed the march of about a hundred and sixty men , with some twenty women and children . There were twenty-eight wagons , all but eight being drawn by horses . The nightly tents made quite an imposing encampment ; while some of the men fed and watered the stock , others brought wood from far and near , others cleaned their rifles , others prepared the wagons for sleeping ; the cooks fried pork and made bread ; women with their babies sat round the fire ; and a saddler brought out his board and leather every night and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch for an hour , striding in thick boots through the prairie grass heavy with frost . Danger had always to be guarded against , though we were never actually attacked ; and while we went towards Kansas , we met armed parties day after day fleeing from it , hopeless of peace . When at last we reached the Kansas River , we found on its muddy banks nineteen wagons with emigrants , retreating with heavy hearts from the land of promise so eagerly sought two years before . " The Missourians could not conquer us , " they said , " but Governor Geary has . " On my first morning in Lawrence , Kansas , I waked before daybreak , and looking out saw the house surrounded by dragoons , each sitting silent on his horse . This again was a new experience in those ante-bellum days . A party of a hundred and fifty of these men had been sent to intercept us , we learned , under the command of Colonel Preston and Captain Walker of the United States Army ; the latter , luckily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , I went with Charles Robinson , the Free State governor , and James Redpath for a half-amicable , half-compulsory interview with the actual governor , Geary ; and we parted , leaving everything undecided , - indeed , nothing ever seemed to be decided in Kansas ; the whole destiny of the Territory was one of drifting , until it finally drifted into freedom . Yet in view of the fact that certain rifles which we had brought , and which had been left at Tabor , Iowa , for future emergencies , were the same weapons which ultimately armed John Brown and his men at Harper 's Ferry , it is plain that neither Governor Geary 's solicitude nor the military expedition of Colonel Preston was at all misplaced . I formed that day a very unfavorable impression of Governor Geary , and a favorable one of Governor Robinson , and lived to modify both opinions . The former , though vacillating in Kansas , did himself great credit afterwards in the Civil War ; while the latter did himself very little credit in Kansas politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foster . Jealousy of the influence of Brown , Lane , and Montgomery led him in later years to be chiefly responsible for that curious myth concerning the Kansas conflict which has wholly taken possession of many minds , and has completely perverted the history of that State written by Professor Spring , a theory to the effect that there existed from the beginning among the Free State people two well-defined parties , the one wishing to carry its ends by war , the other by peace . As a matter of fact there was no such division . In regard to the most extreme act of John Brown 's Kansas career , the so-called " Pottawatomie massacre " of May 24 , 1856 , I can testify that in September of that year there appeared to be but one way of thinking among the Kansas Free State men , this being precisely the fact pointed out by // Colonel William A. Phillips in his Conquest of Kansas , which is altogether the best and fairest book upon the confused history of that time and place . I heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its beneficial effects were universally asserted ; Governor Robinson himself fully indorsing it to me , and maintaining , like the rest , that it had given an immediate check to the armed aggressions of the Missourians . It is certain that at a public meeting held at Lawrence , Kansas , three years later ( December15 , 1859 ) , Robinson supported resolutions saying that the act was done " from sad necessity ; " that on August 30 , 1877 , at the unveiling of Brown 's monument at Osawatomie , he compared Brown to Jesus Christ ; and that on February 5 , 1878 , he wrote in a letter to James Hanway , " I never had much doubt that Captain Brown was the author of the blow at Pottawatomie , for the reason that he was the only man who comprehended the situation and saw the absolute necessity of some such blow and had the nerve to strike it . " Personally , I have never fully reconciled myself to this vindication of " the blow ; " but that Charles Robinson , after justifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the Territory ( Brown , Lane , Montgomery ) were dead , should have begun to pose as a non-resistant , and should later have spoken of " the punishment due Brown for his crimes in Kansas , " - this appears to me to have been either simply disgraceful , or else the product of a disordered mind . The people in Lawrence had been passing through a variety of scenes of danger and discomfort before the arrival of our party ; and though the Missouri attacks had practically ceased , their effects remained in the form of general poverty and of privations as to food , especially as regarded breadstuffs . The hotel and Governor Robinson 's house had been burned , as well as many mills and bridges ; some of the best citizens were in jail as prisoners of state , and their families were really suffering . When I visited these prisoners at Lecompton , one man reported to me that he had left six children at home , all ill , and his wife accidentally away and unable to get back ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after them . " Another had in his arms his crying baby , said to be the first child born in Lawrence , and named after the settlement . Such imprisonment was the lot of more than a hundred of the Free State men . In the more rural regions - though everything in Kansas was then rural , but treeless - there was a perpetual guerrilla warfare going on in a vague and desultory way ; and the parties were so far ( lefined that their labels attached even to dumb animals , and people spoke of an anti-slavery colt or a pro-slavery cow . Several of us visited , near Blanton 's Bridge , the ruins of a large mill , built by a Pennsylvanian named Straub . We met there his daughter , who was a noble - looking girl of twenty , but rather needlessly defiant in manner , as we thought , till at last she said frankly , " Why , I thought you were Missourians , and I was resolved that you should hear the truth . " We being three to one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this girl had walked alone into the midst of the Missourians , while the mill was burning , and had called on one of them to give up her favorite horse which he had taken . This she did with such spirit that his comrades compelled him to dismount and surrender it . She mounted it and was riding away , when the man followed and attempted to get the halter from her hand ; she held on ; ho took his bowie - knife and threatened to cut her hand off ; she dared him to do it ; he cut the rope close to her hand and got control of the horse . She slipped off , defeated ; but presently two of the fellow 's companions rode up and gave her the horse once more . It was a time when // a horse was worth more than a life in Kansas , and we can estimate the completeness of the triumph . As I had been urged to preach to the people of Lawrence , it seemed well to take for my text that which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had fought at Bunker Hill : " Be not ye afraid of them ; remember the Lord , which is great and terrible , and fight for your brethren , your sons , and your daughters , your wives , and your houses . " Riding a few days after to Leavenworth , then a " Border Ruffian " town , to witness an election under the auspices of that faction , I found myself in a village provided with more than fifty liquor shops for two thousand inhabitants , while the doors of the hotel were almost barricaded with whiskey casks . Strangers were begged to take a hand in the voting , as if it were something to drink ; I was several times asked to do this , and my plea that I was only a traveler was set aside as quite irrelevant . Many debated on the most available point at which to cast their pro-slavery votes - for the Free State men denied the validity of the election and would not vote at all - as coolly as a knot of village shopkeepers might debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once the conversation began to grow rather personal . Said one man , just from Lecompton , " Tell you what , we ye found out one thing : there s a preacher going about here preaching politics . " " Fact ? " and " Is that so ? " were echoed with virtuous indignation on all sides . " That s so , " continued he , " and he fixes it this way : first , he has his text and preaches religion ; then he drops that , and pitches into politics ; and then he drops that too , and begins about the sufferin ' niggers " ( this with ineffable contempt ) . " And what s more , he s here in Leavenworth now . " " What s his name ? " exclaimed several eagerly . " Just what I do n't know , " was the sorrowful reply , " and I should n't know him if I saw him ; but he s here , boys , and in a day or two there 11 be some gentlemen here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence I had been warned that three Missouri spies were present . ) " It s well we ye got him here , to take care of him , " said one . " Wo n't our boys enjoy running him out of town ? " added another affectionately ; while I listened with dubious enjoyment , thinking that I might perhaps afford useful information . But the " gentlemen " did not appear , or else were in search of higher game ; and I was to leave town that night , at any rate , for St. Louis . I took the steamer Cataract on October 9 , 1856 , and went down the river ; my chief companions being a large party of youths from Virginia and South Carolina , who had come into the Territory of Kansas confessedly to take a hand in the election , and also in the fighting , should a chance be offered . They were drunken , gambling , quarrelsome boys , but otherwise affable enough , with the pleasant manners and soft accent of the South . Nothing could be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said one , with a sort of tender regret , " how when we went up the river we were all of us drunk all the time ? " " So we would be now , " replied his friend sadly , only we ai n't got no money . " They said that they had been inveigled into coming by Atchison and others , on the promise of support for a year and fifty dollars bonus , but that they had got neither , and had barely enough to take them to St. Louis . " Let me once get home , " said the same youth who made the above confession , " and I d stay at home , sure . It has cost me the price of one good figger just for board and liquor , since I left home . " Curiously enough , in reading a copy of Mrs. Stowe 's Dred , just published , which I had bought in Lawrence , I opened soon after on the apt Scriptural quotation , " Woe unto them , for they have cast lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl for wine , that they may drink ! " // The few Free State men on board were naturally not aggressive , although we spent a whole day on a sand-bank , a thing not conducive to serenity of mind ; but the steamer which pulled us off had on board the secretary of the Kansas State Committee , Miles Moore , and there had been an effort to lynch him , prevented only by Governor Cobb , of Alabama , who was on the boat . Renewal of hostilities being threatened , I invited Moore on board the Cataract at Jefferson City , where we lay overnight . He and I barricaded ourselves in my stateroom , with our revolvers ready , but heard only occasional threats from outside ; there was no actual assault . When we reached St. Louis , - after more than four days on board the steamboat , - and I finally discharged my revolver and put it away in my trunk , there occurred the most curious reaction from the feeling with which I had first loaded it . When it fully came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last six weeks was ended , and that thenceforward , if any danger impended , the proper thing would be to look meekly about for a policeman , it seemed as if all the vigor had suddenly gone out of me , and a despicable effeminacy had set in . I could at that moment perfectly understand how Rob Roy , wishing to repay a debt he owed to the Edinburgh professor , offered to take his benefactor 's son back into the Highlands " and make a man of him . " In twenty-four hours , however , civilization reassuined its force , and Kansas appeared as far off as Culloden . After returning home , I kept up for a long time an active correspondence with some of the leading Kansas men , including Montgomery , Hinton , my old ally Martin Stowell , and my associate brigadier , Samuel F. Tappan , afterwards lieutenant-colonel of the First Colorado Cavalry . Some of these wrote and received letters under feigned names , because many of the post-offices in the Territory were in the hands of pro-slavery men who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas matters , by request , before the legislatures of Massachusetts and Vermont , and was nominated by the Worcester Republicans for the state legislature on the issue of Kansas sympathy ; but declined , feeling that I had tested to the last degree the claim of the Free Church on my attention . I was brought much in contact with that noble and self-devoted man , George Luther Stearns , of Medford , who gave , first and last , ten thousand dollars to maintain liberty in the new Territory ; and also with Dr. Howe and Frank Sanborn , then the leading men in the Massachusetts Kansas Committee . In looking back on the inevitable confusion of that period , and the strange way in which men who had been heroic in danger grew demoralized in politics , I have often recalled as true the remark made by Sanborn , that it was difficult for a man to have much to do with the affairs of Kansas , even at long range , without developing a crack in his brain . It will doubtless seem to some readers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later events which brought some of the above-named men into intimate relations with Captain John Brown . It has never been quite clear to me whether I saw him in Kansas or not ; he was then in hiding , and I remember to have been taken somewhat covertly to a house in Lawrence , for an interview with a fugitive slave who was being sheltered by a white man ; and though this man 's name , which I have forgotten , was certainly not Brown , it may have been one of Brown 's aliases . My first conscious acquaintance with that leader was nearly a year and a half later , when I received from him this communication , implying , as will be seen , that we had met before - RocHEsrEx , N. Y. 2d Feb'y , 1858 . M* DEAR Sin , - I am here concealm*ng my whereabouts for good reasons // ( as I think ) not however from any anxiety about my personal safety . I have been told that you are both a true man : and a true abolitionist ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last fall I undertook to raise from $500 to $1000 , for secret service , and succeeded in getting $500 . I now want to get for the perfecting of BY FAR the most important undertaking of my whole life ; from $500 to $800 within the next sixty days . I have written Rev. Theodore Parker , George L. Stearns and F. B. Sanborn Esqrs. on the subject ; but do not know as either Mr. Stearns or Mr. Sanborn are abolitionists . I suppose they are . Can you be induced to opperate at Worcester and elsewhere during that time to raise from anti-slavery men and women ( or any other parties ) some part of that amount ? I wish to keep it entirely still about where I am ; and will be greatly obliged if you will consider this communication strictly confidential : unless it may be with such as you are sure will feel and act and keep very still . Please be so kind as to write N. Hawkins on the subject , Care of Win . I. Watkins , Esqr . Rochester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and talk matters more freely . Hope this is my last effort in the begging line . Very Respectfully your Friend , JOHN BROWN . This name , " N. Hawkins , " was Brown 's favorite alias . The phrase " partly believe " was a bit of newspaper slang of that period . I wrote in return , wishing for farther information , and asking if the " underground railroad " business was what he had in view . In a few days came this reply - ROCHESTER , N. Y. 12th Feb'y , 1858 . DEAR SIR , - I have just read your kind letter of the 8th inst. , and will now say that Rail Road business on a somewhat extended scale is the identical object for which Jam trying to get means . I have been connected with that business as commonly conducted from my boyhood and never let an opportunity slip . I have been opperating to some purpose the past season ; but I now have a measure on foot that I feel sure would awaken in you something more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just written my friends G. L. Stearns and F. B. Sanborn asking them to meet me for consultation at Gerrit Smith 's , Peterboro ' N. Y.. I am very anxious to have you come along ; certain as I feel , that you will never regret having been one of the council . I would most gladly pay your expenses had I the means to spare . Will you come on ? Please write as before . Your Friend JOHN BROWN . As I could not go to Peterboro ' , he made an appointment in Boston , and I met him in his room at the American House in March , 1858 . I saw before me a man whose mere appearance and bearing refuted in advance some of the strange perversions which have found their way into many books , and which have often wholly missed the type to which he belonged . In his thin , worn , resolute face there were the signs of a fire which might wear him out , and practically did so , but nothing of pettiness or baseness ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply a high-minded , unselfish , belated Covenanter ; a man whom Sir Walter Scott might have drawn , but whom such writers as Nicolay and Hay , for instance , have utterly failed to delineate . To describe him in their words as " clean but coarse is curiously wide of the mark ; he had no more of coarseness than was to be found in Habakkuk Mucklewrath or in George Eliot 's Adam Bede ; he had , on the contrary , that religious elevation which is itself a kind of refinement , - the quality one may see expressed in many a venerable Quaker face at yearly meeting . Coarseness absolutely repelled // him ; he was so strict as to the demeanor of his men that his band was always kept small , while that of Lane was large ; he had little humor , and none of the humorist 's temptation towards questionable conversation . Again , to call him " ambitious to irritation , " in the words of the same authors , is equally wide of the mark . I saw him afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final failure , but never could find in him a trace of mere ambition ; he lived , as he finally died , absolutely absorbed in one idea ; and it is as a pure enthusiast - fanatic , if you please - that he is to be judged . His belief was that an all-seeing God had created the Alleghany Mountains from all eternity as the predestined refuge for a body of fugitive slaves . He had traversed those mountains in his youth , as a surveyor , and knew points which could be held by a hundred men against a thousand ; he showed me rough charts of some of those localities and plans of connected mountain fortresses which he had devised . Of grand tactics and strategy Brown knew as little as Garibaldi ; but he had studied guerrilla warfare for himself in books , as well as in Europe , and had for a preceptor Hugh Forbes , an Englishman who had been a Garibaldian soldier . Brown 's plan was simply to penetrate Virginia with a few comrades , to keep utterly clear of all attempt to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fugitive slaves , and then be guided by events . If he could establish them permanently in those fastnesses , like the Maroons of Jamaica and Surinam , so much the better ; if not , he would make a break from time to time , and take parties to Canada , by paths already familiar to him . All this he explained to me and others , plainly and calmly , and there was nothing in it that we considered either objectionable or impracticable ; so that his friends in Boston - Theodore Parker , Howe , Stearns , Sanborn , and myself - were ready to coöperate in his plan as thus limited . Of the wider organization and membership afterwards formed by him in Canada we of course knew nothing , nor could we foresee the imprudence which finally perverted the attack into a defeat . We helped him in raising the money , and he seemed drawing toward the consummation of his plans , when letters began to come to his Massachusetts supporters from Hugh Forbes , already mentioned , threatening to make the whole matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . On this point our committee was at once divided , not as to refusing the preposterous demands , but because the majority thought that this threat of disclosure made necessary an indefinite postponement of the whole affair ; while Howe and myself , and Brown also , as it proved , thought otherwise . He came again to Boston ( May 31 , 1858 ) , when I talked with him alone , and he held , as I had done , that Forbes could do him no real harm ; that if people believed Forbes they would underrate his ( Brown 's ) strength , which was just the thing he wished ; or if they overrated it , " the increased terror would perhaps counterbalance this . If he had the means , he would not lose a day . " But as I could not , unaided , provide the means , I was obliged to yield , as he did . He consented to postpone the enterprise and return to Kansas , carrying with him $500 in gold , and an order for certain arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas Committee , but had since been transferred , in consideration of a debt , to our friend Stearns , who gave them to Brown on his own responsibility . Nearly a year now passed , during which I rarely heard from Brown , and thought that perhaps his whole project had been abandoned . A new effort was made at Boston in the spring of 1859 , but I took little part in it . It had all begun to seem to me rather chimerical . The amount of $2000 was , // nevertheless , raised for him at Boston , in June , 1859 , and I find that Sanborn wrote to me ( June 4 ) , " Brown has set out on his expedition ; " and then on October 6 , " The $300 desired has been made up and received . Four or five men will be on the ground next week from these regions and elsewhere . " Brown 's address was at this time at West Andover , Ohio , and the impression was that the foray would begin in that region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten days later the blow came . I went into a newspaper shop in Worcester one morning , and heard some one remark casually , " Old Osawatomie Brown has got himself into a tight place at last . " I grasped eagerly at the morning paper , and read the whole story . Naturally , my first feeling was one of remorse , that the men who had given him money and arms should not actually have been by his side . In my own case , however , the justification was perfectly clear . Repeated postponements had taken the edge off from expectation , and the whole enterprise had grown rather vague and dubious in my mind . I certainly had not that degree of faith in it which would have led tue to abandon all else , and wait nearly a year and a half for the opportunity of fulfillment ; and indeed it became obvious at last that this longer postponement had somewhat disturbed the delicate balance of the zealot 's mind , and had made him , at the very outset , defy the whole power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of Washington . Nothing of this kind was included in his original plans . At any rate , since we were not with him , the first question was what part we were now to take . It will be remembered that the explosion of the Brown affair caused at once a vast amount of inquiry at Washington , and many were the threats of prosecuting Brown 's previous friends and supporters . There was some talk of flight to Canada , and one or two of these persons actually went thither or to Europe . It always seemed to me undesirable to do this ; it rather looked as if , having befriended Brown 's plans so far as we understood them , it was our duty to stand our ground and give him our moral support , at least on the witness-stand . This view was perhaps easier for me to take , as my name was only incidentally mentioned in the newspapers ; and it is only within a few months that I have discovered that it had been early brought , with that of Sanborn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among his papers captured at Richmond by Major James Savage , of the Second Massachusetts Infantry , was this anonymous letter , received by the Virginia governor , and indorsed by him for transmission to some one else , probably in Congress , - but perhaps never forwarded . It read as follows : " There are two persons in Massachusetts , and I think only two , who , if summoned as witnesses , can explain the whole of Brown 's plot . Their names are Francis B. Sanborn , of Concord , and T. W. Higginson , of Worcester , Mass . No time should be lost , as they may abscond , but I do not think they will , as they think you would not think it best to send for them . A Friend of Order . " This was indorsed " A Friend to Gov . Wise , Oct. , 1859 . Call attention to this . " And just below , " Sent to me , now sent to you for what it is worth . Richmond , Oct. 29 , H. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a secretary . " This communication was written during the trial of Captain Brown , and a few days before his sentence , which was pronounced on November 2 . It is hard to say whether it had any direct bearing on the arrest of Sanborn at Concord in the following April . It is very probable that it had , and if so , his arrest , had it been sustained by the court , might have been followed by mine ; but it would have been quite superfluous , for I should at any time have been ready to go if summoned , and // should , in fact , have thought it rather due to the memory of Brown . I could at least have made it plain that anything like slave insurrection , in the ordinary sense of the word , was remote from his thoughts , and that his plan was wholly different . He would have limited himself to advising a fugitive slave , if intercepted , to shoot down any one who attempted to arrest him ; and this advice would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , of course , an immediate impulse to rescue Brown from prison . I do not know how far this extended , and can only vouch for myself . The primary obstacle to it was that one of Brown 's first acts , on meeting a Northern friend in his prison , had been positively to prohibit any such attempt ; the message being sent North by Judge Thomas Russell , from whom I received it at the railway station on his arrival . This barred the way effectually , for after Brown had taken that position he would have adhered to it . It occurred to me , however , that his wife 's presence would move him , if anything could , and that she might also be a valuable medium of conimunication , should he finally yield to the wishes of his friends . For this purpose I went to North Elba , New York , the mountain home of the Browns , to fetch her , and wrote , after that memorable trip , a full account of it , which was prefixed to Redpath 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superb scenery of the Adirondacks , I saw myself in a region which was a fit setting for the heroic family to be visited . I found them poor , abstemious , patient , unflinching . They felt that the men of their household had given their lives for freedom , and there was no weak regret , no wish to hold them back . In the family was Annie Brown , who had been with the conspirators in Virginia , and had kept house and cooked for them . There were also the widows of the two slain sons , young girls of sixteen and twenty , one of them having also lost two brothers at Harper 's Ferry . It illustrates the frugal way in which the Browns had lived that the younger of these two widows was not regarded by the household as being absolutely destitute , because her husband had left her five sheep , valued at two dollars apiece . On my return , Mrs. Brown the elder rode with me for a whole day on a buckboard to Keeseville , and I had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in contact with a nature more dignified and noble ; a Roman matron touched with the finer element of Christianity . She told me that this plan had occupied her husband 's thoughts and prayers for twenty years ; that he always believed himself an instrument in the hands of Providence , and she believed it , too . She had always prayed that he might be killed in fight rather than fall into the hands of slaveholders , but she " could not regret it now , in view of the noble words of freedom which it had been his privilege to utter . " She also said , " I have had thirteen children , and only four are left ; but if I am to see the ruin of my house , I can not but hope that Providence may bring out of it some benefit for the poor slaves . " She little foresaw how , within two years , her dead husband 's name would ring through the defiles of the Virginia mountains in the songs of the Union soldiers . When , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the railway-car , the newspaper containing his death-warrant , she bent her head for a few moments on the back of the seat before us , and then lifted it again unchanged . Her errand was absolutely in vain , Brown refusing even to see her , possibly distrusting his own firmness , or wishing to put it above all possibility of peril ; and she returned to her mountain home . Meanwhile , one of the few of his band who had escaped - Francis J. Merriam - had come to my door one day in Worcester . He was the only one among // the band who was of rather feeble intellect , and he would probably have had no place there but that he alone had money and furnished it liberally . When he reached my house , he appeared utterly demented after the danger and privations of his flight through the mountains . He could not speak two coherent sentences , and I was grateful when , after twenty-four hours , I could send him to his friends in Boston . Another and far abler refugee from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Worcester emigrants , - afterwards well known as Sergeant Charles Plummer of the Twenty-First Massachusetts , - who told me , in an interview on February 10 , 1860 , of which I have the written record , " All the boys oppo*ed Harper 's Ferry , the younger Browns most of all . In September it nearly broke up the camp . He himself Tidd left , almost quarreling with Brown . Finally , when they consented , it was with the agreement that men should be sent in each direction to burn bridges , " - which was not done , however . Tidd pronounced the Harper 's Ferry attack " the only mistake Brown ever made , " and attributed it , as it is now generally assigned , to a final loss of mental balance from overbrooding on one idea . Brown 's general project he still heartily indorsed ; saying that the Virginia mountains were " the best guerrilla country in the world , " - all crags and dense laurel thickets ; that " twenty-five men there could paralyze the whole business of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The negroes , he said , had proved ready enough to follow Brown , but naturally slipped back to their masters when they saw that the enterprise was to fail . The same question of a rescue presented itself , after Captain Brown 's execution , in regard to the two members of his party whose trial and conviction took place two months later , - Stevens and Hazlett , the former of whom I had met with Lane 's party in Kansas . In February , 1860 , after urgent appeals from Mrs. Rebecca Spring , of New York , who had visited these men , I made up my mind to use for their relief a portion of certain funds placed in my hands for the benefit of the Brown family ; first , of course , consulting Mrs. Brown , who fully approved . Thayer and Eldridge , two young publishers in Boston , also took an interest in raising funds for this purpose ; and the fact is fixed in my memory by the circumstance that , on visiting their shop one day , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Walt Whitman . He was there to consult them about the publication of his poems , and I saw before me , sitting on the counter , a handsome , burly man , heavily built , and not looking , to my gymnasium-trained eye , in really good condition for athletic work . I perhaps felt a little prejudiced against him from having read his Leaves of Grass on a voyage , in the early stages of seasickness , - a fact which doubtless increased for me the intrinsic unsavoriness of certain passages . But the personal impression made on me by the poet was not so much of manliness as of Boweriness , if I may coin the phrase ; indeed , rather suggesting Sidney Lanier 's subsequent vigorous phrase , " a dandy roustabout . " This passing impression did not hinder me from thinking of Whitman with hope and satisfaction at a later day when regiments were to be raised for the war , when the Bowery seemed the very place to enlist them , and even " Billy Wilson 's Zouaves " were hailed with delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , Whitman decided that the proper post for him was hospital service , I confess to feeling a reaction , which was rather increased than diminished by his profuse celebration of his own labors in that direction . Hospital attendance is a fine thing , no doubt , yet if all men , South and North , had taken the same view of their duty that Whitman held , there would have been no occasion for hospitals on either side . // The only persons beside myself who were intimately acquainted with the project formed for rescuing Stevens and Hazlett were Richard H. Hinton , already mentioned , and John W. LeBarnes , afterwards lieutenant of a German company in the Second Massachusetts Infantry during the Civil War . It was decided that an attempt at rescue could best be made from a rendezvous at Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , and that Hinton should go to Kansas , supplied with money by LeBarnes and myself , to get the coöperation of Captain James Montgomery and eight or ten tried and trusty men . I was to meet these men at Harrisburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among whom be had much influence , from New York . Only one man in Harrisburg , an active Abolitionist , knew of our purpose , and I met Montgomery at this man 's house , after taking up my own residence , on February 17 , 1860 , at the United States Hotel , under the name of Charles P. Carter . I had met the guerrilla leader once before in Kansas , and we now consulted about the expedition , which presented no ordinary obstacles . The enterprise would involve traversing fifty miles of mountain country by night , at the rate of about ten miles each night , carrying arms , ammunition , blankets , and a week 's rations , with the frequent necessity of camping without fire in February , and with the certainty of detection in case of snow . It would include crossing the Potomac , possibly at a point where there was neither a bridge nor a ford . It would culminate in an attack on a building with a wall fourteen feet high , with two sentinels outside and twenty-five inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , and then , if successful , with the need of retreating , perhaps with wounded men and probably by daylight . These were the difficulties that Montgomery , as our leader , had to face ; and although , in Kansas , he had taken Fort Scott with twenty-two men against sixtyeight , yet this was quite a different affair . For myself , I had at that time such confidence in his guidance that the words of the Scotch ballad often rang in my ears - " I could ha'e ridden the border through Had Christie Graeme been at my back . " Lithe , quick , low-voiced , reticent , keen , he seemed the ideal of a partisan leader , and was , indeed , a curious compound of the moss-trooper and the detective . Among his men were Carpenter , Pike , Seamans , Rice , Gardner , Willis , and Silas Soule , all well known in Kansas . The last three of these men had lately been among the rescuers of Dr. Doy from jail at St. Joseph , Missouri , - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar daring ; one of them personating a horse-thief and two others the officers who had arrested him , and thus getting admission to the jail . The first need was to make exploration of the localities , and , taking with him one of his companions , - a man , as it proved , of great resources , - Montgomery set out by night and was gone several days . While he examined the whole region , - his native Kentucky accent saving him from all suspicion ,  --  his comrade penetrated into the very jail , in the guise of a jovial , half-drunken Irishman , and got speech with the prisoners , who were thus notified of the proposed rescue . They expressed great distrust of it , and this partly because , even if successful , it would endanger the life of the jailer , Avis , who had won their gratitude , as well as Brown 's , by his great kindness . I have never known whether this opposition had any covert influence on the mind of Montgomery , but I know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by deciding that a severe snowstorm which had just occurred rendered the enterprise absolutely hopeless . I was not at the time quite satisfied with this opinion , but it was impossible to overrule our leader ; and on visiting that region and the jail // itself , many years later , I was forced to believe him wholly right . At any rate , it was decided by vote of the party to abandon the expedition , and the men were sent back to Kansas , their arms being forwarded to Worcester , while I went to Antioch , Ohio , to give a promised lecture to the college students , and then returned home . I now recognize how almost hopeless the whole enterprise had appeared in my own mind : the first entry in my notebook , after returning ( March 1 , 1860 ) , is headed with the words of that celebrated message in the First Book of Dickens 's A Tale of Two Cities , - " Recalled to Life .
