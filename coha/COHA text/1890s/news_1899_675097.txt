txt The attack on Gen. Miles made by Dr. P. S. Conner , a member of the War Investigation Commission , at a complimentary dinner given in honor of Dr. Conner 's return home from Washington last night , was a topic of general discussion in this city to-day . Dr. Conner 's position as a member of the commission rendered his statements of particular weight , especially that portion devoted to the exulting prophecy of Miles 's early downfall as a result of the deliberations of the Court of Inquiry about to assemble in Washington . The correspondent of THE NEW YORK TIMES is enabled to-night to seal an authentic report of what Dr. Conner actually said . The following signed statement was given out to-night : Some of the newspaper reports of my remarks on Tuesday evening are in a measure Incorrect and I beg that you will permit me to correct them . I did not state that " the Commanding General who , in the time of great importance . the time that meant much to the destiny of the United States and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying ' Beef ! " Beef ! ' should be dismissed from the army that he belongs to and not reduced in rank . " The statethent , and the whole statement , was that " it was not the first time in history that there was heard in the rear of a victorious army the discordant cry of ' Beef ! " Beef ' and In legal fashion cited . ' Henry vs . Hook , 1st Wirt. ? 61 . " No statement was made that the Major General commanding the army was " the only officer who belittled the efforts of the Adminlstration. and the War Department in particular , the only one who manifested any Jealousy . He disgraced the dignity and the honor of his exalted position . Again I say lie should be dismissed from the service " nor anything relating to these matters . I did say , and it is true , that the Major Gen -- eral commanding the army was the only witness before the commission who would neither swear nor affirm , and the only general officer before us who had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the army . Having expressed the oalnion that the commission was glad that there was to be a Board of Inquiry to investigate the matter of beef issue , and the hope that it would be able to ascertain all the facts . I hazarded the prediction that , " If the Board of Inquiry reaches the same conclusion as the War Investigating Committee , then the commanding General will be dismissed from the Army of the United States , " and I fully believe that this is a true statement of what will come . I have not the honor to represent the Administration or the War Department , and have not the slightest knowledge of what is thought by the President of the United States , the Secretary of War , or any one else in authority . Very respectfully , P. S. CONNER . Ex-Judge P. W. Moore , who served throughout the civil war and was later an officer in the regular army for a number of yea.rs , said to-day : " Dr. Conner 's conduct was outrageous . It is a shame that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a compromising position , appearing to countenance such malicious sentiments as those uttered by Conner . I can not see how Dr. Conner could so far forget his position EtS ? a , member of such an important body as the War Investigation Committee and corn ; promise himself and the city by denouncing the highest official of the great American Army before that cfficial has been charged with unofficial conduct , or has - had a chance to defend himself . Such conduct is inexcusable. and Gen. Miles would he justified in meeting the attack with hot ) : .. ad. rather than hot ? words . I certainly think that this may be considered as the voice of the Administration , and the whole affair is to be regretted . " There is a movement on foot among some of the most prominent citizens to invite Gen. Miles to a banquet here In appreciation of the work done by the American Army in the late war . Dr. Conner was asked to-night if he had anything to say in reply to the statement of Judge Moore . Hiq answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't care what he says . "
