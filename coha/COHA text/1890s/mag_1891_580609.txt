txt COMPULSORY ARBITRATION . ONE of the most striking features of our easy-going American character is a ready submission to the domination of our servants . Whether it be Bridget in the kitchen , the railway in our streets , or Congressmen in the Capitol at Washington , we meekly bear the arrogance of the powers of our own creation . In fact , a slight acquaintance with the daily press is sufficient to show that in the matter of public administration the change of relation is an accepted fact , // and we discuss at each succeeding election , not whether we shall employ Democrats or Republicans to serve us , but whether we shall submit to Democratic or to Republican rule . Now that we shall not have that question to settle for two years to come , is it not worth while to consider whether we shall continue to endure without effectual protest every inconvenience which our servants , the carrying corporations and their employees , inflict upon us ? These functionaries , who in our advanced civilization perform for the most of us on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes display an indifference to their duty of which even our cooks do not dream . If Bridget were to depart without a word of notice for a three days ' outing , she would expect her rights in our kitchen to cease forthwith ; but if our public coachmen , the railway companies , refusing to make terms with those in their employ , fail to perform their duties for a like period , we submit as tamely as they could wish . We grumble , to be sure , but the idea of calling these unfaithful stewards to account never enters the public mind . Indeed , in discussing the merits of disputes between its servants and those whom they hire to do their work , the public appears to forget that it has any rights of its own in the matter . Yet the right of the State to interfere is , in truth , unquestionable , resting on the fact that the carrying corporations have received peculiar privileges , by their own petition , from the public , in consideration of public duties which they engage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those duties . At the same time , however , in legislating for its own protection , the State must not abridge the rights of freemen possessed by the employees , nor those granted by law or inherent in justice to their employers . Thus it comes about that the only fair legislation to secure the public its rights will preserve those of Compulsory Arbitration . 85 both employer and employed , while insisting on the obligations of both . The experience of the past , with the delay and inconvenience suffered by the public during protracted strikes , amply justifies the State in extending to disagreements between their higher and their low* ' *ervants its right to control those corporations which have the privileges of eminent domain or of exclusive occupation of territory . Only one other solution of the problem is possible : endowment of both employers and employed with the light of reason and the light of Christianity . As this will probably require several thousand years to accomplish , we are forced , in the mean time , if we hope for relief , to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of state arbitration , there are three important divisions to be observed . In the first place , what shall be the nature of the arbitrating power , whom shall it recognize as parties to a controversy , and how shall it compel submission to itself of all disputes , with the evidence upon them ? Second , by what principles shall it be guided in making a decision ? Third , how shall that decision be enforced , - how far by legal compulsion , and how far by practical constraints alone ? I. ( 1 . ) The corporations concerned are nearly all railways , and most of them are engaged in interstate commerce , so that arbitration of disputes which may interfere with the performance of their business comes within the scope of congressional legislation . Yet this circumstance does not impair the power of the several States from which they have received their right of way *o control their relations with their employees , just as they now regulate them in respect to rates or other matters through commissions or the courts . Interstate roads might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States courts on the plea // that a decision by the state authorities was unjust , though not on the ground of lack of jurisdiction . The first question is , then , whether this would wisely be made a subject of uniform laws for the whole nation , or whether it should be left to the individual States . One of the advantages of our federal system of government is that , in legislating along new lines , each State has the benefit of the constantly accruing experience of all the rest . Now , this subject of compulsory arbitration is a new and delicate one . A national law would apply to all parts of the country at once , and , if it proved to be unjust , the resulting evil would be widespread . At the same time , amendment would probably be more difficult than in the case of state laws , while for making amendments there would be no example of a more successful system elsewhere to serve as a guide . Again , so long a step toward centralization would arouse more determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . At least , until Congress take action in the matter , each State ought to enact a law applicable to corporations within its own limits . Such a law might establish a permanent board , or it might designate some judge of one of the higher courts , whose duty it should be , whenever a case entitled to arbitration was presented to him , to appoint a temporary body of arbitrators , and to preside over their bearings and deliberations . The object of the proposed arbitration , it must be remembered , is not to settle strikes , but to prevent them ; and to this end there must be some authority to whom appeals may at any time be made with assurance of a speedy hearing . Still , it seems as if a body of men appointed for each controversy under general rules , so framed as to insure impartiality , might be better than one chosen for permanent service by popular vote , or appointed by an elective officer . Complaints would come up at irregular intervals , and , after a few decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would come from various localities , and might happen to come from widely distant points at the same time . Thus , promptness of action , which is of the highest importance , and an appreciation of the special conditions of each controversy , would be best secured by local boards of temporary appointm*nt . This would be the case , at least , if arbitration were made a national matter . A permanent board might then find itself much of the time with nothing to do , and at other times crowded with business , and hurried from one end of the country to the other to settle some comparatively trivial question . Again , a mistaken decision , even though palpably unjust , if made by a temporary board , would be limited in its effect , and need not destroy confidence in the principle of arbitration for other questions in the future ; but a slight apparent bias on the part of a permanent body might create such distrust and unwillingness to appear before it as to make the whole system a failure . With so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , it would be hard to keep it out of politics . Finally , whatever the nature of these boards of arbitration , provision ought to be made for their adequate compensation . ( 2 . ) There would seem to be no need for asking who shall be the recognized parties to a dispute ; but this question has , in fact , been the occasion of intense bitterness in many strikes , and in some cases the cause of the strikes themselves . The trouble arises from the membership of the men in associations whose orders they are popularly , and sometimes justly , supposed to obey like slaves , and also from their employment of agents not of their own number to represent them . It has been thus far a favorite and a very plausible excuse of employers for refusing arbitration that their men have asked it not simply a // employees , but by the vote of some labor organization , and that their claims are presented by an outsider , not by one of themselves . They ignore the fact that none but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question , and they refuse to see the difference between a dictator and a representative . Sometimes , again , they say that they are ready to listen to the demands of their men as individuals , but not in a body . So long , however , as a request comes from the employees themselves there is no good reason why they should not present it through an agent , or why that agent should necessarily be one of their own number ; provided only he be in fact their agent and express their real wishes . There is , on the other hand , a most important reason why their claims should be made thus collectively , and through some representative not employed by those to whom he makes his appeal , and hence not subject to discharge for his temerity . Discreditable as it is to certain employers , and incredible though it seems to be to many among the public , workingmen often hesitate to present their own claims or those of their fellows from fear of discharge on some fictitious pretense ; and not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , they should be allowed , when they desire it , to state their case by an advocate ; and it makes no possible difference as regards the justice of their claims whether he be one of their number , or a lawyer , or even a walking delegate . Nevertheless , to protect boards of arbitration from continual appeals by irresponsible claimants , and also to give the public reasonable assurance that the men are not mere dupes of officious leaders , there ought to be some definite enactment fixing the conditions under which hearings shall be given . There is a common idea among the more favored classes that laboring men never think of wanting any other terms than those offered them , until they are aroused to discontent by agitators who seek notoriety and support in idleness , regardless of the consequences to their victims " No doubt the men are in the wrong , and would never have struck at all except for those walking delegates and Knights of Labor , " is the offhand way in which many a really benevolent gentleman passes judgment upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his morning paper . But just because , once in a while , this judgment happens to be true , it is very important to remove all possible excuse for it in future . To attain this end , the law should admit the right of railway employees to organize , and should provide that the officers of their organizations be entitled to recognition by the boards of arbitration : on condition , however , first , that these organizations shall be open to none but railway employees , and shall actually contain a majority of the men concerned in each petition presented ; and , second , that their officers shall be appointed by themselves , and shall owe allegiance to no outside organization . This , it will be observed , does not preclude the choice of men not actually engaged in railway work as officers , or the employment of counsel to present their petitions . Each class of employees , too , could be permitted to have its separate organization or to unite with others , as it might choose . The organizations of railway men being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's employ , not only should the arbitration board give a hearing to cases presented by their officers , but it should also properly decline to hear complaints from individuals or small bodies of disgruntled men who were unable to secure for their petition the support of their fellow-workmen . Such would still have the same right as the rest to appeal to their employers , but a 8tate board of arbitration ought never to be regarded as a primary court // open to every complainant . The law should not say in so many words that every complaint must be presented by the approval of this or that order of laborers , but that every general petition must be approved by a majority of those whom it concerns , and every personal grievance , in so far as personal griev*nces are admitted at all , by a majority of the complainant 's fellows , or by their duly appointed representatives . On questions of wages all interested could easily express opinion , but cases of alleged unjust discharge could be more intelligently passed upon by a small body like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide that no matter be taken before the state board of arbitration until it has first been presented to the proper officers of the corporation . Employers must in no case be denied the opportunity of dealing directly and justly with their men ; and , on the other hand , the men must not be allowed to get the idea that they are responsible first to boards of arbitration , and only secondly to their employers . ( 3 . ) Arbitration boards should have the right to demand from both sides such information as they may think needful ; and failure on either side to respond satisfactorily to any question should warrant the presumption that the answer , had it been given , would have told against the party refusing it . Beyond this there would be no need in the law of provisions compelling testimony or punishing contempt . Moreover , if a body of employees were to strike without making any appeal for arbitration , they would thereby subject themselves to the same consequences as if they had refused to accept a decision rendered on evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men alone appear before the board , the decision shall be by default against their employers . Finally , the arbitrators should be allowed to decide for themselves what sort of information they need , and should not be obliged to listen to irrelevant arguments on either side . II . Though the nature of the evidence to be admitted will vary with each case , and though those to whom judgment is committed must be guided largely by their own sense of justice , it is still worth while to consider what general principles ought to be observed , and what , if any , might wisely be incorporated in law . In the first place , with opportunity for arbitration provided , the so-called sympathetic strike could not be tolerated . In fact , it could occur only in case a body of men were to stop work out of sympathy with strikers in some other State , or were to refuse to handle " non-union " goods of some sort , or cars received from outside roads on which strikes were in progress . The State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its servants to obstruct any business which is carried on in conformity with its laws or with those of sister States ; neither can it , after doing all in its power to provide means of justice for its own employees , allow them to put it to inconvenience by taking part in the quarrels of those beyond its jurisdiction . Yet the men might properly refuse to be removed to a distance to take the place of strikers on some other part of a system under the same general control as their own line . Again , the whole body of a company 's employees within the same jurisdiction should have the right to support the petition of any of their number ; for if this were not allowed it would he possible to cut down wages , first for one small set of men , and then for another , until all had been reduced , without giving a fair chance for a united protest . The most frequent subjects of dispute which may properly come up for arbitration are wages , hours of service , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regarding wages there are at least three different // 1891. theories : ( 1 ) that the ability of a company to pay should be taken into account , a theory advocated by employees when a company is prospering , and by employers when the contrary is the case ; ( 2 ) that the value of a service to the company should be considered , presented by corporations that wish to keep the wages of as many as possible of their men below the standard rate ; ( 3 ) that wages should be proportioned to the labor and skill required to perform a given service . As to the first theory , of payment according to ability to pay , the employees have , perhaps , equal rights with the stockholders to benefit by unusual profits . It is the public , however , that has the true claim on them . If , then , the people choose to say that this special profit , instead of being used to reduce rates or improve accommodations , shall be given to the employees as nominal wages over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no good ground for complaint ; but the employees have no right to expect such benefactions . On the other hand , the limit to which wages may be reduced on the plea of a road 's poverty must not be too low to maintain uninterrupted service . Again , in considering the wealth or poterty of a carrying corporation , and its consequent ability to pay good wages , it will generally make a great difference whether calculation be made on the basis of the actual value of its property or on that of the face value of its securities . It is fair to say that , while the public is at liberty to pay , by means of extortionate rates , as high dividends as it may please on watered stock , it ought not to allow the payment of interest on fictitious values to serve as an excuse for pinching the employees . The second theory is that payment should depend on the value of the service rendered . It seems plausible enough to say that the engineer of a local train ought not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express , because the service of the former is of less value to the company . But if this principle be pressed to its conclusion , its unfairness becomes apparent ; for if it be just , then , similarly , the engineer of a thromrgh freight , that pays little more than operating expenses , should have less pay than the engineer of a local , that contributes to fixed charges and dividends as well . An engineer would deserve less for bringing a nearly empty train safely through snow and storm than for carrying the same train full of passengers on a fair day . It may be that the engineer of the local deserves less than the driver of the through express ; not , however , because his service is less valuable , but because it involves less of responsibility or of skilL In short , the only true rule is the third : that any service which the employer thinks worth doing at all shall be paid for according to the skill and labor required for performing it , with due allowance for peculiar irksomeness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company . This rule should be followed as closely as possible , for it is that by which wages in general must always be governed , according to the law of supply and demand . It is desirable that the public , through its arbitration boards , interfere as little as possible with the operation . of this law , only insuring itself against the inconvenience sure to result if the state of the labor market be put to the test of a strike . In the question how many hours railway men shall work the public has a vital concern . The lives of travelers are imperiled if those in any way connected with the running of trains or the repairing of tracks are kept under a sovere strain . In this matter , therefore , public safety may often require more restrictions than the men themselves would have a right to ask . For th' same reason , the subject might wisely be treated by general laws , though such laws could // not attempt to fix the precise limit of working time for all classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all hours of the day , but the severity of the strain and the responsibility upon those employed vary widely according to the posts they fill . It is , perhaps , not too much for a station master to be on hand at the occasional arrival of trains during eighteen hours of the twenty-four , though it would be a dangerous policy to expect a switchman to be alive to his duty during such a period . Again , a local engineer may be kept on duty ten hours a day , but few managers would be reckless enough to require a man to run a fast express for an equal length of time . A maximum time limit might , however , be set for many classes of employees , such as ten hours of actual service , all to be included within twelve consecutive hours , and to be continued for not more than six successive days . That would , no doubt , be more than could justly or safely be required of many men ; but there is no other business in which precise rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly , the enactment of such a general time limit into law ought not to preclude the right of any class of men to a hearing on the matter before the arbitration board . The hardest question which may require arbitration is that of promotion and discharge . In such a matter every employer wishes to be free to act on his own judgment . The discipline essential to efficient service is endangered if employees are not held strictly accountable to their employers , and nowhere is thorough discipline more indispensable than on railways . Even *n the government civil service , though the power of appointment is restricted , it has not been thought wise to interfere with the power of dismissal . Much less has the State advanced o far in socialism as to limit the right of any ordinary employer to discharge his men , with or without rea son , at pleasure ; and only because the arbitrary exercise of a similar right by corporations sometimes results in their inability to perform their public duties can the State wisely or justly interfere with them . The State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize , and any railway company that attempts to prevent the exercise of this admitted right ought to be held responsible for the consequences . In fact , it is so clearly for the interest of employers to retain good men in their service that questions of discharge would not be a proper subject of arbitration at all , were not some corporations still avowedly hostile to the organization of their employees . Perhaps , too , it is fair to make some concession to the suspicions of the men , unreasonable though they often are . It is the nature of all mankind , save ourselves , to be unreasonable ; our part is to be magnanimous . Every precaution , however , should be taken to prevent indiscriminate appeals to arbitration . This is due , first of all , to the employers , to whom outside supervision must , at best , be annoying ; but it is even more important to the men , for nothing could more discredit their cause than the frequent presentation of complaints that could not bear investigation . INo boards of arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground that they themselves might have done differently in the circumstances , and purely personal complaints ought not to be entertained . In all cases of discharge presented , the men must convince the board that the reasons alleged were a mere pretext for action prompted in reality by hostility to organized labor . It would then be wise policy for the employers to treat their men fairly , in order to avoid possible overruling from without , and for the men to accept in good faith the decisions of their employers , unless very sure of a genuine grievance . Moreover , by being careful to place in prominent positions in their orders only 40 January , // such of their number as are of unquestioned character and efficiency , they can do much to relieve boards of arbitration in the difficult task of deciding what is the real cause of a man 's discharge . It is a signal advantage of arbitration in advance of open warfare that those to whom decision is committed will be free from the prejudices which the incidents attending a strike often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body of strikers by their worst specimen , and to think the merits of a controversy changed by a single injudicious act of the weaker party . With arbitration to prevent instead of to settle strikes , there will be no riots or acts of violence on the part of hot-headed sympathizers with the men ; no employment of Pinkerton " detectives " by the management , to obscure the real issue and render impartial judgment impossible . The boards will not yield to the temptation to punish the corporations for their arrogant demand to be allowed to regulate their own affairs , like private individuals ; nor , on the other hand , will they refuse justice to the employees because some of their claims may be extravagant or their economic theories absurd . III . All has gone on smoothly thus far , on paper at least ; an impartial arbitration board has been appointed , and an impartial decision , based on just principles , has been rendered . But what if either party refuse to accept the decision ? Shall the law attempt positive compulsion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impossible . The law may , however , fix serious consequences for refusal to comply ; legal consequences for the company , and practical consequences for its employees . For the corporation is the creature of the State and the holder of special public favors ; the men have received no favors from the public , and can be held to no legal duties . Yet they have moral obligations , and it is right that the State , after undertaking to secure them from injustice , insist , in return , on recognition of these obligations , and use such constraint as is not tyrannical to enforce it . A corporation , then , though it should still have a nominal right to reject the terms of the arbitration board , ought to be held to full accountability for the consequences . It should be required to maintain uninterrupted operation of its lines , while its employees would be at liberty to leave at once in a body . If , under these circumstances , it fail in the least to do its work , its lines should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer the men the terms just fixed by the arbitrators , and so continue the operation of the road . This saves the public from inconvenience without involving the forfeiture of a company 's charter before the stockholders can be heard ; but on such conditions no corporation would be likely to reject the official settlement , unless it had so good a case as to feel sure of ability to fill all vacancies instantly , or unless the terms proposed were really believed to be ruinous . In the former instance , it would be justified by success ; in the latter , it could prove its sincerity by offering to surrender its property to the State at a fair valuation , - that is , the present cost of building and equipping a similar line added to the original land damages of the line surrendered . It is not , however , at all likely that such a course would ever be taken . Most public carrying companies are either so profitable or so highly capitalized above the actual value of their plant that sale of the property at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next place , what shall be done if the employees refuse the tennis offered , or if they strike without first applying for arbitration at all ? The more the State insists on the performance of their duties by corporations , the more clear becomes its own ( luty to secure these companies effectively against loss // through the refusal of their employees to accept terms which the State itself , by its agents , has declared reasonable . But the State can not compel freemen to work against their will ; and to require men , on entering any service , to bind themselves to accept whatever conditions may be fixed by the decision of a body yet to be constituted would be contrary to the very idea of free labor . It is , however , perfectly just to require due notice of an employee before leaving his employer 's service , as also of the employer before discharging his men without a special cause , or reducing their wages . The time required should be the same for both parties , and the penalty for ivn employer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the employees it would be impossible to compel service , and often impracticable to collect a fine , especially when a kirge number struck at once ; while the idea of making refusal to work a penal offense is as repugnant as it would prove impossible of execution . There is still , however , a means of constraining the employees , suggested by that device , most villainous nuder abuse , the black-list . Men in the employ of public carriers should be licensed , and should lose their licenses as the penalty for leaving their posts without either due notice or the public consent . Licenses should cost nothing in the first instance , but the price should be very heavy for their renewal if once forfeited . This price would be in effect the fine imposed as a penalty for quitting work without warning , and the experience of men unjustly black-listed in the past gives reason for believing that the fear of losing their right to public employment , with the difficulty of regaining it , would save a corporation from danger of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its employees . It is not proposed to interfere with any man 's right to work or not to work for a given employer or at a given compensation , since the license is not to be forfeited as a penalty for refusing terms which an arbitration board thinks fair , but only for leaving work without due warning , on dissatisfaction with those terms . The men are sustained by the whole force of the law in their right to strike instantly in case the corl ) oration refuses the terms fixed , while their own right to refuse them is unquestioned so long as they give notice in advance . At the same time , uninterrupted service is secured by the appointment of a receiver if the managers fail to operate their road , while the system of licenses protects the company from tyranny on the part of the men . The State would not say to the corporation : " You must pay this rate of wages , and you must reemploy these men . " But it would say : " We think that these wages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your motive in discharging these men was purely tyrannical . If , then , your men all leave you in consequence of treatment in our judgment unfair , we shall hold you responsible for any resulting inconvenience . If you fail in the least to perform your duties as common carriers , we shall take control of your property and operate it until you are ready to offer the employees what seem to us reasonable terms . " Neither would the State , on deciding against the men , say to them : " You must work on the terms your employers offer you . " It would say : " We believe your employers ' terms are reasonable . You may reject them if you choose , but you must give fair notice before leaving , so that your places may be filled . And if you leave without notice , and thereby embarrass your employers and put us , the public , to inconvenience , we certainly shall not consider you the sort of men to be employed in the public service again . " Under such conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of their licenses , // unless they saw prospect of bettering themselves in some other calling . On the contrary , the provision for arbitration and the due recognition of their organizations would inspire in them a confidence in the public good will and a sense of responsibility which would raise the tone of the service , and make possible a better understanding between them and their employers . Apart from the natural hesitation before any innovation felt by those fortunate members of society who have never personally suffered by a strike , there are two general reasons why those more immediately concerned oppose the idea of state arbitration . In the first place , many corporations will fight , on what they call principle , any such admission of the right of the State to interfere in their affairs ; and , in the second place , some of the laboring classes , holding that the only remedy for the tyranny of corporate power is in state ownership , object to any half-way measure . There are some on both sides who believe that there is an irrepressible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that both might and right are on their side , desire to hasten , rather than to postpone , the crisis . Again , there are some of both parties who , while favorable to the idea of arbitration , have no confidence that just decisions would be rendered by any tribunal likely to be established for that purpose . The combined effect of these objections is to prove the moderation of the plan . It goes too far for extremists on one side , and not far enough for those on the other . It is idle , however , at this late day , for public carriers to deny the right of the State to control them . They should rather accommodate themselves to the fact of the right , and then so conduct their affairs that there shall be no occasion for its exercise . The experience of the majority of railways in the country shows that , if their employees are treated with fair consideration , arbitration boards will have little to do . On the other hand , there is no good reason why advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction . Such a step tends to familiarize the people with the idea of government control ; and if at the same time the necessity of carrying it further be obviated or postponed , none but such as put the justification of their pet theory above the welfare of the country should regret the result . There is , moreover , no ground for lack of confidence in such arbitration boards as might without difficulty be constituted . Their appointment by the judiciary would obviate the danger of partisanship , and a body fairly composed would always have the support of public opinion . On the other hand , the managers of carrying companies are , by virtue of their peculiar position , under constant temptation to seek the favor of their employers , the stockholders , by returning . good dividends at the cost of hard terms to the employees . Losses incurred by cutting rates may be made good by cutting wages . As the stockholders are not , and can not be , acquainted with these matters so as to decide them for themselves , the managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision of the difficult question of their relative duties to those above and to those below them . The public , while perhaps in some instances inclined to favor the weaker party , has a certain interest of its own in keeping operating expenses down , that rates also may be low . This interest would be strong enough to prevent popular support of extortionate demands , while it would not be sufficient to induce approval of niggardliness in dealing with the employees ; for there would be a feeling that a corporation willing to pinch its men would not be likely generously to bestow the proceeds of its meanness on the community at large . Thus , // public sentiment , when the evidence is fairly before it , is likely to uphold whichever side is right . It is a trite saying , but worth ever bearing in mind , that this difficulty , like most labor troubles , arises from a keen sense of rights combined with utter disregard of obligations . In the present instance , however , while the obligations of the men , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their employers alone , the obligations of the corporations are twofold , - to their men and to the community . Fortunately , too , the latter duty , being legal as well as moral , gives the State the opportunity , while maintaining its own rights , to compel both parties to a dispute to recognize their moral obligations to each other . In view of the experience of the past , the duty of proposing something better rests on those who object to state arbitration . It is a curious spectacle , the general complaint and vituperation on the part of the public while a strike is in progress , and the lapse into the 01 ( 1 indifference that follows almost immediately when it is over . Yet it rests with the people alone to decide whether they will suffer in the future as in the past , or will exercise their right of control over their quarrelsome servants .
