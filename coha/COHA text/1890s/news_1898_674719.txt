txt When the Geneva award of $15,500,000 in gold was paid by Great Britain twenty-five years ago , the payments were made to extend through a period of several months and there was considerable apprehension , in England at least , lest the transfer of so large a sum should produce disturbances in the money market . The Reorganization Committee of the Union Pacific Railroad has just completed the payment of the purchase price to the Government , the entire sum of $53,000,000 having been paid over in a period of six weeks without disturbing the normal conditions of the money market . The transaction is interesting not only on account of its magnitude , in which respect it Is surpassed only by a few historic indemnity payments between nations , but also for the exceeding ease with which it was accomplished through the u. : ? e of the machinery of modern finance . The first payment was made on Nov. 22 , the last on Jan. 5 . The Government turned over to the committee the securities in the sinking fund , amounting to $13,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $40,000,000 the committee got nothing but the receipts of the Government , it being a condition of the purchase that the property should not be transferred until the payments were complete . If this transaction had withdrawn from the market the entire sum of $53,000,000 , transferring it to the Treasury and locking it up there , we should have had a considerable period of " tight money . " Interest rates would have risen , loans would have been called and both merchants and speculators would have been compelled to pay more for their accommodation . All this was easily averted . The Government left $30,000,000 in National banks designated as depositories and received direct into the Treasury only $23,000,000 . But even this was not held there . Secretary GAGE had sent out notices on Dec. 13 that payment of the bonds issued In aid of the Pacific roads , usually called currency sixes , amounting to $29,904,952 and due on Jan. 1 , would begin on Dec. 24 . After that date the Government received from the Union Pacific committee $17,000,000 on Jan. 1 and $8,500,000 on Jam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually returned to the market about $4,400,000 more than it took from it . It has frequently been asserted in Western newspapers that the Union Pacific had been purchased by a European syndicate . That is not true . European subscriptions to the amount of $10,000 , - 000 toward the purchase price were received , but before . the transaction was completed one-half of these subscriptions were bought back far American account , so that Europe contributes less than 10 per cent . of the-Price paid .
