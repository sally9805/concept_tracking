txt The District Attorney 's office does not seem to have been well served in its first investigation of the character and antecedents of James E. Burbridge , one of the two jurors who voted for the acquittal of Inspector . A detective who was sent to East Eighty-fifth Street to verify Burbridge 's answers as a talesman brought back information since discovered to be completely at variance with the real facts . Yet enough was known to the prosecuting counsel to make Col. Fellows in his address to the jury single out Burbridge by name as he asked the question : " Is there a reasonable doubt , Mr. Burbridge ? " It is curious that the same question was repeated in the same emphatic manner to one other juror only , who happened to be Mr. Stein , Burbridge 's companion in obstinacy . Although the jury has been formally discharged , Justice Barrett is still engaged in considering the accusations made by William Scott , Juror No. 8 , who made the secret charge against Juror Burbridge , the nature of which he at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Justice Barrett yesterday , asking him to appear in court to-day . Juror Herman Stern , who was found at his home , 184 East Seventy-fifth Street , yesterday , by a reporter for The New-York Times , said that he had seen the document drawn up by Mr. Scott and had read it hurriedly . It covered a large sheet of foolscap , closely written , and referred to some statement alleged to have been made by Burbridge in Scott 's hearing to the effect that he would soon be rich or a pauper . Mr. Stern added , in regard to other phases of the trial : " I was the only reasonable man on the jury after we retired to consider our verdict , because I was ready to discuss all sides of the case . All the others had their minds made up either one way or the other . " Burbridge seemed to me a very quiet man , though I had little or nothing to say to him throughout the trial and the time spent in getting the remaining members of the , jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was some talk about the keyhole of the door which opened on the courtroom . It was begun , to the best of my recollection , by Charles A. Stein . While the other jurors were discussing , the verdict , Mr. Stein looked through the keyhole , and could see the interior of the courtroom until one of the attendants outside placed his body fiat against the opening . " Mr. Stein then asked for a pin or a pen , I am not sure which , to poke through the keyhole in order to get the attendant to move away . Some other members of the jury went over to where he was standing , and I do not know what happened after that . " The reference to the keyhole was in answer to a question put to Mr. Stern as to whether he had seen any of the jurors thrusting a marked toothpick through the aperture . Some bystander , who was not a court attendant , had pulled out a toothpick apparently crossed by three transverse strokes of ink , with the letter " C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred immediately after the first ballot had been taken , it is supposed by some persons that the " C " stood for " conviction , " and the three transverse strokes for the three votes which were cast for acquittal . Mr. Stern did not think that there was any foundation in fact for this theory , so far as he could judge . James E. Burbridge was ' at his sister 's house , 251 East Eighty-fifth Street , where he lives , yesterday afternoon when the reporter called . He acknowledged that it was true that he had to borrow 20 cents from a court attendant on the day he was sworn as a juror in order to pay to get shaved . " I had no expectation of being put on that jury , " he said , so that I had no money with me . I thought that as soon as the prosecution learned that I was a contractor I would be excused . ' ? At the same time , I have never done work for the city directly , though I have often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cellar excavating and rock blasting , and I have often had to apply for permits to the Public Works Department . There is little or nothing in such work to bring a man into contact with the police force . " As soon as I found that I was to be on the jury , I went home for money and clothes , which I obtained . What the nature of the charge is which Scott has made against me I can not imagine . The word ' money ' was not mentioned by me from the moment I sat in the jury box until the trial was ended . " The other members of the jury , with the exception of Stein and Stern , would hear no arguments on any side but one . It is not true that I would not discuss the case ; I talked until I was tired , but the nine of them did nothing but jump on me every time I opened my mouth . " The first night of the trial there was a conference in one of the bedrooms between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . that time everything seemed to be settled . " After we had retired to consider our verdict , Stein would say to me occasionally , I 'll go with them for a while for quietness sake . ' Then Pelihan or Henley would take Stein to one side and talk to him until everything appeared to be settled , when the trouble would begin all over again . " I did say something about throwing Scott out of the window when he said to Stein , ' Do you want to go State prison like him ? ' ? meaning me . I thought the juryroom was no place to threaten a man , and I think so still . " What seemed most to annoy the ten jurors who were for conviction was my walking about the room while they- were writing or making notes of questions to ask Justice Barrett . " There-is nothing in the toothpick story , in my opinion . I heard Stein say something about being able to see the Judge sitting in the courtroom , and then heard him complain that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Stein asked for a pin or a pen to stick through the keyhole , but my attention was attracted by something else just at that moment , so I did not follow the matter up and did not see the end of it . " Mr. Burbridge said that he had no law suits on hand at present , and expected no large sums of money , except what was owing to him on small uncollected bills . He complained that men from the District , Attorney 's office h4 visited his house yesterday in order to examine the tools in his cellar . Mr. Stein denied himself to reporters yesterday , though repeated attempts to see him were made . William Scott , the author of the myster. sous document , when seen , in his home , 33 West Sixty-third ' Street , yesterdsaa talked freely about everything connected with the trial except the contents of the paper which he had written . " I worte it during the time that we were considering our verdict , " he said , " and I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is now in responsible hands . It may amount to a great deal , or it may amount to nothing , and in either case it would be unwise for me to talk about it . It is true that I am to see Justice Barrett to-morrow in connection with it . " Mr. Scott said that the admissions of Burbridge and Stein showed that they were wholly unfit for places in the jury box in such an important trial . Burbridge , he said , took the stand that Seagrist was a man " with money to burn " ; that he had given money to or Burns without any need for doing so , and that whether he had paid the money or not , no crime had been committeed , because the permit was all that he needed to carry on his work . " He made this statement in the hearing of several other jurors besides myself , " continued Mr. Scott , " yet refused to find guilty . " " Stein for his part acknowledged that Burns had received the money , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extortion . I told him that if he paid his own rent to an agent and got his receipt for the amount , the agent might bolt with the money and yet the landlord could not recover against the receipt of his authorized agent . Stein had nothing to say to this , yet stuck to his verdict of acquittal . " Mr. Scott said he did not believe there was anything serious in the toothpick matter , except that Stein showed his unfitness for his place by lurking and looking through the keyhole when he should have been considering his veridct . Mr. Scott did not see Mr. - Stein thrusting a toothpick through the keyhole , though he remembered the circumstances which led up to that action by somebody . " The public is in error about one thing , " Mr. Scott also said . " During all the time we were locked up we never saw a newspaper , daily or weekly . An impression prevails that we had newspapers with the parts relating to the trial cut out , but this was not the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his six deputies were absolutely faithful to their trust . At no time could two jurors be together unless in the presence of a court attendant . Such a conferencems you say Mr. Burbridge describes was absolutely impossible and never took place . What he says about threatening to throw roe out of the window is substantially true , as well as the reason for his saying so . We could not get on with Burbridge at all , and during the discussion over the verdict he frequently called us liars . " Justice Barrett said last night that he hoped the public would not be discouraged at the result of the first trial . The fault , in Justice Barrett 's opinion , did not lie either with the jury system or with the jury laws , but with the respectable and intelligent jurors who perjured themselves in order to escape irksome jury duty . Thera was nothing in the present law to prevent men from reading the newspapers and even from forming opinions on what they read . It was the forming of such an opinion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in court and from giving a just verdict thereon which incapacitated a talesman from serving . Justice Barrett also said that he felt deeply the privations which jurors had to endure in such cases , and that he for his part was inclined to relax the necessary restrictions as much as possible . He had even considered the possibility of releasing the jurors on their honor after they were sworn and to postpone locking them up until the trial had actually begun . The length of time consumed in getting a jury together to try such a case was inevitable , and Justice Barrett trusted that the jury system would be rescued from unmerited animadversion by a revival of public spirit among the talesmen brought forward to try such cases . It was learned yesterday on the authority of one of the counsel for the prosecution that the legal restriction which prevented a talesman from serving on a jury unless he had 8250 of personal property clear of incumbrance might de enforced in the forthcoming trial , and that the application of this rule to the case of James E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only rejected because it might have seemed to savor of partiality.
