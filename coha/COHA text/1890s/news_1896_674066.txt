txt The Raines Excise bill declares its 1 " short title " to be " The Liquor Tax Law , " and while it proposes to increase the burdens and restrictions upon the liquor traffic , it is paraded as a measure of taxation . So far as it relates to the State at large , it is a revenue measure , and as such - it should be equitable . It iS , in point of fact , an atrocious scheme for robbing the cities of the State for the benefit of the rural communities . A slight analysis and comparison of its tax provisions will make this plain . For the purpose of comparison , let us take two representative counties , New York and Herkimer , and let us suppose that under the operation of the law there would be one seller of liquor " to be drunk on the premises " to every 500 inhabitants , though in fact the proportion would be larger in the city than in the rural county . The seller would be taxed in this city $800 ; in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 50,000 inhabitants , $500 ; in cities and incorporated villages of from 5,000 to 50,000 inhabitants , $350 ; in incorporated villages of less than 5,000 inhabitants , $200 , and in " other places , " $100 . The tax would be collected from all without any reference to the amount of the traffic or the profit derived from it , and one-half of the proceeds would go into the State Treasury . Herkimer County has about 47,000 inhabitants , two-thirds or thereabout in incorporated villages , only one of which has a population of more than 5,000 . On the basis assumed , it would have , say , 95 places selling liquor to be drunk on the premises , of which 11.1 ( in Little Falls ) would pay $350 each , 36 ( in other villages ) would pay $200 , and the rest $100 . The entire proceeds would be , say , $17 , - 500 a year , of which $8,750 would go to the State . The tax would amount to less than 40 cents per capita for the County of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go to the State . In the City of New-York there - Would be 3,600 places subject to the tax " upon the business of trafficking in liquors to be drunk upon the premises where sold , " and the tax upon them would amount to $2 , SS0,000 , or $1.60 per capita of the popIllation , of Which $1,440,000 , or 80 cents per capita , would go to the State . The present number of places engaged in this kind of traffic is much larger than is herd i assumed , and it would probably remain larger under the propdsed " tax law , " and , notwithstanding the duTergice in the tax , the ratio to Population would qwq
