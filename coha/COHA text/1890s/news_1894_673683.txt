txt The legislative representation of territory instead of population may be called the Connecticut idea , but that State has the excuse that it was established in Colonial times , when the various settlements had some claim to an equal voice in the popular Assembly of the day , and was embodied in the State Constitution when there was no great disparity in the population of different towns and counties . The gross irregularities that now exist are the result of the unequal growth of communities in the last seventy-five years . Originally there was no party advantage in allowing equal representation to towns without regard to differences of population , but the development of the unequal representation of the people has been attended by a tendency to the preponderance of one parts in rural communities and of the other In populous urban communities . This makes it difficult to get the wrong corrected , because the party that has the advantage is reluctant to give ' it up . But the late Constitutional Convention in this State , by a party majority , has made a deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets up a plain distinction between rural and urban communities , and proposes to give the former a larger proportionate representation in the law-making body , not for the security of any public interest or right , but for the sake of the party advantage that could be thereby obtained . Will the people of New-York adopt the abuse which Connecticut is trying to get rid of ?
