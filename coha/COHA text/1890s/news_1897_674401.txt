txt Senator AHD ARN has introduced a bill at Albany incorporating the Ward 's Island Bridge Company , the purpose of which would be nominally to construct a bridge and roadway between the " annexed district " and the territory adjacent to Long Island City , but in reality to get a valuable franchise from the State for nothing and hold it until the City of New York , then occupying both sides of the Bast River channel , should be ready to construct the bridge and could be compelled to pay for the privilege .

A franchise for the new East River Bridge was granted to a corporation , and it got ? possession of the best location for it and did just enough to hold it .

It would never be built by anybody else . This attempt to get possession of the ground and to hold a franchise for building and operating a bridge is too transparent to deceive anybody . It is too bald a piece of jobbery for future profit at public expense for even the present Legislature to countenance . We have had enough of this giving away of franchises and subsequent " holding up " of the city . Let us have no more of it .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
