txt In last Sunday 's Herald there appeared a number of letters from clergymen of this city explaining their views of the propriety of ministers engaging in political affairs , and more particularly of the conduct of the ministers who co-operated with the Municipal League in the late election . One of the most extraordinary of these letters appears over the engraved signature of the rector of Trinity Church . We doubt whether Dr. DIX is aware of the astonishment with which some of the deliverances of his letter have been read . Dr. Dix says that last Summer , in his absence and without his consent , his name was published as a member of the ministers ' association . He would not , he says , have sanctioned such a use of his name even by his silence if he had foreseen the direction ( he does not tell what direction ) the movement was to take . Is Dr. Dix quite sure that his memory is not playing him a trick ? He returned to this city before the election , when he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement which he now condemns , and he took no steps that the public knows of to withdraw from it whatever sanction his name could give . Dr. Dix says , " You must confess that the movement was a failure ! " Is it only after the defeat that Dr , Dix finds it necessary to withdraw his name ? Dr. DIX disavows the intention to be a critic or censor of his brethren , and thereupon proceeds to criticise and censure them . He ignores the fact that in its whole motive and inception the movement . for municipal reform was a moral movement , made in the interests of public and private morality . After its defeat he chooses to regard it exclusively as a political movement , and he complacently Sets forth his own virtuous behavior to be contrasted with the misbehavior ( as he considers it ) of many , and particularly one , of his brethren . " I have never , " he says , " made a political address . I should deem it a desecration of my pulpit and my sacristy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Dix 's way of abstaining from censure . If so , it is uncommonly like the world 's way of practicing the same thing . Those things , however , are trifles personal only to Dr. Dix , and of no deep interest to the world . Some other statements contained in his letter , coming as they do from the head of the richest religious corporation on this continent , and therefore apparently representing the principles on which the large endowments of Trinity Parish are administered , are absolutely amazing . On their face they include a denial in terms of the first principles of Christianity and a repudiation of the most imperative duties of the Christian Church , as hitherto taught and acknowledged by Christian people of every name under heaven . This is strong language ; but let Dr. Dix speak for himself . He says : " The Church is not a secular organization nor a human institution , nor was it founded with a direct view to moral culture , class elevation , or any other temporal need . Its mission is to preach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in the ( ) reeds , and to administer the sacraments of salvation . The objects 1-directly aimed at are to make Christ known and loved ; to proclaim the message of salvation and build up the kingdom of Hon in the earth . " Indirectly this work , if faithfully done , ought to tell on society and gradually to transform and elevate She human race , and snoh has been and will continue to be the result . But for us who are charged with this ministry to try experiments and attempt to attain those results by human contrivances appears to me to be a fatal mistake . " I have no confidence in the judgment or wisdom of those wIto tell us that the Church must try to reach the masses , purify politics , elevate the laboring classes , increase incomes , obtain the enactment of laws regulating meat and drink , and , for all I know , take up and settle the questions at the currency , the tariff , Se . " Passing by the ungenerous fling in the closing paragraph , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , to say nothing of a learned dignitary of a great Church , has given public utterance to these astonishing sentiments . Does Dr. DIX really mean to tell a listening world that the Church of JESUS CHRIST " was not founded with a direct view to moral culture " ? Why , the preaching of JESUS et:nun is moral culture ! " The objects directly aimed at are to make Christ known and loved ! " and what is that but moral culture 7 To our minds it seems that the man who has learned to know the character of JESUS CHRIST , in any true sense of the word knowledge , must have made a long step in moral culture ; and the man who has learned to love that divine embodiment of all virtue has gone far toward sanctification ! Coming to a still more practical question , does Dr. Dix really intend to say that the Church of Christ has " no direct view to any temporal need " 4 The Founder of the Church seems to have thought otherwise . He was the best example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live by ; and we are given to understand that " He wont about doing good , " as well as preaching sermons , like that of the Mount , in. which there was very little catechism , but more benevolent morality than the world ( or the Church ) has yet grown wise enough to comprehend . When He sent out His twelve disciples , did He bestow upon theta the power to construct creeds and frame dignified liturgies and . conduct gorgeous ceremonies 4 Not at all . If the Gospel record is true , " He gave them power to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease . " Were His marching orders to the twelve that they should regard men 's temporal needs as a mere side matter which was only indirectly connect-. ed with the preaching of the Gospel ? Most assuredly nor ! The ministry to men 's bodies was to go step by step with the preaching of the Gospel , and as part of the GospeL Here are the words : " As ye go , preach , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils ; freely ye have received , freely give . " That was Christ 's way of preaching the Gospel . Is it no longer that of Hie Church Coming now to a yet broader question , does Mr. Drs seriously mean that he has " no confidence in the judgment or wisdom of those who tell us that the Church must try to reach the masses " I We hope not . All His life long Dr. Dix 's Master did little else than try to reach the masses . " When He saw the multitudes " in Galilee , which were not unlike the masses in New-York , we are told that " He was moved with compassion for them " ; and if Dr. Dix will consult the passage he will find that the Saviour then and there told His disciples that their life work , and the life work of all their successors , was , and was to be , to reach the masses : for " then saith . He unto them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are few . Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers into His harvest ! " To reach and . gather in the masses  --  that is the express work of Christ 's ministers . GOD help them and the masses if it is not ! So we might go on through half a dozen other strange and ( we must say it ) most unchristian statements in Dr. Dix 's letter ; but to what end ? We do not , we can not , believe that he meant them in the bald sense they bear in cold type . We warn him , however , that it is just such statements which produce the fact which has lately been emphasized by a Bishop of Dr. Dix 's Church , that the masses who , even when they are addressed by " infidel " orators , never fail to cheer at the name of JESUS CHRIST , invariably howl and groan and hoot at the mention of churches and ministers . If what Dr. Dix says were true , we should be more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the cheering , of the masses ; but it is not true , and we do not believe that Dr. Dix means it . We believe , on the contrary , that he will seek and find an early occasion to tell the masses what he did not mean in his letter to the Herald .
