txt Friends of Secretary Alger and of Gen. Miles are equally surprised by the turn mat ters have taken in the Miles-Alger controversy . The supporters of the Secretary are in rather high feather to-day . They feel that Gen. Alger has scored a decided hit in asking for an investigation of the War Department . and that Gen. Miles . on the contrary , has weakened his case . Secretary Alger , It is generally admitted , has done the best thing that was left open to him , outside of ordering a court-martial , which would not have accomplished what he wisher  --  the condemnation of Gen. Miles before the public . Gen. Miles , it Is said by the friends of Gen. Alger . and admitted by many of the friends of Gen. Miles himself , has somewhat injured his cause by confessing that what he said and did was for the purpose of setting himself right before the public . and had In it no thought of an investigation that might vindicate the army by eiposing the mismanagement of the war . An official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy is with Gen. Miles in this matter , I must confess that the General has somewhat spoiled a good case by confessing too much . The public was quite ready to believe that he had made the withering criticism of Secretary Alger and Corbin for the purpose of shielding the army from future abuses by means of a thorough investigation and exposure of the mismanagement of the campaign in Santiago . He says , however , that he had no such purpose . His Friends Surprised . " We were surprised to learn that the only purpose that he had in view was the setting of himself right before the public . This in itself is a laudable purpose , and all will recognize that the General had a perfect right to state clearly what was his position and rank throughout the conduct of the campaign ; that he was not , and could not be , superseded by Shafter , and that he was recognized by the War Department itself , despite its reassuring telegrams to Shafter , as the only head of the army . But every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is absurd for any one to discuss it . Abandoned . " But why should the General abandon the high ground of a public benefactor , and sink to the low level of a defender of his personal rights ? We wanted to regard him as the knight errant of the cause of the army , as the champion of its rights , and the avenger of its wrongs . Does he demand an investigation of the wrongs of the soldiers ? Does he ask for an inquiry into the apparently needless suffering of the troops in the trenches about Santiago ? Does he plead for righteously putting the blame for this Suffering- upon the guilty ? " We find him , rather , striving to prevent himself from being overshadowed and robbed of some of his glory . This is all right , but there is a higher catise before the public conscience , and we had come to look upon Gen. Miles as the champion of that cause . Now , however , he himself abandons what we had considered his high position , and has contented himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He has thus given the Secretary and his advisers an opportunity that they were quick enough to seize . The Secretary of War says : ' Gen. Miles wants merely to set himself right . He has done so very fully in a long interview and in a carefully prepared personal statement for the press . I am quite willing to let him have the satisfaction of this vindication , and put an end to this controversy . ' This puts a period to Gen. Miles 's endeavors , if he has been making any , to force an investigation into the management of the war . " Again , Secretary Alger shows In his request for a court of Inquiry that he has been well advised . He is so satisfied with this parthian shot and he left the city the same evening that Gen. Miles returned , confident that he had scored a tactical victory . An Almost Invulnerable Position . " Miles is left out of the investigation . He could be summoned now as a witness only . He can no longer appear in the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have caused or contributed to the suffering of the soldiers of his country . The inquiry will go ahead without his initiative , without his aid even . It is made not upon . his charges or representations , for he has disclaimed that he wished to force such an inquiry . " The Secretary has another source of self-congratulation . He occupies an almost invulnerable position . He is like the Spaniards in Morro Castle who put Hobson between themselves and the guns of the American fleet . He can say , ' Let them investigate . They will find out so much that they can not afford to touch me . ' Every shot fired at Alger will have to go through somebody else . Did we have incompetent men in the Commissary and Quartermaster 's Depa-runents ?  - -  Yes , - but ? who put them ' there ? " Alger was but the cat's-paw drawing - ' out chestnuts for hungry- politicians . He can say to the court that Congressmen . Governors  --  possibly the President himself  --  demanded the appointment of certain civilians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may rest secure in his shelter:lie-hind the for a court of inquiry .. " The request looks good and sounds good . It is - an answer to'all ** to all his Critics . But it will be found that there was considerable astuteness behind the apparently frank demand for an investigation . It was very eleven Few- of the politicians who have clamored for an inquiry will be very anxious to have the Secretary pinned to the wall if he himself has to be skewered on the same frog stick . " Generally Ileu-srded as as Victory . These and similar views are generally expressed here to-day . Nearly every one considers the Secretary 's request for a court of inquiry as a victory , and many express the belief that the investigation will result in nothing for the reasons given above by the official . The matter has ' reached what is considered here as an acute political stage and has been taken from the army and put into the political arena . In the meanwhile the supporters and friends of Mr Alger are very confident .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
