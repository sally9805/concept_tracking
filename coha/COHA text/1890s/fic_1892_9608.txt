EDITOR 'S FOREWORD The third and last of Henry James 's early dramatic experiments extant was published in the January 1872 Atlantic Monthly shortly before the novelist sailed aboard the S.S. Algeric for his second trip to Europe . Where the comediettas preceding A Change of Heart were simple two-character and three-character conversation pieces , this playlet is an attempt in small compass to create a play in the French fashion  --  each entrance and exit marking the occasion for a scenic division after the form in which French plays were cast . As a result this dramatic trifle boasts no less than fifteen scenes . It has more intrigue than its predecessors ; nevertheless there is no evidence to show that James , in writing it , intended it for any stage . Its brevity alone would mark it as distinctly experimental . With the publication of this piece , James seems to have turned away from all thought of play-writing for the time ; he was already at work on the first chapters of his first major novel , Roderick Hudson , and for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction . A NOTE ON THE TEXTS In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication , over a period of two decades , the editor was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . The corrections and emendations were such as occur in the progress of a modern play from the dramatist 's desk , through the production office into the theatre . James was called upon to revise his plays many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays , nor the textual problems arising from collation , warranted such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer 's intentions  --  while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would serve : that of demonstrating their role in Henry James 's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some producer might be caught in the process  --  provide the means for the appearance of at least some of them on the American stage . I therefore directed my editing to this end . It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of the London production , two of them from James 's own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutations of James 's first important effort in the theatre , including a variant fourth act . As regards the other plays , a simple principle was applied . Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the cuts restored ; in a few minor instances there were cuts followed by alterations and where these were in James 's hand they were accepted as his final reading ; where there were simply cuts , these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable , the alternate readings have been given . There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typescripts of the play , I decided that it would be of interest to publish the text as actually performed on the stage in 1909 , which James had approved , despite a number of alterations and cuts . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed ; as the short story Covering End and in the final form it took when it reached the stage . While James went over most of the manuscripts of his plays , making corrections and verbal changes , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's alternately referring to " Valentin " and " Valentine " are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech ; these have been spelled out as an aid to readability . Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips 's Bibliography of the Writings of Henry James ( New York , 1930 ) , pp. 26-27 , 46-47 and 115-16 . CHARACTERS ROBERT STAVELEY ( thirty-seven ) CHARLES PEPPEREL ( thirty-six ) MARGARET ( twenty-one ) MARTHA ( twenty-three ) Main text Drawing-room of a house in the country . Glass doors at back into the piazza and garden ; doors right and left into the house . Late afternoon . Middle of August . Scene First : MARTHA , coming forward , pale and agitated , followed by PEPPEREL . PEPPEREL . What is it to be ,  --  peace or war ? I knew you were here , and yet I came . You may imagine whether I like it . I saw you at the window as I came through the garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the point of turning away . But when a man has come a-wooing , he has a use for all his gallantry . I should have vastly preferred to respect your seclusion . Do me justice ! I 'm not so bad as you think . You know it 's said that unless we 're saints we hate those whom we 've wronged . Of course if we 're saints , we 've not wronged any one . Now I do n't in the least hate you . I do n't say I pity you ,  --  that would be insulting . MARTHA . Yes , do n't be insulting ! PEPPEREL . I esteem you  --  there ! I esteem you more than any woman in the world . Under the circumstances I call that handsome . Meet me , if not as a friend , at least not as an enemy , and justify my good opinion by your tact . MARTHA . ( After a silence . ) Is it really you that I hear ? Am I really standing face to face with you and listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's very odd , certainly . Life leads us a dance , if we happen to have an ear for the tune ! But everything 's odd , or nothing 's odd , according as you look at things . The grand point is not to stand staring , like rustics at a fair . Will you forgive me ? MARTHA . I do n't understand you . I only feel that every word you utter must be an injury . PEPPEREL . The deuce ! Well , I ca n't stand and argue the matter . I must play my part and do my work . Of course , at best , I ca n't expect you to think well of me ; but I 'm determined you sha' n't think so ill as you 'd like to do . I shall therefore be perfectly frank . You know , I suppose , what has brought me here ? MARTHA . I wish to know nothing . PEPPEREL . You must know everything . I 'm engaged  --  I 'm on the way to be engaged  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious in such a case . If Miss Thorne chooses to come dutifully to spend a month with her aunt ( though I 'm told the poor lady 's ailments do n't increase the charm of her conversation ) , I can hardly be expected to wait till the month is up to make my offer , or to break off my wooing in the middle because you happen to be established here . You see we 're just at that point when an offer is propos at any moment . And , really , I 'm extremely happy to find you so comfortably settled . You 'll not pretend you were better off in that dismal little house of your mother 's . Of course , if I could have arranged matters ideally , I should n't have chosen to come and make my offer under your very nose . But let me assure you that I shall remember what is due to you as far as I can without forgetting what is due to Miss Thorne . MARTHA . ( Who has stood silent , with her eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Even your very face is altered ! PEPPEREL . I 've let my beard grow . You 'll forgive me yet . MARTHA . Do n't ask too much . ( Turns to go . ) PEPPEREL . Yes , you 'll forgive me . Allow me five minutes more . I 'll prove what I say . MARTHA . Mr. Pepperel , spare me , I beseech you . PEPPEREL . You know our account 's not squared . I 'm your debtor . I seem as offensive as if I were a creditor . But you 'll get used to me . An hour or two hence , I shall beg for five minutes . It 's a little complicated !  --  Miss Thorne , I was told , is in the garden . We shall be having her jealous ! ( Goes out by the piazza . ) Scene Second : MARTHA alone , then STAVELEY . MARTHA . ( Sinks into a chair and remains for some moments plunged in thought . ) I was prepared for much , but I was not prepared for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fancied it the last humiliation to become a paid servant ,  --  for what am I more ? But it 's the greatest humiliation of all , I verily believe , simply to be a woman ; that includes the others : to listen and believe and trust as a woman ! Well , the world tells us that it 's a great privilege to suffer as a woman . It 's a pity I should n't at least enjoy that ! ( Brushes away her tears ; then suddenly rises . ) A voice on the piazza ? Yes , it 's Mr. Staveley . Nay , there are true men in the world , as well as false , and the woman he should address would not have to suffer for it . STAVELEY . ( Comes in from the piazza with a travelling-bag , which he places on a chair . ) Miss Noel ! Your humble servant . You 're not at home alone , I suppose . MARTHA . They 're all on the lawn and in the garden ,  --  a party of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're having tea on the grass . STAVELEY . Yes , I come with my birthday wishes ,  --  such as they are ! And why have you run away ? MARTHA . I 'm not expected to have any wishes , Mr. Staveley . STAVELEY . You 're morbid ; that 's what 's the matter with you . You 're expected to know how you 're valued . My aunt looks upon you as a  --  as a niece ! MARTHA . Not yet ! But I 'm a very silly girl ! Your aunt 's not there ; she 's been unable , as usual , to leave her room . I remain here to be within summons . STAVELEY . When next she sends for you , pray ask her if she can receive me . There 's no hurry . Who are they all , out there ? MARTHA . A dozen . Mrs. Seymour and her daughters , Mrs. Lewis , the two Miss Jessops and their brother , Mr. Hamilton , Mr. Jones , half a dozen gentlemen . STAVELEY . Including Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mr. Pepperel has just come . Wo n't you join them ? STAVELEY . Not just yet . propos of Mr. Pepperel , I wish , Miss Noel , to ask you three questions . ( As MARTHA turns away , aside . ) Mr. Pepperel 's name makes her blush ; Mr. Pepperel 's presence , if I 'm not mistaken , has made her cry . Can this poor girl have been one of his victims ? He was crossing the lawn there with the strut of the conquering hero ! If she will , she can help me . ( Aloud , as MARTHA comes down again . ) I have a particular desire to learn the position of things between Mr. Pepperel and my cousin . MARTHA . I can hardly tell you . Mr. Pepperel has just come . STAVELEY . O , but you do n't mean to say that you 've not guessed ! You 've had half the evidence ; what more does a woman need ? Margaret has been here a week , I believe . Has she told you nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Thorne is not communicative , and I 'm not inquisitive . Mr. Pepperel 's name has never been mentioned between us . STAVELEY . Ah , there it is ! She 's in love . Is it an engagement ? MARTHA . ( After a pause . ) You 've come to congratulate her ? STAVELEY . I 've come to remonstrate with her  --  if you can believe it . I disapprove of the match  --  I abominate Pepperel . It 's a matter , Miss Noel , in which you can perhaps assist me ; unless indeed , like most women , you 're silly enough to believe in the fellow . MARTHA . I thank you for the sex . STAVELEY . The sex ought really to be obliged to me . But if I can save Margaret , the others may look out for themselves . I 'm not a man who is fond of meddling in other people 's business ; but this time , I confess , I could n't sit still . Of course it will be a siege . She 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Noel , that you 're an observer . You know this terrible Margaret of ours . She 's pretty , she 's clever , and , when she will , she 's charming . She 's not charming when she wo n't ! She 's positive , I can tell you ! In plain English , she 's obstinate . If I may allow myself the expression , she 's hard ! I say all this to you ; of course I should never dare to say it to her . MARTHA . I hope not , I 'm sure . STAVELEY . O , you should hear the sweet things she says to me ! Well , this time I mean to brave them ! I never carried my point yet , but I 've never had one so well worth carrying . My courage has risen with the occasion . Friendship , as well as love , Miss Noel , can make a fool of a man . I 've been , first and last , of a hundred minds about my cousin . Sometimes I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care two straws for her ,  --  that her smiles and her frowns are all the same to me ! I 've declared that she 's cold , heartless , wilful beyond the limits of grace . Then for another six weeks it has seemed to me that her smile is the handsomest thing in the world , and that even her frown is very fine ,  --  as frowns go ! It 's not that I 've been in love with her . Worse than that ,  --  the pains without the pleasures ! I 've undertaken to befriend her for charity ; I 've wanted to be her good genius . A wilful woman , sooner or later , is sure to need one . Margaret 's too proud , poor girl ; she 'll make no sacrifice to the unknown gods . If the gods will only not come knocking some fine day at her door , to demand arrears ! I 've always been absurdly considerate ; I 've never contradicted her ; I 've left her to the gods to deal with . She thinks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boh ! to a goose , and I 'm in hopes she 'll rather like me if I tell her to her face she 's a fool . Unfortunately , to like that sort of thing demands a fund of sense ! How has he done it , what has he told her , to bring her to this pass ? Miss Noel , the gods do avenge themselves ! They do n't come nowadays in thunder and pestilence ; they do n't blast our crops nor slay our children ; they quietly punish us through our own passions . Here 's the proudest girl in the world infatuated with a man whose arm , if she really knew him , she would refuse to take for five minutes at a ball . ( Observing her . ) But you do n't believe me , Miss Noel . How can I hope she will ? MARTHA . It 's no affair of mine , save that I admire your zeal . STAVELEY . O , that 's what Mr. Wigmore , my cousin 's lawyer , said to me this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since my uncle 's death , ten years ago , he has been her guardian . I take the alarm , I rush to him and unfold the tale . " Margaret is about to bestow her hand upon Charles Pepperel , of whom you 've heard , a man a woman ca n't marry ,  --  a rank adventurer ! I know him , he knows me ! To the rescue ! " For all answer , he takes out his watch . " At ten o'clock this morning pretty Margaret became her own mistress . Twenty-one years ago to an hour she entered upon her minority . At ten o'clock this morning she issued from it , and my term of office expired . It 's now twenty minutes past . I have n't the least desire to overleap my authority . I 've had ten years ' bother ; I 've broken off three engagements already ,  --  one before she was out of frocks ; I 've fought a dozen pitched battles . For heaven 's sake , let me rest on my laurels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely . Let this go for his punishment ! " That 's all very well , but I 'd rather not anticipate Providence . I walked about three hours and thought of it ; I worked myself into a rage of benevolence . I packed my bag and jumped into the train , and here I am ! Now tell me , Miss Noel , whether , after all , I 'm simply a meddlesome fool . MARTHA . Your intention is surely excellent . But when a woman is deceived  --  ( She pauses . ) STAVELEY . ( Attentive . ) No man can undeceive her ? MARTHA . ( Abruptly . ) Try , Mr. Staveley ! I 'll pray for you . STAVELEY . I fancy you might help me Page 106 better than by your prayers . You do n't say much , but I imagine you 're very wise . MARTHA . ( Smiling . ) May I never speak again ! ( PEPPEREL has entered from the garden during the last words ; he advances . ) PEPPEREL . ( With gallantry . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starts and falters ; then collects herself . ) Excuse me ; I 'm called . ( Exit hastily . ) Scene Third : STAVELEY , PEPPEREL . The two men exchange a fixed glance and stand for a moment uncertain . PEPPEREL . ( Suddenly assumes an air of friendly recognition . ) Mr. Staveley ! For a moment I was at a loss to place you . STAVELEY . ( Aside . ) Good heavens ! Before such impudence , where 's my chance ? PEPPEREL . Just here I hardly expected to meet you ! But when a man has , like you , the happy pretext of cousinship , where else should one look for him ? ( Aside . ) Confound the cousinship ! Still Margaret has always made light of it . As one of the " family , " I must speak him fair . STAVELEY . I had n't the least doubt as to who you were . My only doubt was as to whether I 'd speak to you . PEPPEREL . ( Smiling . ) Admit , then , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to outstay her little party ; but she did n't mention you as one of the attractions . STAVELEY . I 've only just arrived . PEPPEREL . I 'm just arrived myself . We must have been fellow-travellers ; unless indeed you took the train . I always take the boat . It 's not so much longer ; I 've had time to go to the hotel and dress . And then there 's nothing I like so much as a summer evening on the water . STAVELEY . You have simpler tastes than when we last met ! PEPPEREL . O , that was in the  --  dark ages ! We met in some queer places , eh ? ( Aside . ) What the deuce is he coming to ? I 'll meet him half-way , but only half-way ! ( Aloud . ) Of course you know this is Miss Thorne 's birthday . I 've taken the liberty of bringing her a little present . ( Tapping his waistcoat-pocket . ) A ring , with a really uncommon diamond ! She has such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to accept this as a token of an altogether peculiar sentiment . She promised to follow me in here and give me my opportunity . I wish all those good people were ten miles away ! STAVELEY . I should indeed fancy a dozen good people might make you very uncomfortable . PEPPEREL . You seem inclined to try what one can do . ( After a pause . ) Evidently , you mean war . STAVELEY . I mean victory . It will be war only if you choose to adhere to a hopeless cause . PEPPEREL . My dear sir , you 're unforgiving . STAVELEY . It 's not a matter of forgiveness . I ca n't forget ! I might have forgiven you a dozen times any mere wrong of my own , and yet not be able to stand silent and see a woman whom I respect and esteem think of you as a man she can decently marry . PEPPEREL . You mean , then , I take it , to oppose my marriage ? STAVELEY . I mean to do what I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the undertaking . STAVELEY . I 've given them my best consideration . Have you anything to suggest ? PEPPEREL . Miss Thorne is a woman of a very high spirit . STAVELEY . Imagine her sensations , then , on finding herself married to you ! PEPPEREL . For a man who does n't mean war , you hit hard . STAVELEY . Give it up , and I 'll never strike another blow . PEPPEREL . You 're very generous . After all , what do your blows amount to ? You can prove nothing . STAVELEY . It depends upon what you call proof . PEPPEREL . You ca n't find chapter and verse , without a vast deal of trouble . Meanwhile , I shall gain time . STAVELEY . I can tell a plain tale in ten minutes . PEPPEREL . Your plain tale has a highly ornamental dnouement . The heroine 's married ! It 's a fact ! I doubt whether her husband would care to have her come into court . Without that , it 's simply your word . STAVELEY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my word carries some weight . PEPPEREL . Why , then , it 's just man to man ! STAVELEY . That sounds portentous . Still , I shall do my best . Here she comes . ( MARGARET comes in from the piazza . ) Scene Fourth : The Same , MARGARET . PEPPEREL . ( Meeting her . ) I 'm like Louis XIV. ,  --  I almost waited ! But I 've had good company . MARGARET . Why , Robert , when did you get here ? ( Giving him her hand . ) STAVELEY . Half an hour ago . I have n't shown myself , because I 've my toilet to make . MARGARET . Go and attend to it , and come and make yourself agreeable . PEPPEREL . ( Sotto voce to STAVELEY . ) I think , on the whole , I 'll defy you . STAVELEY . Agreeable ? O , I do n't promise to be that . As to my dressing ,  --  after all , need I ? Your friends must be going . MARGARET . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallantry ? STAVELEY . It 's not in my coat , Margaret . I 'll show you ! ( Takes his bag and exit . ) Scene Fifth : PEPPEREL , MARGARET . PEPPEREL . I came here , Miss Thorne , with a design for which my letter , three days since , must have prepared you . But even if my intention had been less definite , the five minutes ' talk I have just had with your cousin would have given it instant shape . MARGARET . Your letter was explicit , certainly . I did n't answer it because , after it , the least you could do was to come . And pray what has my cousin to do with the matter ? PEPPEREL . Margaret , I love you ! MARGARET . ( After a silence . ) I believe you 're honest . And what is this about Mr. Staveley ? PEPPEREL . To-day , you once told me , is your birthday . I 've not forgotten it . It falls in the nick of time . I have ventured to bring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a ring as I 've seen women wear of whom it was whispered that they were engaged . ( Takes her hand , which she slowly surrenders . He is about to pass the ring upon her finger , when she withdraws her hand , crosses her arms , and looks at him gravely . ) MARGARET . Your ring is beautiful , but you must give me time . PEPPEREL . I 've given you three days . MARGARET . I have your letter here in my pocket ; I 've been carrying it about with me . But the same words , spoken , sound new and strange . PEPPEREL . I love you ,  --  I love you ,  --  I love you ! Are you used to them now ? But you 're right to ponder the matter ! There 's the opinion of the world . Mr. Staveley , for one , altogether disapproves . MARGARET . Mr. Staveley ? What do you mean ? PEPPEREL . He has come down to forbid the banns . MARGARET . Pray who has asked his opinion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to hear it . You 're to hear it gratis . In three words , Margaret , he owes me a grudge , and he 's determined to prevent my marriage . He considers , naturally , that there can be no harsher vengeance . MARGARET . This is something new . From to-day I 'm my own mistress ; it shall not be for nothing . I owe it to you to assure you that my decision shall rest on grounds of my own , and not of my cousin 's . PEPPEREL . ( Aside . ) Victory , victory ! ( Aloud . ) Do you mean to listen to him ? MARGARET . I take it you 're not afraid to have me . PEPPEREL . I 'm not ashamed to say I 'm afraid of losing you . He 'll surprise you . MARGARET . It 's surprise enough to find him meddling in my affairs . PEPPEREL . You know your cousin , Margaret . He 's one of those men who go about measuring all mankind with the little inch measure of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've incurred his distinguished displeasure . It 's an old story . He has raked up a heap of scandal , with which , apparently , he means to regale your maidenly ears . I frankly confess that I 'm a man about whom stories can be told ; and I have the fatuity to believe that you 'll not care for me the less on that account . You do n't suppose that you 've taken me out of the nursery ; and you 'll not complain of having fixed the affections and renewed the youth of a man who had begun to fear that he had no heart and the world no charm . Concerning your cousin , to the best of my knowledge , History is absolutely silent ! I doubt that any one will ever come and startle you with " revelations " about Mr. Staveley . It 's no revelation , of course , to hear that he 's a narrow-minded , rancorous prig . However , there 's no smoke without fire , and I 've no doubt he has a dozen tales at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been idle , reckless , extravagant , selfishly fond of pleasure . I can trust you to believe that they prove nothing worse . I know but one pleasure now , Margaret ; and if to cling to that is selfish , I 'm a monster of egotism ! He has one little anecdote , I believe , which he considers his cheval de bataille . He threw out monstrous hints , but I ca n't imagine to what he alludes . I shall be curious to hear your report . I fancy it 's the tragical history of a certain young person whom he had taken it into his head to consider a model of all the virtues . I proved , irrefutably , that the list was incomplete , and he has never forgiven me this impeachment of his taste . MARGARET . You need n't mind details . ( After a silence . ) Do you know I 'm inclined to thank Mr. Staveley ? His interference has made us more intimate . PEPPEREL . You can thank him outright ! ( STAVELEY returns . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in such a fever that I find I 've forgotten half of them . MARGARET . Mr. Pepperel , go and amuse those poor people on the lawn . I do n't know what they think of their hostess . But when a girl has this sort of thing on her hands  --  PEPPEREL . I 'll represent you ! ( Aside . ) I fancy I 've fixed it , unless Martha speaks ! But , Martha 's an angel . ( Exit , by piazza . ) Scene Sixth : MARGARET , STAVELEY . MARGARET . For the pretty things you have to say to me , you can hardly be dressed enough . Mr. Pepperel tells me that you do n't approve of our acquaintance . STAVELEY . You must admit that , considering the deep and affectionate interest I have always taken in your affairs , you have never had reason to complain of my zeal , and that I have managed to temper it with a great deal of deference . MARGARET . You 've never had a decent pretext for interference . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't come to blow my own trumpet . I came to beseech you not to throw yourself away . The man whom you have honored with your favor is signally unworthy of it . MARGARET . There 's a beginning ! STAVELEY . You 'll excuse me if I lose no time . Those who know him best respect him least . He has neither heart nor conscience . His notions of what is honorable in conduct are absolutely grotesque . He 's a cool impostor . I know what I say . I ca n't stand still and see you sacrifice yourself to a pitiful delusion . Pause and reflect ; reconsider your impressions , and question your heart . I speak to you , Margaret , in the name of the tender good-will I have always borne you , in that of your young happiness and freedom , in that of the very pride and temper which make you resent my words . MARGARET . In the name of my pride and my temper , then , I beg you to know that your words are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know him and I love him . STAVELEY . You 're not the first to love him . You 'll not be the first to repent . He 's incapable of really caring for a woman . He does n't love you , he loves your money . MARGARET . My dear cousin , I 'm vastly obliged to you . You 've shaken me into position . Do I love him ? I had been asking myself . You 've made me say yes ! STAVELEY . You love your own will better ; and my impression is that in this matter you 're defending him far less than that . MARGARET . Charming ! While you 're about it , put an end to us both . STAVELEY . Are you actually engaged ? MARGARET . Considering the key in which you 've pitched the conversation , you 'll not think me rude if I tell you it 's none of your business . STAVELEY . Give me a week , and I 'll prove what I say . I 'll put you into communication with persons who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Pepperel : " propos , they tell me you 're a monster of vice . I do n't know what to say to it , but I think it 's very possible . Invitations are out for an inquest ; next Monday we shall hear witnesses . My cousin has kindly consented to conduct the proceedings . If you pass muster , I 'll have you . " STAVELEY . And your lover , if he 's an honest man , will fold his arms and smile serenely . MARGARET . My lover , if he 's the man I take him for , will calmly await the issue ; and then , when you and your witnesses have made proper fools of yourselves and  --  heaven forgive me !  --  of me , he 'll make me his bow : " I had looked for a wife , madam , and not for a judge in petticoats ! " STAVELEY . O , I 've no doubt he 'll treat you to a pretty piece of impudence ! MARGARET . Really , I 'm glad to love a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong nature . STAVELEY . If that 's all you want , why do n't you take your husband out of the Penitentiary ? MARGARET . Come , do n't talk to me again about my temper . I 'll go back to my guests ; they 're not amusing , but they 're decently polite . STAVELEY . You do n't suppose I 'm afraid to offend you . I came prepared for that . I 'll not ask you to wait a week ; give me an hour . I promise you in an hour to change your opinion . MARGARET . Do you know you 're amusing ? I 'm really tempted to consent . Of course , after this everything 's at an end between us , and I want a good round pretext for despising you . STAVELEY . Ah , my terrible cousin , that 's if I do n't succeed ! But if I do  --  MARGARET . I shall hate you . An hour , to a minute , mind ! ( Exit , to the garden . ) Scene Seventh : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives ! Well , madam , I do n't think I shall love you , at this rate . The trouble of dealing with really superior scoundrels is , that they have a way of wrapping themselves in their dishonor with as many classic folds as a Roman in his virtue . She likes a man who has enemies ! O romance , you 're no better than an old-clothes man ! If I could only make him out the coward he really is ! show her the dingy dishabille of his iniquity ! For that I must have facts and figures  --  and with only an hour to collect them . It would be awkward if I were to be wrong , after all , about this poor little Miss Noel . No , I always felt she had a little mystery of grief , and her tears just now , when Pepperel had left her , and her flight when he reappeared , fitted the key to the lock . Ten words from her , emphasized by that charming wise face and those sad gray eyes , ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest girl to speak such words . She 'll not do it for revenge , but she may for charity . If she will , she 's a trump ! And to save me time , here she comes ! ( Enter MARTHA , from the house . ) Scene Eighth : STAVELEY , MARTHA . MARTHA . I 've seen your aunt . She 'll receive you at seven . STAVELEY . I wish she had called it eight . For the coming hour I have my hands full . Margaret has given me an hour to prove my case . MARTHA . Poor Mr. Staveley ! You see what it is to try and help people in spite of themselves . STAVELEY . Do you think we ought to shrug our shoulders and let them pass ? MARTHA . Our own troubles make us sceptical . We say it 's a weary world , at best , and a little more or a little less  --  STAVELEY . O , this will never do ! I want you to believe . MARTHA . I confess , a very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Noel , has been tried . MARTHA . I never supposed I should tell you so . STAVELEY . I do n't ask you idly . The fact is relevant . You have suffered , I fancy , as Margaret may suffer , when , having believed her lover an honest man , she finds he 's a knave . MARTHA . How have you guessed all this ? STAVELEY . I 've guessed , because I 've observed you , if you 'll excuse the liberty . And I 've observed you , because I admire you . MARTHA . At that , I must excuse it ! STAVELEY . If I have observed to good purpose , you and Charles Pepperel have not met to-day for the first time . MARTHA . For the last . STAVELEY . ( Aside . ) How under heaven is a man to ask it ? ( Aloud . ) You know him well . MARTHA . I thought so till one hour ago . I find I 've but half known him . STAVELEY . Poor girl ! He has added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Here I am talking to you of him as of a stranger . STAVELEY . It 's a good beginning . Speak of him to Margaret ; tell her your story . MARTHA . I would rather it should end with you , Mr. Staveley . STAVELEY . Tell me all , then . ( As she remains silent , aside . ) There 's a request ! MARTHA . We were engaged . My mother was dead ; I was altogether alone ; fair words had a double price . For three days , I believe , he was sincere ; in three days I was convinced . I believed  --  my excuse is that I believed everything . I placed my slender patrimony in his hands , to reinvest to better advantage . We were to be married in a month . It was then , I suppose , that he met Miss Thorne ,  --  richer , prettier , more attractive than I , and apparently as credulous . Poor girl ! But she has a cousin ! From that moment till an hour ago I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me farewell  --  in a note of three lines , enclosing the titles of a scattered remnant of my property . As this was an insufficient support , I was obliged to earn my living . I found this situation as companion to your aunt , and I consider that I 've been fortunate . STAVELEY . Good heaven ! MARTHA . I do n't complain , Mr. Staveley . I 'm very happy . STAVELEY . O , allow me to doubt it . MARTHA . Your aunt 's eccentric , but she 's kind . STAVELEY . My aunt 's a fretful old shrew ! MARTHA . ( Smiling . ) Of course it takes less to content me than it would you . I have no generous dreams of helping and enlightening my fellow-mortals . STAVELEY . ( Looking at her a moment in silence . ) Miss Noel , you think I 'm a gross idiot ! MARTHA . I place my confessions at your service . STAVELEY . ( Aside . ) Ah , the brave girl ! ( Aloud . ) Have you still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've kept it . If you were a woman , you 'd know why . I am waiting for a moment in my own room to burn it up . STAVELEY . Keep it an hour longer . Give it to me . It 's for that you 've kept it . MARTHA . Do you really think so ? STAVELEY . ( After a pause . ) Do you know , Miss Noel , this high and mighty cousin of mine ought to be desperately obliged to us ? MARTHA . She 'll not forgive me , that I know . STAVELEY . We shall be in the same box . I 'll not waste my logic upon her . Pepperel will apprehend it better . He shall convince her ! If I have ten minutes ' talk with him , you 'll not object to my mentioning your letter . MARTHA . To what purpose ? STAVELEY . To bid him repent , by Jove ! under pain of exposure . To bid him disgorge ! You 're too patient by half ! MARTHA . You 're Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is her interests that are in question . As I can easily keep them distinct from my own , I had better see Mr. Pepperel . Yes , in fact , it 's better . An hour ago he asked me for an interview , which I then felt no inclination to grant . But , on reflection , I 've changed my mind . I wish to be just . He spoke of our " account . " I do n't know what he means , but I fancy he has some proposal for the restoration of my property . I shall bid him keep it and give up Miss Thorne . STAVELEY . Merciful powers ! Is that your notion of justice ? Let me deal with him . MARTHA . Thank you ; it 's my own affair . STAVELEY . I detest the idea of your meeting him again . MARTHA . I 'm very calm . And now while we 're talking , your aunt is waiting for you . STAVELEY .

They 've gone at last ; but it 's no thanks to you , Miss Noel . MARTHA . ( Smiling . ) Do you mean that , if I had been present , they would have gone earlier ? I have to be within sound of your aunt 's bell . MARGARET . I wish , by the way , you 'd bring in from the grass the shawls and cushions she lent us . It 's not for my aunt , but for my aunt 's nephew , that you 've been lingering here , I believe . I hope you found him more civil than I. He treated me to half an hour 's abuse of a friend so intimate that it amounted to telling me outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silence . ) Are you engaged , Miss Thorne ? MARGARET . If you feel disposed to congratulate me , you need n't wait . MARTHA . I ca n't in conscience congratulate you . MARGARET . Really , this is the Palace of Truth ! My cousin has n't wasted his time . MARTHA . I know Mr. Pepperel , not by your cousin , but by himself . ( Aside . ) I could tell him , but I really ca n't tell her . ( Aloud . ) I once did Mr. Pepperel more than justice . MARGARET . Ah , you are perhaps the young lady he told me of , in whom Mr. Staveley took such an interest and about whom he had his quarrel with Mr. Pepperel ! Hinc ill lachrym ; do you know Latin ? Tell me your story . MARTHA . I know nothing of Mr. Staveley 's quarrel , nor its cause . As for my story , your ear has evidently been gained in advance . MARGARET . Well , whatever it may have been , you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O , you poor creature ! ( Aloud . ) Excuse me ; I think you 'll be enlightened yet . MARGARET . What on earth is going to happen ?

My cousin 's in love with me ; he wishes to marry me himself ; of course , he detests poor Pepperel . MARTHA . I wonder whether , after all , you 're not to be congratulated . You 'll not be unhappy ; you evidently do n't know true coin from false . MARGARET . Jealousy , jealousy ! You , on your side , are in love with Mr. Pepperel , and it will serve your turn , of course , to have me give him up . You 'll console him . After the kind things you 've said of him , he 'll vastly need it ! MARTHA . Yes , decidedly , I congratulate you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancies . Excuse me ; I must fetch your aunt 's shawls . ( Exit to the garden . ) Scene Tenth : MARGARET , alone . MARGARET . Upon my word it 's a conspiracy ; I 've got the clew ! One would think I was a child of ten , to be frightened by long faces and big words . With all her demureness , that girl 's an intrigante . I feel for all the world like the heroine of a novel ,  --  a victim of the Inquisition ! ( Enter STAVELEY . ) Your machinery works to a charm ! You ought to have been here just now , to hear little Miss Noel rattle off her lesson . Scene Eleventh : MARGARET , STAVELEY . STAVELEY . Ah , she has told you  --  MARGARET . She told me that Mr. Pepperel was the blackest of villains ,  --  as plump as you 'd say good morning . I confess that I want something more than the word of a spiteful little governess , bursting with jealousy ! STAVELEY . Margaret , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed . But if this is your great stroke , you 've lost the game ! Remember , your time is nearly gone ! Twenty minutes hence , I 'm at your service . ( Exit . ) Scene Twelfth : STAVELEY , alone . STAVELEY . She has spoken , then , poor girl  --  with small success . Martha jealous , Martha spiteful ,  --  she the angel of forgiveness , the soul of generosity ! Aunt Jane , at least , does her justice . I wonder what on earth Aunt Jane thinks of my talk . Three questions about herself , her aches and her pains and her pills , and twenty about Miss Noel ! " She 's a good girl ,  --  a good girl ! " For Aunt Jane , that 's great praise . I doubt whether she has ever said it of any other young woman of the present corrupt generation ! Of Margaret and of Margaret 's choice , she altogether disapproves. propos of which I began to tell her of my scheme for the enemy 's confusion , when suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the frank stare of a wise old woman  --  seemed to say to me , " Robert Staveley , you 're making a mess ! " And truly , Robert Staveley , where 's your delicacy ? Is Miss Noel 's trouble really fit for nothing but to paint a moral and adorn a tale , for Margaret 's edification ? Is it the part of perfect gallantry to send the poor girl groping back into her dark past for a bugaboo to frighten Margaret ? O , Margaret 's not afraid ! Do I really care so very , very much for my gentle cousin , and so very , very little for Miss Noel , that I 'm willing to fold my arms and let Miss Noel fight the battle of my transcendental philanthropy ? Miss Noel would have me believe , perhaps , that she has a battle of her own to fight . Confound it , I 'll fight Miss Noel 's battles . Nay , she declines my services ! Well , she sha' n't fight mine , at all events ! And while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him ? She 's seeing him now , I suppose ! They 're talking it over . They 're in the library there , with the door closed . He 's pleading , flattering , swaggering ; she 's listening , blushing , remembering ! Ten to one , he 's insulting her ! Worse than that , he 's offering her twenty per cent on her stolen property ! Damn her property ! Let him keep it ! Really , that 's very well for me to say ! One would think I was jealous . Upon my soul , I am jealous . This raking up of her past altogether offends me ! Good heavens , where are they ? ( As he turns hastily to go out MARTHA enters from the garden , carrying several shawls and a couple of cushions . ) Miss Noel , I was going in search of you . You 're laden down like a packhorse .

STAVELEY . Turn that side against the wall . Have you seen him ? MARTHA . I 've seen Miss Thorne . STAVELEY . I know what that means . Accept my humble apologies for inducing you to expose yourself to such misinterpretation . MARTHA . Miss Thorne is the offended one . There was a time when I would have given advice as cold a welcome . STAVELEY . I wish you 'd forget that time , Miss Noel ! MARTHA . You 've done something , you know , to remind me of it . STAVELEY . To my ineffable regret ! Have you seen him ? MARTHA . ( Listening . ) I know his step . I hear it on the piazza . STAVELEY . For heaven 's sake , forget that ! Do me a favor . Forego this interview . MARTHA . I ca n't consent to your seeing him . I prefer to keep my grievance to myself . STAVELEY . Keep it then and welcome . I only wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have forgotten apparently your pledge to your cousin . STAVELEY . My cousin must shift for herself ; I 've need of my wits for my own cause . Let the gods interfere , Miss Noel ; they have n't human hearts ! And , after all , do you know I half pity Pepperel ? ( PEPPEREL , coming in from the garden , has heard these last words . ) Scene Thirteenth : The Same , PEPPEREL . PEPPEREL . ( Aside . ) He pities me , eh ? Does that mean he has made out his case ? I 've my card to play too . If Martha speaks , I 'll never believe in a woman again . ( Aloud . ) I 'm sorry to interrupt a tt -- tte so intimate ! But if Miss Noel will grant me the favor of ten minutes ' conversation  --  STAVELEY . Miss Noel is engaged . MARTHA . Five minutes , I think , will be enough . I will join you in the library . STAVELEY . ( With vehemence . ) Martha , I entreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . ) I seem destined to-day to do as you choose . PEPPEREL . Miss Noel will , as the advertisements say , hear of something to her advantage . STAVELEY . ( To MARTHA . ) Let there be nothing more between you , for better or worse ! He means to offer you your money . Decline it ! MARTHA . O philosopher ! PEPPEREL . To her immediate and substantial advantage . STAVELEY . You 've saved your conscience , sir . You 're excused . PEPPEREL . Madam , to you I speak . MARTHA . ( After a moment . ) You 're answered ! PEPPEREL . ( Stares from one to the other and then turns away with a shrug . Aside . ) Excused , answered ! There 's a graceful unanimity ! Really , I think I 'm more frightened than hurt , Jupiter Tonans has forgotten his thunder to flirt with  --  with Hebe ! If I were only an old pagan , I 'd spend the money in vows ! Truly , I am pagan enough for that ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Aloud . ) Your humble servant . ( Makes them a bow in silence , and turns toward the door , where he meets MARGARET , with whom he stands a moment in talk , watching MARTHA and STAVELEY . ) STAVELEY .

You came here for a disinterested purpose . ... Forgive me . I ca n't accuse you of having remained for an altogether selfish one . STAVELEY . You 'll join me in the library ! MARTHA . You must not desert your cousin . STAVELEY . I know my cousin better than I did an hour ago . I think I can leave her to consolidate her own prosperity . She 'll get full weight , in one way or another . Poor Mr. Wigmore ! ( MARGARET comes forward with PEPPEREL . ) Scene Last : The Same , MARGARET . MARGARET . Cousin , I believe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You 're overdue . PEPPEREL . Mr. Staveley has been so busy . MARGARET . In an hour , you know . STAVELEY . Really , I 'm afraid you must despise me !

It is essentially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art as a diseuse long before she had achieved the international reputation she enjoys today . When James first saw her do some of her characterizations and sketches she had not yet embarked upon her professional stage career ; she had appeared in London in a few private salons , always writing and developing her own material . Miss Draper talked to James of her plans . She wondered whether she should go on the stage in plays , devote herself to writing or do the unique type of sketch she later made famous . She has quoted James as saying to her , " My dear child ... you ... have woven ... your own ... very beautiful ... little Persian carpet . ... Stand on it ! " That she had produced a deep impression is shown in the fact that he wrote the monologue even though she assured him it was not her habit to use material other than that written by herself . He sent her his first rough draft , keeping no copy for himself , and wrote to her on December 4 , 1913 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your purpose . ... I seem definitely to ' visualize ' you and hear you , not to say infinitely admire you , very much in it . It strikes me , going over it again , as a really practical , doable little affair . ... " He pleaded for complete anonymity and gave her permission to cut it " if you find anything can be spared . " He expressed doubt on that score , however , " because it seems to me so close already , for comprehension and clearness ; for adequate expression , I mean , of its idea . " Miss Draper felt that to have done the monologue without revealing its authorship , as James suggested , was impossible . For one thing it " bore his peculiar stamp . " She felt she certainly could not do it as written by herself , and consequently she never produced it . " I think he was disappointed , but I never learned it or tried it on anyone , " she said . Readers of Henry James 's novels and tales will recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Queenship " which he felt to be too prevalent among American women of his day . James had written all his life about American women , representing them in his fiction either as supremely gifted heiresses of all the ages , or as predatory creatures , or as creatures such as Daisy Miller , simple , naive , possessed of a New World freshness and insouciance unaware of complex forces at play around them . He liked the courage , independence and individuality of the American woman ; but on the negative side of their new-found freedom he saw some of them as aggressive , demanding , masculine . Spoiled by doting husbands or parents , they walked across the American-European stage , hard and imperious , graceless and exacting . In a series of articles written for Harper 's Bazar in 1907 on the speech and manners of American women , reflecting his impressions of his rediscovery of America after his long residence abroad , he clearly expresses his disappointment that the American woman 's enviable social position did not seem to carry with it a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American woman has not asked of her ... that she shall have definite conceptions of duty , activity , influence ; of a possible grace , a possible sweetness , a possible power to soothe , to please , and , above all , to exemplify . It has simply ... taken her for granted as a free , inspired , supreme thing , nobly exempt ... there is nothing the American woman socially less resembles than a second fiddle . It is before her , and her only , that the score is open , while , without any hesitation , and with a play of elbow all her own , she brandishes the bow . " It is in this context , as in the context of The Bostonians with its ironical treatment of suffragettes , faddists , the " do-gooders " of James 's time , the socially and politically ambitious female , that this little monologue must be read . A NOTE ON THE TEXTS In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication , over a period of two decades , the editor was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . The corrections and emendations were such as occur in the progress of a modern play from the dramatist 's desk , through the production office into the theatre . James was called upon to revise his plays many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays , nor the textual problems arising from collation , warranted such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  that is of truth , fidelity to text and to the writer 's intentions  --  while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would serve : that of demonstrating their role in Henry James 's half-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some producer might be caught in the process  --  provide the means for the appearance of at least some of them on the American stage . I therefore directed my editing to this end . It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of the London production , two of them from James 's own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors . It was thus possible to give the mutations of James 's first important effort in the theatre , including a variant fourth act . As regards the other plays , a simple principle was applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the cuts restored ; in a few minor instances there were cuts followed by alterations and where these were in James 's hand they were accepted as his final reading ; where there were simply cuts , these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable , the alternate readings have been given . There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons ' typescripts of the play , I decided that it would be of interest to publish the text as actually performed on the stage in 1909 , which James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed ; as the short story Covering End and in the final form it took when it reached the stage . While James went over most of the manuscripts of his plays , making corrections and verbal changes , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's alternately referring to " Valentin " and " Valentine " are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization . In some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech ; these have been spelled out as an aid to readability .

Main text The Secretary of Embassy , who has called , is there in her sitting-room at the hotel or wherever , but she is clearly disappointed as to what he has had to say . Do you mean to say , Mr. Lynch , that you 've come to tell me my Presentation is n't even yet arranged , after all the time I 've given you  --  with my writing on from Florence ? Why , I 've got to go over to Paris for at least three weeks on the 23rd ; so this next Drawing-room is just the one I want , as I ca n't possibly be here for the one after , and still less wait if there 's to be another ; I want to get the good of it  --  I should think you 'd understand !  --  before I 'm about ten years older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  is that what you suggest , but just for my sweet society and to talk over friends in New York ? Well , then , you shall have all of my society you want as soon as this thing is fixed  --  but I wo n't talk over anything till you can let me know it is . I have the Ambassador 's promise  --  that is , I have your colleague 's assurance , which I hope you understand I take for a promise  --  that the Ambassador wants me to be put right through . Why , he told me so himself last week , when I asked him what you 're all here for , in such style , at our expense , unless to back us up and protect us . Your colleague , as your superior , is responsible ?  --  and he must be attending to it ; is that what you mean ? Well , I want you to go right to that telephone  --  just step across the hall there , you 'll see , and ring them up about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me my name 's down for the 9th . What will I do for you if you see about it ? Why , I 'll just tell you with my sweetest smile that I 'm glad to see you do feel what you were sent out here for ; it seemed to me at the Embassy lunch that you did n't quite feel it . Do n't you know you were sent out to act , for our benefit  --  not to talk about it , but just to do it : for which I 'm giving you such a splendid chance . Yes , you shall have tea at five if Sir Robin Adair does n't come in before  --  I 'm staying in for him on purpose , but he 's usually before his time , and rather awful , too , if he finds anyone else . He mostly does , as I could n't live in solitude for him , poor man , even if I wanted to ; but I told them to let in nobody but you  --  just to have from you what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . ) Here he is . ( To her maid , who ushers in SIR ROBIN . ) Faites voir Monsieur le tlphone . How are you , dear Sir Robin ? You know Mr. Lynch , our Second Secretary ?  --  who 's arranging my Presentation for the 9th . ( Then as the two men have bowed and the maid waits , waving MR . LYNCH off . ) Remember the 27th wo n't do a wee speck ... ( The door closed , she is alone with SIR ROBIN . ) Why yes . I 've got to go to Paris for about three weeks  --  oh do n't be afraid , you wo n't lose me for long , and I expect you 'll come over too ! So it simply has to be this first one . And it 's always my rule , too , everywhere , to have my Presentation fixed for the very first date , do n't you see ?  --  so that I come in for whatever else I want . You can do all sorts of things with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you know . I lost about a month at Berlin last year  --  they seemed too helpless , and at last I practically did it myself .

( Then , as if he has spoken amusedly . ) I seem to make them do what I want ? Why , what in the world should I make them do ? I agree with you  --  one ought to help them on their way . Then if they do n't understand , poor dears , it is n't at least one 's fault ; and I do n't at all subscribe to the pushing and fighting and rowing that your women seem to find necessary .

Why , I had never really had to ask for anything in all my life till I struck that state of things in Berlin . Their women are abject  --  they grovel to the men ; and our Embassy , with the sight of it all round them , seemed to have lost their own sense ! Do n't I miss it here then  --  since yours grovel too ? Do n't I miss our native pedestal and the lovely way we just float on ? ( She looks at him a moment with beautiful bland archness . ) Well , no , Sir Robin  --  I do n't think I miss anything with you , because I seem to recognise that you feel the charm  --  oh no ( with a laughing protest against the too personal application ) , I do n't mean mine more than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that of our beautiful response to the way we 're treated in general  --  when we 're really nice : the effect on us of being treated as Queens is that we have the grace and dignity and outlook of a class expected to receive homage sweetly . We get so much of it that we have practice  --  we know how ; and that 's why ( more and more charming to him ) I have the confidence just to accept all yours . It 's the way to make you comfortable  --  do n't pretend to tell me it is n't . I know how to make people comfortable , and ( as she sees her maid reappear ) I do n't mind telling you that my husband over there is the person in all the world I make most so ! Un tlgramme ? Merci . ( With the missive , holding it up as a trophy . ) A cable  --  propos !  --  just to show how he feels I trust him ; and probably not even his regular remittance ; since he knows by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just laid then , with his compliments , at the foot of my Throne .

No , it is n't a remittance . ( Taking in the disconcerting difference . ) It 's only a Liberty ! Then they do take them with us , you say ? Possibly  --  ( throwing up her head with spirit , with decision and disgust )  --  Men are capable of anything anywhere ! But this is quite the first Mr. Tuff has ever taken  --  and ( with still higher decision ) I nip it in the bud . What I call a Liberty ? I call that .

Mr. Tuff is n't much on Drawing-rooms . ( Yet explicitly , for the benefit of both . ) Mr. Tuff is a very nice man  --  and a very fine man ; but he has no call at all to London ; and ( to MR .

Used by permission of Oxford University Press , Inc.  --   --   --   - -  @@2614 FOREWORD " Theatre-stuff ... Drama-stuff " In this volume there appear , collected for the first time , the complete plays of Henry James , together with the unfinished scenario for an unwritten play and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as we know the novelist completed twelve plays in all . Five were published during his lifetime ; the remaining seven have never before appeared in public print . Four of the unpublished plays were produced on the London stage , three with moderate success and one under circumstances , fully described in this book , which proved disastrous for the novelist 's career in the theatre . It will be asked why James himself never published all his plays upon which he lavished , over many years , the resources of his literary maturity . He lived in an era when , in the Anglo-Saxon world , publication of plays was not as common as it is today ; and even today only the highly successful play usually is able to make its way into print . James , on more than one occasion , deplored the failure of the English-speaking audience to demand the text of a play with the same insistence as did the Continental audience . " A comedy or a tragedy , " he wrote in the preface to his novel The Awkward Age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons in London or in New York to desire that view of its text which is so desired in Paris , as soon as a play begins to loom at all large , that the number of copies of the printed piece in circulation far exceeds at last the number of performances . But as with the printed piece our own public , infatuated as it may be with the theatre , refuses all commerce . ... " And in that sprightly imaginary conversation on the shortcomings of the British theatre , After the Play , published by him at the moment when he was settling down to five years of play-writing , he put into the mouth of one of his personages this same complaint : " There 's no text . ... One ca n't put one 's hand upon it ; one does n't know what one is discussing ... nothing is ever published . " And again : " A play is n't fully produced until it is in a form in which you can refer to it . " He published his dramatization of Daisy Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of its success in the story form , after it had been rejected by both New York and London managers ; and in 1894-95 he published in England and in America his two series of Theatricals , apologizing in his prefaces for offering to the public plays which had never justified their existence by being performed . Theatricals received a poor press and had a negligible sale . Thereafter Henry James never again published his plays . He did , however , devise a way of getting some of them into the hands of a wider public than they might have reached in their original form . In 1898 , in preparing The Turn of the Screw for publication , he found that it made too slim a volume by itself ; having at hand the one-act Summersoft , written for Ellen Terry but never produced by her , he turned it into the story Covering End , and it appeared as a companion piece to his now-celebrated ghostly tale , in the volume entitled The Two Magics . In a letter to H. G. Wells of December 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play to story : " For three mortal years had the actress for whom it was written ( utterly to try to fit ) persistently failed to produce it , and I could n't wholly waste my labor . The British Public wo n't read a play with the mere names of the speakers  --  so I simply paraphrased these and added such indications as might be the equivalent of decent acting  --  a history and an evolution that seem to me moreover explicatively and sufficiently smeared all over the thing . The moral is of course Do n't write one-act plays . " It is amply clear thus that Henry James would long ago have published his plays had conditions been favorable . To a request made in 1913 that he give a critic access to his plays for the writing of an article about them , he replied emphatically : While they were being played they of course came in for whatever attention the Press was paying to the actual and current theatre . They were inevitably then Theatre-stuff , and as such took their chance ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , Drama-stuff  --  which is quite a different matter . It is only as Drama-stuff that I recognize their exposure to any public remark that does n't consist simply of the critic 's personal remembrance of them as played things . ... When my Plays , such as they have been , are published , then of course the gentleman you mention will enjoy all aid to his examination . I am sorry I can not now oblige you further than by promising you a copy of such volume or volumes on that occasion . ... The occasion never came . Henry James died three years after writing this letter and the manuscripts of the unpublished plays were placed in a large trunk , together with his notebooks and other papers , and sent to America . There they remained and were examined by the editor of this volume some years before 1942 , when the novelist 's nephew , the late Henry James of New York , who was his literary executor , presented them to the Houghton Library at Harvard . The text of the one-act Summersoft was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sole copy to the actress , Elizabeth Robins . Copies of the four produced plays , The American , Guy Domville , The High Bid and The Saloon , also are to be found in the Lord Chamberlain 's Office in London , where they were deposited in conformity with British regulations for the censorship and licensing of plays , and their texts , together with other extant texts color=redPage 11 described elsewhere in this volume , have been carefully collated for the purposes of this edition . It is doubtful whether the format in which the plays appear here would have met with the unqualified approval of Henry James , even though his Daisy Miller play appeared in just such a form in the pages of the Atlantic Monthly . He was , in this respect , a devout and uncompromising follower of the French , and when Daisy Miller was to be published in book form he wrote to his American publisher , J. R. Osgood : " I should only make the condition that it be printed in the manner of French comedies  --  that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not on a line with them . " His Theatricals were put forth in this form , with much white space around each speech . The considerable bulk of his collected dramatic works makes it impossible , in these days of complex book production , to do the same for them , but in every other way his manuscripts have been faithfully reproduced ; such editorial changes as have been made have been largely in the interest of consistency within the given play and are fully explained in the note on the texts . The editor has , in arranging the volume , taken his cue from Henry James , who remarked , when he was seeking to justify his publication of the two series of Theatricals , that if more rejected plays were published " with some history of their adventures " they " would end by constituting in themselves a suggestive , almost a legitimate literature . ... " In an attempt to meet the conditions which James envisaged , the history of each " adventure " has been set down here as fully as possible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two unfinished novels and , more recently , of the Notebooks , completes  --  with a few minor exceptions  --  the publication of all the posthumous papers of Henry James which were in Lamb House at the time of his death . It should now be possible to evaluate the place these plays occupy in the large body of Henry James 's work and , still more important , to estimate , as Allan Wade put it many years ago , " the loss sustained by the refusal of the 19th century theatre to encourage Henry James 's attempts to write for it " L.E . ACKNOWLEDGMENT Publication of the dramatic works of Henry James marks the completion of a twenty-year quest to arrive at the singular story of the novelist 's obsession with the theatre . When these researches were begun it was fashionable in critical circles to dismiss the play-writing phase as " disastrous "  --  a waste of precious time in which the novelist might have been writing fiction instead . Moreover , Henry James himself had been highly secretive about his play-writing ; he confided his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague record in the letters to his intimates , and he scrupulously destroyed the working notebooks for his dramas . It seemed to me that criticism had too readily dismissed five years in the creative life of a great novelist whose later fiction was described as " dramatic " in structure and whose dramatic years were followed by the heightened creativity since called his " major phase . " The results of my preliminary researches were embodied in a doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne , published in French , Henry James : Les annes dramatiques ( Paris , 1931 ) . Subsequently , I was charged by the late Henry James of New York , nephew of the novelist and his literary executor , to edit the plays and there began the long search to run down all the texts as well as the correspondence with managers , producers , actors and actresses . I talked to such actors as had appeared in James 's plays and who were still on the stage ; to playwrights , friends , theatregoers of that distant time . I caused searches to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coherent story began to emerge , more detailed than any yet recorded , of the novelist 's bitter-sweet theatrical endeavors in the fading years of the Victoria era , as well as during the brief later phase in the first decade of the new century . My debt accordingly is very great to many persons who made possible the reconstruction of an unusual chapter of biography and literary  --  as well as dramatic  --  history . I can not sufficiently express the extent of my debt to Henry James , the third bearer of a distinguished name , oldest son of William James , who allowed me to examine the James family papers some years before he finally presented them to Harvard College where they now constitute one of the prized collections of the Houghton Library . An accomplished biographer , possessing the gift of expression characteristic of his distinguished forebears , scholarly  --  although his life work lay in the fields of education and administration  --  he took a personal interest in my task and closely followed its development , offering encouragement and assistance that enabled me to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dorothea James , who shared her husband 's interest in the project , for sympathetic assistance given me since his death in 1947 . To the third Henry James 's brother , William , and his wife , Alice , of Cambridge , Massachusetts , I am indebted for a similar friendliness and sympathy ; both were very close to the novelist during his last years , had resided with him at Lamb House , and at various times they have evoked for me vivid memories of that period , as well as affording me access to valuable letters and documents . A major portion of the research for this volume was accomplished during 1937-39 with the aid of a fellowship of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation , granted for a year and generously renewed , which permitted in particular the collation of the texts and a journey to France and England as well as a prolonged stay at Harvard for the accumulation of material . I am indebted for many kindnesses shown me at the Houghton Library by William A. Jackson , its director , and his staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who provided continued access to the James Collection as well as other Harvard collections in the later stages of my task . My debt to the following will readily be apparent from the content of the volume and the notes appended to it : Lady Alexander , widow of Sir George Alexander , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Archer , brother of William Archer , Mary Anderson de Navarro , Douglas Ainslie , Arnold Bennett , Clare Benedict , E. F. Benson , Theodora Bosanquet , Daphne du Maurier , Lucien Daudet , Mary Robinson-Duclaux , Blair Fairchild , W.

Graham Robertson , Jill Esmond and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose period of employment there extended from the 1890 's into our own time , and whose fund of recollection and anecdote , one warm sunny London morning years ago , set me upon rewarding avenues of research . Of The American cast , I talked or corresponded with Mrs. Edward Compton , Elizabeth Robins and Clarence Blakiston and received additional information from Compton Mackenzie , son of Edward Compton . The story of The High Bid came largely from Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson and his wife , Gertrude Elliott , Elizabeth Robins provided the text of Summersoft and Edith Craig the letters to her mother , Ellen Terry . Gertrude Kingston and Halliwell Hobbes illuminated the story of The Saloon and Granville-Barker and Allan Wade that of The Outcry . John Balderston , Donald Brien , James Gilvarry , Rupert Hart-Davis , Paul Lemperly , Simon Nowell-Smith , Harold Moulton and P. S. O'Hegarty provided material from their collections , and the facilities of the Huntington Library , the libraries of Middlebury College in Vermont and Colby College in Maine were made available to me , as were those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex Symington .

I am especially grateful to the late George W. Latham , my professor of more than , two decades ago , who first oriented me toward these researches and to H. G. Files of McGill University under whom they were begun ; to my friend , Edward K. Brown of the University of Chicago , who provided stimulus , and guidance at various stages of the work ; to F. O. Matthiessen , Harry Levin and John L. Sweeney for kindnesses shown me during my work at Harvard ; to Bertha C.

Both followed my researches step by step , read the manuscript and offered invaluable criticism and guidance . L. E. Henry James : The Dramatic Years An Introductory Essay by Leon Edel It is of course for my reader to say whether or no what I have done has meant defeat ; yet even if this should be his judgment I fall back on the interest , at the worst , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEPARTURE In the hours before dawn of January 4 , 1910 , Henry James  --  he was then sixty-seven  --  sat at his work table in Lamb House , Rye , Sussex , scrawling notes for a new novel in a rapid , half-illegible script across large loose sheets , a deluge of words pouring from an image-crowded mind and hurriedly transcribed by a tired old hand . As the balanced sentences formed themselves , exploring the plot , casting about for structural elements , gathering up moments of memory , a sense of exhilaration swept over the novelist  --  the joy of remembering , assembling , creating . The manuscript pages , with their pencilled scribble , tell the story : the sense of creative strength , the gratitude , mystical and semi-religious , for the guidance of his " blest Genius , " the surge of passion , the expression of tender feeling for the Muse  --  the hidden " powers and forces and divinities " at the source of his art . The passage he wrote has all the quality of a fervent prayer : I come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the dramatic way  --  as I can only see everything and anything now . ... Momentary sidewinds  --  things of no real authority  --  break in every now and then to put their inferior little questions to me ; but I come back , I come back , as I say , I all throbbingly and yearningly and passionately , oh mon bon , come back to this way that is clearly the only one in which I can do anything now , and that will open out to me more and more , and that has overwhelming reasons pleading all beautifully in its breast . Why was the " dramatic way " the only way ? That is our point of departure . A SMALL BOY AT THE THEATRE Henry James was taken to the theatre at an early age , probably during his eighth year , and thereafter , for sixty years , he was a consistent ( and consistently critical ) playgoer . He was a stage-struck boy , a stage-enamored young student , a serious-minded drama critic during his early manhood , and in middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost its fairy-tale spell for him . He might grumble at the poorness of the play , sitting deep in his stall , his eyes taking in every detail on the stage ; he was seldom satisfied with the actors , save those of the Thtre Franais ; he tended to speak of " theatre " as an institution created to " murder " dramatic literature ; yet , when the new play opened , at the hushed moment before the curtain 's rise , he was there in box or stall , ready to renew the experience , ready to sit glowing with momentary satisfaction or moaning and muttering to himself , or , so it has been reported , rising half-way through a play with an audible " I ca n't bear it any longer , " and stalking from the theatre . There were times when his attitude was less overtly belligerent . Going to the theatre in the company of actresses  --  the great Fanny Kemble , Mary Anderson , Elizabeth Robins  --  provided ears for his running commentary and opportunities for the exercise of wit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novelist to the play : " One never grew wholly acclimatized to the nipping airs that now and then would blow about the startled stalls . Mr. James 's all too audible remarks , conveyed in terms always ' chosen , ' often singularly picturesque , sometimes diabolic , as though he revelled in mercilessness  --  would send cold shivers down his companion 's spine . " Mary Anderson 's testimony sheds further light . " He sat by me and whispered his criticisms . ' You see that fat , rubicund old Colonel on the stage now ; well , shortly he is bound to say " Damn it , sir , " and the audience will be delighted . Oh , they love trifles and vulgar trifles very often . ' He had hardly finished speaking when the fat old Colonel said , ' Damn it , sir , ' and the audience laughed long and loud . ... " If the middle-aged playgoer thus brought a personal bias and an intricate and highly individual critical apparatus into the theatre , it was because in mid-nineteenth century a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his parents with uncommon regularity , and because those nights in the theatres of Broadway , Chambers Street and Park Place provided that familiarity with the " scenic art " which is a pre-requisite to critical theatregoing . Memories of these imaginative , artistic childhood adventures crowd the 436 pages of Henry James autobiographical A Small Boy and Others , a volume which covers only the first fourteen years of his life . Fully one-eighth of the book is filled with the names of plays and actors , what they wore and how they strutted , their very grimaces , as well as of the lamplit and gaslit old theatres  --  all recounted and pictured with an evident delight at seventy , although six decades separated the old James from the little New York playgoer . He remembered how he used to wander down lower Fifth Avenue spelling out the names of plays and players on the yellow and white billboards , pasted in those days on large screens and sociably disposed against trees and fences ; and he remembered how he used to trudge up Broadway , his hoarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fare , averting his eyes as he passed the doughnut stands , in order to attend the matinees at Barnum 's " Lecture Room " to which little boys were drawn by the same magic that draws little boys of our era to the movie palace and the " western . " Here the dramatic art was embodied for him in the person of such actresses as the red-faced Emily Mestayer , with damp ringlets and a " vast protuberance of bosom " playing in J. Sheridan Knowles 's Love or The Countess and the Serf , shouting at the top of her lungs that a purse of gold " would be the fair guerdon of the minion " who should start on the spot to do her bidding . He remembered her also as Eliza in Uncle Tom 's Cabin , " her swelling bust encased in a neat cotton gown " and her flight across the ice blocks " intrepidly and gracefully performed . " The theatre was assigned this role in young Henry 's life by the senior Henry James . The book , the literary periodical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held places of importance in the lives of the four James boys and their sister ; but books could be read quietly at home , and pictures studied in picture-books or in a casual stroll through a gallery , whereas going to the theatre involved a trip in a carriage , an encounter , over flickering footlights , with strange and fantastic characters , and after the performance , recapitulation and critical discussion . Henry 's parents , he tells us , had a simple theory . They liked the theatre , such as it was in those early American days of lurid melodrama and elaborate farces , Shakespearian productions that would seem heavy-handed to us , and burlesque Dickens characters . They reasoned that if the plays were good enough for them they were good enough for the children . But first , before he had reached the age considered ripe for theatregoing , there were the allied pleasures : the pantomime , the concert hall , and , inevitably , the circus . Theatres came later . He remembered hearing the infant Adelina Patti , poised in an armchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; visits to Niblo 's Gardens to see the Ravels in their pantomime of Jocko or The Brazilian Ape and Zaoul or The Magic Star ( it emerges in James 's recollections as Raoul or The Night Owl ) and to Franconi 's " monumental " Hippodrome , which rang with Roman chariot races . There was a visit to the New York version of the Crystal Palace , sprawled over half a dozen acres in the far reaches of " uptown " Forty-second Street ; it seemed to Henry James years later that he got the first taste of a voyage to Europe here , in the light of the Palace 's Old World origins , so that the return in the autumn dusk on the new Sixth Avenue cars was a " relapse into soothing flatness , a return to the Fourteenth Street horizon from a far journey . " He never forgot that his older brother William was taken to the theatre first . He has left us a record in two places of the incident . In A Small Boy the novelist identifies Charlotte Cushman with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but languished at home when my betters admired Miss Cushman . " " My betters " included William , who was a year older than himself . Ten years before this allusion , he had set down a fuller account in a biography of the American sculptor , William . Wetmore Story , where a reference to the actress set him off on a digression that concerned his own boyhood rather than the life of Story . He and his brother , one winter 's evening in their Fourteenth Street home , were doing their lessons for the next day ; the parents were at the theatre seeing Miss Cushman in Shakespeare 's Henry VIII . Suddenly the father reappeared ; he had driven home from the theatre in haste at the end of the scene or act , impressed with the play 's interest for the older of the small boys . William was snatched up from his homework and taken off to see Shakespeare . And the Henry James of 1900 , looking back at the small Henry of 1850 , is filled with pity and resentment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through my being inadequately estimated , I did not assist , is one of the most ineffaceable in my tolerably rich experience of the theatre . I recall it as a vivid vigil in which the poor lonely lamplight became that of the glittering stage in which I saw wondrous figures and listened to thrilling tones , in which I knew " Shakespeare acted " as I was never to know him again , in which , above all , I nursed my view of paternal discrimination . Miss Cushman played in Henry VIII in September 1849 , again in January 1850 and in June 1851 ( always at the Broadway Theatre and not at the Park , as Henry recalled ) and at Brougham 's Lyceum in 1852 . By 1852 , however , Henry had been taken to the play and consequently the 1850 date  --  a winter 's night  --  would seem the most plausible . He was then seven  --  old enough to sense keenly the " paternal discrimination " in favor of an older brother who would then have been eight . He has set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own theatregoing . He believed the play was A Comedy of Errors , produced by William Burton in his small theatre in Chambers Street . The Shakespearian production Henry James describes in his memoirs , however , could not have been his first experience as a playgoer . Burton produced A Comedy of Errors during 1853 and again in 1855 , and by that time the small boy had already seen many plays . The production he describes fits completely Burton 's of April 18 , 1855 , when Henry was twelve . The novelist recalled that " a celebrated actor , whose name I inconsistently forget , had arrived to match Mr. Burton as the other of the Dromios . " Burton was twinned on this occasion by the Dromio of Harry Hall , " an actor of good repute " newly-arrived from London . The novelist remembers also Mrs. Holman as playing Adriana in this production ; she was , indeed , in the cast , but in the role of Luciana . The only other productions of the play during this time were at Barnum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowery Theatre in March of that year . 1851 could have been that of Henry James 's coming-of-age as a theatregoer . He was eight and we have seen that this was the age at which William was judged by his father to be old enough to see Shakespeare . We can speculate therefore that James may have seen the earlier production of A Comedy of Errors and telescoped it with the more elaborate Burton production of 1855 . He remembered that the play had been read to him during the day of his theatregoing debut ; he recalled the " sacred thrill " once inside the theatre in Chambers Street before the green curtain that refused to go up : " One 's eyes bored into it in vain , and yet one knew it would rise at the named hour , the only question being if one could exist till then . " We can picture the James family arriving at the theatres of old New York with their two older sons , during the early 1850 's : the long-bearded senior Henry , descending from the inevitable carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ever afterwards relied on this means of transport  --  accompanied by his quiet , soft-spoken wife and two bright-eyed boys , probably attired in brass-buttoned jacket such as Henry wears in a daguerreotype of the period , buttoned right up to the neck , with only an edge of white shirt showing . Young Henry was taken to all the leading New York theatres of the mid-century  --  Burton 's , the Broadway and the National , Wallack 's Lyceum , Niblo 's Gardens and Barnum 's " Lecture Room " attached to the Great American Museum . It was the era when many theatres , in the lingering Puritanism , still masqueraded as gardens , lecture rooms , lyceums  --  anything in name but what they really were . At Burton 's he saw such familiar farces of the time as The Toodles and The Serious Family ; at the Broadway the super-spectacle of The Cataract of the Ganges or The Rajah 's Daughter and the popular Green Bushes ; at Wallack 's the clever comedies of Dion Boucicault ( James rightly recalls that it was then written Bourcicault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And always there is the vivid recollection of the actors : William Burton , the Aminadab Sleek , Mr. Toodles or Paul Pry , " his huge person , his huge fat face and his vast slightly pendulous cheek , surmounted by a sort of elephantine wink , to which I impute a remarkable baseness " ; Madame Ponisi , the Oberon of A Midsummer Night 's Dream " as representing all characters alike with a broad brown face framed in bands or crowns or other heavy headgear out of which cropped a row of very small tight black curls " ; Madame Cline Celeste , " straight out of London " in Green Bushes ( J. B. Buckston 's play which James wrongly attributes to Boucicault ) , " whose admired walk up the stage as Miami the huntress , a wonderful majestic and yet voluptuous stride enhanced by a short kilt , black velvet leggings and a gun haughtily borne on the shoulder is vividly before me . ... " Miss Julia Bennett " fresh from triumphs at the Haymarket ... in a very becoming white bonnet , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licentious design , I forget which , though with a sense somehow that the white bonnet , when of true elegance , was the note of that period of the adventuress . " We can multiply examples of these crowded recollections , sometimes accurate in all details , sometimes mistaken , as when he assures us he saw Fanny Wallack in London Assurance " as Lady Gay Spanker , flushed and vociferous , first in a riding habit with a tail yards long and afterwards in yellow satin with scarce a tail at all . " Fanny Wallack 's last appearance in America was in June 1852 and London Assurance was n't produced at Wallack 's until 1854 with Rosa Bennett as Lady Gay . Henry may have been thinking of Miss Bennett as the lady with the long  --  and later abbreviated  --  train . Dickens , next to Shakespeare , probably was the author who figured most frequently in Henry James 's boyhood playgoing , although it is a question whether he figured more for him on the stage than in the book . The familiar characters were emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the stage by play tinkers seeking to give bodily form to the Micawbers and Scrooges , Pickwicks and Copperfields , Oliver Twists and Paul Dombeys , whose very names assured a full house . To Burton , Henry James was indebted for the Captain Cuttle of Dombey and Son , and he recalled him as a " monstrous Micawber ... with the entire baldness of a huge easter egg and collar-points like the sails of Mediterranean feluccas . " He must have seen him in that role , if not in 1850 when Burton gave David Copperfield at his theatre , then in the revivals of 1853 and 1855 . At Burton 's too he saw Nicholas Nickleby with Lizzie Weston as Smike " all tearful melodrama . " In face of his recollection of these productions , the aged Henry mused , " who shall deny the immense authority of the theatre , or that the stage is the mightiest of modern engines ? Such at least was to be the force of the Dickens imprint , however applied , in the soft clay of our generation ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . " He saw one important drama that was to remain a landmark in the American theatre for successive generations . The Barnum version of Uncle Tom 's Cabin , in which he had admired Emily Mestayer , was the third to reach the New York stage . Henry did not see the first , which had an abbreviated run at the National in 1852 , and which the New York Herald reviewed indignantly with the question : " What will our southern friends think of all our professions of respect for their delicate social institution of slavery ? " This production , without St. Clare , with no little Eva and no Topsy , and with a spurious happy ending , went to its deserved closing after two weeks . Eleven months later a full version by George L. Aiken , in six long acts , was brought out at the same theatre , eight tableaux and thirty scenes , embracing the whole of Mrs. Stowe 's novel . It ran for three hundred performances ( colored folk were allowed in the parquet for twenty-five cents through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third version by H. J. Conway , with a happy ending . Undisturbed by competition , confident in his audiences , and particularly in the patronage of the small boys at the matinees , he mounted it in November 1853 and here Henry saw it for the first time . In due course he saw the full-length production too , an evening particularly remembered , because it happened to be the occasion of his first theatre party and because he could be a critic : he could compare the two versions . He was certain the second Eliza was less dramatic than Miss Mestayer ; but the ice floes at the National did seem more genuine than the more obvious carpentry at Barnum 's . And Henry James , writing of this evening when he was seventy , hints that it was all the richer for him in that its humor and pathos were collectively shared . He was absorbed as much by the junior audience as by the play . The little sophisticates had gone to Uncle Tom with some detachment , but found themselves swept along by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as aesthetic adventure . On June 27 , 1855 Henry Senior sailed for Europe with his wife and children to give the young ones " a better sensuous education than they were likely to get here . ... " ( Years later Henry , seeking to justify his long expatriation , carefully misquoted this remark , contained in a letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson , making it read " ... such a sensuous education as they ca n't get here . " ) The initiation of the James boys into the European theatre was somewhat slower and less extensive than might have been expected of such devoted young playgoers . Europe provided , Henry recalled , a drama richer than anything that could be found in the theatre , " life in general , all round us , was perceptibly more theatrical . " There were other factors ; the simple one of distance , for example . In New York the theatres had been within easy reach of Union Square . In London the distances to be traversed to the playhouses from St. John 's Wood made theatregoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two throbbing and heaving cabs " travelling across vast , foggy tracts of the town and then depositing the playgoers , after many twists and turns , before the ancient theatres whose interiors seemed as labyrinthine as the trip to the West End . In Paris there was an additional limiting factor that had nothing to do with distance or the French language , which the boys had studied from an early age . The plays in the French capital were , as James put it , " out of relation to our time of life ... our cultivated innocence . " The plays in Manhattan had been directly addressed to such innocence in the adult audience and so were suited to children as well . This was , to a considerable degree , true also of London . The theatres of London offered in effect the same type of entertainment as those of New York  --  lurid melodrama and sprawling farce , sentimental drama and ranting eloquence , translations and bowdlerizations from the French . The acting was sometimes more finished ; the diction may have been purer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterparts of those seen in their native city . London offered the excitement of the Christmas pantomime ; it offered also Charles Mathews , Frederick Robson , Alfred Wigan and Charles Kean and the small boy saw them all . We have Henry 's word for it that the " momentous " event in their London playgoing was Kean 's production of Henry VIII . ( It may have been momentous since it was the play William had been taken to see while he " languished " at home . ) Kean played Wolsey , but the children were less conscious of the acting than of the elaborate spectacle , and notably Queen Katharine 's dream-vision of beckoning and consoling angels which for weeks afterwards they tried to depict in water colors . " The spectacle had seemed to us prodigious  --  as it was doubtless at its time the last word of costly scenic science . " ( He was to see Kean again ten years later in Boston as Macbeth " without a rag of scenic reinforcement " and was struck by the fact that " no actor so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairing it by a kind of cold rage of endeavor . " ) Henry saw the stunted Robson , heard his hoarse voice , his grotesque delivery ; Robson snarled and leered , he used to grind his teeth and roll his eyes , but he created vivid comedy and painful intensity . At the Olympic he saw Tom Taylor 's Still Waters Run Deep with Wigan as John Mildmay ; he saw Mathews in The Critic and a comedy " botched " from the French , Married for Money . He remembered the nights at the Olympic in Wych Street , approached through the squalid slums  --  an " incredibly brutal and barbarous " avenue to an evening of theatrical joy . They lingered a while in Paris . Here the staunch little playgoers were reduced to the level of circuses  --  the perpetual Cirque d ' t and the Cirque d'Hiver as well as the Thtre du Cirque ; nevertheless they relished the profusion of clowns and acrobats and the elaborate ballet-pantomime . Only two French plays remained with the old Henry as having been seen at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fargueil lingered in his memory . It seemed to him , in retrospect , that his boyhood stay in Paris was one of missed opportunities . It was the golden age of French acting  --  Rachel was dying , but her name was on everyone 's lips . He did not see her ; neither did he see Djazet , Mlingue , Samson ; the memory of Mademoiselle Mars lingered ; Mademoiselle Georges " a massive , a monstrous antique " had returned for a season . He missed her , as he missed the others . He has recorded one missed opportunity in particular . " There emerges in my memory from the night of time the image of a small boy walking in the Palais-Royal with innocent American girls who were his cousins and wistfully hearing them relate how many times ... they had seen Madame Doche in La Dame aux Camlias and what floods of tears she had made them weep . " Charlotte Doche created the role of the unhappy Marguerite in 1852 and played it five hundred times ; and for Henry James the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the role his cousins gave the pocket handkerchief in the theatre , the manner in which his ears responded to the strange beauty of the title , the complete unawareness of the little girls , and Henry himself , of the social position of the lady of the expensive flowers . The time was to come , however , when he would make amends for these missed opportunities and when , from the experience of countless evenings in the theatres of five countries , he would evolve his theories of acting and the drama which exercised so significant an influence upon him when he came to write his own plays . PICTURE AND SCENE The small boy , an inveterate theatregoer , inevitably developed stage ambitions : he would be an actor ; more important still , he would be a dramatist . His early experiences in stage production were confined , he recalled , to watching his older brother take charge of attic theatricals in which Albany cousins and playmates of the Fourteenth Street neighborhood participated . There was much more preparation than performance , " so much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thick of it all " throwing off into space conceptions that I could stare at across the interval but could n't appropriate . " William was producer , playwright and director rolled into one , while the passive Henry stood in the " wings " bereft of garments , waiting for a costume , " unclad and impatient both as to our persons and to our aims , waiting alike for ideas and breeches . ... " There has survived , out of this time , a letter in its original rectangular envelope , postmarked Paris , but without legible date , addressed to " Master E. Van Winkle , 14 st . N. York " which attests to Henry 's continued interest in neighborhood theatricals after the James family had taken up residence abroad . We can imagine the small boy , by then twelve or thirteen , sitting down in one of the hotels of the rue de la Paix , in those early days of the Second Empire , to address this missive to far-away New York . The recipient was Edgar Van Winkle , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry had a deep respect ( " Edgar walked in a maze of culture , " Henry wrote decades later ) . It is the earliest letter of Henry James 's to have survived . " Dear Eddy , " it runs , with a brevity the novelist was seldom to achieve in his later correspondence , " As I heard you were going to try to turn the club into a Theatre . And as I was asked w'ether I wanted to belong here is my answer . I would like very much to belong . Yours Truly H James . " His experiments in boyhood " play-writing " were closely related to his brother 's activities . William James , at an early age , revealed a talent for drawing and devoted his young manhood to the study of art . Henry , in emulation , also drew , and he evokes for us a picture of his older brother in New York , sitting in the evening under the lamplight sketching , with himself a few feet away plying the pencil , or rather the pen , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was so often engaged at that period ... in literary  --  or to be more precise in dramatic , accompanied by pictorial composition ... how could I have doubted ... with our large theatrical experience , of the nature , and of my understanding of the dramatic form ? " Is he trying not only to imitate William , in brotherly rivalry , but to surpass him ? William , he explained , " drew because he could , while I did so in the main only because he did . " At any rate he had evolved a ritual for these illustrated dramas : quarto sheets were purchased in a shop on Sixth Avenue , three sheets ruled , the fourth unruled . The drama filled the ruled pages . The blank page provided the space for the illustration . " I thought , I lisped , at any rate I composed in scenes , " he tells us in describing what he set down on his quarto sheets . Every scene had its explanatory picture and he strained toward the picture " which had ... something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and must have helped me to believe in the validity of my subject . " Picture and Scene . The words were to figure again and again in his critical writings . They became part of the special lexicon of critical terms he created to define the arts of fiction and of the drama as he practised them . We are confronted in this instance , as in others , with the question : how much of his later art , his finished practice , did he read back into his childhood ? The later novelist boasted that to the laying of a scene and the launching of a drama he had always been faithful ; and it would be entirely understandable that in the circumstances he would think of himself as having lisped and composed scenes at an early age . We do know that during adolescence Henry was " an immense writer of novels and dramas , " for his father so described Him in a letter from Boulogne in which he spoke of his second son as not as fond of study " properly so-called , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries . " He added , in this letter , written to Henry 's grandmother , " He has considerable talent as a writer , but I am at a loss to know whether he will ever accomplish much . " The " plays " written during this period by the fourteen-year-old Henry perished long ago . However , a family anecdote throws light on their nature . Henry had drawn a picture of a mother and child clinging to a rock in the midst of a stormy ocean and had written underneath it : " The thunder roared and the lightning followed . " William James pounced upon the illustration . It is not in the nature of older brothers to correct the mistakes of their juniors with tact and indulgence . That Henry should put thunder before lightning was a meteorological blunder that invited high derision from the scientifically-minded William . He tormented the sensitive young writer with such acerbity that Henry promptly enacted part of his story . He ran for maternal protection and invoked  --  and received  --  it for his quarto-sheet manuscript . Out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other , he used to illustrate his sense of the Scene as well as of the Picture . His father had taken him in the summer of 1854  --  when he was eleven-on one of their rare visits to an uncle 's home , Linwood , at Rhinebeck on the Hudson . It was a broad , roomy estate . He remembered roses , grapes , peaches , currant clusters , the hum of insects , a wide view of the river with " great bright harmonies of air and space . " One evening the eleven-year-old boy wandered to the eminence overlooking the Hudson accompanied by his little cousin , Marie . She was of his age , small , brown , with shining black eyes , and , he had been told , " spoiled . " That made her especially interesting , since the James boys had never been " spoiled . " It gave her a romantic status to young Henry who only half understood the meaning of the term . His uncle , Augustus James , who was sitting near by , remarked with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have fallen with some weight ; by implication it was probably Henry 's bedtime too . What he retained , however , as he wrote of the incident half a century later , was Marie 's objection , a somewhat emphatic rejoinder from Uncle Augustus , and Marie rushing into her mother 's arms " as if to a court of appeal . " From the aunt came these simple words that appear to have fallen with a sharp ring in the ears of the small boy : " Come now , my dear ; do n't make a scene  --  I insist on your not making a scene ! " " That was all the witchcraft the occasion used , " wrote Henry , " but the note was none the less epoch-making . The expression , so vivid , so portentous , was one I had never heard  --  it had never been addressed to us at home ; and who should say now what a world one might n't at once read into it ? It seemed freighted to sail so far ; it told me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' scenes ' ; but the great thing , the immense illumination , was that we could make them or not as we chose . " It matters little the extent to which Henry James read back into his reminiscent pages the subtle implications of the incident in the light of his devotion to Picture and Scene . What is Important is that he brought the incident out of the distant days of his childhood , and told it with a vividness that revealed it to have been a significant event in the development of his artist 's consciousness . He had , in all his fiction seen himself as both a painter and as a dramatist . In the very first novel he reviewed , when he was twenty-two , he had written that " there is no essential difference between the painting of a picture and the writing of a novel , " and in the same breath he had held up Balzac as a writer who " lays his stage , sets his scene . ... " Who can say how many doors of his mind little Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linwood ? It suffices that Henry James himself considered it a landmark in the history of his imagination . SCHOOL OF THE DRAMATIST The father had sought a better " sensuous " education than he believed his sons could find in America . During their early European travels  --  between Henry 's twelfth and seventeenth years including a trip to America and a speedy return to Europe  --  the small boy was exposed to the rich panorama of the Old World : the London of Dickens and Thackeray , the Paris of the restored monarchy , the pensions and hotels of Switzerland , the provincial seaside life of Boulogne , and a brief glimpse of the stolid Germanic life of Bonn . The future novelist-dramatist was educated neither for the novel nor the drama ; but he absorbed the materials for both in his reading of current literature , his nights at the play , his visits to art galleries , and his constant inspection of European architecture and landscape . The young Henry James who came back in 1859 to rediscover America from the placid perspective of Newport in Rhode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharpened vision of life and art , an international sense , an acute appreciation of Anglo-American culture and a good-humored understanding of the American abroad . He had become a cosmopolitan even before he had had an opportunity to be a provincial . If this background contributed first and foremost to the creation of a great psychological novelist , it contained also those elements which contributed to his prolonged flirtation with the stage and the writing of his plays . We can disengage them as we follow his development , finding , as he begins his career as a writer , that he turns first to fiction , but never without sidelong  --  and loving  --  glances at the drama . In A Small Boy he injects the " note " of theatre recurrently : the memory of receiving Lamb 's Tales from Shakespeare from a long-legged Scotsman who was his tutor in London and who later tutored Robert Louis Stevenson ; schooldays at Boulogne with the pastry-cook 's son , B. C. Coquelin , whom he was later to admire on the stage of the Thtre Franais ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva , taught him Racine , describing Rachel 's playing of Phdre  --  her entrance " borne down , in her languorous passion , by the weight of her royal robes  --  Que ces vains ornemens , que ces voiles me psent !  --  the long lapse of time before she spoke " ; the memory of a night at the play in Bonn with his father ( who in a letter has left us a record of his impression of Adelaide Ristori 's portrayal on this occasion of Maria Stuart " ... the vulture counterfeiting Jenny Wren . Every little while the hoarse , exulting voice , the sanguinary beak , the lurid bloated eye of menace , and the relentless talons , looked forth from the feathery mass and sickened you with disgust " ) . And the recollection of Frau Stromberg at Bonn , at whose home William stayed , and who combined the art of making pfankuechen with dramaturgy , reading her five-act tragedy of Cleopatra to William and her other pensioners . He remembered the neat little volume and the fine print of the text which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , in his story Eugene Pickering , Henry attributed to his Germanic Madame Blumenthal the authorship of an Historisches Trauerspiel in fine print named Cleopatra in five acts . ) Elsewhere he has recorded a never-forgotten image of Fanny Kemble ( first glimpsed near New York when he was a little boy and she a celebrity riding on horseback ) giving her readings from Shakespeare in assembly rooms in St. John 's Wood , the great human thunder roll of the Kemble voice in Lear , Howl , howl , howl , howl . He remembered how she carried herself , the black velvet she wore on this occasion , the white satin in which she attired herself for a reading of A Midsummer Night 's Dream and her " formidable splendor . " The time was to come when Henry James would escort this formidable creature to the theatre and spend Christmas with her at Stratford-on-Avon . He was seventeen and at Newport , walking along the moss-clad shore and over sand-starved grass to the Paradise Rocks , talking endlessly to John LaFarge and Thomas Sergeant Perry , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ des Deux Mondes , translating Alfred de Musset 's Lorenzaccio into which , Perry has told us , " he introduced some scenes of his own . " Henry James was to write tenderly of the Newport days and particularly of the hours spent with the young LaFarge , who encouraged him in his literary undertakings and introduced him to the poetry of Browning as well as the French writers . It was essentially a period of initiation and discovery , of intensive reading , quiet cogitation and observation , tranquil literary labor . The young man who turned up at the Harvard Law School at nineteen , during the second year of the Civil War , felt himself somewhat outside the society in which he lived . He was about as much interested in law as he had been in scientific studies attempted earlier at Geneva . William James had preceded him to Harvard and Henry , as in the past , gravitated in the same direction . The picture of the Harvard months , sketched in Notes of a Son and Brother , shows us a young man very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions of trying for a legal " career , " but he moved to one of his own choosing . Of an evening he would journey into Boston by horse-car to see a play at the Howard Athenaeum . He found that the " half-buried Puritan curse " still lingered . Boston audiences had more guilt feelings about the theatre as a frivolous institution than New York audiences ; he felt in the Bostonian attitude " that intimation more than anything else of the underhand snicker . ... " He tells us that he went to the theatre as often as possible despite the " implication of the provincial in the theatric air and of the rustic in the provincial . " At seventy he pictured his student self  --  always with a touch of benign irony  --  as a critical and quite elevated young theatregoer , but he was little more sophisticated about the plays while an undergraduate than when the small boy was frequenting Barnum 's . He went to see Kate Bateman ( who thirty years later was to appear in one of his own plays ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell in Fanchon the Cricket , translated from a German play by Augustus Wauldaur which in turn was derived from George Sand 's La Petite Fadette . Miss Mitchell had played the one part up and down the United States ( " she twanged that one string and none other , every night of her theatric life " ) . Yet there was nothing stale about the charm she exercised upon her youthful admirer . Henry returned entranced to his rooms in Winthrop Square and wrote her a letter " from which the admired Miss Maggie should gather the full force of my impression . " This she seems to have done , for she reciprocated by autographing for him a printed " acting edition " of the play . The old man amusedly fancied his Harvard self as a dashing young Pendennis with Miss Mitchell as his Miss Fotheringay . He recalled in particular , however , that the impression of the play and Miss Mitchell 's acting prompted him to write an appreciation of the production and of the actress . " I first sat down beside my view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of the fondly hoping and fearfully doubting who count the days after the despatch of manuscripts . " He adds coyly that " nothing would induce me now to name the periodical on whose protracted silence I had thus begun to hang . ... " So far as we can determine James 's dramatic criticism never saw the light of print . But it is significant that the first bit of original writing he sent to a publication should have been devoted to a play and to an actress . We have these anecdotes and incidents , the scattered clues to his reading , theatregoing , gallery-visiting , and yet little to explain the extraordinary maturity , sureness , poise , of his writing from the moment that he blossomed out at twenty-one in the pages of the North American Review and a few months later in the Atlantic Monthly , the newly-founded Nation and the Galaxy . Youthful the writing is , in its desire to be clever , to score points , to toss off neat epigrams , and in its dogmatism ; yet as regards the fundamentals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual terminology , a theory of fiction , of art , of drama that is vigorous and often original . One wonders where the school of the novelist and of the dramatist had been . How could so desultory an education have produced so balanced and coherent a practitioner of the art of writing ? Henry James was to develop during the next half century a much more complex aesthetic ; he was to develop a style , a manner , an elaborate doctrine relating to fiction and the scenic art : yet from the first he knew what he wanted to do , and how to go about doing it . So much savoir-faire in one so young could only be explained in the facts that James himself adduced in his autobiographies : his was the history and growth of an imagination , a curious , observing , retaining and disciplined mind , stimulated and sharpened in the family circle , and flourishing in spite of repeated attempts to regiment it within the framework of " education . " The anonymous reviewer in the Nation who accorded an extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 24 , 1875 , when the novelist was thirty-two , had a valid , if elaborate , explanation : " He has seen more cities and manners of man than was possible in the slower days of Ulysses , and if with less gain of worldly wisdom , yet with an enlargement of his artistic apprehensiveness and scope that is of far greater value to him . " His artistic apprehensiveness  --  there perhaps is our answer . And as regards the drama the apprehensiveness had only to play over the world of the theatre to make it one of the most important schools he ever attended . During the first ten years of his creative life , James established himself as a literary critic , a writer of travel pieces , a master of the short story and , at the end of the decade , as a novelist . From 1865 , when his critical articles began to appear in ever-increasing numbers , to the end of 1875 , the year in which he took up permanent residence abroad , he wrote 26 short stories , 132 book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art criticism , seven articles on the drama , three dramatic sketches or comediettas and two novels in serial form . Much of the material for this work was the fruit of his absorption of American life in Boston and New York ; most of it stemmed from two trips abroad during 1869-70 and 1872-74 ; all of it went back to roots buried deeply during the years of his " sensuous " education . If at the end of this crowded decade of travel , discovery , creation , Henry James Figure : 339KB emerged as a full-fledged novelist , he emerged also with a full-fledged theory of the drama . It might be observed that he developed as well his critical notation of painting and that painters and paintings loomed much larger in the work of these years than did the theatre . These were the years of his discovery of Italy and the glories of its art ; his enthusiasm for art and architecture overflowed into his travel sketches and from these into his stories . He had always been fascinated by painting , and the painter attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drama was something deeper . Play-writing was a craft allied to fiction . Henry James never tried to paint pictures , once he discarded the drawing pencil and brush at Newport . But he did write plays . The dramatist was there behind the novelist : both might look upon art with an appraising and critical eye  --  but each had a separate creative task to perform . Dramatic interest . He held this essential to good novel-writing . Give me " dramatic compactness " he lectured George Eliot , in his review of Felix Holt , criticizing her for creating " intense " characters without showing them in action . Miss Alcott 's Moods , to take a novelist writing on a completely different level , provoked him to suggest that she was insufficiently acquainted with people " to handle great dramatic passions . " As a consequence , he observed , discussing the novel as if it were a drama , " her play is not a real play , nor her actors real actors . " Reviewing Miss Braddon 's Aurora Floyd he speaks of play-writing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had already tried his hand at it and found the going difficult . Reviewing Swinburne 's poetic drama Chastelard in the Nation ( January 18 , 1866 ) when he was twenty-three he remarks with the assurance of his years " it is comparatively easy to write energetic poetry , but ... it is very difficult to write a good play . " He tells Swinburne : " You have to have more than a pretty idea to carry a play . " He tells him again : " A dramatic work without design is a monstrosity . " He offers him advice ; " Chastelard descants in twenty different passages of very florid and eloquent verse upon the intoxicating beauties of his mistress ; but meanwhile the play stands still ... let him talk as much as he pleases , and let him deal out poetry by the handful , the more the better . But meanwhile let not the play languish , let not the story halt . " He had , thus , a decidedly " fixed " view of what drama , action , scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the ten years that followed his first appearance in print he was to develop a firm and consistent  --  and quite dogmatic  --  conception of what acting and production should be in the theatre itself . The young writer who left Cambridge in 1869 at twenty-six on his first adult journey abroad was to spend many nights in the playhouses of Europe . In strange cities , with long evenings before him , he gravitated toward the theatre arguing that there he would find a reflection of the civilization he was visiting , that a country 's culture could be studied at first hand in the plays it mounts and in the audiences that come to see them . He watched the audiences ; he strolled through foyers listening to their remarks ; and he sat before the plays an enthralled and studious spectator . Henry James paid his first visits to the Thtre Franais and the theatres of the Paris boulevards during 1870 , regretting that he could not tarry longer , asserting emphatically in due course that the French national theatre constituted a school of taste " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1872-73 we can follow him from France into Italy . He pauses for a week at Perugia and goes to the theatre nightly , paying twenty-two soldi for an orchestra seat , seeing such plays as Amore Senza Stima , Severit e Debolezza , La Societa Equivoca , feeling that his study of the audiences brings him close to the people of the Italian town . We catch him in Rome at the Teatro Valle listening to Goldoni 's I Quattro Rustighi done in the Venetian dialect which he can only half follow : the acting not as fine as the French , but " in some of the women  --  ugly , with red hands and shabby dresses  --  an extraordinary gift of natural utterance , of seeming to invent joyously as they go . " And we find him that same month in a box at the Apollo , in Rome , surveying Italian princesses in neighboring boxes and watching a violent Othello played by Ernesto Rossi . Othello seized Iago , whacked his head " half a dozen times on the floor " and then flung him " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young American , but " in the doing of it , and in the evident relish for it in the house there was I scarce know what force of easy and thereby rather cheap expression . " Early in 1875 , while Henry James 's first long novel was appearing in the Atlantic Monthly , he went to New York for a few months and served as a casual critic for the Nation , reviewing art shows and plays . He saw Ristori and Rignold , The Two Orphans and a play entitled Women of the Day which he described as an " unqualifiable mess of vulgarity ... ghastly , monstrous , a positive nightmare . ... " He had little good to say of the New York season , and before the year was out he had decided to take up permanent residence in Europe . Before sailing he gave fullest expression to his theory of the drama , not in any formalized manner , but in a long review , of Tennyson 's Queen Mary written for the Galaxy , and published in September 1875 . He was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast them in his dramatic criticism , but he was never to formulate them with greater compactness . " The dramatic form , " he wrote in the review , " seems to me of all literary forms the noblest , " and he added promptly this personal note : " I have so extreme a relish for it that I am half afraid to trust myself to praise it , lest I should seem to be merely rhapsodizing . But to be really noble it must be quite itself . ... " And he goes on : The fine thing in a real drama , generally speaking , is that , more than any other work of literary art , it needs a masterly structure . It needs to be shaped and fashioned and laid together , and this process makes a demand upon an artist 's rarest gifts . He must combine and arrange , interpolate and eliminate , play the joiner with the most attentive skill ; and yet at the end effectually bury his tools and his sawdust , and invest his elaborate skeleton with the smoothest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or humorous , poetic or prosaic  --  is like a box of fixed dimensions and inelastic material , into which a mass of precious things are to be packed away . It is a problem in ingenuity and a problem of the most interesting kind . The precious things in question seem out of all proportion to the compass of the receptacle ; but the artist has an assurance that with , patience and skill a place may be made for each , and that nothing need be clipped or crumpled , squeezed or damaged . The false dramatist either knocks out the sides of his box , or plays the deuce with the contents ; the real one gets down on his knees , disposes of his goods tentatively , this , that , and the other way , loses his temper but keeps his ideal , and at last rises in triumph , having packed his coffer in the one way that is mathematically right . It closes perfectly , and the lock turns with a click ; between one object and another you can not insert the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , rigid laws , is always a strong man 's highest ideal of success . ... In a play , certainly , the subject is of more importance than in any other work of art . Infelicity , triviality , vagueness of subject , may be outweighed in a poem , a novel , or a picture , by charm of manner , by ingenuity of execution ; but in a drama the subject is of the essence of the work  --  it is the work . If it is feeble , the work can have no force ; if it is shapeless , the work must be amorphous . An important subject , moulded by " a few grave , rigid laws "  --  this , then , was Henry James 's recipe for a good play , and few persons can quarrel with such a formulation . He is asking for the classical perfection of form and content and a goodly measure of each , harmoniously wedded . What stands out , however , is this concept of the " grave and rigid " laws . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenic fluidity of our theatre and the influence of the cinema , to accept so chaste a definition . For James , in his time , confronted with the anarchy of the Anglo-American stage and the neatness and precision of the French  --  and given his fastidious personality and his delight in a disciplined and ordered art  --  there could be no choice . He accepted the " laws " of the theatre of which Francisque Sarcey in Paris was the principal critical exponent : a play had to be " well-made " and its technical structure was all-important . He upheld the French classical theory of the drama , but applied it to the melodramatic , manipulated dramas of Scribe and Sardou . When Henry James , making his start as a playwright , exclaimed , " A moi , Scribe , moi , Sardou , moi , Dennery ! " he was invoking the dramatists who were the special gods of Francisque Sarcey . A brilliant and documented critic , Sarcey nevertheless had one set of laws for all times and all dramatists ; he was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the " inimitable and incorruptible . " James saw him as one who believed in the theatre as if it were a religion and loved it with an abiding passion . For Sarcey all France revolved around its stage . Its actors and playwrights were a cultural force , practitioners of an art  --  no , more , of an exact science . From Sarcey 's writings James derived much of his knowledge of the French stage of the time and of its immediate past , and a great deal of theory to match his own observations of the Maison de Molire in the rue de Richelieu , hard by the Louvre . In fiction Henry James made his own laws ; on the stage he bowed to a whole series of laws other playwrights ignored  --  a minuteness of exposition , a constant fear that the audience would not understand him and therefore the need to explain every detail , an elaborate to-do attending entrances and exits , the traditional fuss of the ficelle play . He bowed to them , accepted them as an inevitable " straitjacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while  --  he attempted to write plays . The thirty-odd pieces of dramatic criticism written by James over a quarter of a century or more , collected by Allan Wade in the volume entitled The Scenic Art , constitute a plea for substance as well as form in the theatre , and , under the influence of Sarcey , place very considerable emphasis on the form . Their merit , as Mr. Wade has observed , over and above the value of their balanced judgments and the charm of the writing , is in their plea for standards of creation and criticism in the theatre . Henry James 's own plays were conceived with a general observance of the theatrical doctrines he propounded and a general conformity to standards accepted from the French . Unfortunately the rigid laws of the drama , as he formulated them or derived them , pinned him down . James once complained to Logan Pearsall Smith that he never sat down to write a play without feeling that a thousand devils were besetting him from all sides . His plays became the prisoners of his theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in The Princess Casamassima , took Millicent Henning to a London theatre to see a play called The Pearl of Paraguay , " his imagination projected itself lovingly across the footlights , gilded and colored the shabby canvas and battered accessories , losing itself so effectually in the fictive world that the end of the piece , however long or however short , brought with it something of the alarm of a stoppage of his personal life . It was impossible to be more friendly to the dramatic illusion . " In attributing what he also called the " dear old playhouse spell " to his hero , Henry James endowed him with his own deeply subjective attitude toward the stage . For James , to whom fantasy was a form of reality , could not but identify himself with the stage 's " fictive world , " and the end of a play for him would indeed be the stoppage of his personal life . Henry James has told us how in going to the Thtre Franais he found " an ideal and exemplary world " on its boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the felicities that the world we live in misses . " What were these felicities and what was this world ? Henry James describes it : it is smooth , harmonious , artistic . Great attention is paid to detail . The people do the things " that we should like to do ; they are gifted as we should like to be ; they have mastered the accomplishments that we have had to give up . " The women are not all beautiful but they are graceful , agreeable , sympathetic , " ladylike , " perfectly dressed , possessed of the best manners , charming , with musical voices . They speak with " irreproachable purity and sweetness . " They walk with elegant grace . In short , they are the idealized heroines of James 's fiction , the Milly Theales , Isabel Archers , Mme. de Cintrs and Maggie Ververs . And the men ? They were not handsome either ( except Mounet-Sully who was an " Adonis of the first magnitude " ) but they looked whatever part they played ; they were as well-mannered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , and they produce the illusion . " Emotion and passion were controlled , partitioned , into scenes and acts , attaining appropriate well-timed climaxes . For the " observer " Henry James , the " individual so capable as I am of the uncanniest self-effacement in the active exercise of the passion of observation " as he described himself , here was a way to look at life recreated and acted while maintaining a state of sublime passivity . Henry James could sit quietly and drink it in , as his official observers and commentators did in his fiction . This was perfection indeed : an ordered world played out on a large and beautiful stage and with an art as consummate as that which he lavished on his own work . The Thtre Franais was steeped in the past ; it had traditions and standards , rituals and observances . No dinner could be too hastily swallowed in order to get to the seven o'clock raising of the great curtain , to see such actresses as Madame Nathalie in Feuillet 's Le Village ; no uncomfortable stall could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croizette , Brohan and Bressant , Regnier and Got , Mounet-Sully and Coquelin ; no " pestilential " atmosphere  --  meaning quite simply the theatre 's poor ventilation  --  could spoil the magic sense that in the air of the building , in the dim reaches of the great dome , there slept the echoes of Rachel 's voice , the sense that these footlights had illuminated the tragedienne 's finest moments . Herr Toeppfer had described it all during the novelist 's student days at Geneva ; now Henry James could discover it for himself . He saw his first performance in the rue de Richelieu on the eve of the Franco-Prussian war  --  Augier 's Lions et Renards with Coquelin or L'Aventurire , we can not be sure which of the two it was . He was in the capital again two years later in the wake of the Commune , visiting the barricades , sensing still the smell of blood and gunpowder in the air , going " every night  --  or almost " to the Thtre Franais . On Sunday evenings he would dine with James Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faubourg St. Germain near the Chamber of Deputies and he wrote later , " I never cross the Seine amid the wet flare of the myriad lamps , never note the varnished rush of the river or the way the Louvre grows superb in the darkness without a recurrent consciousness of the old sociable errand , the sense of dipping into a still denser Paris with the Temps and M. Sarcey in my pocket . " Lowell and Sarcey were James 's mentors during this Parisian stay in which the Thtre Franais assumed an importance in his mind never to be erased . There were two nights which stood out in memory , both of a later date , the autumn of 1877 . On one of these he saw Dumas the Younger 's Le Demi-Monde which inspired his The Siege of London ; on the other he saw a play by Charles Lomon , Jean Dacier , with Coquelin . In both cases he later described how he left the theatre " agitated " with what he had seen , pacing the streets far into the night , wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell exercised by the players . He quarreled with the plot of Le Demi-Monde , he thought Jean Dacier weak as a play , but he was nevertheless stimulated and inspired by the art with which they had been done . " Far away and unspeakably regretted the days , alas , or , more exactly the nights , on which one could walk away from the Franais under the spell of such fond convictions and such deep and agitating problems , " he wrote thirty years after that Paris autumn . To Benot Constant Coquelin Henry James 's most vivid impressions of the French stage attached themselves : " the rich , the rare , the admirable and inimitable " Coquelin , the " most joyous and exuberant of pure comedians . " They had been to school together as boys at the Collge Communal in Boulogne , and to these memories of childhood was now added the excitement of seeing the mature and accomplished artist . He remembered how , on leaving the theatre after Jean Dacier , " I walked about a long time under the influence not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , which had made the thing so human , so brilliant , so valuable . I was agitated with what it said to me that I might do  --  what I ought to attempt .  --  This was nothing compared to " the state I was thrown into by meeting Coquelin . " He met him at Andrew Lang 's in 1879 when the Comdie Franaise came to London . Henry wrote that " it stirred me to the depths . ... It excited me powerfully , " the way in which Coquelin 's personality overflowed into his talk . " All day , and for days afterward , I remained under the impression . " In his journal he referred to the two Coquelin episodes ( one of which he embodied later in a long essay on Coquelin published in 1887 and revised just before his death ) as " landmarks " in the history of his theatrical ambitions . These constituted the final steps in Henry James 's education for the theatre . He had assimilated French dramatic theory and he found himself on terms of growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch , and later wrote to him encouragingly from Paris urging him on in his dramatic ambitions . When are you being acted ? Coquelin queried , and he added that James had only to give him a signal and he would come to see him played . James devoted nine essays and reviews to the French stage . His best-known is the urbane essay he contributed to the Galaxy ( and included in French Poets and Novelists ) which summed up his impressions of the Thtre Franais . Shortly after settling in London , in 1877 , he did the same for the London theatres . He found British audiences less Bohemian , less blas , more naf , " well dressed , tranquil , motionless " suggesting domestic virtue and comfortable homes . The British audience looked to him as if it had come to the play in its own carriage , after a dinner of beef and pudding . The ladies " are mild , fresh-colored English mothers . ... There are many rosy young girls , with dull eyes and quiet cheeks  --  an element wholly absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ... Altogether they are much more the sort of people to spend a quiet evening with than the clever , cynical , democratic multitude that surges nightly out of the brilliant Boulevards into those temples in which MM . Dumas fils and Sardou are the high priests . But , " added James , " you might spend your evening with them better almost anywhere than at the theatre . " He was to live the rest of his life among the people he thus described and he was to attempt to write plays for them . " The art of writing a play has apparently become a lost one with the English race , " he wrote , and set about planning to revive this art . " There can be no serious school of acting unless there is a dramatic literature to feed it , " and he believed himself capable of creating such a literature . He was unsparing in his criticism of British plays and British acting . For him the French theatre remained the one theatre worthy of emulation . " The French esteem the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote attacking the British theatre for its meagreness , its scenic excesses , its " barbarism . " One of these liberties was the way in which it adapted plays from the French : " An English arrangement of a French piece is a pretty woman with her back turned . " The nights in the rue de Richelieu colored his view of the London stage and they were the " light by which one must work " for the theatre . To his journal , in 1881 , the novelist confided : " The French stage I have mastered ; I say that without hesitation . I have it in my pocket . ... I have laid up treasures of wisdom . ... " To William James he had written four years earlier : " My inspection of the French theatre will fructify . I have thoroughly mastered Dumas , Augier and Sardou ... and I know all they know and a great deal more besides . " He is writing here in a light and consciously boastful vein , but with an awareness of the resources he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted that he had the French theatre " in my pocket " ? He had studied it with all the earnestness and solemnity of a college student , methodically reading texts and going to see them acted . He had read the critics . He had , moreover , watched the actors . If he wrote of the plays as a literary critic , and complained that French playwrights contrived only endless variations in their well-made plays on the theme of adultery , he wrote of the actors as if he were a professional man of the theatre , a stage director , a producer . In the history of dramatic criticism there are few writers who described scenery and costumes as closely and who dwelt in such detail on the histrionic technique . Like Sarcey , James cultivated the theatrical eye . The manner in which an actor walks is important to him ; he pays close attention to his diction ; he observes that the trivial act of taking a letter from a servant or placing a hat upon a chair can be made suggestive and interesting . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only had advice for the players ; he considered himself qualified to go beyond Prince Hamlet , step upon the stage and coach them  --  which is what he ultimately did . The extent to which he had steeped himself in the practical side of production is revealed to us in his long novel of the stage , The Tragic Muse , which he completed just before beginning his play-writing , seeking to purge himself in it of all his conflicts over the dramatic art . In those portions of the novel which are devoted to the career of Miriam Rooth  --  a fictional English counterpart to Rachel or Sarah Bernhardt  --  he not only echoes the lessons of the rue de Richelieu and his dramatic theory ( as well as his sense that actors , self-absorbed and exhibitionistic , can have their life only on the stage ) , but reveals in the process intimate knowledge of the Thtre Franais backstage as well as front . One of the great scenes in the novel , inspired by a visit James paid to the loge of Julia Bartet when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1889 , describes the green room , the actors behind scenes , the corridors , the portraits , and the personality of a French actress such as Bartet . His feelings about the Thtre Franais are echoed from page to page in the novel . One character ventures to suggest that it is a greater institution than the House of Commons ; Madame Carr , the retired French actress , who might have been drawn out of Fanny Kemble and Pauline Viardot , observes , with the delightful French insularity which James understood , " Je ne connais qu'une scne  --  la ntre , " a view James held to be the truth ; and Gabriel Nash , the character in the novel who speaks for  --  and even resembles physically  --  the novelist himself , says , " The theatre in our country is puerile and barbarous . " When Mrs. Rooth , Miriam 's mother , observes that she would n't want her daughter to play a bad woman , Madame Carr rejoins : " Ah , in England then , and in your theatre , everyone 's immaculately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed ! " And Gabriel Nash-James comes in , a solemn chorus : " We have n't any plays . " Miriam says she wants to play Shakespeare , and Madame Carr wryly observes this is fortunate " as in English you have n't anyone else to play . " Thus the nights in the rue de Richelieu overflowed into his writings . His saturation with the theatre was reflected at many points in his fiction , so that he set great scenes in his novels in theatres . He went playgoing with all his London friends , and thought of himself constantly as a playwright-in-the-making . " To be read 200 years after your death , " he wrote , " is something , but to be acted is better . " And yet the years passed and he did not write plays . APOLOGIES FOR THE THEATRE The years passed but he wrote no plays . His theatrical ship had taken aboard a cargo of experience ; its hold bulged with elaborate , heavily-documented dramatic theory , enough playgoing to crowd a lifetime , the memory of performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the ship did not set sail . At thirty-three he had written to William James : " I know the Thtre Franais by heart . " At thirty-five he wrote to him : " It has long been my most earnest and definite intention to commence at play-writing as soon as I can . ... " And again during the same year : " I am very impatient to get at work writing for the stage  --  a project I have long had . I am ... certain I should succeed and it would be an open gate to money-making . " And now he was approaching forty  --  and still the ship had not set sail . For a man " impatient " to get at play-writing , he was procrastinating to an extraordinary degree . He had written three little closet dramas , chamber plays or comediettas , one when he was twenty-six , and two at twenty-nine , brief experiments in dialogue , but these were not serious efforts , certainly not intended for the theatre . Between his thirtieth and fortieth years he had published three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel articles . He had a fast-moving pen , and a stream of work left his desk wherever he might be  --  in England , France or Italy . Yet something was keeping him back from the drama , and one day the question rose to the surface of his mind and crept out of the tip of the pen into the pages of his journal . It was on December 26 , 1881 . He had returned to America after an absence of six years . He was in Cambridge and he was taking a sheet of paper into his confidence . He had talked with the owners of the new Madison Square Theatre in New York , the brothers Mallory , one a clergyman , and their manager , Daniel Frohman . They had invited him to dramatize his highly-successful short story , Daisy Miller . He wrote in his journal : " After long years of waiting , of obstruction , I find myself able to put into execution the most cherished of all my projects  --  that of beginning to work for the stage . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . None has given me brighter hopes  --  none has given me sweeter emotions . " And then , in a moment of self-questioning , he adds : " It is strange nevertheless that I should never have done anything  --  and to a certain extent it is ominous . I wonder at times that the dream should not have faded away . " It was strange and it was ominous . What follows in his journal is an illuminating passage of self-examination on the one hand and heavy rationalization on the other . He told himself that there were good reasons for his failure to write plays  --  because of the " little work at any time that I could do , " because he had needed " money on the spot " and this his fiction had provided ; because of his " inability to do two things at once , " and the " absence of opportunities , of openings . " He could afford to wait , he told himself , since the drama was the ripest of the arts and " while I was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reminding himself of these " obstacles " to " justify my innumerable postponements . " Yet he had not quite convinced himself . He went on to hammer home these arguments , underscoring words as he wrote : " ... it seems to me simply deplorable that I should not have got at work before . But it was impossible at the time , and I knew my chance would come . ... " This need for self-justification can be understood readily . Not one of the arguments he gave himself was completely valid . He complained of the little work he could do at any time , and indeed he made that complaint often ; yet judged by any standards of literary productivity he had accomplished a lifetime of work when he wrote these words . During eighteen years of writing he had published fifteen volumes  --  fiction , travel , short stories ; his novels included , by this time , Roderick Hudson , The American , The Portrait of a Lady , Washington Square and such diverse tales as The Madonna of the Future and Daisy Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Review , the Galaxy , the Atlantic Monthly ; he had been correspondent of the New York Tribune and the Nation . It was true that he always felt that he could have produced more ; but it was equally true that so active a pen could have written the plays Henry James kept saying he wanted to write . The need for " money on the spot " ? He lived on a modest scale in some rooms in Piccadilly ; he could have maintained them on his income alone , the rents that arrived regularly from Albany and Syracuse properties of the Jameses . His literary earnings only made life more comfortable , provided a broader margin of security . As a matter of fact , when he wrote of his need for money at this particular time , he was receiving substantial pay from two sources for the simultaneous serialization of The Portrait of a Lady in Macmillan 's in England and the Atlantic in the United States  --  not to speak of additional earnings from the occasional pieces he was constantly writing . This does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him throughout his lifetime so that even larger earnings would have seemed to him to be insufficient . " Inability to do two things at once " ? He was doing just that constantly : delivering his monthly instalment of his current novel and at the same time producing short stories and articles . As index of his capacity to juggle a number of literary commitments simultaneously we may cite his work for 1879 , the year of his greatest success which attended publication of his tale , Daisy Miller ; he saw the tale through the press in book form , and published also his study of Hawthorne , a two-volume collection of short stories , carefully revised in their transference from magazine to book ( The Madonna of the Future and Other Tales ) , all this while feeding his serial Confidence to Scribner 's , and writing three short stories , nine articles in the Nation , one for Lippincott 's and one in the North American Review . Nevertheless on this score we must remember that play-writing has more often than not been considered an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writing several stories at once and would still consider the writing of a play at the same time the doing of " two things at once . " " Absence of opportunities " ? In the very journal entry in which he speaks of this , he mentions that John Hare , one of London 's leading actor-managers , had asked him to write a play and " offered me his services in the event of my doing so . " James knew very well that a playwright need not wait for opportunities to market his work any more than a writer of fiction . He submitted his articles and short stories to editors ; he could have submitted his plays just as well to managers . He had , however , been singularly fortunate in his literary opportunities ; Charles Eliot Norton , William Dean Howells and James Russell Lowell had opened doors for him , recognizing at once his extraordinary talents . For one of his passive nature , however , the thought of having to push doors open himself in the theatre would be considered an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave must have kept him from writing the plays he wanted to write : the fear of turning aside from the already familiar outlets he had found for his work ; the hesitation to embark on the practical hazards he felt inherent in the theatre . The contempt he expressed so often for these hazards was alone a symptom of this . Publishers sought out Henry James during those years  --  theatre managers and actors merely evinced an interest in a possibly " useable " script . In his study he could write as he wished , follow the high demands of " art " in accordance with his own standards and principles and the public could take him  --  or leave him . " One must go one 's way and know what one 's about and have a general plan and a private religion  --  in short have made up one 's mind as to ce qui en est with a public the draggling after which simply leads one in the gutter . One has always a ' public ' enough if one has an audible vibration  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He put it thus to his brother on the eve of his dramatic years . To venture into the theatre was to forsake this private religion ; it involved obtaining approval of one 's creations from men with a greater concern for the pocketbook than for " audible vibration "  --  except as the vibration meant box office returns ; of actors interested in the work largely as a vehicle for exhibiting their own talents ; and finally it involved a search for the approval of a heterogeneous public for which one had to dot one 's i 's as with pumpkins  --  an image he used later in describing the simplicity of statement to which he felt the drama reduced him . The reticent , secretive , aloof literary alchemist of Bolton Street and De Vere Gardens , a feted London " lion " moving in the world as a conscious observer and recorder , rebelled at the very things which are the life of the stage . If he could have become a dramatist as he had become a man of letters he would have long before turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of conflict that became increasingly acute with the passage of the years . He was attracted to the theatre and at the same time was repelled by it . He wanted its successes and rewards and yet was afraid to chance its pitfalls . A work of fiction might receive adverse reviews and fall flat in the market and still remain an honorable performance ; it did not involve the public exposure that went with a play . When a magazine rejected a story  --  this was a private matter between editor and writer . But when a play was announced , publicized , promised to the public , and then not produced , or failed in production , the author was , in the process , publicly rejected . This was what Henry James feared more than anything else . He was not alone in his creative problem . A long line of literary men had sought , long before him , to be playwrights , with varying conflicts and varying success . In his own century Byron had faced the drama with a loathing akin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life , carried by the tide of his poetic and public stature ; Meredith had secretly attempted to write a play , but it had never left his desk ; Thomas Hardy dramatized one of his tales , and later wrote The Dynasts without regard for the " laws " of the drama ; George Moore joined his fellow writers of Ireland in their serious flirtation with the stage ; Swinburne had written long poetic dramas which the younger James had tartly reviewed . Henry James 's Continental models , Balzac and Turgenev , had written plays without notable success . There was ample precedent for James among the men of literature , so that he might have faced his own attempts with equanimity . For him , however , the theatre became the focus of anxiety , fear , insecurity , conflicting emotions that caused him to approach it with faltering footsteps . His dramatization of Daisy Miller in 1882 was turned down by the Madison Square Theatre and , promptly discouraged , Henry James returned to the writing of fiction . During the next six years he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bostonians , The Princess Casamassima and The Tragic Muse . He published the play version of Daisy in 1883 and the following year turned down a proposal that he dramatize The Portrait of a Lady , writing to the actor Lawrence Barrett , who suggested it , that he could not see a play in that novel . Nevertheless he told him " I should be glad to try something next year . ... I should probably be prepared to write you a play , to take or to leave , as you should like it or not , on the chance that if you should like it , it would open the door to my acquiring a goodish sum of money . " He was not , however , free for a sustained dramatic effort . His big novels , all serialized , kept him constantly at his desk . In 1886 he told one correspondent ( Julian R. Sturgis ) that he was not interested in trying to write plays because of " the whole general disillusionment that has come over me . ... When I was younger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has faded away with the mere increase of observation  --  observation I mean , of the deadly vulgarity and illiteracy of the world one enters , practically , in knocking at a manager 's door . Besides I think , I confess , less highly of the drama , as a form , a vehicle , than I did  --  compared with the novel which can do and say so much more . " Three years later he was expressing the opposite view ; and for one claiming a waning interest in the drama he applied himself to its problems assiduously even if he wrote no plays . When he wrote this letter he was already planning his long novel of the stage , The Tragic Muse . At forty Henry James had sought to convince himself that he should write some plays . At the threshold of fifty he turned to the theatre in desperation . " My books do n't sell , and it looks as if my plays might . " This was the rueful confession he made to Robert Louis Stevenson in 1891 . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself , in the late Victorian London , in the anomalous position of being a literary lion whose works were unread . He had caught the public fancy with his " international " tales , and notably Daisy Miller , but the success had been short-lived . Within a decade James had found a public and lost it . Or had the public lost him ? Publishers still brought him out , because it continued to be an honor to have him on their lists and because he sold modestly and had a limited following . The pages of the Atlantic continued to be wide open to him , and now and again one of his shorter pieces created a mild flurry . The golden moment of " success , " nevertheless , seemed to have come and gone forever . " I have entered upon evil days , " James wrote to Howells , who had been his mentor and companion in the early Cambridge time and to whom he turned constantly for practical advice about the marketing of his work . " I am still staggering a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury wrought  --  apparently  --  upon my situation by my last two novels , the Bostonians and the Princess . They have reduced the desire , and the demand , for my productions , to zero . " What had happened was that Henry James had turned his back on the " international " novel and had given the public something it did not expect from him . The Bostonians was strictly about America ; The Princess Casamassima was about a young Anglo-French bookbinder in London . James 's public had come to expect from him stories about Americans in Europe , or Europeans in America . Moreover , his method and manner in these novels of the middle period had grown increasingly intricate ; his continued and ever-deeper exploration of the consciousness made for complexity , and complexity made for public confusion and indifference . This was the price the artist paid for his curiosity , his love of experiment , his desire to reach farther and deeper into life . There is nothing a public resents more than a brusque change in the personality and work of an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , analytical , crowded with observation of the life of Boston and London , attracted few readers , although today they speak eloquently to us . Why did Henry James turn to new subjects after his fortieth year ? What had caused him to turn away from the field he had made his own and to which Howells and his brother William urged him to return ? We can only collate the circumstantial evidence , for we touch here the inner life of a complex mind . His last and most important " international " novel , The Portrait of a Lady , was published in 1881 and in the autumn of that year he revisited America after an absence of six years . In January 1882 his mother died . He had barely returned to England when he was recalled to Boston to the death bed of his father . He then returned to Europe and remained away from the United States for more than twenty years . The change in his artistic production coincided thus with the loss of his parents . He had been a " passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own and other pilgrimages with objectivity , sympathy , insight . He was conscious that " home " was in the United States even though he resided abroad and that his was an American mind playing over Europe and reflecting the Continent to his American readers as well as his Americanism to his British readers . Now " home " had suddenly ceased to exist . The maternal and paternal ties were severed  --  the mother , for whom he had always retained a child-like attachment , the awe-inspiring father , whom he could not follow in his re-creations of heavens and hells in his religious thinking  --  both were gone . His first artistic reaction amounted to an attempt to recover " home . " He felt an overwhelming compulsion at this moment  --  it is recorded in his journal  --  " to show that I can write an American story " ; he underscored the word can . Few had seriously questioned his ability to do so . He had given ample proof of his capacity to write American stories many times before , and as recently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt this need , and he began The Bostonians . It is an unusual work for Henry James , a bitter , ironic and derisive attack on the budding suffragette movement , on female reformers , on cults , in the provincial atmosphere of post-Civil War Boston . The hero , Basil Ransom , is a Southerner , hence an " outsider " like the expatriate New Yorker Henry James . He is also a lawyer , practising the profession Henry James forsook for a career in letters . We need not go into the complexities of the plot , save to note that Ransom sets out to wean the gifted and oratorical Verena Tarrant from her suffragette friends and her family and to make her his wife . " The city of Boston be damned ! " says the hero in the final phase of the book . Henry James had started out to make peace with " home . " He ended by damning it . The Princess Casamassima ( 1886 ) carries the conflict to London . It too deals with characters in revolt  --  only here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found anarchists instead of suffragettes , French migrs instead of Boston cultists . The hero , Hyacinth Robinson , born in the slums , belongs to the masses  --  and yet recoils from them . He too can not make his peace with himself or with " home . " His solution is drastic . Unwilling to destroy a world he is ready to accept , unable to live out his revolt , he destroys himself . These were the two novels which , despite the richness and brilliancy of their writing and the mature art of their creator , provoked no ripple to speak of in the literature of their time . The next novel , The Tragic Muse ( 1889 ) brought James 's conflict to the surface since it carried it into James 's world of art . In it the novelist treated two parallel artistic problems , both akin to his own . A young politician wants to forsake Parliament for the palette ; a young actress , " a creature of the stage , " is asked to forsake her art and marry , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of these varied conflicts a recurring pattern which haunts a score of James 's tales as well as his novels . They reflect James 's revolt against America and his deeply-rooted belief that an artist must make a choice between art and " the world . " A choice between Boston ( home , art , the study ) and Europe ( the world ) had imposed itself and he had made it , although in reality without resolution of the inner conflict . So his original choice of letters ( home , the study ) instead of law ( the world ) . Thus Nick Dormer 's conflict , Parliament ( the world ) , the palette ( art ) and Miriam Rooth 's  --  the art of the stage ( world ) , and marriage ( home ) . In two stories Henry James actually split the conflicting personality of his artist ; one sat in the study and wrote while the other moved in society ( The Private Life ) ; one lived in a flat with an ornate room looking down on the public square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends ; the other looked upon a quiet garden from his rear bedroom , and wore rusty raiment as he wrote his poems ( Benvolio ) . James had always been attracted by the legend of Balzac returning late in the evening from his worldly encounters to don a monkish robe and write through the night . He believed he had resolved his conflict of law versus letters at Dane Hall when he was nineteen . But now with literary failure  --  rejection by his public  --  staring him in the face , it was revived . Revived also were the rejections he had felt in childhood , which he tells us about in A Small Boy and Notes of a Son and Brother , the sense of rivalry and inferiority to brother and father . Where was the mother he could turn to , now ? And here a fortunate circumstance occurred . His sister Alice , ailing , had come to England , and " home " in a sense was reconstructed around her . He could start anew . And he did . He turned to the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world  --  Drama ( literature ) was what he wrote in his study , which he conceived as some monastic " great good place . " He would see whether he could make a go of Theatre ( the world )  --  where the Drama comes to competitive life . He was in Paris in December 1888 , freshly come from a stay in Geneva , and a trip to the Riviera , when the offer came : a suggestion by Edward Compton , a young actor-manager , whose company 's activities were confined to the British provinces , to dramatize The American . Compton 's wife , the American actress Virginia Bateman , had read an article in a theatrical publication suggesting that James 's 1877 novel was a good subject for a play . Compton 's proposal came at a good moment ; this was the year during which James was complaining of his waning literary fortunes . It found him also at work on The Tragic Muse which he had begun that summer . In a journal note of May 12 , 1889 , when he was completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of the drama , of eight years earlier : I had practically given up my old , valued , long cherished dream of doing something for the stage , for fame 's sake , and art 's , and fortune 's : overcome by the vulgarity , the brutality , the baseness of the condition of the English-speaking theatre today . But after an interval , a long one , the vision has revived , on a new and a very much humbler basis , and especially under the lash of necessity . Of art or fame il est maintenant fort peu question : I simply must try , and try seriously , to produce half a dozen  --  a dozen , five dozen  --  plays for the sake of my pocket , my material future . Of how little money the novel makes for me I need n't discourse here . The theatre has sought me out  --  in the person of the good , the yet unseen , Compton . I have listened and considered and reflected , and the matter is transposed to a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility , and do the best I can in them : this is the moral of my present situation . ... He had made up his mind , but he was still in conflict . Compton had written at a propitious moment . Nevertheless almost a year elapsed before James could write his play version of The American . During that time he poured into The Tragic Muse the pros and cons of play-writing , his contempt for the practical conditions of the stage , his delight in the dramatic form . When Gabriel Nash , in a long outburst in the fourth chapter , describes the problems of writing for the Victorian stage  --  and it applies to the contemporary as well  --  he is speaking ( and with what vehemence ! ) for Henry James : ... the omnium gatherum of the population of a big commercial city at the hour of the day when their taste is at its lowest , flocking out of hideous hotels and restaurants , gorged with food , stultified with buying and selling and with all the other sordid preoccupations of the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their seats , timing the author , timing the actor , wishing to get their money back on the spot  --  all before eleven o'clock . Fancy putting the exquisite before such a tribunal as that ! There 's not even a question of it . The dramatist would n't if he could , and in nine cases out of ten he could n't if he would . He has to make the basest concessions . One of his principal canons is that he must enable his spectators to catch the suburban trains , which stop at 11.30 . What would you think of any other artist  --  the painter or the novelist  --  whose governing forces should be the dinner and the suburban trains ? The old dramatists did n't defer to them  --  not so much at least  --  and that 's why they 're less and less actable . If they 're touched  --  the large loose men  --  it 's only to be mutilated and trivialised . Besides , they had a simpler civilisation to represent  --  societies in which the life of man was in action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those things could be put upon the playhouse boards with comparatively little sacrifice of their completeness and their truth . To-day we 're so infinitely more reflective and complicated and diffuse that it makes all the difference . What can you do with a character , with an idea , with a feeling , between dinner and the suburban trains ? You can give a gross rough sketch of them , but how little you touch them , how bald you leave them ! What crudity compared with what the novelist does ! A would-be dramatist approaching his art with so acute a sense of its short-comings and material difficulties was hardly in a frame of mind to attack it bravely . This passage suggests that James had climbed into the dramatic " straitjacket " even before the actors and managers attempted to force him into it . He set about his play-writing with cheerful alacrity ; yet his letters during these early months of what was to prove to be a five-year siege of the theatre betray hesitations , uncertainties , misgivings , anxieties  --  a continuation of the conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes the same notes in all his letters : he is venturing into the theatre for " exclusively mercenary " reasons ; he wants his play-writing to be kept a secret until the play is produced ; the dramatic form is admirable , the conditions of the British theatre are vulgar and odious . He is secretive to the point of coyness ; he sends his script to his sister Alice and solemnly enjoins her not to write to William about it , or at any rate to " give a sign that he must bury what you tell him in tenfold mystery . " To which he adds , half-seriously " ... but I doubt if even this would be secure  --  it would be in the Transcript the next week . " To William he writes that " for all sorts of reasons I desire to be extremely secret , silent and mysterious " about the theatrical enterprises . He explains that this was to be an attempt of the " most resolute and scientific character . " He writes : " It is ridiculous at my age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one murder makes a villain  --  millions a hero ' : ) therefore I mean to make  --  as soon as may be  --  eight or ten . " As Henry continued to be mysterious and secretive about the details of his dramatic work , William in characteristic fashion teased him , saying he assumed the " mysterious fortune-making plans " were probably the " formation of an international ' trust ' to produce the plays simultaneously in all the capitals of the earth , or something of the kind . " He added : " You ought to know enough critically about the qualities that the stage requires , if you can only cold-bloodedly throw in enough action to please the people . ... " Later , when William knew the details , Henry was still cautioning him " please breathe no word of these confidences , as publicity blows on such matters in an injurious and deflowering way . And interests too great to be hurt are at stake . " His need for secrecy was explained by him in a letter to his brother many months later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is heart-breaking is the having to tell them and talk about them and answer people 's questions ( I do n't say this for you ! ) mostly indiscreet and idle . That , only , is the real giving one 's self away . There is no answer to be given , or information to be supplied , in relation to any situation one is in with a theatre or manager . Silence , till production takes place , if it is ever to , is the only thing that meets the dangers and covers the abysses . Please know nothing if anyone asks you about my affairs . I say nothing myself whatever . I only do my business and go my way . " Outside his family , Robert Louis Stevenson was one of a few friends who received his theatrical confidences , and yet always in general terms . To Stevenson he was invariably apologetic : " Do n't be hard on me , simplifying and chastening necessity has laid its brutal hand on me and I have had to try and make somehow or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the same letter he refers to The American as his " tribute to the vulgarest of the muses " and speaks of a " base theatrical errand "  --  meaning a rehearsal he is about to attend . He writes to Stevenson : " My zeal in the affair is only matched by my indifference ... " yet in the same letter he says " I find the form opens out before me as if it were a kingdom to conquer . ... " And then , as if he had spoken too kind a word for the theatre , he promptly adds " a kingdom forsooth of ignorant brutes of managers and dense cabotins of actors . " And immediately after this there is again an expression of delight : " All the same , I feel as if I had at last found my form  --  my real one  --  that for which pale fiction is an ineffectual substitute . " Again , lest Stevenson take this for genuine enthusiasm , he once more qualifies : " God grant this unholy truth may not abide with me more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight or ten rounded masterpieces and make withal enough money to enable me to retire in peace and plenty for the unmolested business of a little supreme writing , as distinct from gouging  --  which is the Form above-mentioned . " To William he had written without qualification a few days earlier : " I feel at last as if I had found my real form , which I am capable of carrying far , and for which the pale little art of fiction , as I have practised it , has been , for me , but a limited and restricted substitute . The strange thing is that I always , universally , knew this was my more characteristic form  --  but was kept away from it by a half-modest , half-exaggerated sense of the difficulty ( that is , I mean the practical odiousness ) of the conditions . But now that I have accepted them and met them , I see that one is n't at all , needfully , their victim , but is , from the moment one is anything , one 's self , worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , command them , squeeze them , lift them up and better them . As for the form itself , its honor and inspiration are ( dfaut d'autres ) in its difficulty . If it were easy to write a good play I could n't and would n't think of it ; but it is in fact damnably hard ( to this truth the paucity of the article  --  in the English-speaking world  --  testifies , ) and that constitutes a solid respectability  --  guarantees one 's intellectual self-respect . " These passages from letters written to brother and to friend during the period of the production of The American illustrate strikingly Henry James 's waiverings and his terrible need to justify the venture into the theatre as if it were some abnormal undertaking , requiring explanation and apology . Allowing for his habitual tone of banter in his correspondence with Stevenson and his addiction to elaborate euphemism , it is clear , nevertheless , that the reiterated apologies for the theatre sprang from needs other than to amuse and entertain his friends . The tone of the letters might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content was serious , and derived from the deeply-grounded need to put up a good " front " dramatically speaking . He had made a decision ; he was not at all sure of himself ; he felt he was straying from the dignified path of a man of letters and he wanted to be sure his friends would not think the less of him for it . The late Victorian theatre was an impoverished institution , lacking the artistic richness and freedom of fiction . Henry James recognized the challenge to improve it . But he was afraid . The best justification he could find was his need to earn money . It was true that the dwindling sales of his books created a greater sense of financial need than actually existed . At this time , as in 1881 , his earnings were adequate . The Atlantic paid him $15 a page for The Tragic Muse ( a yield of $300 a month ) and income from other writings and other sources continued to give him a safe margin of security . There was , however , another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached his " middle years " beset by feelings of literary inadequacy ( in the marketplace ) and the thought of the years to come , with the prospect of diminishing returns , deeply disturbed him . Therefore one of the reasons he gave was the desire to " provide for one 's old age . " And his emphasis on money must be seen in the light of a new friendship he formed at the outset of the dramatic years with a young American , Wolcott Balestier , a friend of Howells 's , who had arrived in London shortly before the dramatization of The American to represent a New York publisher . Intense , energetic , himself a writer of short stories and novels ( he later collaborated with Kipling in the writing of The Naulahka ) , young Balestier undertook to guide James in his financial arrangements for the plays . With a whole-hearted admiration for the middle-aged novelist , and a characteristic enthusiasm that endeared him to London 's literary world , Balestier fired James 's imagination with stories of fortunes to be derived from dramatic production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed his letters to James with a flamboyance and flattery that delighted the novelist ; and presently James was building great castles in the air based on hypothetical royalties he would derive from his plays in England plus those which would pour in from the American rights and even , he fondly daydreamed in a letter to William , from the Australian ! The thought of fabulous fortunes , coupled with an awareness of the large incomes of playwrights such as Arthur Pinero , Henry Arthur Jones and later Oscar Wilde , made Henry James acutely aware of the smallness of his literary income ; and it was small indeed , judged by a dramatist 's earnings during the successful run of a play . What James overlooked , in his constant reference to the royalties received by his contemporaries in the theatre , was that a playwright too has his ups and downs and that between plays his income can fall to zero . James 's emphasis on money , on secrecy , on the vulgarities and baseness of the British stage , betrayed again and again his ambivalent attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he was seeking to vend his wares in a competitive market . Perhaps one of the elements in his conflict was the strong American impulse that he no doubt possessed  --  had his Albany grandfather not demonstrated its truth ?  --  that to be worth one 's salt in the world one had to elbow one 's way to achievement by solid worldly enterprise ! He was launched in the theatre ; he had abandoned the novel for the time being . Henceforth he kept telling himself , he would write only plays and short stories . He would , like Balzac , seek to leave a multitude of pictures of his time . But it was no accident that most of the stories written while he was wooing the Muse of the Drama are either stories of " unsuccessful " writers , or ghostly tales expressing nightmare terror , anxiety , frustration . " A MOST UNHOLY TRADE " He threw himself into his play-writing as one possessed . In all the fifty years of his authorship he was never to create at a pitch of greater or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier engaged in battle and his life depended on the outcome . The words " siege " and " war " recur constantly in his letters . He imaged the world of the theatre as a battleground . He pictured the stage as an " abyss " and by implication placed himself on its brink . He rewrote , he elaborated parts to suit actors and actresses ; he contrived happy endings he would never have dreamed of in his novels ; he caricatured his fellow countrymen to win laughter from English audiences ; he struggled with the " barbarous , the ignorant , the sickening race of managers " ; he bowed before " the foul fiend Excision "  --  speaking of his plays as bloodied , amputated , butchered children . ( " Oh , the mutilated , brutally simplified , massacred little play ! " ) Behind the half-exaggerated and elaborate irony and mockery of his pronouncements lay a deep and serious purpose , that of meeting the stage on its terms , and communicating to the audiences . " Forget not , " he exploded one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write for the stupid  --  that is , that your maximum of refinement must meet the minimum of intelligence of the audience  --  the intelligence , in other words , of the biggest ass it may conceivably contain . " And he added : " It is a most unholy trade ! " Scenario succeeded upon scenario  --  we shall never know exactly how many  --  and were circulated among the London managers . At rehearsals James mounted the stage to demonstrate to the actors how parts should be played , drawing upon his memory of bits of " business " seen on the stage of the Thtre Franais " I spent upwards of five hours yesterday on the deadly cold stage of the Ports-mouth Theatre ( the ' ladies ' had such red noses ! ) going at them tooth and nail , without pause , and then two more with my grand premier rle at his lodgings , coaching him with truly psychological intensity ; acting , intonating everything for him and showing him simply how ! The authorship ( in any sense worthy of the name ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see that one 's creation of it does n't terminate till one has gone with it every inch of the way to the rise of the curtain on the first night . ... " During his five dramatic years , however , he had only two productions upon which to lavish such effort ; the majority of his plays remained unproduced . He was in a constant state of nervous , tension : accustomed to the freedom of fiction he found himself in a theatre wedged between the backdrop and the proscenium , reaching beyond the footlights to an audience that asked to be entertained and pleased " on the spot . " At first he relished the flare of the gaslight , the painted faces , the rituals and superstitions of the stage , the high hopes , the realities backstage and the make-believe on-stage . The reactions of the audience stirred and excited him ; the modest , unobtrusive " observer " that was Henry James enjoyed hearing his work applauded , and humanly delighted in the call of " Author , author " that brought him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge of the dramatic art , and was stimulated by his contact with creatures of flesh and blood , he who had lived in the fantasied world of his novelist 's study . Yet disillusion set in rapidly ; inner nightmares plagued him : his anxieties overflowed to disturb and confuse his relations with actors and managers . At fifty , and a famous man of letters , he was impatient over the characteristic delays of the theatre : " The great stumbling block in the whole business is the question of Time  --  the slowness , the waiting , the delays which are a large part of the very essence of managerial production . They talk of years as we talk of months and I am handicapped by having begun too late and being too old : I ought to have come to it ten years ago . But I shall vanquish all the same . " Recognizing this , he was , nevertheless , unprepared for the theatrical rebuffs which are the common lot of actor and playwright . The children of his brain , upon which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vere Gardens , lingered ignored in the managerial offices . James was artist enough  --  and human enough  --  to feel deep anguish at their treatment . He pleaded , he argued , he worked , he revised , he compromised , and in the end , with the jeers of an audience ringing in his ears , he fled back to his study , to the sanctuary and great good place that had been waiting for him all the time of his struggle in the outer world , exclaiming , as he had many times before : " I may have been meant for the Drama  --  God Knows !  --  but I certainly was n't meant for the Theatre . " We can plot the chart of Henry James 's fitful dramatic fever from the casual allusions , hints , veiled vague references to his theatrical enterprises in his letters  --  information grudgingly vouchsafed to an inquiring older brother , or on occasions to intimate friends close to his efforts in London . The American , written early in 1890 , was an open secret since it went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by numbers in his letters and we are never certain in what order they were written since he only named three of them . Between November and December 1890 he wrote Tenants , first known as Mrs. Vibert , for John Hare ; in mid-December he began Play #3 intended for Compton , who had produced The American , and this was completed by January 10 , 1891 . It was either The Reprobate or The Album  --  the two works he described later as designed to be played in country towns and which he ultimately admitted to Edmund Gosse he had intended for the Compton Comedy Company . On February 6 , 1891 , he wrote to William that he was attacking " my fourth " but we have no way of knowing what this play was and whether he completed it . In the autumn of 1891 he discussed a play for Augustin Daly , the American manager who was planning a London season , and in December of that year he was writing a " three-act contemporary comedy " again for Edward Compton  --  this again either Reprobate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the summer of 1892 for he read Mrs. Jasper , later re-titled Disengaged , to Ada Rehan during August of that year , and in November he was planning a second play for her which , however , ultimately became the one-act play he wrote for Ellen Terry . In May of 1893 he sketched the scenario for a " three-act comedy pure and simple " which later that year he offered to George Alexander , the matinee idol and enterprising manager of the St. James 's . He spoke at this time also of a play tentatively titled Monte Carlo . In May or June of 1893 he set down his first note for the dramatization of The Chaperon following a suggestion made to him by Arthur Pinero that his short story of that name had in it all the ingredients of a high comedy . That summer , at Ramsgate , he wrote Guy Domville for Alexander . In November 1893 , while negotiating with Daly for the production of Disengaged , which he revised , and with Alexander for the production of Domville , he had " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carr , the London art critic who had leased the Comedy Theatre for a fling at dramatic production . Carr was waiting to decide after seeing the third act . From an allusion to the Monte Carlo play in his notebooks at this time we may speculate that this work may have been intended for Carr , but there is no way at present of knowing . By this time Henry James 's desk was clearly piled high with scenarios and half-written plays . On December 7 , 1893 , he slips into a letter to Elizabeth Robins a final exclamatory sentence : " I have begun another play ! " and three weeks later , before his Christmas fire , he is dreaming up still another play for Compton , tentatively named The Promise . In 1894 he sets down the scenario for this play , and lays it aside when Compton shows no interest in it . ( Two years later he turned it into the novel , The Other House , and a dozen years after that he turned the novel into a play . ) During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to flower into The Wings of the Dove , conceiving it first also as a play . How many of these numerous projects were completed ? how many absorbed into his fiction ? how many scrapped ? We know little more today than James 's correspondents did when they received his chary confidences . The two plays which saw production during the 1890 's never saw publication . Four comedies written during this period which never reached the stage were issued in book form ( the two series of Theatricals ) ; a one-act play was converted into a short story ; a scenario was converted into a novel ; and much later a three-act comedy into a novel . It is quite likely that the novelist did not scrap any of his completed plays , since we know that he did not like work to go to waste . Many of the " plays " written during these crowded months existed only as extended scenarios and these he seems to have destroyed . Perhaps some day some portions of plays and scenarios may turn up among the papers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little likelihood since James usually reclaimed his scripts . We may surmise that he made copious notes for his plays in those notebooks which he destroyed ; the few pages of the first note for The Chaperon which survive ( because he had hopes of writing this play ) were torn from a scribbler such as he used for his notebooks and break off in the middle of a tantalizing sentence . A few words more and we might have learned something about Monte Carlo . Searches instituted some years ago by the editor of this volume among the papers of Sir John Hare and J. Comyns Carr yielded neither scenarios nor letters . The four comedies which Henry James published as a " melancholy subterfuge , " seeking to console himself with " the performance imaginary , " are conventional and contrived in the tradition of French comedy of manners . James resorts freely to melodrama to untangle his plots ; he is prodigal , after the manner of the time , in his use of asides and employs the catch-phrase unhesitatingly as a humorous resource . His characters belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " women , double dealers , doting mothers , flirts and philanderers , deep-dyed villains and virtuous , bumbling protagonists . An adventuress seeks to " place " her illegitimate son in the social hierarchy ; there is an intrigue to deprive a rightful heir of his fortune ; a practical joke results in a man 's engagement to a woman , in spite of himself , and there is an intrigue to " disengage " him ; a young man , considered a reprobate , develops into a self-asserting individual . There are echoes of Dumas fils and Augier in these plays ; there is the coup de thtre in the manner of Sardou ; the ficelle is strained to the breaking point . Henry James was seeking to write crisp , witty , epigrammatic comedy at the same time as Oscar Wilde , and these comedies inevitably invite comparison with those of his contemporary . James 's plays have more substance , weightier machinery , much plot , considerable drollery , less wit , but much sharper caricature . Wilde 's plays are tinsel and pasteboard ; his people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in James 's comedies , but at every turn one is conscious of the hand of an experienced artist engaged in characterizing people and setting them within the scenic frame . The fundamental difference between Henry James and Oscar Wilde ( James called Oscar the " unspeakable one " ) so far as the failure of one and the success of the other in the theatre is concerned , resides in their approach to the public . Wilde remained true to the figure of himself he had long before projected  --  that of a cool , arrogant coiner of witty phrases and epigrams , utterly indifferent to his public . James described to a friend how he attended the first night of Lady Windermere 's Fan in 1892 and Oscar " with a metallic blue carnation in his buttonhole and a cigarette in his fingers " made a curtain speech . " The speech , which , alas , was stupid , was only to say that he judged the audience felt the play to be merely as charming as he did . " The audience accepted his condescension because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his public . He was trying too hard to please it . The public , or the managers who read his plays , sensed this strain , and could neither laugh at him , as at Wilde , nor sympathize with him . The result was fatal for James . This feeling of anxiety and tension in James is reflected in the prefaces to the two volumes of Theatricals . Beneath the polished surface of their prose one can sense the heartbreak . Gallantly James observes that the publication of unproduced plays is in a sense an admission of defeat ; he is giving expression at once to a kind of self-pity and exasperation . Stripped of their urbane exteriors the prefaces are a moan of fear mingled with a grunt of anger . In arraying the difficulties faced by the dramatist James also expresses the apprehension surrounding his play-writing  --  tear of being supersubtle , fear , coupled with a very natural resentment , of the mutilation of his plays by managers , fear of the limitations imposed upon him by the clock . It is no wonder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw in James 's " exaggerated respect and exaggerated contempt " for the stage the frustrating ambivalence arising out of conflict that foredoomed his theatrical undertakings . " He is fascinated by the very difficulty , " wrote the perspicacious reviewer , " yet in his heart he despises himself for yielding to the fascination . " The theatrical tight rope , the abyss , the straitjacket , existed in James 's own mind . If Henry James could have approached the theatre in a more relaxed fashion  --  in the manner in which he wrote his fiction  --  we should probably be telling a different story today . ONE YEAR MORE ... He had thought of himself as a double personality , a monk writing in his cell , a man of the world moving about in society , observing , noting , recording . Now this fantasy reasserted itself . Henry James , the dramatist , walked abroad in the London daylight , was strong , vigorous , masculine , a soldier laying siege to the citadel of the theatre , a champion of Ibsen , a gallant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the literary man , sat in his Kensington study , contriving scenarios and plays , cursing managers and writing  --  always writing . He wrote a story about such a double personality in The Private Life during the second of his dramatic years , attaching it to the figure of Robert Browning , whom he envisaged as possessing an alter ego , a writer who created his poetry for him in private while an unpoetic , a more prosaic , figure moved through the London drawing-rooms . Henry James worried at the " dramatic , the unspeakably theatric form , " but he dipped his pen also into the " other ink  --  the sacred fluid of fiction . " Nothing was more soothing , he journalized in 1893 , than " to remember that literature sits patient at my door , and that I have only to lift the latch to let in the exquisite little form that is , after all , nearest my heart . " ( Thus far had he come since his outburst to William James two years earlier about the " pale little art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " my more characteristic form . " ) For he continued to practise the fictional form and " pale " is the last word most critics would apply to the stories written during the dramatic years . He had forsworn the novel ; he confined himself only to the short story ( la Maupassant , he told himself ) and with an ardor all the more intense , since his story-writing provided an escape from the frustrations of the theatre . Between the production of The American in 1890 and Guy Domville in the first days of 1895 , he wrote nineteen tales including such masterpieces as The Real Thing , The Altar of the Dead , Sir Edmund Orme , The Chaperon , The Marriages , The Death of the Lion , The Coxon Fund and thirteen articles ranging from memorials to his lately dead friends , James Russell Lowell , Fanny Kemble , and Robert Browning , to critical discussions of Ibsen and Flaubert . He saw six volumes of tales and essays through the press during the dramatic years ; his output continued to be large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serialization in the magazines reduced his literary earnings considerably . Writing unproduced plays was proving a costly process . Into the tales written during these troubled years there flowed very little of his actual theatrical experience . Only one of the nineteen stories dealt directly with a theatrical subject ; this was Nona Vincent , written immediately after the production of The American and reflecting in every detail James 's adventures on the road and in London with the Compton Comedy Company . Allan Wayworth , the young , fastidious , nervous playwright , clinging to the safely-married and all-wise Mrs. Alsager , was the Henry James who had read his plays to his friends Mrs. John L. Gardner and Mrs. Hugh Bell . Henry James 's boast to his brother : " I feel at last as if I had found my real form " was Wayworth 's " mastery of the scenic idea " ; Henry James 's view that the theatre was an " abyss of vulgarity and platitude " was Wayworth 's " managerial abyss . " Henry James 's remark in the preface to the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " periodical throwing overboard of the cargo to save the ship " parallels Wayworth 's " You were perpetually throwing over the cargo to save the ship . ... " If the overt material did not go into his other stories , the emotions arising from his play-writing did . A reader examining the stories , unaware of James 's activities during these years , would discover in them evidence of his personal fears and anxieties , and an ever-deepening sense of frustration . He had written only four ghostly tales between his twenty-second and forty-seventh years ; now the supernatural element appears in a series of tales  --  the daylight ghost of Sir Edmund Orme , the overwhelming night-time spirit of the Family in Owen Wingrave , the supernatural-fantastic of The Private Life , the operation of clairvoyance or telepathy and benign supernaturalism of Sir Dominick Ferrand and Nona Vincent reflecting James 's uneasy state of mind . He wrote twelve such tales during the nineties including the celebrated Turn of the Screw , his ultimate record of nightmare set down in the aftermath of dramatic defeat . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers unappreciated and ignored , public failures , private " successes , " triumphant in their art . These are almost completely autobiographical since , in each case , Henry James identified himself with the writer he portrayed . The stories were derived ( as James cautiously said in a preface a dozen years later ) " in each case , from some noted adventure , some felt embarrassment , some extreme predicament , of the artist enamored of perfection . ... " Some felt embarrassment . We do not have to seek far to discover the person who felt the embarrassment . He published a volume after his dramatic years containing four stories , two dealing with unsuccessful writers , and called it Embarrassments . In 1893 , the year of his fiftieth birthday , James published only one short story . He called it The Middle Years . It is the story of a writer who , in middle life , feels that it has taken him too long to learn his craft . " His development had been abnormally slow , almost grotesquely gradual . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of life to produce too little of his art . At such a rate a first existence was too short . ... " Poor Dencombe , the writer , pleads in vain for a second existence in which to write the great works he has in his mind and dies realizing that he has accomplished all he has been capable of doing . The dying Dencombe whispers to the admiring young doctor at his side : " It 's frustration that does n't count . " And the admiring young doctor philosophically replies : " Frustration 's only life . " Frustration was only life . At the end of the year in which he wrote these words , Henry James withdrew his comedy , Disengaged , from Augustin Daly , after a difference with the producer , gritted his teeth and wrote to William : " ... la guerre comme la guerre . I mean to wage this war ferociously for one year more  --  1894  --  and then ( unless the victory and the spoils have not by that become more proportionate than hitherto to the humiliations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult incurred ) to ' chuck ' the whole intolerable experiment and return to the more elevated and more independent courses . " And he added : " The whole odiousness of the thing lies in the connection between the drama and the theatre . The one is admirable in its interest and difficulty , the other loathesome in its conditions . " One year more  --  1894 . Henry James 's notes during this year are crowded with fantasies of death . Entry after entry betrays his deep sense of frustration , brooding despair that accompanied his sense of time irretrievably lost , the feeling that had grown in the five years since his last novel that he was a figure unwanted in the artistic life of his time . The record of frustration can be read in his letters and stories ; the fantasies have been set down for us in his notebook . At the beginning of the year he wrote " The idea of death both checked and caught me ... " and it became the leitmotif of the successive notebook entries : ideas for stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have died emotionally or who have bartered passion for material opportunities , and live on in a mockery of life . During this year he set down his fantasy of the literary " lion " discovered late in his career and smothered by uncritical adulation , finally dying of it . During this year he set down the first fantasy of " some young creature ... who , at 20 , on the threshold of a life that has seemed boundless , is suddenly condemned to death " which eight years later became The Wings of the Dove . And during this year he wrote his lament for the neglected dead which grew in his hands into The Altar of the Dead  --  the story of the great blazing altar on which George Stransom set his candles , symbols of the tomb , in the knowledge that a candle one day would be lit for him . During 1894 James published only three tales and two of them have Death in their titles  --  The Death of the Lion and The Altar of the Dead . To the volume in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written during a sad summer in Italy that year , a story of death-in-life , of a writer who fritters away his talent in talk , and The Middle Years , the story of the author seeking a second chance , he gave the lugubrious title of Terminations . 1894 was a year of terminations and Henry James knew it . One year more . Guy Domville was to be the final test and all his hopes and dreams of the past five years went into that play . Rehearsals began during December of 1894 , and for a few days Henry James re-experienced all the high elation  --  and sharp conflict  --  of the dramatist he had painted in Nona Vincent . The year of gloom came to a gloomy end with word of the death of his old friend Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa ; and the new year was but five days old when Henry James walked out on the stage of the St. James 's theatre to face the ultimate rejection from the public he had tried to please . In a few stormy seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the terminal episode of his dramatic years . " DIVINE PRINCIPLE OF THE SCENARIO " In Guy Domville Henry James had told the story of a young man destined for the priesthood who , on becoming the last of his line , is prevailed upon to forego the monastery and assume the obligations due his family name  --  to take charge of his estates and to marry . He ventures from the threshold of the cloister into the world only to discover that it is filled with evil . He is surrounded by conniving people , dishonesty , betrayal . He tries to accept this world but to no avail , and finally , shocked and disillusioned by a supreme betrayal , he returns to the embrace of Mother Church . The situation in the play , which was written at the height of Henry James 's struggle in the theatre , clearly parallels the novelist 's experience . He could identify himself with his hero to the full . He had always thought of himself as dedicated to the priesthood or fraternity of letters ; he had strayed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world filled with conniving actors and managers , dishonesty , betrayal . Like Guy he had sought to adjust himself to it . The very play which dramatized his problems had , by a supreme irony , been the instrument of his disillusion and defeat . Like Guy he would now " turn away his face " from that non-literary world which had treated him with such cruelty . He would re-enter his monastic cell of letters . From Henry James 's notebook , January 23 , 1895 : I take up my own old pen again  --  the pen of all my old unforgettable efforts and sacred struggles . To myself  --  today  --  I need say no more . Large and full and high the future still opens . It is now indeed that I may do the work of my life . And I will . xxxxx I have only to face my problems . xxxxx But all that is of the ineffable  --  too deep and pure for any utterance . Shrouded in sacred silence let it rest .  --  He had written to William James at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to attack , renewedly and repeatedly , the almost impregnable fortress of the theatre . " No one had repulsed his attacks . The fortress had remained ( for him ) quite simply impregnable . Now , at fifty-two , he could return to silence , devotion , contemplation  --  to the observation post of the mind he had occupied during all the long years that preceded his play-writing . Here no one could challenge him : no manager could reject his dreams and fantasies or apply the brutal axe of Excision to his manuscripts ; no actor could dictate his characters for him . He was the undisputed master , the omniscient observer . He could speculate , analyze , lose himself in his fancies  --  make these the realities of his life to replace the other realities that lay outside and beyond his literary monastery . And so , immediately after Guy Domville , we find him dreaming self-consolatory stories , seeking " compensations and solutions . " His works were not popular ? This was because they were " too good " for the public whose " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus he wrote a short story , The Next Time , about an author who seeks to create pot-boilers , but is capable of producing only unread masterpieces . His works were not understood ? This was because their form , their pattern , their texture was not perceived by the mole-like critics . Thus he wrote a short story , The Figure in the Carpet , to plead for a criticism that might understand the artist 's intentions . While he thus sought and found reassurance for himself , on a conscious level , in stories that might be termed " rationalizations , " he was nevertheless stating truths that the critics of today can readily accept . He was too discriminating for the taste of his time ; his art , complex , and conforming to high standards of perfection , eluded critics who should have known him better . And there was indeed a pattern in his work which still seems to elude them , a subtle autobiographical pattern , the manner in which he wrote his life into his work . In the order , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and the names he gave to his books , there lay the figure in the carpet for those who wished to find it . On another level of the mind  --  and here we skirt more speculative areas  --  he was now plunged into a nightmare of fear and insecurity . To have been rejected brutally by his public amounted to artistic death , and he fought against this with all the force of his manhood . Three days after Guy Domville , he visited the Archbishop of Canterbury , at his country seat of Addington , near London , and there , in conversation with members of his family , he described himself as a man who had " hitherto ... seemed to himself to have been struggling in some dim water-world , bewildered and hampered by the crystal medium , and that he had suddenly got his head above the surface , with a new perspective and an unimpeded vision . " Henry James thus imaged himself as one who had been drowning and who only now could begin to breathe again . A striking image for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch him , through the weeks that followed , struggling against the waves that threatened to swallow him up , groping for a foothold against oblivion . Here was the death-in-life of his fantasies of the year before . The jeering audience in St. James 's had reduced him to the helplessness of an unappreciated child ; it had cut at the heart of his creativity . It is perhaps no coincidence that the first note he set down after Guy Domville was that of a tale of horror , a nightmare story , told him by the Archbishop at Addington , which became The Turn of the Screw . He had written a few years earlier two short stories about ill-starred children ; now he moved into a world of childish fear and terror ; the bogey of non-success now merged with the infantile Bogeyman . Two novels and a novelette are set down in rapid succession picturing fragile innocents , bright , precocious , blooming , worldlywise , pushed and fenced by adult hands , some doomed to early blight . For the children of the stories he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is murdered ( The Other House ) ; childhood is a special hell created by adults ( What Maisie Knew ) ; adults plague children with phantoms ( The Turn of the Screw ) . The Henry James who had retreated from his older brother rather than compete with him ; the celibate Henry , whose life would never be shared with his own children ( whose author in The Lesson of the Master describes children as contributing to " damnation , artistically speaking " ) , dreamed tales of children assaulted by great forces of aggression . And since these dreams sprang full-blown from his mind at this climactic moment in his literary career , we must accept them as evidence of the inner disturbance provoked by his theatrical failures . He moved from his disturbed present into a disturbed childish past . It is no wonder that James described the ghostly tale as the finest form of the fairy tale . In saying this he linked the fear and wonder of his ghosts with his childhood . There had been too many preceptors and governesses , too many pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rivals and rejections . On February 14 , 1895 , little more than a month after Guy Domville , Henry James sat down at his desk to work out the details of a story he had noted the previous year . " I have my head , thank God , full of visions . One has never too many  --  one has never enough . Ah , just to let one 's self go  --  at last . ... " He glances at the theme which was to become The Wings of the Dove , he goes on to glance at the note that foreshadowed The Golden Bowl . He expresses some worry about the " adulterine " element in this theme ; it would be difficult to sell such a story to the highly sensitive American " family " magazines . The solution would lie in the handling of the subject . ... He muses , " Voyons , voyons may I not instantly sit down to a little close , clear full scenario of it ? " Suddenly at the mention of the word scenario he does " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask myself the question , with the very asking of it , and the utterance of that word scenario so charged with memories and pains , something seems to open out before me , and at the same time to press upon me with an extraordinary tenderness of embrace . Compensations and solutions seem to stand there with open arms for me  --  and something of the ' meaning ' to come to me of past bitterness , of recent bitterness that otherwise has seemed a mere sickening , unflavoured draught . He asks himself a still more important question : Has a part of all this wasted passion and squandered time ( of the last 5 years ) been simply the precious lesson , taught me in that roundabout and devious , that cruelly expensive , way , of the singular value for a narrative plan too of the ( I do n't know what adequately to call it ) divine principle of the Scenario ? If this was the case , he almost blessed the " pangs and the pains and the miseries " of the " whole tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core of it this exquisite truth  --  I almost hold my breath with suspense as I try to formulate it ; so much , hangs radiantly there as depending on it  --  this exquisite truth that what I call the divine principle in question is a key that , working in the same general way fits the complicated chambers of both the dramatic and the narrative lock : IF , I say , I have crept round through long apparent barrenness , through suffering and sadness intolerable to that rare perception  --  why my infinite little loss is converted into an almost infinite little gain . The long figuring out , the patient , passionate little cahier , becomes the mot de l ' nigme , the thing to live by . Let me commemorate here , in this manner , such a portentous little discovery , the discovery , probably , of a truth of real value even if I exaggerate , as I daresay I do , its porte , its magicality . Divine principle of the Scenario . He did not exaggerate its importance , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook entries of the remaining years . He called it also " mastery of fundamental statement , " and as the months passed he grew increasingly attached to this simple device , derived from his work methods of his dramatic years : that of setting down a full outline of each project , a rough statement , a scenario , even when a trivial short story was involved . He had , in earlier days , communed with himself in his notebooks , never to any extended length . Now there appears in his scribblers full-length scenarios for his novels ; this explains the detailed working out of The Spoils of Poynton and What Maisie Knew and the elaborate " Project for The Ambassadors . " " Projects " or scenarios or " rough statements " existed for all his later novels ; however , after he started dictating directly to the typewriter he did not include these in his notebooks , and most of them were destroyed by him in the flames to which he consigned the bulk of his papers a few years before his death . Henry James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the writing of his plays . He talks of his fiction as if it were drama . " What then is it , " he asks himself at one point in working out the Spoils , " that the rest of my second little act , as I call it ... must do ? " And he goes on : " What I feel more and more that I must arrive at , with these things , is the adequate and regular practice of some such economy of clear summarization as will give me from point to point , each of my steps , stages , tints , shades , every main joint and hinge , in its place , of my subject  --  give me , in a word , my clear order and expressed sequence . I can then take from the table , successively , each fitted or fitting piece of my little mosaic . " This is the carpenter-dramatist at work ( as James envisioned him years before ) on his knees , disposing of his goods this that and the other way , packing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; it is not the old-time novelist spinning a discursive narrative , chatting , pausing to describe , taking his reader on diverse journeys , letting his pen run cheerfully away with him ; it is the novel given a form as calculated as a fugue or a sonata , the boundaries defined and within them the work built step by step in accordance with its particular substance and logic . In his note for The Spoils of Poynton from which we have quoted above , Henry James went on to write : When I ask myself what there may have been to show for my long tribulation , my wasted years and patiences and pangs , of theatrical experiment , the answer , as I have already noted here , comes up as just possibly this : what I have gathered from it will perhaps have been exactly some such mastery of fundamental statement  --  of the art and secret of it , of expression , of the sacred mystery of structure . Oh yes  --  the weary , woeful time has done something for me , has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an intense little lesson and direction . What that resultant is I must now actively show . ... He actively showed it from then on : he attached the utmost importance to his " subject-noting , " the " working-out " sessions , the " thinking out ... pen in hand . " In one of his short stories ( The Death of the Lion ) he described an author 's scenario as " loose liberal confident , it might have passed for a great gossiping eloquent letter  --  the overflow into talk of an artist 's amorous plan . " The survival of the unfinished scenario for The Chaperon now published here  --  the sole play-scenario extant so far as we know  --  gives us a picture of the way in which James liked to " fumble out " his subject . It belongs with the notes which survived for his unfinished novels , The Sense of the Past and The Ivory Tower which Percy Lubbock edited after his death . He thus practised to the full the application to the narrative plan of his " divine principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cahier " became indeed the key to his work , the mot de l ' nigme , the figure in the carpet , " the thing to live by . " He rejoiced in the elaborate mechanics of his writing  --  the process of fitting the scenario key , as he had put it , into the " complicated chambers of both the dramatic and narrative lock . " In the process , he was equating drama and fiction , the same door and the same lock led him to both . The effect of this method on his later work was extraordinary , for in applying his drama-working methods to the novel he gave to his fiction the qualities of the play . His protagonists would be shown at the crucial moments in their lives , face to face with their conflicts and decisions and in scenes as carefully set as if they were the work of the stage designer and the property man . The theatre had taught him rigid economy and how to allow a situation to unfold without the intervention of the narrator ; how to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drama it contained . Henry James had arrived at the ultimate integration , in his work , of Picture and Scene . ( " I realize  --  none too soon  --  that the scenic method is my absolute , my imperative , my only salvation . " ) The series of experiments Henry James embarked upon led him from a group of three short , play-like novels , to the final major novels of his career which combine his qualities of analyst and painter with those of the artist of the scene , the dramatist . On the surface these later novels appear the reverse of dramatic ; the situation seems to be static while we are in the minds of the Jamesian characters and observers , following them through their analyses and their problems . Each passage of analysis , however , leads invariably to a sharply-defined scene so planned as to advance and resolve the given situation  --  the whole arranged in a symmetrical and highly logical pattern . The work possesses an organic architectural design . Background is reduced to essentials , as on the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His first novel after the dramatic years was The Spoils of Poynton , his second the adaption into fiction of his scenario of The Other House . In accomplishing this work , in which , for the first time , he consciously used a scenario designed for a play as the basis for a novel , he carried out what he had adumbrated in his notebooks . A dozen years later , in one of his outbursts of emotion in his notes , he spoke of The Other House as " a precedent , a support , a divine little light to walk by . " He went on to write What Maisie Knew , The Turn of the Screw , In the Cage with an ever more rigorous application of the scenario principle and the scenic structure resulting therefrom , until in The Awkward Age ( 1899 ) he set down an entire novel in dialogue  --  one scene for each of his personages and each scene illuminating the central situation . He described it as " all dramatic and scenic " and explained it as " presented episodes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no going behind , no telling about the figures save by their own appearance and action . ... " Figure : 574KB The image James used in his preface to this work was that of a series of lamps disposed around a central subject " the function of each of which would be to light with all due intensity one of its aspects . " Readers of Henry James 's prefaces will recall how often he describes the manner in which a subject appealed to him , and how in each case he heard the inner voice say , " Dramatize , dramatize ! " It is true that he had " dramatized " long before the dramatic years . But it was only after these years that he applied the scenic method with complete and conscious consistency . In the preface to What Maisie Knew he acknowledges the " inveterate instinct " with which his stories " keep conforming to the ' scenic ' law " and he adds , " Going over the pages here placed together has been for me , quite to watch the scenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly , quite rhythmically recurs . ... " He speaks elsewhere of the " charm of the scenic consistency , " of " those scenic conditions which are as near an approach to the dramatic as the novel may permit itself , " of " the blest operation ... of my Dramatic principle , my law of successive Aspects . ... " Time and time again , seeking to reassure himself , he wondered whether the dramatic effort had really been worth while . With the passage of years the conviction grew that it had been his salvation . One day in 1895 , when the hurt was still great , he wrote : " Is the beauty of all that effort  --  of all those unutterable hours  --  lost forever ? Lost , lost , lost ? It will take a greater patience than the others to see ! " A moment before he had written , " How a click of perception ... brings back to me all the strange sacred time of my thinking-out , this way , pen in hand , of the stuff of my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working of the old passion . The old problems and dimnesses  --  the old solutions and little findings of light . ... " Six years later , when he was launched in the writing of his three final novels , he set down in his notebook the germ for a story ( May 23 , 1901 ) and added : " How , after a long intermission , the charm of this little subject-noting ... glimmers out to me again  --  lighting up for me something of the old divine light , rekindling the little old sacred possibilities , renewing the little link with the old sacred days . Oh , sacred days that are still somehow there  --  that it would be the golden gift and miracle , today , still to find not wasted ! " Eight years later he comes back to this again : A sense with me , divine and beautiful , of hooking on again to the ' sacred years ' of the old De Vere Gardens time , the years of the whole theatric dream and the ' working out ' sessions , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that still live again , somehow ( indeed I know how ! ) in their ashes . ... In retrospect the aches and pains and harsh struggles of the dramatic years slipped away and what remained was the beneficent memory of the positive good acquired in writing scenarios for his plays and working out , step by step , scene , character , action . For Henry James , the years devoted to the plays were always to be  --  since he now applied to the full the knowledge and method they gave him  --  the " strange sacred time " that had yielded the secret of " the sacred mystery of structure , " the " old sacred days "  --  and finally " the sacred years . " THE " TRADE " RESUMED The later  --  the final  --  phase of Henry James 's dramatic work occurred toward the end of his life and was a much less disturbing episode than the struggle of the 1890 's . It had none of the earlier desperation ; there was now no fluttering rise and fall of hope , no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was neither besieging the theatre nor besieged by it . He was older , less sanguine of success . Opportunity came his way to write some plays . He embraced it . Nevertheless , the circumstances which caused him to take this last fling at a form he had so firmly renounced were not unlike those which originally contributed to his dramatic years . Panic had seized him then , when he discovered his literary fortunes were waning , and a compulsive need to assert himself in the world had pushed him into his theatrical adventures . Now the pattern recurred . After the turn of the century , Henry James had revisited the United States following a twenty-year absence . He had been feted , interviewed , lionized ; he lectured on Balzac and the American Speech to large audiences ; the sales of his books increased . With such circumstances to aid , self-confidence , induced by the universal respect and appreciation he commanded , mounted , and James signed a contract with Scribner 's for the publication of an edition of his collected novels and tales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty volumes , it was decided that James should define the limits of his work , selecting only such fiction as he considered to possess " definitive " value . It was agreed that the edition would run to twenty-three volumes  --  perhaps because Balzac 's dition Dfinitive had that number  --  but it overflowed into a twenty-fourth . James grouped his tales after the manner of Balzac , according to theme and subject , and wrote a series of analytical and autobiographical prefaces . He revised large segments of his early work and rewrote passages in others , determined to have the edition speak for the mature artist rather than his younger self . It was as if he were rewriting his life . He labored for three years over his edition and , when it had been completed and was appearing volume after volume , he learned that it was having an extremely limited sale . He had offered the world his lifetime of work , or what he deemed to be the quintessential portion of it , only to discover once again , and for the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Guy Domville was repeated here , in attenuated form . He was in a mood , therefore , to be receptive to the overtures now made to him by the theatre . In 1907 , at the request of Johnston Forbes-Robertson , Henry James converted Covering End  --  originally the one-act Summersoft  --  into the three-act High Bid . The play was given for a series of matinees and received warm praise in the press . The British theatre , now seeing in the novelist a potential playwright , came knocking at his door . Sir James Barrie urged Charles Frohman to include a James play in a repertory season Frohman was planning at the Duke of York 's Theatre and the novelist was , in due course , asked ( along with Shaw and Galsworthy ) to contribute a work . There came also to Henry James the Anglo-Irish poet-scholar , Herbert Trench , asking for a play for his new repertory theatre at the Haymarket . It took very little to persuade James that perhaps this time the British theatre was ready for him . There was every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elapsed since Guy Domville had witnessed a series of far-reaching changes : Ibsen had blown away the cobwebs of the Victorian stage , his cause by now had been fought and won . Oscar Wilde had brought wit back to the stage and Bernard Shaw had added ideas to the wit . Audiences which had formerly come to the theatre to be entertained now came to be stimulated intellectually as well . Arthur Pinero and Henry Arthur Jones had demonstrated that the British public was willing to see " serious " drama and Harley Granville-Barker had shown as actor , playwright , producer and manager that the stage could advantageously embrace both art and scholarship and attract a wide public . The British theatre still lacked many things and was far from satisfying the fastidious Henry James , but an encouraging trend had set in . The novelist , despite his prolonged absences from London , had maintained a constant interest in the theatre . On his occasional trips to the city from his Sussex retreat , he invariably took in a play or two , often , in later years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Gregory , Jocelyn Persse , who was very much in the social world from which James had withdrawn . His letters to Persse between 1905 and 1909 discuss dates to see such plays as Man and Superman , Major Barbara , The Doctor 's Dilemma , Lady Windermere 's Fan , Granville-Barker 's The Voysey Inheritance and others . James settled down through 1908 and 1909 to write plays again even while he was dictating his final prefaces and correcting final proof for the Definitive Edition . He had begun to dictate his work during 1896 and by now was addicted to his " remingtonese . " His plays , however , were drafted by hand , and dictated from the draft . What is striking in this second phase is his choice of subject when compared with the themes of the dramatic years . With the exception of The American , which had been a novel , and Guy Domville , which treated a psychological conflict , he had sought largely to be entertaining on a superficial level . The plays of the second phase are impregnated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched lightly at moments with what we would now call " social consciousness , " as if James were making a bid for the audiences of Shaw , Galsworthy and Granville-Barker . There is substance in the comedy of The High Bid with its young reforming " passionate , pledged Radical " hero , and this is true of the " highly contemporaneous " Outcry written for Frohman . His one-act The Saloon dramatizes the problems of a young conscientious objector , a thoroughly Shavian theme ( which led to a pointed exchange of letters with Shaw , now published for the first time ) . The Other House , the drama written for Trench , is a psychological " shocker " that at the same time has in it all the qualities of an Ibsen play and a heroine derived from Hedda Gabler or Rosmersholm . He also resumed work on his abandoned plan for the dramatization of his short story The Chaperon , which , had he completed it , would have yielded an ironic social satire . Thus it can be said that in the second dramatic phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realities and with a genuine desire to treat material he deemed pertinent to the times . Of the plays written during these two years only The High Bid and The Saloon were produced and the worries over the plays , combined with the shock over the failure of the Definitive Edition , together with a growing morbid fear that he was suffering from a heart ailment  --  of which his doctor in Harley Street could find no sign  --  brought on a nervous illness and deep depression . In the 1890 's he had escaped physical illness by writing out his fears and anxieties in a series of play-like novels , ghostly tales and autobiographical stories . Now , however , he was old and tired , unable to meet the challenge of public neglect . Only the rude shock of the much more serious illness of his older brother diverted attention from his own troubled state of mind . He journeyed with William James to Bad Nauheim for the " cure , " and then crossed the Atlantic with him to Chocorua in New Hampshire . His play-production plans collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart for them now in any event . William 's death in August 1910 plunged him into deep mourning , but at the same time shattered the spell of self-absorption , and opened avenues for memory of family history that set him to the writing of reminiscences during the next four years . After that was to come the greatest shock of all  --  1914 . TERMINATIONS And thus it was that in the early morning hours of January 4 , 1910 , in scrawling the notes that ultimately shaped themselves into The Ivory Tower , Henry James set down those words which were our point of departure and which also constitute our termination ... I come back yet again and again , to my only seeing it in the dramatic way  --  as I can only see everything and anything now . ... The closer he got to his " dramatic way " he told himself  --  by which he meant the method of the scenario and the application of the scenic method  --  " the closer I get to the problem of the application of it in any particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the more doubts and torments fall away from me , the more I know where I am , the more everything spreads and shines and draws me on and I 'm justified of my logic and my passion . ... " Causons , causons , mon bon  --  oh celestial , soothing , sanctifying process , with all the high sane forces of the sacred time fighting , through it , on my side ! Let me fumble it gently and patiently out  --  with fever and fidget laid to rest  --  as in all the old enchanted months ! It only looms , it only shines and shimmers , too beautiful and too interesting ; it only hangs there too rich and too full and with too much to give and to pay ; it only presents itself too admirably and too vividly , too straight and square and vivid , as a little organic and effective Action . Celestial , soothing , sanctifying process ! The dramatic years  --  the sacred years  --  had yielded their full harvest , and not so much in the plays ( although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might produce in a lifetime ) as in the consequences for his fiction arising from their creation . It would be inaccurate to dismiss the plays themselves as having served only as a school of experience for the final works , the so-called " major phase . " So qualified an authority as Bernard Shaw has described the earlier plays as stageworthy , while rejecting the later works as cast in a dialogue " inhumanly literary " ; while , on the other hand , the equally authoritative Granville-Barker considered the later works , particularly The Outcry , to be as manageable as a Restoration play or a play of Chekhov 's . Guy Domville , during its brief existence , was praised alike for its cadenced dialogue and for the human situation it dramatized . Most critics have recognized the high dramatic qualities residing in the plays , as indeed in all the work , of James . These plays are thus more than literary curiosities . They must be read in the light of the theatre for which they were written and the audience for which they were intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's creative life . They can be read  --  some of them  --  for intrinsic merit , for some of their scenes of high comedy , for the drollery or depth of the characterizations , for the intensity of the drama . They represent , in especial for students of the dramatic form , a picture of a highly-cultivated mind at grip with the problem of re-producing life within the proscenium-frame and , as James so often put it , in a civilization in which entertainment must be provided between dinner and the suburban trains . Above all they are part of a very human and a very touching story  --  that of a writer stumbling and searching , with obstinate passion , to win success on the stage and then , after a series of painful defeats due in large measure to an inability to face the realities of the theatre , wresting from his failures a final and a major victory , finding in the scenic method the salvation that enabled him to pursue his art and arrive at those discoveries which mark him out as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S FOREWORD Henry James had been writing criticism and short stories for five years when Pyramus and Thisbe  --  his first dramatic composition to be printed  --  appeared in the April 1869 issue of the Galaxy . The future novelist was twenty-six and had left the United States a few weeks earlier on his first adult voyage to Europe . When the piece appeared he was in London , in Half Moon Street , engaged in the " alluring and beguiling " rediscovery of England he was later to record in his autobiographical fragment , The Middle Years . A letter from Cambridge , from his brother William , told him : " Galaxy got yesterday , and your thing reads very well . Better than when you read it to me . Father says , ' Harry has decidedly got a gift . ' " Aside from Henry James 's long-standing interest in the drama and his determination to write plays some day , we have no way of knowing what prompted him to produce this little dialogue at this particular time . He has spoken of the year which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explorations , initiations , " and Pyramus and Thisbe may well be characterized as an exploration . He had spent the greater part of his early writing years in Cambridge and shortly before sailing had complained that he was bored by the lack of distraction and social life . His brother William had been abroad and he was eager himself to quit the parental roof and venture forth into the world . The boarding house picture evoked in this playlet is one we find elsewhere in his work . He was himself a veteran of the European pension and when he set his hero of The Bostonians , Basil Ransom , in New York it was in a similar house with the pleasant and distracting company of a fellow boarder , a variety actress . The title , Pyramus and Thisbe , fairly obviously , was derived not from James 's reading of the classics but from the play within a play in A Midsummer Night 's Dream . He had seen it many times and he was to draw upon it on other occasions . A NOTE ON THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over a period of two decades , the editor was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . The corrections and emendations were such as occur in the progress of a modern play from the dramatist 's desk , through the production office into the theatre . James was called upon to revise his plays many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays , nor the textual problems arising from collation , warranted such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  that is of truth , fidelity to text and to the writer 's intentions  --  while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve : that of demonstrating their role in Henry James 's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some producer might be caught in the process  --  provide the means for the appearance of at least some of them on the American stage . I therefore directed my editing to this end . It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of the London production , two of them from James 's own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors . It was thus possible to give the mutations of James 's first important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As regards the other plays , a simple principle was applied . Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the cuts restored ; in a few minor instances there were cuts followed by alterations and where these were in James 's hand they were accepted as his final reading ; where there were simply cuts , these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable , the alternate readings have been given . There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons ' typescripts of the play , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text as actually performed on the stage in 1909 , which James had approved , despite a number of alterations and cuts . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed ; as the short story Covering End and in the final form it took when it reached the stage . While James went over most of the manuscripts of his plays , making corrections and verbal changes , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's alternately referring to " Valentin " and " Valentine " are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization . In some of the texts the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been spelled out as an aid to readability . Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips 's Bibliography of the Writings of Henry James ( New York , 1930 ) , pp. 26-27 , 46-47 and 115-16 .

Enter CATHERINE , in walking-dress , with a roll of music in her hand . CATHERINE . Dear me ! this dreadful smell of tobacco again !

Pshaw ! it 's worse with the window shut than with it open . If I 'm doomed to suffocate , I might as well do it comfortably . ( Raises the window violently . ) Of course he 'll hear that , too . ( Taking off her bonnet at the mirror . ) Heigho ! what a dreadful humor I 'm in ! And on my birthday , too ! Well , why should n't one be out of sorts on one 's birthday as well as at any other time ? Is it such a mighty privilege to have been born ?

It was actually as much as I could do to help throwing my slipper in good earnest against the wall . That would have been scandal , I suppose . But to lie tossing , and sighing , and listening to Mr. Young 's interminable sentences  --  it was all one sentence , I declare , from nine o'clock until three  --  and to wake up on your birthday with a headache , and a pale face , and hollow eyes  --  that , of course , is perfect propriety .

( Seats herself at the piano and plays with violence . While she is playing the door opens and STEPHEN YOUNG looks in . Seeing MISS WEST , he advances a few steps  --  leaving the door ajar  --  and stops a moment looking at her and listening . He carries a small bouquet in his hand . Finally he speaks . ) STEPHEN . Bravo ! bravo ! CATHERINE . ( Starting up . ) You , Mr. Young ! STEPHEN . Excuse me . If it was n't for my flowers I 'd clap you . CATHERINE . If it was n't for your flowers , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who let you in ? STEPHEN . I let myself in . I knocked three times , but you were playing with such extraordinary fury  --  CATHERINE . ( Archly . ) Oh , you can make yourself heard when you wish , Mr. Young ! STEPHEN . Now I verily believe that 's a reproach . CATHERINE . Of course it is . STEPHEN . Ah , my dear Miss West , two can play at that game . In the way of noise there 's not much , I fancy , to choose between us ; there 's six of one and  --  CATHERINE . I 'll admit that there are six of one , but certainly a dozen of the other  --  especially when there are two of you . STEPHEN . Bless my stars ! It 's no more than fair . You have your piano  --  I have my friend . CATHERINE . Your bass-drum , you might call him . STEPHEN . I assure you , he 's a very nice fellow . CATHERINE . I hope , for your sake , he is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . STEPHEN . Ah , poor Ellis ! Do you mean you actually heard us ? CATHERINE . Distinctly . I came near throwing something at the wall . STEPHEN . I doubt that we should have heard it , any more than you heard me just now . CATHERINE . Happily for you , it never would have occurred to me to walk in in person . STEPHEN . You would surely have been excusable if you had come on so harmless an errand as this of mine . ( Holds up his flowers . ) CATHERINE . Your flowers are very pretty . STEPHEN . They are none of mine . When I came in , a couple of hours ago , I found them in my room , on my table . You see they 've lost their first freshness . Here is a little card affixed , denoting their proper destination , which the messenger seems , through some extraordinary inadvertence , to have overlooked ; as if any one would send me flowers ! CATHERINE . ( Taking the bouquet and reading the card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. T. " I 'm much obliged to you for repairing the error . STEPHEN . I confess there is some virtue in it . To give a young lady a bouquet of your own making , or your own buying , is assuredly its own reward . But to serve as a mere bald go-between ; to present a bunch of lilies and roses on the part of another  --  a mysterious unknown  --  to act , as it were , as the senseless clod of earth in which they 're wrapped for transportation , and not as their thrilling , teeming , conscious parent soil , this , Miss West , I assure you , is to make a terrible sacrifice to vanity . CATHERINE . I appreciate the sacrifice , and I repeat my thanks . STEPHEN . I might have kept them , you know . CATHERINE . ( Placing the flowers in water . ) Nay , it would have been a pity to spoil them . STEPHEN . Spoil them ? What do you mean ? CATHERINE . ( Taking the bouquet out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should you call the prevailing odor ? STEPHEN . Geranium  --  heliotrope  --  jasmine , I should say . CATHERINE . I see your sense is completely blunted . STEPHEN . Why , what should you call it ? CATHERINE . ( Replacing the flowers . ) Tobacco , Mr. Young . Flowers are like women ; they do n't like you to smoke in their faces . STEPHEN . Dear me ! Do you really object to smoke ? CATHERINE . Object to it ? I hate it ! STEPHEN . And do you ever perceive my pipe ? CATHERINE . Constantly , Mr. Young . STEPHEN . Alas ! what a terrible neighbor I am ! I 'm extremely sorry ; but what can I do ? I strongly suspect that I ca n't give up talking , and I 'm profoundly convinced that I ca n't give up smoking . CATHERINE . Do n't for a moment suppose that I suggest any such abnegation . If I 'm uncomfortable there 's an easy remedy . STEPHEN . Exactly . Patience , my dear Miss West , comes just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transcendent virtue , only because , as you so truly say , it 's so easy . CATHERINE . You perfectly express my own sentiments . I regard patience as quite a secondary virtue . There 's another that I prize infinitely higher . STEPHEN . Oh , you go too far . CATHERINE . I mean action , Mr. Young . STEPHEN . The deuce ! You mean to seek a remedy in action ? CATHERINE . Oh , do n't be frightened . I mean nothing very terrible . I mean that I can move away and take another lodging . STEPHEN . Oh , that would never do . We must bear and forbear , Miss West . Without a few mutual concessions we shall find but little comfort in life . CATHERINE . That 's doubtless very true , Mr. Young ; but , really , are you quite the person to say it ? STEPHEN . Why , if it 's the truth , I certainly ca n't afford to let it pass . CATHERINE . Well , if it 's not impertinent , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . STEPHEN . Oh , to every one . CATHERINE . They say that every one is no one . STEPHEN . By no means . It includes , to begin with , my very next neighbor  --  yourself . CATHERINE . ( Laughing . ) Truly ? I 'm actually the object of your generosity ? Your charity , I might call it , since it begins so near home . I confess I never suspected it . STEPHEN . Well , Miss West , the fact is  --  CATHERINE . Alas ! what can the fact be ? STEPHEN . I hate music . CATHERINE . You hate music ! ( Laughing violently . ) STEPHEN . ( Provoked . ) I absolutely detest it . CATHERINE . Poor Mr. Young ! Well  --  I pity you . STEPHEN . You would pity me if you knew what I have suffered . CATHERINE . From my piano ? STEPHEN . From your piano . CATHERINE . ( After a pause . ) Decidedly , one of us must move . STEPHEN . One of us ? Good ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said just now that I should go . STEPHEN . That was propos of your own sufferings . CATHERINE . Well , in spite of yours , I still think I had better go . STEPHEN . I ought n't to consent to it . CATHERINE . ( Laughing . ) So you detest music , Mr. Young ? I do n't know why I should laugh ; I feel much more like crying . It 's too provoking . I protest I do n't understand it . I do n't see what such people are made of . STEPHEN . Of good flesh and blood , Miss West  --  CATHERINE . Yes , and not much else . STEPHEN . In that case , then , they have no tempers to lose . But what call under heaven have I to enjoy the strumming of a piano ? I make my bread , you know , by scribbling for the newspapers . Every morning , as I sit down to my table you sit down to that tuneful battery . The very first rattle of the keys is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maimed and tattered veterans  --  fall prostrate to the ground . I pick them up and dress their wounds , and coax them once more to the front . The battle rages generally some three or four hours . I deem myself very lucky if , at the end of that time , a small fraction of my little army have escaped with their lives . Once in awhile , in the afternoon , when the fire has subsided , one of the missing turns up . and comes limping back to camp . But , I confess , the whole temper of the service is so utterly demoralized that , instead of being shot for an arrant deserter , the rascal is welcomed like a prodigal son , and the calf that was being so tenderly fatted for the whole regiment is sacrificed to this poor makeshift of a hero . CATHERINE . The meaning of all this is that you ca n't write except in absolute silence . STEPHEN . Why , there 's something between absolute silence and  --  absolute sound . CATHERINE . I should like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very kind of you to say so , after my attack on your music . CATHERINE . Oh , you make it out to be so bad that I speak from curiosity . STEPHEN . At any rate it would not be very pleasant for you to reflect that it 's your own fault that it 's no better . CATHERINE . Whose fault is it , Mr. Young , that you 're no wiser ? STEPHEN . Well , I 'm as heaven made me ; we 're all of us that ; and heaven made me , as I say , to hate a piano . CATHERINE . ( Out of patience . ) Oh , it 's my opinion that heaven did n't make you at all ! Upon my word , you deserve that I should sit here forever and thump out music from morning till night . STEPHEN . Is that a threat ? CATHERINE . Take it as you please . STEPHEN . I take it as a declaration of war ; of course in that case I shall choose my own arms . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , my comfort 's gone in advance . What comfort shall I have in playing for your annoyance , when I think that I might be playing for my own pleasure ? But my revenge will remain . STEPHEN . Heaven help us , it will be a hard fight . CATHERINE . Another Waterloo , I assure you . Within a fortnight I shall look for your retreat . STEPHEN . Oh , I sha n't give you more than a week . CATHERINE . I must make the most of time , then ! Quick , to your own lines . I mean to open fire . ( She runs to the piano , seats herself , and begins to play furiously . STEPHEN claps his hands to his ears and hurries out . CATHERINE continues to play for several moments , and then in the midst of a movement suddenly stops short . ) I wonder whether my playing really disturbs him , or whether he invented it all in return for my complaint of his talking and smoking  --  surely it was n't the best taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles . If they are a real annoyance , all I have to do is to hold my tongue and change my quarters . I certainly have no right to ask favors of Mr. Young , and I should be very sorry to find myself in his debt . ( Leaving the piano . ) I 'll just quietly move away ; I can easily find a better room . This one has a dozen inconveniences ; it 's out of the way , and it 's up too high . And yet I 'm attached to the old place . When you 've occupied a room for five years you seem to have made over a portion of your innermost self to its keeping . It knows you so well ; it has all your secrets , and there 's no getting them back either ; if you go away you leave them for others . I feel as if I had grown up between these four walls . Here I came after my mother died ; here I 've learned to know myself , and , thinking over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I do know it , the world ; here I 've tasted both the bitterness and the sweetness of solitude  --  all the more reason , by the way , for my not resenting poor Mr. Young 's proximity . What on earth has got into me ? I came in from the street with my senses thrilling with the whispery and perfumes of spring ; I cross the threshold and happen to catch a whiff of my neighbor 's cigar  --  a puff of harmless incense to the season  --  and straightway I fall into a passion . Decidedly , I 've made a fool of myself , and to save my dignity I must decamp . As for this dingy old chamber , I hate it . I shall go and begin life afresh somewhere else . I wonder what Mr. Young means to do ? What can he do ? I 'm curious to see . If he really suffers from my piano , I have the advantage . It 's not his fault , after all , if he objects to music . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really pleasanter though , under the circumstances , than if he happened to have a passion for it . When I play , I feel , I think , I talk , I express my moods , my fancies , my regrets , my desires . I can imagine nothing more disagreeable than to know that some totally superfluous little gentleman may be sitting behind that partition , deciphering my notes and very possibly enjoying them  --  that I am treating his worship , in short , to a perpetual serenade ! I 'm spared that annoyance , at any rate ! And yet  --  and yet  --  and yet I confess that there would be a harmless sweetness in having , once in a while , some other auditor than Susie , and Jennie , and Josie . But what 's this ? ( Going to the table . ) How came it here ? ( Takes up a small parcel . ) " Stephen Young , Esq . " He ca n't have left it here ; he brought in nothing but the flowers . Pah ! it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without loss of time . ( Goes to her door and calls into the entry . ) Mr. Young . ( A pause . ) Mr. Young ! STEPHEN . ( Without . ) At your service , madam ! ( CATHERINE returns and replaces the package on the table ; STEPHEN reappears with an open letter in his hand . ) No proposals for a compromise , I hope ! CATHERINE . ( Pointing to the package . ) Be so good as to possess yourself of your own property . How it came here I 'm at loss to say . STEPHEN . Why , it 's evident ; your flowers and my tobacco arrived together . The young woman who brought them up committed the pardonable error of giving you my parcel , and me yours . CATHERINE . Pardonable ! It 's easy for you to say . STEPHEN . Perfectly so , inasmuch as it has given me a pretext for another visit . CATHERINE . You 're reading a letter . I 'm sorry to have interrupted you . STEPHEN . The interruption is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like King and Emperor in the middle ages . They prepare with a great flourish and rumpus to knock each other 's heads off , when up comes the Pope and knocks off their crowns , without which , of course , their heads are worthless . This letter is the Pope 's bull . CATHERINE . What on earth do you mean ? STEPHEN . Our good landlord is the Pope . May I request your attention for five minutes ? This morning , as I went out , I deposited below the amount of my monthly bill , which had been some days due . This answer has just been put into my hands . ( Reads . ) " My dear Mr. Young , I return your bill receipted , with thanks . I take this occasion to make a communication which I have been for some time contemplating , and which it is important you should receive without further delay . I have just sold my house to a party who proposes to convert the ground-floor into a store , and the upper portion into offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my present lodgers . As I have granted immediate occupation I shall be able to allow them to continue or to renew their present leases only to three weeks from this date ; namely , to the fifth of May . I have little doubt but that in this interval , my rooms all being let singly , they will find other quarters . I shall immediately advise them to this effect . Yours , etc . " What do you think of that ? CATHERINE . Think , Mr. Young ? Why , it 's horrible , monstrous ! STEPHEN . Man proposes , but landlords dispose . I 'm very much afraid we shall have to make peace , in spite of ourselves . CATHERINE . Peace ? Oh , I shall know nothing of peace until I find another resting place . It 's very hard to have to leave this old room . STEPHEN . I had no idea you were so fond of it . CATHERINE . I beg you to believe that I am fond of it . It 's very unreasonable , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely disagreeable , but , nevertheless , I like it , and I do n't choose to be swept out like old rubbish in a housecleaning . STEPHEN . The room in itself , or rather , perhaps , in something that is n't exactly itself , is charming . If you were only to see mine ! CATHERINE . For a man , it 's different . You have only to stuff a few clothes into a valise and to take it in your hand and march off in search of fortune . STEPHEN . You put it rather strong , perhaps  --  the independence of men . Nevertheless , I confess that , compared with you , I can transplant myself with but little trouble . I have no piano , no sofa , no pictures , no curtains , no little work-tables , or other gimcracks . CATHERINE . I declare , I could sit down and cry . ( Seats herself . ) STEPHEN . Oh , come , do n't say that , or I shall begin to entertain feelings with regard to our wronger which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the penalties of the law . Perhaps I 'd better not have read you the letter . CATHERINE . It was as well to hear it from you as from that  --  that wretch ! STEPHEN . To-morrow , probably , he 'll give you warning . CATHERINE . I shall have gained a day , at any rate , or lost one ; I hardly know which . STEPHEN . How , lost one ? CATHERINE . Well , if you wish particularly to know , to-day is my birthday . STEPHEN . Ah , yes . Well ? CATHERINE . Well , that 's all . STEPHEN . Ah , I see , and I 've spoiled it by that detestable piece of news . CATHERINE . Oh , there was little enough to spoil , after all . STEPHEN . ( After a pause . ) Ah , so to-day 's your birthday ! CATHERINE . Dear me , it 's a nice time to talk about birthdays . STEPHEN . That accounts , of course , for those flowers . CATHERINE . Exactly ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I might have guessed at something of the sort . CATHERINE . Something of the sort ! You 're not very polite . How many anniversaries do you think I keep ? STEPHEN . Upon my word , if I had known this was your birthday I would n't have read you that letter . CATHERINE . The letter was better than nothing . Besides , it is a rule that my birthdays should be the grimmest possible reminders of mortality . Last year I was laid up with a sick headache ; the year before I lost my best pupil , who dismissed me in a polite little note ; the year before my chimney caught fire  --  this very chimney . It was a late cold spring , you remember ; we had fires into June ; I was sitting here alone ; I heaped on the coal , for company 's sake . In half an hour , I assure you , I had company enough  --  the landlord , all the lodgers , a dozen firemen , and three or four policemen . That was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through everything in this little room . What was it the year before that ? CATHERINE . That year I had no birthday . My mother died . After that , I came here . STEPHEN . That was threeFootnote : 1Kb years ago . You must have been lonely . CATHERINE . At first I was lonely , indeed . Then I began to get lessons , and I had no time . Only sometimes in the evening I missed a few old associations ; and now I have got used to it . STEPHEN . There 's nothing you miss , then ? CATHERINE . Nothing  --  nothing , at least , that I have ever had . STEPHEN . You 're contented , then . I 'll be hanged if I am ! O happy woman ! CATHERINE . O stupid man ! There 's a difference between missing the past and longing for the future . We get used to being without the things that have passed away ; we never get used to being without the things that have not yet come ; we end by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of these ; and , as regards them at least , we are never contented . STEPHEN . Why , you 're quite a philosopher ! ( Hesitates a moment and then seats himself . ) CATHERINE . ( Rising . ) You 'll admit that I need to be a philosopher with such a landlord ! ( Moves out a small table , takes a cloth from the drawer and lays it . ) STEPHEN . What are you going to do now ? CATHERINE . I 'm going , by your leave , to have my tea . STEPHEN . Ah , yes , by all means ; even a philosopher must eat . Do you actually make your tea this way every evening ? CATHERINE . ( Smiling . ) Actually . Tea is n't a thing one has by fits and starts . STEPHEN . It 's something I never have at all . I dine at six , at an eating-house , where I take a cup of very bad coffee . But I have n't really sat down to tea since  --  since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a school where I give lessons . After running about all the afternoon , of course by this hour I 'm quite ready for this little ceremony . It 's very pleasant to be able at last to have tea by daylight . STEPHEN . So I suppose ; just as it 's disagreeable not to be able to dine by lamplight . CATHERINE . Ah , me ! to dine by lamplight is the dream of my life ; but I suppose I shall never do it till I 'm old and rich . STEPHEN . As the days grow longer I put off my dinner . In fact , I have n't dined yet . CATHERINE . ( Laughing . ) Good heaven ! what a life ! ( During the above , she has been passing to and fro between the cupboard and the table , setting out the articles necessary for tea . Among other things , she has placed a small kettle , and kindled the lamp beneath it . ) STEPHEN . It 's certain that at my eating-house they do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make it up by other things . Ah , there 's a little hole in the middle ! STEPHEN . The great Goethe has wisely remarked that man loves freedom and woman order . CATHERINE . I 'll cover it up with my bouquet . ( Places the vase of flowers . ) What do you say about Goethe ? STEPHEN . I knew you were going to do something with those flowers . CATHERINE . It was knowledge easily gained . Do n't look at the kettle , now , or it wo n't boil . STEPHEN . Of course I 'll not look at the kettle when I can look at you . What are you going to have for tea ? CATHERINE . Nothing to speak of ; bread and butter . There 's at least an hour of daylight left ; if you are very hungry , you are welcome to share of my loaf , en attendant your dinner . STEPHEN . Oh , I 'm terribly hungry . CATHERINE . Dear me , if it 's as bad as that you 'd better go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like sardines ? STEPHEN . Particularly . CATHERINE . And guava jelly ? STEPHEN . Extravagantly . CATHERINE . Well , then , perhaps we can blunt the edge of your voracity . ( Returns to the cupboard and takes out a box of sardines and a pot of guava jelly . ) STEPHEN . Ah , the kettle boils . CATHERINE . ( Setting down the above . ) Be so good , then , as to move your chair up to the table . Luckily , I have things for two . ( Lays cup and saucer , plate , etc . ) STEPHEN . I suppose that once in a while you have a visitor . CATHERINE . ( Seated . ) No one but the cat . You must excuse it , but that 's the cat 's saucer . Frequently , in the evening , she comes up to drink tea with me . I make her a dish of it just as I do for myself , and she sips it up like a perfect lady . When I move I must have a cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete . STEPHEN . Good heaven ! if that 's all you need to feel complete  --  CATHERINE . How do you like your tea ? STEPHEN . Strong , please  --  as strong as Samson unshorn . CATHERINE . You mean by that , I suppose , that you want neither cream nor sugar ? STEPHEN . Cream and sugar are the wiles of Delilah . CATHERINE . I must say , then , that Delilah is a much-abused person . STEPHEN . It 's no more than natural that you should stand up for her . You yourself , Miss West  --  CATHERINE . Very well  --  I myself  --  ( Laughing . ) I declare I believe you want me to compare you to Samson . But , I assure you , my respect for the sacred legends of Scripture forbids me to do it . STEPHEN . Do n't laugh at me now , or I shall pull down the roof on your head . CATHERINE . propos of pulling down roofs , our charming landlord is the man to claim the title . Oh , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to my idea . Delilah was , of course , a very charming woman . To begin with , you and she have that in common . CATHERINE . Granted . Pursue your argument . STEPHEN . Well , the long and short of it is that you , being , as I say , a charming woman , here I sit breaking your bread and drinking your tea , as if we were the best friends in the world . CATHERINE . I must say that you 're a very weak Samson . I 've treated you with no more than common decency . I could n't do less than ask you to have a cup of tea . STEPHEN . No , thank heaven , that you could n't ; but , you know , we had so fiercely resolved , in our future intercourse , to violate the commonest civilities ; and then I hated you so ! CATHERINE . From the moment that a term was so suddenly set to our acquaintance , it seemed a great relief to throw those troublesome resolutions overboard . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the inspiration of hatred . STEPHEN . Really , then , I hardly know whether your implacable attitude was the more or the less to your credit . CATHERINE . Implacable ? You use hard words ; not that I admit , however , that I was not quite right . STEPHEN . Oh , it was very becoming . Of course you felt no sordid human passion . You figured simply your divine protectress  --  the canonized Muse  --  outraged , insulted , discredited ; but cold , relentless and dispassionate . I confess that I felt a good earthly spite . CATHERINE . I forgive you . Your cause needed it . After all , this new turn of events has saved us some confusion . STEPHEN . One of us , certainly . CATHERINE . Well , one of us , if you will . There could have been no graceful termination to our quarrel . And so farewell to the whole business . STEPHEN . Farewell ! You pronounce the word with singular unction . CATHERINE . I know but one way of pronouncing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor next time ; some unappreciated Mozart , some undeveloped Rossini . CATHERINE . I 'm much obliged to you for your wishes , but my own are very different . I had rather have no neighbor at all . It 's much simpler . STEPHEN . I 'm quite of your mind . So long as contiguity subsists the parties are bitter enemies , and when they come to part they find suddenly that they are great friends . If I could afford it , I should go and take a house and occupy it alone . Failing that , I do n't know what 's left for me but to perch like St. Simeon on the summit of some lonely column . CATHERINE . I shall go to work to-morrow , and if I do n't find a lodging before the sun goes down , I shall consent to pass for a very silly creature . I shall not stay here a moment longer than I can help . STEPHEN . I applaud your spirit . I shall do as much . We can perhaps be of some assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apartments that are far too nice for such as me . I will note them down and hand you the list . You , on the other hand , will see a great many that you could never think of occupying ; you can give me a hint of their whereabouts . CATHERINE . I had no idea there was that vast difference in our needs . STEPHEN . Ah , nothing is too nice for you , Miss West . CATHERINE . Come , you 're extravagant . STEPHEN . And nothing too rough , too dingy , too common for me . CATHERINE . Oh , do favor me with a reason for this wild antithesis ! STEPHEN . Why , you see , during this half hour that I 've been spending in your room , I 've gradually become penetrated with the spirit of the place  --  the simple elegance , the unerring good taste that lurks in the disposition of every little ornament , in every fold of drapery . There is n't a thing  --  down to the very piano  --  that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Young , you have a brilliant imagination . STEPHEN . You would n't say so if you were to see the musty , dusty , absolutely naked little hole on the other side of that wall , in which I spend my days and nights . In the middle , a rickety table , with a book under one foot to keep it steady , littered with the direst confusion of dust-covered books and papers , and literally constellated with an infinite diversity of ink blots . A row of bookshelves , with the books thrust in any way but the right way ; a cane-seated armchair , a stuffed ditto , a stove , a bed , a washstand , a trunk , a window , four walls , a ceiling and a floor . There you have a complete inventory ; that is , it would be complete if I could represent , by any form of words , the lonely , grimy , dingy , **28;101;TOOLONG expression of the whole place ! CATHERINE . You have what you need , I suppose . Men 's and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inveterate gad-a-bouts , are essentially stay-at-home creatures . Even wretched , shiftless peripatetics like myself cherish a secret ideal of domesticity . I may tramp about half the day , from house to house , but I like to think that I have a little sanctuary at home where I may hang up a few votive knick-knacks to the household gods . This little room is the home of my fancy ; it wants no wider field ; it calls its guests sometimes from a distance , but it never goes beyond the threshold to meet them . With you it 's quite another matter . A man living alone , as you do , ca n't make a home ; he ca n't live in his shell ; he has only one foot at his fireside , the other is in the world . STEPHEN . One foot here  --  one foot a mile off ! You 'll admit that it 's a deucedly uncomfortable position . CATHERINE . ( Laughing . ) I do n't pretend to deny it . Nevertheless , I declare I mortally despise a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on four pins ; who has all his little properties neatly brushed and ticketed and classified . There 's nothing I admire so much as a certain generous disorder ! STEPHEN . Heavenly power ! If you only knew me how much you would admire me ! It 's a very happy arrangement , by the way , this exquisite human faculty of admiration . How it amplifies the soul !  --  how it doubles one 's existence ! Personally , as you say  --  as I see for myself  --  you 're the very patron saint of neatness and elegance ; you make cleanliness picturesque ; you make symmetry natural . And yet , seated in the midst of your native paradise , you bestow an approving smile on the dreary chaos of my unblessed existence . And so , on my side , from the depths of that chaos , I gaze in wonder and worship on the unforced harmony , the tranquil comfort which you shed upon your pathway , and which encircles you with a gentle radiance like that of some wholesome daylight saint . CATHERINE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most natural to us , and which from long usage have lost every vestige of mystery and charm , and have become as flat and cold as the muffins of this morning 's breakfast , should be the very points of attraction to the minds of others , and appear to them as bright and blooming as untrodden islands . Ah , Mr. Young , I 'm dismally prosaic , if you only knew me . STEPHEN . I have a passion for good prose . I 've swallowed in my time an amount of indifferent verse ! CATHERINE . I declare I 'm quite tired of myself and my lonely , fussy little virtues . Do knock over something and break it , Mr. Young ! STEPHEN . Willingly ; if on my side I could only bespeak the touch of those helping , healing hands ! CATHERINE . ( Rising . ) By the way , it 's one of my virtues not to leave my table standing a moment after I 've had my tea . If you 'll be so good as to rise . STEPHEN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll break it . CATHERINE . Gladly , it 's very ugly . ( Takes out the bouquet and offers the vase . ) STEPHEN . Oh , I mean the flowers themselves . CATHERINE . Ah , barbarian ! is that the way you understand me ? STEPHEN . Now do n't tell me I 've made a great mistake . CATHERINE . It certainly is a mistake to suppose that a woman will ever submit to see flowers wantonly destroyed  --  unless when , for some good reason , she destroys them herself . STEPHEN . There 's an excellent reason why you should do me a favor . CATHERINE . What is the favor , pray ? STEPHEN . Throw that bouquet out of the window . CATHERINE . Dear me ! is that all ? And what is the reason ? STEPHEN . That I particularly desire it . CATHERINE . They are quite worthy of each other . The favor must be less , Mr. Young , or the reason greater . STEPHEN . Tell me , then , who sent you the bouquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll satisfy you ! Hem ! a very dear young friend . STEPHEN . Do you call that satisfying me ? CATHERINE . Upon my word , you 're very exacting . STEPHEN . And you , Miss West , are very exasperating ! CATHERINE . Good , so our quarrel is open again ! STEPHEN . ( Very serious . ) I assure you , as far as I 'm concerned , it has never been closed . CATHERINE . Just as you please . I have no time for such trifles now . I have a heavy care on my mind and a long day 's work on my hands . STEPHEN . ( With energy . ) By Heaven ! I could positively howl when I hear you talk so . CATHERINE . My talk , it seems to me , is quite as reasonable as yours . STEPHEN . Doubtless , and your feelings even more so . CATHERINE . Farewell , Mr. Young . STEPHEN . ( After a pause , looking at her . ) You said just now that there is but one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . CATHERINE . Very well , I excuse you . STEPHEN . The best way is not to try it ; I 'm sure I should break down . In the name of pity , do n't you understand me ? CATHERINE . Not in the least . In one word , are we friends or enemies ? STEPHEN . I wish to heaven I could say we were neither . CATHERINE . Come , Mr. Young , you 're foolish . STEPHEN . Desperately so , I 'm a lover . CATHERINE . Oh , oh ! STEPHEN . Of course , you do n't believe it . CATHERINE . Of course ? ( A pause . ) Excuse me , you 're no lover . STEPHEN . Of course you do , then . CATHERINE . Worse and worse . STEPHEN . Confound it ! Perhaps you do , perhaps you do n't ! CATHERINE . ( After a pause . ) Perhaps I do . You 'll excuse me if I 'm not perfectly sure . The events of the last hour  --  STEPHEN . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof conclusive of my passion . I 've known for the last month that it is a passion , but only this evening have I read it aright . The sunlight of your presence has cleared up my misty doubts , my dusky illusions . Now , that there is a menace in the air of my losing you , I see that that troubling , tuneful presence , which I took to be the torment of my life , was , in truth , its motive and its delight . I assure you I thought of you far more than your music warranted . We need some other explanation . Do accept this one  --  that I love you with all my soul . CATHERINE . ( Smiling . ) It 's very true that , considering that that 's a good stout wall , we have been singularly conscious of each other 's  --  idiosyncracies . STEPHEN . Divinely conscious ! CATHERINE . I must say , however , that it 's a pity you have such an aversion to a piano . STEPHEN . My dear Catherine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn your leaves . By the way , you 'll perhaps get used to my smoking . CATHERINE . You best of men ! I promise to light your cigar . STEPHEN . Ah , life will be too sweet . But now that I 've stepped into authority , I demand as a right that you tell me the history of that nosegay . CATHERINE . Why , like that of Viola 's love , in " Twelfth Night , " it 's well nigh " a blank , my lord ! " It was sent me as a birthday token by a pupil , a very good little girl of ten . STEPHEN . Bless her kind little heart ! Well , my dear , you may keep it as a farewell .

PAGE 37 First play at the Thtre Franais : In his 1877 essay on the Thtre Franais HJ says he saw Regnier but once " ... the first time I ever went to the Thtre Franais . He played Don Annibal in mile Augier 's romantic comedy of L'Aventurire . " In his essay on Coquelin , Century Magazine ( Jan. , 1887 ) , HJ begins : " It was nearly seventeen years ago and the first time that the writer ... had taken his seat in that temple of the drama . ... The spectator ... felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening M. Coquelin was revealed to him in Lions et Renards . ... " It is clear therefore that he saw a play by Augier ; and it is possible that in 1877 his memory would have been more accurate . Since Coquelin played in both L'Aventurire and Lions et Renards , James may have confused the two productions .

James considered an author 's journal to be the record of day-by-day trivia or such incidents as he wished to note for future reference . The notebook served the more specific function of the " working out pen in hand " of stories he was writing or planned to write .

Used by permission of Oxford University Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 27 , 1893 Henry James , freshly arrived in London from a trip to the Continent , went to the St. James 's Theatre to attend the first night of a new play by Arthur Pinero , The Second Mrs. Tanqueray . He was sufficiently excited by it to write to Pinero the next morning that the occasion had been " momentous . " It is easy to see why . Aside from the strength and honesty of the play itself , in a theatre addicted to the " time-honored bread-sauce of the happy ending , " it dealt with a woman " with a past , " in highly dramatic terms and was played with remarkable intensity by Mrs. Patrick Campbell . James , who had treated such a woman in The Siege of London and in Tenants , who had , moreover , been fascinated by the demi-mondaines of Dumas fils , found much in Paula Tanqueray to interest him . He had just published , in a volume of short stories entitled The Real Thing , a social-satirical tale of such a woman and her daughter entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , " Pinero wrote in reply to James 's letter of praise , " that in The Chaperon you have the germ of a fine comedy for the theatre . " James immediately asked himself in his notebook " Is there a subject for comedy  --  for a pretty three-act comedy  --  latent in The Chaperon ? " The note which follows was not included in The Notebooks of Henry James and is published here for the first time . It was written on pages torn from a scribbler and since it ends in the middle of a sentence it seems quite likely that it came from one of the notebooks James had destroyed . The note owes its preservation to the fact that James intended to write the play , and he did in fact , fourteen years after this original jotting , begin an extended scenario ( see page 609 ) which he never completed . Note for The Chaperon 1893 May or June , 1893 The Chaperon : 3 act Comedy . Is there a subject for comedy  --  for a pretty three-act comedy  --  latent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is  --  but I ca n't tell till I try . Three questions ( exclusive of this matter for E.C. ) rise before me in a row , with importunate solicitous faces . One is the question of the play I began so long ago on the subject that , for convenience , I have provisionally labelled Monte-Carlo ; the other is the question of having something in my hand ready for Daly in the event of there arising between us a question of a second play . The third is this desire to thresh out the Chaperon a little and see what 's in it . The sense of a margin ( absit omen ! ) makes all the difference . It makes one good-humoured and patient and pliant and impersonal and divinely willing , makes one care only for the process and the prize and not a bit for the subjective accidents . The definitely wise , the concretely practical thing is probably for me to sit down , without delay and before the Monte-Carlo idea ; and I hereby declare myself ready ( ready ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my siege . I should like , however , en attendant , to make a note , to make a notch against the question of what may be feasible with the Chaperon ; to look into it a moment as I pass  --  have the amusement of having just started my hare ! The idea of the play is expressible enough  --  the idea of a girl who , reversing with courage and compassion , the usual relation , takes out and imposes on society , making sacrifices to do so , her discredited mother . A part of the drama ( either of the story or the play ) is in the sacrifices in question . In the tale , which is very brief and simple , she stands ready to sacrifice her lover . He does n't exact it  --  he comes round to her and she does her work and keeps him as well . But the tale can , essentially , contain only the germ of the play . What presents itself , offhand , as indispensable for the play  --  without approfondissement or more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the element of sacrifice and an intensification of the element of the mother 's milieu , of the signs and tokens , the associations and appendages , the stamp and colour that are part and parcel of it and offer it to the view . Everything , in a word must be satirically intensified and dramatically pointed . The struggle must be more arduous than in the tale , the renunciation more heroic , the difficulty greater , the personality and situation of the mother more contrasted , the victory more brilliant . The whole thing must be at once more general , more typical , and more special . All sorts of things , as it were , must depend on the daughter 's success . There must be complications in the mother 's life , and yet a picture  --  very droll , very satiric  --  of the whole " desolation of propriety , " as the story calls it , in which that life is consciously past . There are the people whom the girl 's struggle is with , and who must be intensely selected , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the girl must deal with in the mother 's past as well as the mother herself . How directly , as one approaches it , one begins to see the drama open out ; see it give , give , give as one presses ! It always gives  --  gives something ; the question that remains is whether in the particular case it gives enough . The charming thing is that even if it does n't one is when one reaches that question , so far  --  so much the farther  --  on the general way . The Maresfield interest becomes , in the play , one of the big wheels of the action . May the added someone or something , in the mother 's " past , " in the problem that the daughter has to deal with , not perhaps be the old lover , the corespondent for whom the mother was divorced . I need n't absolutely have a divorce unless I want to . It may have been only a scandalous separation and thereby serve my purpose ; especially if it disposes of some questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Let us assume then , for the moment , that the lover is there , to add to the girl 's difficulty and danger . Make the machinery to capture her , to prevent her , more important ; the Maresfield machinery , I mean  --  the Maresfield bribe . Make the girl 's second lover more dramatically active than Guy Mangler . In this way one gets the bribe , somehow , as well as the loss  --  what she gives up  --  at home  --  and what is held out to her elsewhere . Not what is held out to her to make her drop her mother as Bertram Jay wishes to make her drop her : ( he 's on the family  --  her own family side )  --  but what is held out to make her sacrifice her , give up trying to put her through and look out only for herself . The way Rose works this , in the tale , is of course a thing to be made intensely dramatic and ironic in the play . Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey becomes  --  can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand the family must be reconstituted  --  the grandmother does n't seem to me to be what I can find de mieux . Aunt Julia  --  yes , a representative of property etc.  --  another sister , yes  --  a representative of the opposite  --  the proper course ( comedy-character  --  with secret flirtation of her own verging on scandal )  --  and possibly , conceivably , the father ? No ; I think not  --  the struggle is n't with him , it 's with the world , I mean that from the moment it 's not a question of making him reaccept her mother , he can only be awkwardly placed in the action . Therefore he 's out of it , and one gets by that the benefit of his inheritance for Rose  --  her means , the thing that makes her valuable . She must sacrifice money  --  yes ; that is her family prospect . But she must sacrifice a lover  --  or have the question of sacrificing him above all . I seem to see a pretty part that would make a third suitor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever observant , sincere fellow ( the real " hero " ) who has had no parti-pris about her in advance and who is won to help her by the gallantry of her course . The thing assumed here ( D.V. ) is an action in which he may help her  --  help her , say , with the lover , who constitutes a difficulty . I seem to see all sorts of things  --  they swarm upon me . I see Aunt Julia as an uncle , a rich , intolerant bachelor , to diminish the number of women ( Rose 1 , sister 2 , Mrs. Tramore 3 , Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey 4 , Lady Maresfield 5 ) . In the way of men there would seem to be : The Hero , Bertram Jay ( 2 ) , Guy Mangler ( 3 ) , the Ex-Lover ( 4 ) and the young man whom her sister ( Edith ) has her flirtation with ( 5 ) . I must add that Lady Maresfield and Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey may be resolved into one person , and this may also happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , I confess , just in a glance , at all see that duplication . ) Nor at the first blush is the role of the lover very apparent to me . Of course at the first blush there is nothing but the germ of the subject : I mean a kind of faith in it , enveloped in a mist of confusion . Out of the mist there looms , somehow , a first act in which the various things ( and more ) are settled that are settled in the first chapter of the tale . I vaguely see a place in which a meeting of the various people is possible : an hotel in Switzerland , at Aix-les-Bains  --  or at the Italian lakes . The girl here is introduced to her mother , made acquainted with her , has the mother 's situation revealed to her . She sees her cold-shouldered etc . She is shocked , pained by it  --  affected , in a word , as also is in the tale , and is moved to take up the position she takes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses by it , made clear to her . The Maresfield-Vesey interest must be , here , the cold-shoulderers , and their evolution , their transition is that they see , later , how she draws . The " observant " suitor ( the added one ) plays , practices , ironizes as I may say , on the situation in conjunction with Mrs. V-V.  --  or on her in conjunction with the situation . He believes in the girl , is charmed , has no doubts . By making him so , however , I lose the chance of bringing him over  --  making him serve her work , as Rose makes Captain Jay in the tale . There may be a way of attaching this personage  --  in some way  --  to Mrs. Tramore . I see that the difficulty  --  one of them , and the main one , in what the story gives at least  --  is the sufficiently unheroic character of Bertram Jay . He does n't do  --  as he is  --  for the hero . And yet his being as he is , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other fellow , the inserted personage , making Rose 's acquaintance for the first time on the very occasion of this crisis of the first act . He 's an outsider when the curtain rises  --  but drawn into the action by the very effect of her behaviour . If I keep the ex-lover , discredited , disreputable now ( may there not be a question of his marrying her ( Mrs. Tramore ) now that her husband is dead ?  --  marrying her to satisfy the claims of respectability , the standards of the Philistines ) if I keep him , I say , and keep him as an annoyance , a mortification to Mrs. Tramore , I get a kind of lien for the new hero , a link of introduction or attachment . I am wondering in other words whether an entrance may not be found for him , and after an entrance a strong and valid part , as a kind of relative , a cousin , of the lover , to whom Mrs. Tramore has applied , to whom she has appealed , to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of him . He is on the spot for that purpose , and his situation gives him his vision of Rose . Two alternatives arise ( for me ) : the idea of making Mrs. Tramore 's lover a perfect bore of fidelity , desiring to marry Mrs. T ; while she now does n't want that , has outlived the phase of desiring it ; and the idea of her wanting it and having sent for New Hero , his kinsman , to force it on , and then been moved to a different determination by the entrance into her life of her daughter . The idea would be here that the girl conceives the bold and superior design of acting for mother without the marriage  --  putting her through herself , independently , without it ; on the basis of disliking so the poor ex-lover . Both she and his kinsman dislike him : they meet on that . Ignominy  --  satiric treatment  --  of the social view , the social standard , that makes it the condition  --  et encore ! One seems , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a good deal of life : but not at an hotel abroad , on second thoughts , no . The two sisters have been living abroad  --  with their father : partly on account of their mother , who is in England and whose presence there has been a reason for their keeping away . They only know  --  Rose only knows , what this father has bien voulu tell them about her . The father dies  --  they have a prim , rich , fussy bachelor uncle to whom they devolve more or less by this circumstance . He goes for them  --  or they come back , and the first act takes place in his house in London just after their return . It is abroad  --  during her last year  --  that Rose has met Bertram Jay . It is the proper , conventional , worldly uncle who has embraced the idea of Mrs. Tramore 's now marrying her former lover  --  regularising her position . He has , fatuously , busy-bodily sent for the lover to express to him , thus opportunely , his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sent his kinsman  --  a cleverer , more creditable , more distinguished person  --  to treat , to converse , to see de quoi il s'agit , etc . This is his introduction to Rose , his first encounter with her . Happy thought  --  that is it seems to twitch my sleeve as one . Keep the ex-lover personally out of the play altogether  --  make him present , like Mme Benoton , Footnote : 1Kb only by reference and contention . So the kinsman , the new lover , the Hero , is hereby brought . Mrs. Tramore is brought , in the simplest and most natural way in the world , by her own act . She has meditated , planned her visit as a kind of bold , calculated coup  --  she has had in mind its " effect " on her daughter  --  as a means of capturing her , of making a good impression on her , before a bad one is made by the representations and machinations of others . She is ignorant of Mr. Tramore 's ( her brother-in-law 's , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the machinery set in motion , in the name of the grotesque proprieties , to make her ( and encore only questionably ! ) tidy herself up by this tardy union . It is part of the ground  --  this new knowledge , this present pressure , on which she meets her daughter . Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey has come , partly at Mr. Tramore 's instance and partly at that of her own speculations  --  to see what can be done for her brother Guy Maresfield . It is for her , also , perhaps  --  or doubtless  --  that Mr. Tramore has sent as a form of feminine support , of chaperonage , to advise about the girls and look in particular after Edith . I reflect , however , that it may be a mistake to reduce Lady Maresfield and Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey to a common identity . Do n't I sacrifice , thereby , lose something indispensable ? The number of women need n't disturb me so much  --  it 's a part of the essence of the subject , which represents , for Rose , a struggle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I make my women too few . Lady Maresfield and her daughter perform totally different , perform opposed functions . Mrs. V.V. is the intensely modern woman who is with Rose etc . Let me , therefore , begin with , try to see Lady M. in first act , alone . She need n't even have been " sent for " by Mr. Tramore : she has come , by her own officiousness etc. on speculation . She wants to get Rose for her younger son . Her opposition , her scandalization , when she hears or divines what Rose forfeits . This counts as part of the public opinion that the girl has to face and fight . Then elle se rabat , for Guy , on Edith  --  but with the divided mind of watching to see how it turns out for Rose , and if she ( Rose ) may not perhaps get , somehow , from her mother , more than she forfeits from her uncle . The young Edith , meanwhile , flirtatious and hypocritical , which her sister is not , is meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German music-master , or some such person . Make Bertram Jay by no means military  --  make the hero military if you like . Bertram Jay becomes political and parliamentary . He becomes the timid , the prudent , the shockable lover as contrasted with the brave . He is another of the " social forces " with which the girl has to count . But in this connection , of course , one sees rise before one the question , the difficulty of the " love-interest " and the marriage-question from the moment the serious side of this matter is taken from the circumspect lover and attached to another man . In the story the girl uses Bertram Jay , as it were  --  and then , later , marries him . To make her marry the Hero without using him offers , of course , infirmities . He must be an agent , in other words ; and we shall manage that . Bertram Jay is a comedy-agent , and a reluctant and unwilling one ; and the Hero is a sentimental agent  --  an eager and sympathetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . He must find his activity partly in being the showman of the human spectacle . Bertram Jay drops out by being too cautious , too anxious , too tactless , too parliamentary . He must fail her on a crucial occasion , when , instead , she finds the Hero there . This occasion must be the climax of an action extremely corve , thoroughly overhauled and solidified . In the simplest expression it consists of the effort of the girl to place her mother . The intensity and the interest of this effect depend largely upon the question of where she wants to place her . This point , this where , must become supremely and admirably concrete in the third act . It must be a great occasion  --  it must have high importance . It must be something higher than Lady Maresfield  --  something for which Mrs. V.V. is operative in the spirit she exhibits in the tale . Is it a great party at a Duchess 's  --  is it something more than a party ? Is it a charity bazaar ?

The main little mass of it is there , but something more is wanted  --  and I must take some quiet creative hour ( ah , quiet creative hours  --  their very name in this general connection is sweet ! ) to thresh that out . Little by little , D.V. , the right thing will come . As I in a primary way rest my eyes on it , I seem to see the required , the augmented interest to the ... the manuscript breaks off at this point . EDITOR 'S FOREWORD On November 12 , 1907 , James sent off to Forbes-Robertson his completed three act High Bid . Two days later , his interest in the stage now thoroughly revived , he re-read his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dictated the " Rough Statement " which follows , breaking off in the middle and never returning to it . Miss Bosanquet 's notes reveal that he decided it was more important to get on with a one-act curtain raiser to go with The High Bid which , despite its three acts , still did not fill out an evening . This fragment of a scenario , which James calls also his " notes of Character and Design " can be taken as an example of the statements , notes , projects  --  he had different terms for them at different times  --  James set down for his plays , for his own use , during the 1890 's . It is quite likely that the earlier ones were more succinct , since they ante-dated the period when James began to dictate his work directly to the typewriter . The " Rough Statement " in its manuscript form is " rough " indeed ; apparently , since he never resumed dictating it , he never reread the sheets , and they survive as they fell from the typewriter , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from uncorrected dictation . The text has been printed here as it stands with only the insertion of a few commas as an aid to readability . In one of his short stories James described such scenarios as " the overflow into talk of an artist 's amorous plan . " The statement for The Chaperon takes its place with the notes for the unfinished novels The Sense of the Past and The Ivory Tower . It is quite distinct from the " projects " prepared by the novelist for magazines or publishers giving them the plan of his work ( as in the case of the project for The Ambassadors or the outline for The Bostonians ) . The rough statement was intended for James 's eyes alone and in the normal course of events would have been destroyed when it had outlived its usefulness . James himself indicates the use to which he put it " step by step , inch by inch , one silver thread of the tangle handled at a time . ... " The statement indicates how , in writing his plays , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fixed " each person , gave each scene its plausible background and context . The idea for The Chaperon in its original short story form was first noted by James at the Marine Hotel , Kingstown , Ireland on July 13 , 1891 , where he had gone to recuperate from a bad attack of influenza  --  the story of a young girl who decides to " chaperon " her mother ( a woman with a " past "  --  she had left her husband and gone off with another man ) and to reinstate her in her social position in London . Five days after his original note , he wrote to Horace Scudder , editor of the Atlantic Monthly , that he would send him a " thing in two parts called The Chaperon . " Two days later he had completed the first part , and eight days later the second . The story appeared in the Atlantic of November and December 1891 and was republished in The Real Thing in 1893 . A NOTE ON THE TEXTS In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . The corrections and emendations were such as occur in the progress of a modern play from the dramatist 's desk , through the production office into the theatre . James was called upon to revise his plays many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays , nor the textual problems arising from collation , warranted such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  that is of truth , fidelity to text and to the writer 's intentions  --  while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some producer might be caught in the process  --  provide the means for the appearance of at least some of them on the American stage . I therefore directed my editing to this end . It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of the London production , two of them from James 's own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors . It was thus possible to give the mutations of James 's first important effort in the theatre , including a variant fourth act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was applied . Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the cuts restored ; in a few minor instances there were cuts followed by alterations and where these were in James 's hand they were accepted as his final reading ; where there were simply cuts , these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable , the alternate readings have been given . There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons ' typescripts of the play , I decided that it would be of interest to publish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which James had approved , despite a number of alterations and cuts . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed ; as the short story Covering End and in the final form it took when it reached the stage . While James went over most of the manuscripts of his plays , making corrections and verbal changes , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's alternately referring to " Valentin " and " Valentine " are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization . In some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech ; these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips 's Bibliography of the Writings of Henry James ( New York , 1930 ) , pp. 26-27 , 46-47 and 115-16 . Main text ROUGH STATEMENT FOR THREE ACTS FOUNDED ON THE CHAPERON Section 1 Irresistible the pressure of inducement just to break ground , if nothing more , for a first go at the elements involved in this application of my idea ; as nothing is done till one begins actively to grope , till one makes something in the nature of a start , however false , and with no matter how many steps to retrace and how many merely experimental perces into the vague or into the impossible one may make . This is the only way the possible comes ; one must explore the country right and left , leaving no square foot of it untrodden or unsearched .

This seems to me very arrangeable , quite without difficulty ; she simply comes of age , comes into her little money , which is n't very much , at twenty-one , quite as if she were a boy . The fact that an entertainment of some sort , of however mild an order , should commemorate this circumstance , may not on the face of it appear extraordinarily natural , but may be made so , quite easily , with moderate tact and ingenuity . It has only to by sufficiently constat that the young Tramores , the three of them , have always , ever since their domiciliation with their Grandmother , enjoyed this little institution of the birthday-party , by an amiable family tradition , and by the epicurean humour in especial of their late Father , whose habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light and easy neglect of them ( leaving them altogether to his Mother and Miss Tramore ) by these three little commemorations or recreations in the year , one for each , for which he has provided conjurors , or fiddlers , or birthday cakes , or whatever , in the past ; and for which he would now presumably do the thing more handsomely , were he alive to adorn with his presence this important date for his eldest child . What I am supposing is that he has been dead for rather more than a year , and that to-day is precisely a sign of the coming out of mourning , as it were , of the two Girls , who have practically stayed at home , so to speak , ever since ; with the first appearances in the " world " of each of them , the first small social launching of the elder in particular , prematurely overdarkened by their bereavement , and above all by their highly sincere and decorous observance of it : an observance that has in Rose 's case seemed rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia T. ; whom I see as somehow a bit irritated and ruffled in advance by this first symptom of the Girl 's capacity for her own view and system and little private idea and conviction , firmly grasped and quietly , persistently applied , about everything . The boy is at his crammer 's or wherever , and though probably present to-day , I make out no urgent use for him ; the two others have then been living , in their old way , with their Grandmother , though of course , I must be careful to note , not absolutely buried ; Rose having necessarily had to form the few social relations that immediately come into play : which , as this must be perfectly clear , I conceive her having formed during the year of her first " coming out " ; the brief time between that event and her Father 's death , during which she went about more or less under his easy and highly adequate protection , making the acquaintance of the sort of people he knew , " good " society , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the attributes it is necessary she should have , have made him quite happy and proud to be able to introduce her . It is from that time , for instance , that her acquaintance with Lady Maresfield dates , and the marking her for her own , then and there , by that lady , who has seen how beautifully she will probably do for the young up-growing , up-climbing , Guy . In connection with which remember that the little share of her patrimony that she comes into must be something of a respectable thing ; the figure of it , with a thousand other items and values , to be fixed at closer quarters ; as well as the very important matter of her further , though her wholly contingent , expectations from Old Mrs. Tramore ; who can give or withhold quite according to her own pleasure and to the attitude taken by each of these young beneficiaries . It is highly conspicuous , of course , that she can " cut off " Rose at her discretion , if sufficiently displeased with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Son 's two other children ; who are such quite other affairs than Rose , and so comparatively plastic and , as it were , abject . But meanwhile , at any rate , Rose has enough of her own not only to " go on " with , but to make Lady Maresfield , not to speak of others , regard it as a " factor , " a potential one , in an appreciable prospective income for Guy . It must n't be presented as imperceptible to the other young man either , the young man who figures in the Tale as the rather priggish and precautionary , but really decent and sincere and loyal , Captain of Engineers , Bertram Jay ; but whose profession , situation etc. , I must now visibly alter to something more Contributive . I postulate that he will have met her first , and got his impression and so forth , during the year of her so distinctly successful little going-about before the subsequent sequestration ; the continuity and consistency of which , par parenthse , it would be admirable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp , effective Notes of Character and Design , of intelligent choice and the Long View , on the part of my young woman . She has seen him since , but only three or four times , as she has seen also the youth presented in the Tale as Guy Manger ; but has seen nothing much of anyone , as we definitely make out , and has really spent her time in nursing the conscious purpose and storing up the precious courage , to which it is the function of Act First to represent her as giving effect to in the most conspicuous and interesting and " dramatic " manner possible . Bertram Jay has had contact with old Mrs. Tramore , who approves and favours him and on whom  --  this being an Element of almost the first Value  --  she exactly counts to throw his weight , with Rose , on her , the old woman 's side , in the conflict of judgment , opinion , in fine sharp and decisive action , which she has begun , though within a very short time , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between herself and her Granddaughter . I make it out that Jay 's function in this act is essentially to represent , to Rose , in common with Julia Tramore , the old woman 's high and passionate , at any rate absolutely rigid and final view of the situation : I see him as yet , so far as I grope my way , for the time lucidly confined to that function . Her break with him is thus part and parcel of her break with her Grandmother , her Aunt , her Brother , and her Sister ; her ultimatum to him part and parcel of her ultimatum to them ; her making up her mind , luminously , insurmountably , to do without him so far as any further Discussion is concerned , but the other face of her preparedness , which I should like , I seem to make out , to be the subject of a little separate scene with each ( save that here , at this stage , are of course abysses for further sounding ) to do without most of the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before I go further  --  and it bears on the question of her actual " means "  --  the high value of her definite " forfeit , " as the price of her perversity : it being important for my purpose that she should forfeit something still more tangible than her place " in the Family " and the sympathy and esteem , the very intercourse , as it were , of the other members of it . She must forfeit money in some marked and eminent degree ; she must bring money , in some degree or other , to her Mother  --  it is even one of her motives ; yet I must reconcile this with her still having that which may still keep her in question for Lady Maresfield and such-like , during the period of her sacrifice and her ostracism . Apropos of which , at the same time , I recall that these designs of the Importunate are precisely to get her to give her Mother up , to renounce her missionary work , her quixotic campaign , as the bad job it is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear ; and so go back to the loaves and fishes , to the recovery and realisation of her possible prospects , that is , if she makes it up with the scandalised old woman before the latter dies disinheriting her . To put it simply and provisionally , just to get it down , Mrs. Tramore , the elder , has resources her share of which , conditioned on " good terms , " may accrue to her ; and Miss Tramore has the same  --  the latter and Bertram Jay being , with the Brother and Sister , indeed , if I " drag them in , " ( all , as yet here , however , preliminary darkness ) the immediate expository mouthpiece of these stern realities . By which I probably mean , in fact , by which I still more prettily and interestingly mean , I daresay , that , after having had all the needful home-truths about her Step from the three others , it is she herself who is the most , who charmingly becomes the most , authoritative exponent of them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anxious , the remonstrant , the supplicating , but the altogether baffled and discomfited , Jay . It in fact rises before me Interesting that , face to face with this question of Who the presented Agents here are limited or multiplied to ; face to face with the question of keeping them down in First only to such as may be Agents and Values again in Second and Third ; it glimmers beautifully , I say , that the young man , here through may , more effectively than not , do the whole business of old Mrs. Tramore , by his acting , speaking , comporting himself , in her name and at her behest ; she having adopted him thus as her candidate and solemnly laid it on him to do what he can . I see this is an Artful Simplification , an accretion of value and interest for him ; and as ministering , in fine , to my in every way sublime Economy . The Brother and Sister , Eric and Edith , say , have very conceivable uses wrapped up in them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably of the first degree of Designation for First ; on the basis of involved sequences , later , finally , catastrophically , of all due vividness . Thus I get for the present Opposition the four persons thus named , with the further Social Adjuncts to be gone into . Step by step , inch by inch , one silver thread of the tangle handled at a time . Old Mrs. Tramore , then , must be , I descry , conveniently , yet rather amply and " handsomely " suburban ; this the most workable basis , I piously , if not presumptuously , judge , for my fundamental dispositions in Act First . What I thus sketchily see , to begin with , is the bright and beautiful afternoon , early in June , on which Rose 's birthday-party is taking place , with people out from town in carriages , in motors even , supposons , and by train , a number of people sufficient to show the effort the fine old hostess has made to have a bright and copious muster of old friends  --  on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the further little fact that the high pitch of the Crisis ( between herself and Rose ) has come only after the invitations have been issued : so that things have been left as they are rather than cancelled  --  all the more that the old woman does n't really know the " length " to which Rose has , all the while , really been going : the length , that is , of communication with her Mother already entered into , though she has obeyed the letter of her Father 's wishes and impositions , by not yet having been to see her . She has only let her know , definitely , that she comes , and comes to stay , the Hour she is Free . Technically speaking , perhaps , she is not free till the day has wholly elapsed ; so that , giving her plan the benefit of this doubt , she has determined to take her flight , to begin this new relation , only on the morrow . A part of the Function of Act First is to show this patience as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to show the Step in short , as dramatically precipitated . Wherewith , one promptly discerns , one of one 's first cares is to establish and set forth , as an almost prime preliminary , how much of a shadow , in the form of a shock , a scandal , a general and particular flurry and chatter , this Coming Event has cast before it . Here spreads itself precisely , therefore , one of those Visions of Beauty which consist of the right , the felicitous and triumphant Determination of the March of the exhibited Case ; the creation of the process or picture by which Clearness and Interest become complete ; stage adding itself to stage , suspense to suspense , appearance to appearance , and the whole thing logically and dramatically developing . It is of the essence , in other words , that the ground is first thoroughly laid , up to the last point of excited expectation and curiosity , for our view of the particular thing that is happening , as to which our knowledge grows minute by minute ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all up , where artful Preparation has left it off , simply stationing itself at the right point to hand it over to her ; and that with this appearance or irruption she takes it completely in charge to climax . But the Preparation here will have to be of the most consummate ; which is but a reason , an inspiration and a value the more . Roughly speaking , then , old Mrs. Tramore is out in the grounds , where the beautiful day permits all the best of everything to go forward ; and we have the sufficient image of her reported , reflected , and borne in to us by a pointed reference and echo , while our own immediate picture is constituted in the Drawingroom of the house , open to the terrace , verandah , lawn and whatever , and serving as a partial place of transit and arrest ; also rendered comparatively private and proper for my uses by the fact that everyone instinctively goes further , has been " shown through , " as it were ; no one pausing , lingering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our action brings into play and makes them conform to . Admirably interesting and appealing , always , this question of one 's first " struck " note ; the determination , really mathematical in its logic , of the point furthest back and yet at the same time nearest to , at which one 's March must visibly , audibly , fruitfully begin ; as with the concentrated germ of the Whole of the Rest folded up in it . There is always question of the sufficiently Far Back for Clearness , and the sufficiently Near To for Straightness and Immediacy . Well , I seem , till the contrary is proved , to clutch that point here with the production of the two Young Men , as I call them , the youths who figure , so very slightly , in the Tale as Eric Tramore and Guy Manger , but who here immediately acquire an appreciable value . I seem to make out , for experiment , that , at rise of Curtain , the young Eric , coming in from the Grounds , meets the Butler just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Butler does  --  that everyone is outside , but that he can pass through this way . Important , evidently , that there must be the appearance of two Ways out to where everyone is gathered ; a way , and especially a course of Egress and Departure ( always from the Grounds ) more directly connected with the Entrance to the House ; so that there is the presumption , the indication , of coming and going , but in particular of going , independently of this passage through the Drawingroom ; it being marked that the latter becomes thus the scene of such passages , encounters and contacts as are specially motived and conditioned there . Another point to make here instantly , further reflection shows me , is that the Occasion , at rise of Curtain , is already waning to its close , though the long June afternoon still is bright ; and that the main movement is the ebb of the tide , the stream of departure so that the latter part of the act , the whole Climax , finds the principal Agents free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have here next to deal with ( I mean after Eric and Guy ) , there can be no entrance , of any outsider , save for the purpose of getting away . What glimmers to me now , at any rate , is that the Butler first shows young Manger in , with an " Oh yes , sir , you can as well go this way : the Ladies receive in the Grounds " and that it is just as the visitor is about to pass across and out to the visible Terrace or whatever , that the young Eric comes in from that quarter , greeting him with an : " Oh yes , you 're very late , but you can get through ; though if you 'll wait a moment I 'll take you . " This note of the youth 's lateness is emphasised , with some reference to the fact that people are moving off ; and with some occasion for Guy to ask if his Mother is still there ; with the answer on the other 's part as to Lady Maresfield 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps even to the presence of the sister , Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey of the Tale , a Value , I assume , for later on ; and part of the sign of the way the family have rallied . What is instant , at any rate , here , is Eric 's motive for hurrying in , indicated by an immediate sign to the Butler to wait , even while he receives the other youth , with whom I conceive for him considerable identity of futile type , age , occupation , and vague state of preparation for some " smart " profession ; presumably , on the whole , not military . Eric sends the Butler up to his room for a certain box of precious cigarettes  --  those Granny provides being ( for young Manger ) so beastly ; producing ring of keys from his pocket and giving him instructions where to look , so that some minutes are provided thus for the Butler 's absence while the two young men wait ; Guy indicating , for that matter , his preference and purpose to wait ; with a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He carries in his hand a small , or indeed a rather ridiculously large , box done up in white paper and pink ribbon , a tribute in the form of chocolate-creams , marrons glacs , or whatever that he has brought in the form of a birthday offering to the young Rose ; but that he has immediately become shy , self-conscious , and awkward about , on finding it a question of his sallying forth with it across the lawn and presenting it before a lot of people . I am not sure even  --  since one must thresh out every alternative  --  that he may not have an initial passage with the Butler before Eric appears ; the Butler having relieved him of his parcel and , having , also , as we learn and see , introduced him into Drawingroom at his rather flurried and preoccupied request , and standing there with the beribboned object delicately held to await his indications . Section 2 BUTLER All outside , sir : Mrs. Tramore receives in the Grounds . ERIC Then could you  --  ah  --  carry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving you to  --  a  --  follow sir ? ERIC Oh no , I 'd go with you . But I do n't like to take it myself . BUTLER Nothing to  --  a  --  go off , sir ? ERIC Oh dear no  --  ( then rueful ) unless chocolate-creams , in large masses , do explode ( On which the BUTLER , who naturally has his business at the Door to attend to , availing himself impenetrably of this pretext . ) Butler I had better perhaps place them here , sir  --  according to your first Idea . ( The young MANGER , swayed by every breath , is constitutionally flurried , and agitatedly embraces this amendment . ) Eric It was my Idea  --  where she 'll see them ; and perhaps wonder  --  ! Butler In which case should I mention , sir  --  ? Eric Oh yes , do mention ; or ( as he sees ERIC come in ) perhaps , my dear chap , you kindly would ! ( Then as ERIC takes in with surprise the very large beribboned box , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . ) Chocolate-creams  --  for Miss Rose ! ERIC . ( Who , entering from Terrace , has signed to BUTLER to wait , but is also amused at size of box . ) Half a Ton ? GUY . ( Complacent though flushed . ) For her Birthday ! ERIC . I 'm afraid I should have to mention the Number as fatal . But do it yourself  --  they 're all out there . GUY . ( Who , by large open glass doors , has looked out , pulling himself up , rather , apparently , at what he sees ; while the BUTLER approaches ERIC , who unhooks from left-hand pocket-button of his trousers a silver key-chain , with rings and several keys attached . ) I should like you to take me out ! ERIC . I will  --  with my Cigarettes . ( To BUTLER , who takes the keys from him . ) The best tin box in one of my locked drawers : search ' em all till you find it ! I 'll wait . ( After which , while BUTLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's are too beastly ! GUY . ( Coming away from window ; simple , surprised . ) Is Mrs. Tramore smoking ? ERIC . ( With fine youthful impatience and importance . ) For all I know  --  she has so lost her head ! GUY . ( Wondering , interested , but never anything if not simple . ) Through having such a Crowd ? ERIC . ( Prompt , sharp . ) Through having such a Grand-daughter . GUY . ( As thinking quite to seize the point . ) Do you mean your so awfully successful Sister ? ERIC . ( Emphatic , resentful . ) I mean my Sister Rose , whose Success strikes me as mainly in setting us All  --  I mean all of us who have lived together here with Granny since Papa 's Death : Aunt Julia and Edith and Me , you know  --  most awkwardly by the Ears ; and in availing herself , for the purpose of this handsome Celebration  --  though I do say it !  --  of her Twenty First Birthday . GUY . ( Anxious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone and got Engaged ? ERIC . ( Youthfully superior ; his thumbs in his waistcoat armholes ; his eyes on the other a moment . ) There are more ways than that , old Chap , of making a Fool of yourself ! GUY . ( Gloomy , vague . ) And that 's what she 's doing  --  ? ERIC . ( Distinct , definite . ) What she 's doing is to make some such Exhibitions of all of us  --  and above all such an Exhibition , as one may say , of the Character and Conduct of our late admirable Father who , in a most important particular , took pains to lay down the Right Line for us . From that Line Rose has just proclaimed it her intention to Deviate . GUY . ( At sea , imperfectly following . ) " Proclaimed " it  --  before the Crowd ? ERIC . ( In his own manner . ) Before the Crowd assembled  --  but not in time , most unfortunately , to prevent its assembling . GUY . ( Mystified but impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to put off a Party for ? ERIC . ( Like an approved man of character , and above all of action . ) I 'd have put it off  --  if we had known it in Time . But she spoke but this Morning . GUY . ( More and more anxious . ) What then did she speak of ? ERIC . ( Bringing it out with gravest effect . ) She spoke of Mamma . GUY . ( Enlightened , relieved , even a little amused . ) Oh  --  I see ! ERIC . ( With the same high gravity . ) We do n't speak of Mamma . ( Then for return of BUTLER . ) So hush ! ( To BUTLER . ) Put them down . GUY . ( While BUTLER places cigarette-box and goes out . ) But do you mean it affects my Chance ? ERIC . ( Who has gone to the table and taken out a cigarette ; sniffing it . ) I did n't know you had a " chance " ! ( Then as he passes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Distressed , though taking the cigarette . ) You have n't known about it all this Time ? ERIC . ( Impatient , lighting his cigarette , but , in his preoccupation , offering the other no light . ) Known about what ? GUY . ( Almost touchingly simple . ) Why , that  --  more than fifteen months ago  --  she Refused me . ERIC . ( Smoking . ) Ah , fifteen months ago she Refused fifty fellows ! That was before Papa 's Death . GUY . ( Definite . ) The year she came out  --  so tremendously Out ! ( Ingenuous . ) She refused me twice . ERIC . ( Dry . ) Do you want her to do it again ? GUY . ( Embarrassed , rueful , even slightly boobyish ; scratching his thigh and looking askance at the big box . ) That was n't what I brought those Sweets for ! ERIC . Had n't you then better eat them yourself ? I do n't think it a particularly good moment for you to try again . GUY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheepishly and shamefacedly askance on his massive tribute . ) My Mother , you know , supposed that  --  with the Day and all , the charming Celebration and the happy Occasion it rather would be ; and she directed me herself therefore to bring with me some nice little thing that would please . ERIC . ( Amused . ) Ah , so that 's your idea  --  ? Well , you quite sufficiently " please "  --  yourself , my dear fellow ,  --  however you come ; please all of us together , I mean , so that I 'm sure we 're very glad to see you . But ( after an instant , with decision ) I think there 's something you ought to know . GUY . ( With a slight awkward hesitation , as from delicacy . ) Well , there are a lot of things that my Mother has told me ! ERIC . ( With a return of his dryness . ) It 's your Mother then that takes the principal interest  --  ? GUY . ( All candidly . ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing the ground for me ? ERIC . She is here , I believe , and has been for the last couple of hours : I 've encountered Lady Maresfield , I confess , at every turn of the Garden . But I doubt that she can have told you what she ca n't possibly know ; and what I think , ( after further consideration , then with emphasis and importance ) I had better mention to you , without delay ; to clear your mind  --  or at least to clear your Mother 's !  --  of any fond hopes for which we might , later on , be held responsible ! GUY . ( Plaintively , conscientiously . ) Ah , but my Mother 's mind is so terribly clear ! ERIC . ( Turning on him with a certain superior pity . ) Not , I take it , about the terms of my Father 's Will  --  which have hitherto been nobody 's business but our own , but which I think , from to-day , should really be , like Lost Articles , advertised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a foolish , awkward , yet amiable , laugh . ) It 's at least her notion  --  if you press me !  --  that you 're not , you know , half badly off ! ERIC . ( Throwing up his hands in sharp impatience , breaking off , taking a turn , but then facing round again as with importance and resolution . ) Do you know anything about Mamma ? GUY . ( Much of the space of the room between them ; looking at him an instant and speaking not without a certain mild " point . " ) You do speak of her then ? ERIC . ( Unperturbed . ) I never have , in the whole Course of my Days  --  but ( as justifying it to him completely ) Rose has now made it necessary we should do so One for All . GUY . I 've at least always heard that Mrs. Tramore is lovely . ERIC . ( Very straight , grave and digne . ) So lovely that my Father was  --  at an early stage  --  forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering . ) You mean there was a Row ? ERIC . ( Superior ; not faltering . ) In the Divorce-Court  --  yes : when  --  by Papa 's Decree , to say nothing of that of the Court itself we were too young to know . Since when we 've never so much as seen her . GUY . ( Artlessly but irrepressibly pleased at this advantage . ) I have  --  at the Opera . ERIC . ( With high propriety . ) We 've never  --  in view of that Danger so much as been to the Opera . ( Reconstituting , presenting , their young Annals , their past History . ) We made Papa that sacrifice  --  as we made him all those of which , as I 'm free to confess to you I think with all justice , he made , to the day of his Death , such an absolute point . We remained his  --  and I  --  for it sharply marks my Position  --  consider that we 're His still ; that we 're in fact now His more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly abashed and a good deal mystified . ) Do you mean that Mrs. Tramore  --  a  --  thinks  --  ERIC . ( Breaking straight in . ) We 've not the least idea what Mrs. Tramore thinks : it was settled in our Infancy that that was the last thing that was good for us . It was Papa 's Arrangement that we were to live in Ignorance ; and the Arrangement has perfectly worked . So we have lived  --  save for losing Him ; " immune , " as they say  --  till Rose takes this extraordinary occasion to start up and spoil All ! GUY . ( Following , but at a loss . ) But what does she want to do ? ERIC . ( As if it 's so much more than enough . ) She wants to See her . GUY . ( Wondering . ) And you consider that she may n't  --  ? ERIC . Not if I can possibly prevent it ! GUY . ( After an instant ; watching , as in suspense , his movements . ) Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in his pockets , his shoulders up ; after reflection . ) No . ( Then to explain . ) Rose is a Case . GUY . ( As with , after all , his own opinion . ) She 's a Brick  --  that 's what I think , you know , she is ! ERIC . ( Dry , unmoved , ironic . ) You strike me as exactly expressing the Degree of her Sensibility ! I mean , to the weight of Papa 's high Example and Authority . GUY . ( Yielding , conceding . ) Oh , of course she ought to mind  --  ! ERIC . ( Distinct , definite . ) She ought to mind her younger Sister , she ought to mind her elder Brother , she ought to mind her fine  --  and , I recognise , firm  --  old Granny , who has harboured us here from far back , and who remains the previous Vessel , as it were , of Papa 's beautiful Influence . She ought , above all , to mind Public Propriety  --  and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Who has taken this in as rather portentous ; turning it over . ) Do you suppose my Mother 's Appeal  --  ERIC . ( Curt ; sceptical ; having quite , by his exhibition of his case , worked himself up to exasperation ; so that he speaks , for the instant , indifferently and impatiently . ) You had better ask her ! GUY . ( Vague . ) Ask Miss Tramore  --  ? ERIC . Ask Lady Maresfield  --  if she thinks she can do any good . Only there are things that , in that case , she ought to know . GUY . ( Interested . ) Things I may tell her ? ERIC . ( With a gesture , an impatience of assent . ) That Either of us who , under his Will , breaks its grand Provision  --  GUY . ( As ERIC has paused as for positive pomp of effect . ) Loses a lot ? ERIC . ( With his effect . ) Loses Everything . GUY . ( Impressed indeed . ) Everything ? ERIC . ( Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am conceiving at this point the Entrance , from the Terrace , of the personage not appearing at all in the Tale , but whom I make out as of high importance here  --  an importance I shall presently develop all the ground of ; and whom I simply dub , to begin with , for convenience , the Colonel . In connection with which Entrance , as the two young men are about to leave , I immediately , suspending further detail , jot down roughly for benefit of memory the Concatenation of Sequences of the whole Act , the fine frame or mere osseous skeleton of it , as I from here experimentally view it . The Colonel arrives from the Grounds with of course , his abundant and vivid Motive ; and I wo n't now tackle detail of the passage immediately taking place  --  the simple getting him in and getting the others out  --  beyond seeming to see that Eric shall have rung , just sharply pressed the bell , as he finally moves about , for Butler , and that on the latter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes on table , " Bring these . " It is the Colonel who checks the Butler with his inquiry before the latter 's Exit to Grounds and I thus promptly see that he must n't have met the young men or crossed with them  --  a needless awkwardness  --  and that to this end , and probably certain other ends , though this alone would be enough , there must be a third easy Entrance to the Room . I have seen to the Left the Entrance from the Hall and main Passage of the House ; which supposes the Diningroom where indoor Refreshments are liberally going on off in that quarter ; which becomes a quarter of Reference . There is thus easily besides the Connection with Terrace and Grounds another Door or Passage to Right , as to a couple of other Rooms , smaller Sitting-room , Library , etc. , upon which the Terrace also opens ; so that they likewise may be entered from Garden . This is the way then the Colonel has come in , just as the young men go out and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He is instantly checked by the Colonel with the latter 's question as to whether Lady Maud is there , whether he has seen her come or go , in fact whether the Colonel , who has passed through the other parts in search of her , is in time to get at her before she goes further . This is the Motive with which I bring him on ; which he makes immediately vivid ; and which gains further significance from the Butler 's saying , that is becoming able to say , at sight of the person in question , just after the inquiry : " Here is her Ladyship " ;  --  and he may even announce her , true to his automatic habit , by her full name , as she appears at Entrance to Left . She and the Colonel thus instantly meet ; the Butler goes out to Grounds , and they have their scene together . ( Worth noting here , for remembrance , the small matter of a touch before the exit of the two young men . Eric has touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second Everything ; then he adds to his companion his " But we must go out . " The Butler instantly appears , to whom he addresses his order to bring out the cigarettes , and makes his exit , while the Butler speaks to Guy . " And the chocolate-creams , sir ? " On which I give a little the effect of the confidence about the girl 's forfeiture of means just made him , by his hesitating , debating , while he just scratches his chin , and after a rueful glance at his massive tribute , decides and says " No ! " He goes out after his friend , and then it is the Colonel arrives from Right in time to arrest the Butler . The moment there is of the briefest ; the Colonel simply saying " Have you seen Lady M. ? " and the man , one easily sees , on reflection , not uttering the superfluous word or two I imputed above , but simply with his look to the door Left as she appears there , announcing her by name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is her first visit to the House he wo n't know her . Never mind ; she has come in the moment before , while he was still outside , and he has heard her name herself to a footman . He simply hands it on , after the very momentary interruption caused by Eric 's ring for him . ) But I go into too many details that can wait so well till after I have finished , fully and simply stated , straight off , my present concatenation , as I have called it , of sequences . I shall come back , exhaustively , to the Function of the Scene between the Colonel and Lady Maud , as well as to the Function of each of these two individually ; though I ca n't forbear just noting here even now that he tells her he has come to stop her off , as it were , and why  --  because , in three words , he thinks it 's better , given something that clearly has happened in the House , though , mind you , he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should n't , so to speak , make so bold . She promptly replies that she has come by reason of an invitation straight from Rose herself  --  the nicest little note in the world that the Girl has been so good as to write her . The Colonel retorts to this that he knows , precisely , all about the nice little note  --  Rose having mentioned to him , out there in the Grounds just now , that she had taken this step and is hoping for the practical response . But none the less , the Colonel feels , it wo n't do  --  it wo n't at all do . And pray why wo n't it do ? Well , it will make a difficulty for her . There 's thunder in the air  --  or there 's powder  --  and I 've been enough in the House , as an old soldier , to smell it . Something has happened  --  I do n't quite know what ; but Mrs. Tramore is as grim as a Death 's head , and I do n't advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to suggest , that he wo n't answer for it that in such an event there might n't be a scene  --  out there before everyone ; so that " My dear woman , just nip away again unobserved , and forgive me the crudity of my warning , for which I feel that you 'll live to thank me . You see I know her , and you do n't . " Then for clearness : " I 'm not talking of Rose herself , poor child  --  but who , you know , is a most interesting creature ; I 'm talking , my dear , and entirely for your benefit , of the terrible old woman . " LADY MAUD . ( Who has taken this with immediate interest and good humour , though with my idea of her listening to him and watching him quite amusedly and ironically while he speaks , as if she knows , as indeed she does , more than he of the very thing he is talking about , and has thus her card up her sleeve . ) You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But may n't it perhaps make , rather , a facility ? COLONEL . It will scarce make a " facility " for anyone that the Old Woman shall be rude to you . LADY MAUD . ( With her smile and her air . ) People are never rude to me . COLONEL . ( With his own similar resource . ) That , my dear , is because you always choose the right ones . With these people here you 'd choose the wrong . LADY MAUD . I have n't chosen  --  I 'm called . Do n't you understand , if you 've talked with Rose , why she has sent for me ? COLONEL . ( A bit annoyed , as she looks so knowing . ) Why , because it 's her coming of age , as she calls it ,  --  and because , as she says , she has cast , for the occasion , a very wide net . LADY MAUD . ( Amused . ) Is that the way she puts it ? COLONEL . I make use of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever . COLONEL . Of course she 's very clever . Too clever for any of them here . LADY MAUD . ( Full of her knowledge . ) She 's too clever for you , my dear  --  if you have n't guessed then , on the spot , what she 's up to . COLONEL . ( Struck , and even as with a sense of his own odd density , clapping his finger-tips to his forehead . ) She 's going to her Mother ? LADY MAUD . ( As playing her card . ) She has practically sent for me  --  as Flora 's best friend  --  to bring her . COLONEL . ( Immensely startled . ) Lord o'mercy ! ( Yet amused too and wondering . ) To snatch her up and run with her ? LADY MAUD . I mean that she three days ago let Flora know she may count on her . COLONEL . ( Immensely interested , but vague . ) But count for What ? LADY MAUD . For Society . COLONEL . ( Throwing up his hands . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home . She can come to her . COLONEL . ( Still mixed . ) Flora can come here ? LADY MAUD . ( Enjoying it . ) Rose can come to us . She announces , my dear , that she Will . COLONEL . ( Not even yet wholly catching on . ) Come to see her ? LADY MAUD . ( For her climax . ) Come to Stay . Come to Live . ( Highly serene . ) Always . COLONEL . ( Now really astounded . ) You do n't mean to tell me she 's going to Chuck  --  LADY MAUD . ( Taking him up , laying her hand straight on his arm and holding him an instant with her eyes on him . ) What does she in fact Chuck ? COLONEL . Why , by the rigour with which Tramore settled it , Everything . LADY MAUD . ( Assured . ) Then she 'll do it . She wants to chuck all she can . COLONEL . ( Facing it , taking it in . ) I say , I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with a certain reflection on his tone . ) Do n't you like it ? COLONEL . ( Rubbing the back of his head with something of a grimace . ) We 'll say I admire it ! LADY MAUD . ( Good humouredly . ) I admit it 's Heroic . COLONEL . ( Emphatic . ) It 's Sublime ! She gives up , poor dear , so much more than she Knows ! LADY MAUD . ( After an instant ; as having , a little awkwardly for herself , to recognise this , but passing it off as with a slight sarcastic dig at him . ) Well , so long as she has n't to give up You  --  ! COLONEL . ( As in possession , more and more , of what it means . ) Ah , Maud , I feel that  --  as the one old Friend of her Father 's who , whether by the wisdom of the serpent or by the sweetness of the dove , whether for a sign of my constitutional " cheek " or only for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , miraculously , with a foot in either Camp , has contrived the trick of still seeing Them Here while being known or suspected yet to see You , and above all Her , Elsewhere , of being loyal to my poor stiff old Friend and his Memory , in short , without undue prejudice to Sympathies less arduous , even though of course , as you 'll allow , less Exemplary  --  I feel , I say , that as such a monstrous master of social Equilibruim , it will be a question not nearly so much of her giving me up as of her taking me quite systematically and comfortably on . LADY MAUD . ( Impatiently . ) If what you want is to make me again remark to you that I do n't know what , for so many years , we should have done without you , I decline to be dragged again through the Dust of that Abjection . I call your attention moreover to the fact that the Day of Deliverance for Flora has come , as it were , in spite of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She regards it then , poor dear , as her Day of Deliverance ? LADY MAUD . ( Her shoulders up as for all there is , vainly , to say of it . ) Did you ever see Flora  --  COLONEL . ( Instantly , comprehendingly taking her up . ) Depart from her glassy , her inimitable calm ? I 'm bound to say that , to the best of my recollection , and for the particular Charm we most value in her  --  Never ! LADY MAUD . Well then you 'll see her Now ! ( After an instant , almost with unction . ) It 's Beautiful to see her ! COLONEL . ( Appreciative , as with the vision . ) You make me want to !  --  if her Ecstasy has gone the length of really deputing you  --  ! LADY MAUD . ( Prompt . ) " Deputing , " my dear ? She brought me every inch of the way . COLONEL . ( Astonished , again , even alarmed . ) To this Door ? ( Anxious . ) Then where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . ) In the victoria . COLONEL . ( Quite aghast . ) And where 's the victoria ? LADY MAUD . ( Serene . ) I told it to drive up and down . COLONEL . ( As for the lurid vision . ) With MayFootnote : 1Kb Tramore in it ? LADY MAUD . ( Amused . ) If she has n't  --  in her Ecstasy  --  tumbled out ! At which moment it is , I think , that the Butler , who of course has had time to do everything outside and get round and back into the House , effectively intervenes ; appears at Left and announces to the two others " Mrs. Charles Tramore ! " She is there upon them , upon the Colonel in particular  --  though I mark Lady M. as not prepared either for the coup de tte of this sudden portentous and dangerous irruption : I see her there upon them , as I say , with the most characteristic Entrance and Aspect possible ; her extreme prettiness and extravagant elegance of preserved youth , of immense care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glassy calm and the charming candid serenity that the Colonel has just appraised in her , and with the note , from the first and always , which is the prime note and value of her personality and effect through the whole play that though she expresses herself at moments with a certain innocent intensity of the superlative , and makes funny little statements about her emotions , opinions , conditions , her visible glossy , dainty , perfectly arranged and unperturbed state betrays at each moment , in the drollest way , the account she gives of herself . She stands there like a lovely large-eyed expensive doll : she says something like : " I felt I had to come up  --  do n't you think ? " It 's her note also that she 's always placidly , tenderly , weakly  --  and one feels at bottom all indifferently  --  appealing . She proceeds with the sweetest , most fixed , least fluttered stare and smile : " I 'm too awfully agitated to sit ! " Meanwhile they 're both upon her ; talking together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . But , my dear , this is dreadful ! But , my dear May , how reckless ! But , my dear May , You 'll spoil all ! " I think this last will probably prove a good cue for her  --  for something in the way of : " Then she will come ! " LADY MAUD . ( In despair , with movements of precaution , while the COLONEL has gone to the window upon the Terrace , to the door Right etc . ) She wo n't come if you dish us ! COLONEL . ( Talking together with LADY MAUD . ) She wo n't come if you make a scandal ! MRS . TRAMORE . ( Absolutely unagitated by every sign , only looking about her with interest , as if taking in , in a perfectly detached way , the place , and its signs and tokens , her Daughter 's habitation . ) She could n't come to me here ? BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER . My dear woman , it 's Madness ! MRS . TRAMORE . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But you do n't know what it is to Wait ! COLONEL . ( Impatient , moving about , shrugging his shoulders , throwing up his hands . ) If you 'd but take it from me what it may be for you not to Wait . MRS . TRAMORE . ( Centre , looking straight before her with her beautiful fixed doll-like eyes . ) I 've waited , you know , for Eighteen Years . LADY MAUD . ( As ready to throw herself upon her to get her out . ) Then you might wait eighteen minutes . Something is said , by her like Ca n't you let her know ? which he echoes with : " Go out to her in the Grounds before everyone ? " Is she in the Grounds ? With all the rest of them ? With my other children ? With twenty Tramores ! Can I see her from there ? They both , as climax of short sharp scene get possession of her for retreat ; the Colonel saying to Lady M. : " Take her , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY MAUD . And not come back ? COLONEL . But do n't you see ? and , Lady M. then disappointedly assenting , Mrs. T. , submitting , has yet an appeal to him : MRS . TRAMORE . You do n't back her ? He throws up his arms : " I back her ! " LADY MAUD says : Then come to us ! He replies : " to-night ! " and hustles them off . Section 3 I see meanwhile , that I did n't jot down , in the above rough adumbration of possibilities , the Colonel 's question to Lady M. as to " Why " it is that Rose wants to go to her Mother ; the thing that brings Lady M. 's reply : " To do her good " ; with , possibly , the Colonel 's demand then of " What good ? " and her retort , to this , of some contributive Value or other . She may only say perhaps : " Ah , you must ask her ! "  --  that is ask Rose herself ; which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation for the so potentially interesting passage , the Climax of the Act between Rose and the Colonel . It drives in the little silver-headed nail for that . Also , there is no hint in the foregoing  --  as how should there be ?  --  of what is almost the major indispensable of the scene , the provision required , so absolutely , so intensely , for the placing , the identification , in relation to the Girl and to her Mother , of each of these two . The passage required , for Value and Effect , that the vision of who and what each of the parties is , who it is , on one side and the other , that is talking thus , that some such perfectly definite little brief basis shall have been made firm and sharp . Exquisitely manageable , however , this ; and by my making Lady M. " do " it about the Colonel , to himself ; and making the Colonel " do " it , in the same degree , to Lady M. , about herself . C'est la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smeared a pictorial note , at any rate , does , I think , vividly justify my sense of this enormous importance of putting in the brief sharp vision , apparition , of Mrs. T. , without a moment 's more delay . No further reference to her has , or can have , required Value or Effect without the momentary production of her . Then the ground becomes firm , the spectator knows where he is ; nothing , in other words , need , or can , prevent the March from being straight and strong . But I 've tumbled into delay again as to memorising just here , before anything else , the order of my little successions . Let me parenthesise , all importantly , first , what I just above stupidly overlooked , that there is no reason for the Colonel 's not himself immediately hustling off the two women , not himself departing with them in order to get them away , unless I give him his explicit motive for remaining ; which is there , fortunately , in perfectly precious little form , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-blown rose from its stem . It comes his reason , his urgent ground for remaining , and his liveliest interest in doing so , exactly from the fact , about Rose 's intention , that Lady M. has imparted to him  --  exactly from this fact in general , and above all from Mrs. Tramore 's last word , her appeal about his " backing " the Girl in particular . " I 'll back her , " he says , and he gives it , with all due point and force , that this is exactly why he does n't go away ; why he remains there , waiting , wanting immediately to see Rose again , all eager to do so  --  both so that he shall serve Mrs. Tramore 's anxiety and his own lively interest . So here is abundance of Provision ; the carpet more and more smoothly laid and tightly drawn . The two women then have no sooner gone than , at Right , the door to what I have called Library and so forth , the one by which the Colonel has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maresfield appears ; having passed in , by the same verisimilitude as the Colonel from the Grounds , and been ready , immediately , to explain her entrance . One would have liked to make her arrive from Left , for a particular reason ; but this is impossible without the appearance of her crossing in that manner with Mrs. T. and Lady M.  --  a fatal stupidity ; and the only thing I lose is my not being able to give her a word about her having come from the quarter that one postulates as the Tea-room . Her reason of presence is immediate  --  she is looking for Rose ; with whom her business , she intimates , is urgent  --  just as the Colonel 's is , we know , on his side ; and since she is apparently by the line of Lady Maresfield 's quest , not now in the Grounds , where at any rate the latter has missed her , it would have been mildly convenient for the Colonel to be able to say , with his own impatient interest , " Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is nothing to waste words on  --  I mean for myself thus  --  and if I give him , immediately , " Wo n't she be  --  if she is n't outside  --  in the Tea-room ? " it comes practically to the same thing . What is fundamental , and of the first importance here , is some formulation of the terms of acquaintance , of intercourse , of preliminary reciprocity , between these two  --  just to match , as it were , the perfectly constituted formulations of the preceding scene ; but with the pressure of Time , of Space , going of course all the while crescendo ; every inch , every instant and fraction of such , being , I need n't say , a precious stinted quantity before Rose 's Entrance . Existing acquaintance , of a vague London order  --  but I wo n't go into that now ; it is exactly what trips me up in this would-be mere bald statement of Sequences : I finish my statement first ; then come back for real , consummate gouging everything out of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constitutive according to its Function ; and I may just note that it surely need n't draw itself out much , in fact ca n't do so , by reason of its thus discounting the scene that follows : all of Lady Mare. ' s business being intensely reservable of course for the latter ; with no clumsy leak in advance . Exquisite , really , for the Form this measure , this perfect sanctity and purity of the Passage or Part true consummately , ideally , to its Function , and keeping its edges as clear and sharp as steel from other muddlements and communities . So much , I say , for what awaits us between Lady Mares. and Rose ; which we arrive at in its order . There is , however , valuably , importantly , or  --  to say the only word  --  constitutively  --  which I see the Colonel handling with her  --  beyond the mere little fact that they both " want " Rose . I ca n't help just worrying this Value here for a moment , in order to formulate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , is that the very flurry and commotion , in either breast , which , on mention of Rose , betrays itself straightway by the holding back of neither , by their breaking ground on the Remarkable Matter or Startling News , they have just learnt , he from the women who have just left him , she from her Son , in the Grounds , on his going out there with his friend  --  I do descry this , I say , as a pictorial contributive Value . It gives the note of the consternation created ; and really gives it the more strongly in proportion as the pair have not really had anything more ( as they may so well , after all , not have been likely to have ) than a mere sketchy , scrappy , casual London acquaintance . But more than this is wanted ; and indeed , stupid that I am , I get it on the instant  --  it having been at the back of my head all the while ; Lady M. becoming straightway for the Colonel , the sharp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conventional , social view , " of Rose 's projected action . She gives him this , of course ; whereby I take it as figuring for him as a Determinant , in his own predisposed sense  --  that is as the sketch for the large formidable picture , to be hung up now in Chester Square , say , of the arrayed , the inimical , ignoring , cold-shouldering , dropping and cutting scandalised proper world . Moreover , as I instantly see , on exerting the smallest squeeze , I obtain here other Values , other little sharp , crisp Values , that neither of the two previous passages could give me , and that , though here just within the limit , are essentially of the sort that ca n't brook another moment 's holding over . Not sharply , not possibly " formulated " yet , one immediately grasps , the Truth of the Peculiar Horror and Scandal , the Unprecedented Degree of the Commotion , surrounding poor Mrs. Tramore 's Case 18 years before : the most important point in the world this , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my little Tale in its way set forth , on the fact that all this histoire was prodigiously Exceptional  --  in the supposed Displeasingness of its features , an affair standing altogether by its dreadful , uneffaceable , unforgivable Self ; so that the Attitude of Society has ever been in the same degree Exceptional , with not a muscle of its rigour relaxed , nor a symptom of the common inevitable eventual Condonation yet beginning to peep . Of the essence that this vital truth shall be established at the earliest possible juncture  --  whereby I had been taking for granted that it might just a little be dealt with between the Colonel and Lady Maud . There is , indubitably , some little place for it there ; but it has to reckon there  --  being of course moreover wholly out of the question in the previous scene , which needfully stretches the nature of Eric 's allusion to his Mother to the utmost length  --  with the sharp celerity of that encounter , which loses truth , on the spot , if it loses a certain breathlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first moment of the golden opportunity ; in conjunction with which it figures to me further , by the blessed law that the squeezed material , once it is real material , always gives out , as it were , the precious phosphorescent glimmer of what one needs  --  that here exactly pops in my germ of what I need the Colonel most particularly to " give " about the actual present facts of Mrs. T. 's position and existence ( for herself ) and , coincidently with this , of the form and habit of his own sustained Countenance of her , his continued , in short , friendship for her . He must make his little vivid statement with a sharp , effective radiation of rather droll , pitiful Picture in it , of what the current fact and features literally and familiarly ( to him ) are ; not " discounting " even this , however , in view of what I reserve for him , at Climax , with Rose . He has facts to give her about her Mother ; though , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , I seem to make out the case for their being most predominantly , quite most , administered to Lady Maresfield . She brings them on , as it were ; promptly " voicing , " as the newspapers say , the reprobation of the world , and forecasting it , though again , remember well , without discounting what I reserve for her with Rose . Her tone , her attitude , affect and aggravate the Colonel , who , given his idiosyncracies , is driven into sharper opposition by them ; so that he positively " draws " her a little , into portrayal of the particular consistency and duration of the terms of the poor lady 's outlawry  --  under the ban ( pile this up ) as London has never really seen a woman once well-connected before : all of which promotes what I want , for Clearness and Sharpness from the moment Rose comes on on the part of the Colonel . It is at the Climax then of Lady Maresfield 's own " statement , " as it were , in which her allusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something of that sort , rings out  --  it is at this juncture , I say , and quite as if she may have caught the expression as she stands there , that Rose appears : the Colonel seeing her first and raising a sharp hand of caution , an imperative " Hush ! " as he becomes aware of her . She arrives up at Back from the Grounds and stands there a moment , in her birthday array , framed by the window-space and gravely looking from one to the other in a manner to suggest her guessing without difficulty to what this appearance of a somewhat heated passage between them refers itself , and who it is Lady Maresfield is in the act of denouncing . With which I immediately remember the stupid omission , in the immediately foregoing , of what I had in view definitely to note : the circumstance of Lady Mare. ' s mentioning to the C. , on her own entrance , not only that she has thought Rose might be in the room , but has thought she might be awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Grounds five minutes before  --  that is the older woman 's having mentioned to the younger  --  that she would like so immensely a few minutes privately , as might be , with her . Yes , she has said this to the C. , directly , for presentation of a motive ; and she seems to convey that it is her habit to assume that when she has made such intimations of her desires , she mostly finds them promptly taking effect . This by itself is a note , for that matter , that just perceptibly aggravates the Colonel ; he puts it quite forth , on his side , that he is staying on purpose for a word with the Girl ; in connection with which I really seem to see the " fat on the fire , " as it were , a little between them . To which , still further , let me note , just here , that it has glimmered before me as a little elementary effect that Lady Mare. ' s denunciation , representation , misrepresentation , indignant evocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous colours , in fine , in which she brushes her off , gains for us , gains for irony and comedy , by the fact that we have just had Mrs. T. in our eye , in her habit as she so remarkably lives , survives and blooms ; and that I also constater that Lady Mare. has never at all seen her , I mean in the multitude of London chances , which Guy has profited by ; and that this marks the particular circle of revolution in which Lady M. goes round  --  all such chances being really out of her ken . She is really the dry hard kind of grim dragon of a British Matron ; with the attenuation or aggravation of her characteristic desire to push her advantages and provide for her young . Rose , at any rate , is meanwhile there , as much " led up to " as can possibly be perpetrated ; and with Lady M. 's instantly checking and recovering herself enough to greet her all eagerly with an " Oh , it 's so sweet of you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having completed at her ease , as it were , her look from the Colonel to the lady , and from the lady to the Colonel , receives with a reserve , or even with a vague protest that appears to indicate that she has n't come for this formidable Visitor at all . In fact  --  I seize the conviction  --  she makes it clear , for my presently-to-be-realised advantage , that this is particularly not the case : she simply looks , keeps looking , like a sort of beautiful young Fate at the elder woman quite hard for a minute , and even disconcerting the latter 's own fine hardness perceptibly by doing so , and by making no acknowledgement of the speech just addressed to her . I seem to want her to convey that the phrase , the tone " that horrible woman ! " or whatever it is , continues to ring in her ears . Then , when her attitude has sufficiently conduced to this rather striking image , it is to the Colonel she speaks , and quite , for him , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . ROSE . I 'm so glad to find you  --  for three words . ( Then as she comes down , brushing past , as it were , LADY MARESFIELD ; speaking only to the COLONEL . ) I was afraid you had gone without speaking to me . Lady Mare. instantly breaks in , before he has had time to do more than make a gesture , as with her prior claim : which bits only await treatment . The Colonel does the graceful thing , gives way , and there is an exchange or two during which Rose says nothing to their companion ; only says to him that he must then come back to her  --  and that he had better meanwhile go and have his tea properly . He promises his return , and his exit to Left leaves her with Lady Maresfield ; toward whom her attitude , not a little inscrutable , is that of not breaking silence till she is forced , as it were , of leaving the burden of approach , the inevitable floundering and embarrassment  --  if Lady M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lady M. , has n't , in point of fact , any delicacy and immediately shows it : she straightway mentions to Rose that her Son Guy has just told her , just repeated to her  --  as it was his duty  --  what Eric Tramore has told him : viz. of her entertained , of her nourished , of her domestically imparted intention of " seeing " her Mother . I go on , with my Concatenation , straight from here ; but again ca n't help just parenthetically noting , memorising , that this must quite definitely " give " that Lady Mare. knows it only from her Son ; so that we have it definite that , as the Colonel has just been shown as knowing it only from Lady Maud , so , evidently and definitely , the thing has n't as yet spread abroad . It is precisely in order to speak before it has had time to do so  --  and this exactly is the manner in which she puts it  --  that Lady Mare. now presents , announces , describes and images herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Society . I give her this Function  --  the grand gist and essence of which is that if she does carry out her perversity Rose will simply find that she ca n't decently marry . Or she puts this at least for Climax , luridly presents first , the other things she forfeits ; showing moreover that she has n't needed to have , as yet , from old Mrs. Tramore the family view of her wicked course : she has gathered that sufficiently from her Son 's echo of Eric 's tone . A truce , however , to this immediate lingering ; everything has to be come back to in such abysmal detail , and with such exhaustive thoroughness . Suffice it that the scene terminates with Bertram Jay 's advent : he being announced by the Butler , Left , at exactly the right psychological moment . He is discomforting too , in his degree and manner to Lady Maresfield , thanks to the possibilities or presumptions as to his " carrying off " Rose , that cluster about him and some foretaste of which she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the fact that if I do n't get my " Preparation " for this Entrance between the two women in some way or other I do n't get it at all . This highly vital fact , with its lesson to be extracted to the last drop ; while I for the moment just now jot down that the Young Man determines Lady M. 's exit , that after this scene between the Others then , that is with its sequel , the " shank " of the Act , his exit is determined by the entrance of Julia Tramore , the aunt , from Grounds with request from her Mother , the old woman , still grimly encamped under her tree , that he will come out to see her . He goes , by Back after appealing to Rose for prospect of his seeing her again before leaving . Julia observes on this , conceivably if not monstrously , that perhaps after he has seen her Mother he wo n't want to see her niece , and then , on his exit , has her own highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this I do n't pretend to go at this moment ; suffice it that her exit is determined by Jay 's return from Grounds , after his Interview with the old woman , and with his request to her Daughter that she will immediately go to her . Exit Miss Tramore ; on which I get Jay 's second and contrasted scene , his transformed attitude and appeal , to the Girl . He of course on his first entrance had arrived , late , straight from town ; having heard nothing , knowing nothing . I get , I say , my Big Value for this encounter , which culminates then in the Colonel 's return , as by his previous agreement ; producing Jay 's exit and departure . Then my Grand Climax , as it were , of the Situation of Rose and Colonel , culminating  --  well , in what I make it culminate in ; and Curtain . I am much moved to strain on to a preliminary rough ciphering-out of Second ; but such a cloud of considerations still hangs about what I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment longer . All sorts of things come up ; as for instance , in the light of future needs and opportunities , the whole of the future Situation , the question of the best Value for the Maresfield Young Man , as to whom my indication at the beginning of this Act is of course a mere vague hint , the survival of what was in the Tale ; a form that will clearly take great bettering , in respect to what one may wish to get out of him , to do with him and use him for , in the further complexity . I see of course that the Tale really gives me nothing for him that is of special value here ; and as one wants of course but to go in for Interest at any price , he must be conceived in the light of that interest ; as to which I find myself just catching a considerable Glimmer , to be further caught , to be exhaustively worked out , further on . And then , as regards the foregoing , there are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possible , or rather and inevitable , Developments and Intensifications , from Rose 's entrance on , she remaining on to Curtain , as the extremely interesting Agent and Centre of them all : to say nothing , for that matter , of those that precede her entrance  --  though I must n't even accidentally speak as if the Whole thing were not one Intense and Continuous Fusion . On the degree to which the matter of the relation of my Young Woman and principal Young Man has to be , and will be , ca n't help , in my hands , becoming , richly and charmingly Interesting , I need n't Discant : there are so many things in it  --  as , for that matter , there are such innumerable workable and desirable things , right and left , at every turn , in all the rest . But this is my Horse-of-Battle , my High Ridge of Interest and to keep it so , vividly , from beginning to end , is of course the golden key to  --  well , to what I want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I wanted particularly to note is that , as my rough adumbration stands , I get the Family Opposition to the Girl directly embodied only in her Situation with Julia Tramore , who represents thus , of course , represents officially and portentously , as it were , the Family , speaks for Them , for her august old Mother , the suggested Image of whom , invisible , but intense , and ruling the scene in spite of her absence from it , one wishes somehow to make felt , to make felt , to make appreciable , to cause , as it were , effectively and , I say , portentously , to play through . Miss Tramore represents , above all , and " voices " the dead Father and the view he would take of the case were he there ; speaks for this , urges this , makes it definite , gives it all its Value ; gives their Value , above all , to the facts , the sharp material facts that represent , collectively , the consequences and penalties , the losses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must know with the most perfect clearness what these are , with what clearness they are present to herself , and with what clearness present to Bertram Jay , after his interview with old Mrs. Tramore has made them so . I want them present also  --  by which I mean represented as present to the Brother , and Sister ; for whom , with these things , as I even thus roughly thresh them out , and therefore , evidently , still more , as I shall consummately cipher them in detail ; for whom , I say , the Climax of Act I strikes me , even under this light pressure , and as a consequence of this vague squeeze , as having more use and play than the foregoing scratches glance at . Yes , I want , all naturally , my Climax here enriched and , as it were , amplified as much as possible ; and there are uses for the Brother and Sister in conducing to such enrichment and amplification . In the jottings , or as I say , the scratches , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , this would result , that each of my Situations or cumulative passages , from Rose 's Entrance to End would consist of two persons , practically ; since the overlapping two or three times of a third does n't count to speak of . This is very well , but I need n't in the least accept it as final ; and I have my Brother and Sister all convenient , all contributive , all logically , and in fact indispensably , involved , for some small creation of the relief of Number . There Glimmer upon me the ways , the lights , in which They may fill out , animate and curiously , amusingly , ironically , illustrate , in the interest of fine Comedy , the Family Attitude exemplified by Miss Tramore  --  to which they give further body and colour . The simplest way to put it , and it immediately and dramatically imposes them , is that , as they profit handsomely by everything Rose relinquishes and forfeits , I must have them there to do so ; have them there for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features and illustrations of their partly priggish , partly rueful , in any case pictured and presented state of Conformity , of disciplined submission , of interested calculation ( though not in the least heinous , or really ugly , of course ) may be achievable for them . Beautiful and exquisite problems the very keeping of all this in the Tone , the right and bright and light , and always interesting , but never ugly , not overdone , nor in any way miscarrying or deviating , or , I need n't say , blundering , Ironic . The working in of Eric and Edith , or whatever their names may confoundedly be , is a part of the little goldmine that awaits me again to dig in ; suffice it for the moment that I see them as presently reinforcing their Aunt in her Supreme Appeal , as , after a bit , associated with her in it ; or perhaps even as kept in abeyance then , to be associated and admirably involved in my Climax Proper , as I must call it , the Situation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World , her old contributive Chorus and Critic and Precious General Agent , the Colonel . So many things crowd upon one in these widenings and intensifyings of Vision , that one scarce knows which first to clutch at , and one , for the moment , pushes in and overlies the next , driving it , driving them , out of one 's head . Thus , for instance , the vital little truth of one 's definitely seeing the Course of Action in the Girl develope , before one 's eyes , under dramatic Determinations , from moment to moment and point to point : which is but a little way , precisely , of stating the very principle and meaning and beauty of Drama . It is a Concatenation of things visibly , appreciably , terribly or comically , at any rate logically and traceably determined within the frame of the picture before one 's eyes ; of every golden grain of applicable sense and force in which axiom I neither more nor less than propose that every inch of my March , and every touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I cling to is the Vision of her being precipitated , on the spot , and before us , to her Step ; with everything that happens to her  --  and the whole of the Show , from her Entrance , is describable as a close succession of things happening to her  --  promoting the necessity , creating the inevitability , of her ( so to speak ) Deed . It grows there before us ; all the others , that is , all save the Colonel , whose Function is a thing entirely apart , minister to its growth by the Fatuity ( blest word  --  that 's the comprehensive , vivid Idea I want ) of their attempting just the opposite ; so that really a lovely description of her line , of her situation and little history , is that it 's a struggle , direct and intimate , with surrounding and appealing and would-be smothering Fatuity . Fatuous everyone , fatuous with the exception , all and always , the precious Colonel ,  --  with whom the interest and charm of her tie is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective ways the figures of 2nd and 3rd , fatuous Lady Maud , fatuous the young Maresfield scion , whose elder Brother , decidedly , dies , is killed by some hunting accident or something , between 1st and 2nd. , so that his social and matrimonial value have gone straight up ; and so that when in II I confront him , in the midst of Rose 's Desolation , as I must call it , before Bertram Jay has played round and up , vulgarly speaking , I may confront him with the Girl as a temporarily thinkable Relief or Alternative or Solvent or Issue , or even slight Bribe ; for I gather it to be a part of the complexity here that he really does care for her . The making right of his type entails of course a thorough and interesting working-out of his Mother 's and of his curious and " amusing " relation with her . Fatuous , above all ,  --  and this is just really , for irony and comedy and charm and grace and interest and pathos and Everything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drama of their relation , his and Rose 's , the full extraction of meaning and picture from it is in the process of her reduction , conversion , transformation , clarification , illumination , of this element in him till his fine high-toned priggishness , with all sorts of good things beneath and behind it , becomes under her conscious and intelligent pressure , a " finer humanity " ; a wider and kinder and brighter and more detached and amused sense of things , and of her situation and mission in particular ; as to which I keep thinking of sidelights beautiful and valuable and helpful and droll , all the while on the part of the Colonel . The conversion of Jay , as well as the Bringing Out of her Mother , becomes thus the very description of what we see her actively and subtly and charmingly about , as consciously and fondly , even , capable of till she brings it to full Fruition ; which full Fruition is the vague and remote and most embracingly general label for my Climax of Second  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong as one turns the matter over , that , very presumably , the Climax of the brief and rapid situation of the Colonel and the two women should be , over and beyond his vow to " back " Rose , her demanding of him this , that he let her Daughter know of her having been there , of his having waved her away , and of her having yielded on condition of his thus immediately telling Rose . She makes it her condition of going . He promises  --  then she goes . ACT SECOND I have to break ground here , I feel , from very far off indeed , to approach my place of Siege , by rather wide circumvallations , beginning with considerations quite general , and drawing closer drawing in , from these to the more particular and to the Centre . On the face of it one 's subject here has the air of presenting rather more the aspect or category of the Difficult  --  as if , however , really , any thing appreciably worth doing , in these conditions were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , speaking , as I say most Generally , the Act , is , by its nature , in a large degree , or at all events in an appreciable one , the picture of a State or Status : full of character , full of colour , full of comedy , full in a word of things , including lively Interest ( as I see and feel it all ) ; but with the March and the Movement to be , doubtless , by due need , a little more artfully and ingeniously and scientifically extracted from it than in the case of what has preceded . What I most rudimentarily get , at any rate , is that I think , to begin with , a term of not much less than two years , in fact even a little more , has elapsed since the beginning of the last interval ; two years that have run their course for Rose 's Domestication with her Mother . Speaking again in an elementary fashion , all the warnings and vaticinations addressed to her in First bore on what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most lurid , or at least intensely deterrent symbols : in spite of which she went her way . Well , now we have as first conditioned the picture of what she really was " in for " ; what she has been , all this time , and still is , " in for . " The time seems considerable , but I somehow do n't make it out as less : it has to be considerable to present its meaning and bear its fruit . It becomes thus indeed a little longer than a term of two years , since I seem experimentally to disengage that they , the persons the thing gives me , are all together , toward the summer 's end , gathered at some little foreign place to which Rose , now completely managing her Mother 's life ( " She believes in you , " the Colonel says to the Girl with whom he is now an immense chum , " as she believes in the Preservation of her Figure , the Understanding of that Figure by her Paris Dressmaker "  --  or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstition or sign and token , that passes with poor Mrs. Tramore for a rule of life , a Working Faith ) , has conducted her , in the absolute and unperturbed inveteracy of their ever being invited anywhere ; anywhere , that is , that they will go  --  by which I mean that Rose , with her plan of campaign , her pious demonic subtlety , will consent to their going . Potentially exquisite , it gleams upon me here , the exhibition for their present situation , of this Generalship of exclusion , selection , discretion , precaution , high and delicate fastidiousness , as to their contacts and doings ; even though it happens that , till something really worth while comes , the effect of it is to leave them all high and dry , utterly isolated , frequented , haunted , encompassed , for the nearer circle with no one but the Colonel and Lady Maud and young Maresfield and One Other Man , I seem speculatively to grope toward , a compromising man , a dreadful man , a man with amusement to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipwreck or crisis , who keeps imaging and symbolising and recording it , as for that matter Lady Maud does too , in her somewhat different way ; though all under Rose 's superior Control and Conduct and Compression : a part of the state of things that have ended in the absolute collective , grateful , plastic , comic , devout submission to her as their eventual Guide and Redeemer out of Bondage , if they will only be utterly good , and take the Law from her in every particular . There float before me Patches , as this most preliminary Process is but a floating before one of Patches  --  as of awfully characteristic and " comico-ironic " Exhibition of this high prudent system of vigilance , exclusion , selection , and all that sort of thing , on Rose 's part , as for the organisation of her eventual victory : though just let me note here before I break off , that as each of my Acts essentially embodies a Crisis , and is , organically , the picture of the Crisis , so this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Crisis of Discouragement  --  presenting first the high bleak table-land , as it were , of the very Desolation of their general Propriety ; which as yet has led to nothing at all  --  so that the March , here , can only be , all designated and indicated , as that of what it begins , under visible , vivid Determination , to lead to . It begins , I say ; we see it so begin , as soon as the Desolation is duly and adequately presented and constate ; then the March is that of its further logical , and awfully dramatic and interesting , Development to a Climax . The way I seem to see them is , as it were , at some last gasp of their high and dry state , their dreadful , desperate , fruitless propriety and respectability , reaching the vividest , drollest , blankest neutrality , as it were , in every direction and relation , on the part of Mrs. Tramore , and with the apparent failure of Rose 's sacrifice , her devotion , her diplomacy , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I keep lumping Lady Maud with them , for the sake of the illustrative possibilities of " quaintness " of her ,  --  in a worldly and social way , the particular way for which she has laboured . She has laboured , she has calculated and plotted , to float her Mother back into the innermost waters of the Harbour of Safety , and Mrs. Tramore , blandly and prayerfully passive , with her indefeasible superficiality and frivolity and amiability and juvenility , her utterly shallow , and serene passivity has sat , arrayed and hatted and gloved , ready to the last twist of a ribbon , to disembark , as it were , on the sacred strand ; but with no summons whatever , no faint symptom of a call , an opportunity , a possibility , yet looming into sight . In short the situation depicted with all its foreshortened vividness in the Tale . My cue for Mrs. T. 's aspect and image throughout Act II is just the little figure that I think I used in the Tale ; that of her sitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of her chair , with " her things on , " as waiting for the carriage which is to come and take her and drive her to some happy place to which she has not the faintest chance of going . Well , so things are  --  only with the faithful Colonel , always hovering , always revolving , always returning , and above all , always interested , intensely interested in Rose , always amused , amusing and tremendously Contributive . The particular Hour , as I feel it , is one at which the situation seems to " kind of " threaten to crack and give way as by excess of tension ; as by having got , though to an extent they all loyally dissimulate , on all their nerves  --  especially of course on Rose 's , whose wound-up and overdone state , smilingly as she masks it , is in a manner the key of what we see happen . The Colonel comes and goes with his protected and privileged contacts and communities  --  he brings in reports of the outer life ; he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowledge . If Rose has learned a short time before of the death of her Grandmother , and of what has happened at home since , as it were , that is of her own disinherited and further proscribed and condemned and branded state , it is all and only through the Colonel ; as to which bereavement , moreover , I seem to see that she , as for perfect decorum , has put on light , perfunctory , though highly becoming , technically respectful and decorous mourning . Such is the image , that of very charming and simple qualified mourning , a summer array of " tasteful " black and white , that she presents in this Act . Say we take her at the moment when it has really come up for her , under some Determination , quite supremely , whether she can " stand " it , any longer , the dreary impasse of her situation ; whether she can stand it for another month , week , day or hour . Say they have gone to the little place , which I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as might have been propitious quiet resort in the Austrian or Bavarian Tyrol , on some calculation of her 's , Rose 's very own , worked out entirely by herself , that some " good , " of a vague , sweet , blessed sort , would thereby come to them ; say that they have taken rooms in a sort of chalet or Dependance of the main little hotel , which has its garden in common with the latter ; the ladies being lodged together in the Dependance and the Colonel just a little way off at the hotel . Say , further , in conformity with this , that their presence has been somehow blighting , measurably detrimental , in regard to a small circle , as it were , of English habitus , on whom the landlord largely counts , has counted , from year to year , for his month of September or whatever ; and say some effect , some consciousness , distinctly depressing and menacing , of this kind , is in the air on rise of Curtain , with our attestations of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered salient , amusing , interesting . Say we get it not only that they have Broken Down , but that this has somehow to-day got to be Recognised ; say it comes up for them too unmistakably , and that the brunt of it is what Rose , trustedly , really quite unchallengedly , but all discouragedly , dejectedly , even all sceptically now at last , has to meet . They have it there , somehow  --  they have it before them that they ca n't " go on , " as it were , unless something happens , since none of the things originally dreamed of have as yet in the least done so ; and I want to give the note of Rose 's Temptation , as it were , which she feels might become sharp on this , were it only to take the form of lurid Opportunity  --  the temptation , in other words , to throw up her sorry game , to " chuck " her vain speculation and clear out , saving at least her own skirts or skin . For she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within an inch of her life ; the society of the outlawed , of the supposedly " unspeakable , " has come at last to excruciate her  --  that is her Mother 's which is the real crux , has  --  by its desperate vapidity , vacuity and propriety . What I seem to clutch , as Constatations , in their order , or at any rate in their cluster ( since the order requires , obviously , full threshing out ) is that , perhaps first , of their appreciable Detrimentalism as to the little place they occupy ; their having prevented this , that and the other annual visitor from coming , or having determined this , that or the other annual visitor , and his wife and daughters , prematurely to depart ; their having , in fine , in some appreciable way exercised an uncanny and disquieting influence  --  which makes the landlord say , though appreciating them too , for the expense they are at , fidget and wonder and appear moved to bring the so odd matter to a head . Mettons that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with all their leisure  --  no late engagements or complications to keep them in town !  --  and so are encamped ; with , after all , the Effect of their Presence , I hint to myself , a matter of Appreciation more by themselves , as an acute consciousness of their Detrimentalism , than a ground for the landlord 's worriment  --  an element that , I see , would n't plausibly work , and that I do n't really need . It 's all a question with and for and roundabout Themselves ; this , properly dealt with , making it quite a sufficient little silver-mine for all my Values . Their vision becomes thus a consciousness of everything as Negative ; they have n't even the thrill or incident of shocking people and driving them away ; they so create the desert about Them that , in the oddest , uncanniest , as well as drollest , way in the world , there are no People , to be , in any manner affected ; all of which is a part of what is thrown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I somehow seem to want to make some of the wrong people come , and I see thus that I do perfectly descry reason to be grateful for my Second Man , as I call him , the representative of the true Detrimental as distinguished from Themselves ; the one whom they have never been able to get rid of , and whom in London , with whatever sneaking fondness for him still , they constantly have to try to suppress and relegate . I seem to see , as a happy value that , given their desperation now , they are only all too glad to have him again , with what he may have brought them from outside , from elsewhere , to relieve them of the burden of Themselves . I catch the tip of the tail of the idea that the three women are at the very first alone on the ground , at the place , together , and have been so for some little time , and that this ministers , in due course , to desperation  --  that is to desperation for Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  matters , that is , to Us . The tip of this tail would seem to give me the successive arrivals , from elsewhere , of the four or five men : that is of my Second Man , as I call him , of the Colonel , of the Maresfield Scion , and of Bertram Jay . Each of these Contributive , each of these sharp Determinants . Besides , or rather with which , with everything to be disengaged from the richness , there flare at me the two images , as I thus parenthetically clutch at them , of what I call Lady Maud 's Case , the case of her Demoralisation , for Rose to deal with ; the case of her not Playing the Game ( awfully precious this clue or note , for presentation of Rose , of her vigilance as to their Playing the Game ; ) and the case of the Awful Person , probably Impossible Woman , previously known and " shed , " bearing down on them , and who must be as wildly waved away as the Colonel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the acute Discussion of their state , even as might be among Survivors on a Raft , casting about and differing as to what it is best to do . The waves of Discussion breaking against Rose 's mask or armour of fortitude , but with such possible ironic amusement and interest in the presentation of it all . Everyone , that is each , is shown as demoralised , except Mrs. Tramore whose glassy surface of exquisite Ignorance never for an instant belies itself  --  though ah , the possibilities of all this crowd upon me almost too thick for discrimination . But steady and easy , step upon step : what I disengage for the instant , stated with the last crudity , is these differences in the two or three Demoralisations of which I see the Colonel as more or less the confidant . What I meant just now by Lady Maud 's Case is her aspect and share in what I have called the frank Break-down . She does , all cynically give it up as a vain job ; and though she makes Rose no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Rose has it out with her , just as she would have it out with Rose if she dared , that Opportunity is all that is wanted for each of them somehow to collapse . Say Lady Maud wants , positively , cynically and admittedly , the Impossible Woman , their old pal  --  wants her for the simple change and relief and diversion and vulgarity she 'll bring . " My dear , she 's so delightfully vulgar  --  and we 're just dying for want of that ; with our perfect Distinction that has landed us on this sand-bank . Do let us have her , before we all become idiots ! "  --  or something of that sort . Rose is " Disappointed " in her , and has to be austere and explicit about it ; catching her , however  --  for I seem really to require it  --  in some act , some covert fact , of the course of subterfuge that I have called not playing Fair . And yet with , all the while , this hauntedness of her own by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back matter NOTE FOR " THE CHAPERON " PAGE 455 HJ to Pinero , 28 May 1893 ( U ) : I am indebted to Mr. Harold Moulton for the text of this letter .

" I saw Molire done  --  more delicately and deliciously than words can say , " he wrote to his mother , expressing regret that he could not have spent more time in the French capital . " I should have learned bien des choses at the Thtre Franais . ... " He returned to Cambridge later that year , and early in 1871 reported to Charles Eliot Norton that he was busy " scribbling some little tales . " That spring a group of Boston ladies decided to stage an elaborate fair in aid of the destitute people of France , victims of the Franco-Prussian war . Susan Hale , sister of Edward Everett Hale , assumed the editorship of a little sheet which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literary great of Boston and Concord . Henry James , whose sympathies for the French were keen , contributed Still Waters and it appeared in the second of the six numbers of the Balloon Post , on April 12 , 1871 . The plot of this sketch  --  that of a passive hero , worshipping the heroine in silence , ready to abdicate in another 's favor  --  resembles that of such early tales as The Story of a Year and A Most Extraordinary Case and foreshadows many later situations including that of Guy Domville . The triangle indeed is not unlike that of the later play and the renunciatory hero has much in common with Guy . His last words , " Farewell . Be happy  --  be very happy , " have the same ring as the speech James was to write for Guy thirty years later . " Be kind to him . Be good to her . Be good to her . " The title of Still Waters suggests that of Tom Taylor 's play Still Waters Run Deep which James saw as a boy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heroines  --  James 's is Emma , Taylor 's was Emily . The text here published is taken from the Library of Congress copy of the Balloon Post . A NOTE ON THE TEXTS In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication , over a period of two decades , the editor was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . The corrections and emendations were such as occur in the progress of a modern play from the dramatist 's desk , through the production office into the theatre . James was called upon to revise his plays many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  that is of truth , fidelity to text and to the writer 's intentions  --  while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would serve : that of demonstrating their role in Henry James 's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some producer might be caught in the process  --  provide the means for the appearance of at least some of them on the American stage . I therefore directed my editing to this end . It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors . It was thus possible to give the mutations of James 's first important effort in the theatre , including a variant fourth act . As regards the other plays , a simple principle was applied . Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the cuts restored ; in a few minor instances there were cuts followed by alterations and where these were in James 's hand they were accepted as his final reading ; where there were simply cuts , these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons ' typescripts of the play , I decided that it would be of interest to publish the text as actually performed on the stage in 1909 , which James had approved , despite a number of alterations and cuts . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed ; as the short story Covering End and in the final form it took when it reached the stage . While James went over most of the manuscripts of his plays , making corrections and verbal changes , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization . In some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech ; these have been spelled out as an aid to readability . Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips 's Bibliography of the Writings of Henry James ( New York , 1930 ) , pp. 26-27 , 46-47 and 115-16 .

Miss Emma is not so fond of my society . HORACE . Oh , indeed !  --  You know poor Mrs. Meredith has a dreadful headache , and Miss Emma  --  FELIX . No ! it dates , I regret to say , from before the headache . But perhaps our talking here disturbs the headache . She 's capital company . It 's a great bore having her laid up . HORACE . I 'm in hopes she 's asleep . I 've just been down to the druggist 's , in the village , to get this prescription . ( Takes out a little phial wrapped up . ) FELIX . Ah , you 've walked to the village ! Is n't it extremely hot ? HORACE . ( Wiping his brow . ) A little warmish . But I took an umbrella . FELIX . Oh , you took an umbrella ! ( Aside . ) Confound him ! My young lady is moving away . HORACE . You 've been sketching , I see . FELIX . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sunday afternoon . ( Eagerly . ) By the way  --  you 're an engineer , you sketch yourself ,  --  would n't you like to turn over my drawings ? ( Thrusts the portfolio at him . ) HORACE . Oh , you 're very kind . FELIX . Dear me ! Who is the young lady there on the rocks ? Really , I think it 's Miss  --  what's-her-name ?  --  who was here last evening . Is n't it rather unsafe down there , wandering about at haphazard ? There 's a hole there  --  you come upon it suddenly ! Excuse me , I 'll go down and tell her about that hole . ( Disappears in the direction of the shore . ) HORACE . ( Holding the portfolio and looking after him . ) Happy man !  --  happy , stupid , clever man ! ( Turning over the drawings . ) More stupid than clever , in the matter of drawing . If I were to make such a sketch as that , people would laugh at me . I 'm little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet high , with enormous whiskers and a still more enormous impudence ,  --  and so , with all his enormities , people swallow him whole . I 'm a gnat and he 's a camel ! Emma , poor girl , she has swallowed him whole ; but she finds him hard fare . ( Looking a while at FELIX 'S sketch . ) Come ; is she in love with the man who has drawn those rocks like parlor settees and that shimmering ocean like parlor carpet ? She 's in love with some one , that 's very plain ; and not with me , that 's plainer still . With whom then , but with Mr. Felix ?  --  Mr. Felicissimus ! And he , under the circumstances  --  the dromedary !  --  he can think of nothing more to the point than to go down under her very nose to pick up a flirtation on the rocks . Oh , sensibility ! She avoids him , forsooth ! Has n't the man half an eye ? Wait till you 're in love , Mr. Felix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not be so idiotic . ( Laying down the portfolio , he sees on the bench a little book , which he takes up . ) Adelaide Proctor 's poems . Dear me ! Miss Emma 's own , and with marginal notes and elucidations , in her own sweet , sloping hand . Lovely womanish scratches and dashes ! Happy Miss Adelaide Proctor ! I should like immensely to puzzle out her notes . I wonder whether she would miss it . She 'll think it 's Felix , and that will make her happy ,  --  half-happy , half-miserable , as people are when they 're in love  --  even when the loved object is absolutely indifferent , or , what is worse , partial to another ! Poor girl , I ought to feel for her ! As she is , I am ; shadows chasing shadows . I 'll borrow the book for an hour and take it down to the rocks and read these divine hieroglyphics . ( Just as he has put the volume into his pocket , EMMA appears . ) EMMA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience . ) O Horace , here you are ! We did n't know what had become of you . HORACE . It was a little hot , Miss Emma . I was unable to walk as fast as I should have liked to do . But I 've got the medicine . I hope Mrs. Meredith is better . EMMA . Better ! my dear Horace , headaches do n't go off like that ! She 's trying to sleep . ( Looking round her . ) I thought Mr. Felix was here . HORACE . ( Aside . ) I 've no doubt she did . Behold the pure essence of love ! Runs away when he comes and runs after him when he goes . He was here , a few moments ago , but he went down to the rocks . He seems a little  --  a little bored , if I may say so . EMMA . Poor fellow ! You ought to try and amuse him , Horace . HORACE . I never amused any one . EMMA . Yes , you 're very odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a lady too ! What lady is that ? HORACE . The young lady , I believe , who was here last evening . So said Mr. Felix . EMMA . He must have very good eyes , to recognize her from here . HORACE . He has an eye for distant objects . EMMA . ( Aside . ) Yes , rather than for near ones . What does he find to say to Miss Walsingham all this while ? He hardly knows her . HORACE . He is warning her against that hole . EMMA . What hole , pray ? HORACE . The great hole in the rocks , which one may so easily fall into . EMMA . My poor Horace , what are you talking about ? There is no hole within a mile . Ah ! whose sketch is that ? HORACE . Not mine , I assure you . EMMA . ( Taking it up . ) Of course not ,  --  how interesting ! HORACE . There is a lot more in the portfolio . Look them over ; I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know I want to ! Pray , sir , what do you mean ? HORACE . ( Aside . ) Ah , that blush ! Could any one make her blush so for me ? Here comes the great painter , himself . You can tell him how much you like it . ( FELIX , crossing the lawn , reappears on the piazza . ) EMMA . I ca n't stay : I must be off with my medicine . ( She lingers , however , and , to give herself a pretext , unwraps the little bottle which HORACE has given her . ) FELIX . ( Strolling forward . ) It was n't Miss Walsingham , after all . But I saw a very pretty face for my trouble . HORACE . I 've been seeing a prettier one , with no trouble at all . FELIX . ( Staring , aside . ) Compliments ! What is the man up to ? EMMA . ( After a silence , turning away , to herself . ) Has he nothing to say to that ? But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwrapped her bottle , with a little cry . ) Why , Horace ! HORACE . Dear me ! have I erred ? EMMA . Altogether . I told you essence , a dozen times  --  essence , essence , essence ; and you 've brought me tincture . FELIX . My dear fellow , how could you ? HORACE . Dear me ! ca n't she take that ? EMMA . Why , they have directly opposite effects . FELIX . One 's a sedative  --  the other 's a stimulant . HORACE . Why , I thought you said tincture , you know ! I went along repeating to myself  --  tincture , tincture , tincture ! EMMA . I 'm sorry . I would send Michael , but unfortunately , Sunday afternoons  --  FELIX . He goes in search of a certain tincture on his own account ! HORACE . Oh , I 've made the mistake ! I shall be happy to repair it . EMMA . That 's a good fellow . HORACE . ( Aside . ) A good fellow ! Blessed mistake !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't hurry ; you know it 's hot . Essence , remember . HORACE . Quintessence , I promise you ! FELIX . ( Aside . ) The squirrel hath a wit ! By the way , since you 're going into the village again , perhaps you would n't mind doing me a favor . Do get me a state-room on to-night 's boat . A good one , you know , away from the engine . EMMA . ( Starting . ) Ah ! Mr. Felix , you 're going ? FELIX . I 'm afraid I must be off . EMMA . ( After a pause . ) My sister will be sorry . HORACE . ( Aside . ) Her sister ! Divine mendacity ! FELIX . I 've just remembered an engagement . HORACE . ( Aside . ) An engagement . O thou dull Moor ! I 'll get him the very next state-room to the engine . It takes an engine to affect him ! FELIX . Please disburse for me and I 'll repay you . EMMA . ( Aside . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-rooms . Horace , you 'll find me here . HORACE . ( Aside . ) This last hour she seizes ! ( Looking at her . ) Since you 'll kindly allow me , I 'll walk slowly . ( He goes away through the house . EMMA , slightly embarrassed , strolls to the end of the piazza . FELIX , not at all embarrassed , proceeds to collect his drawing materials . ) EMMA . ( Softly . ) He 's going because he 's bored . What can I do ? I wish I were only a little brighter ! He thinks me a common creature ! This last hour ! I may never see him again . I could do something wild ! Surely , he 's not going to march off to his room . I saw , as I was passing , an uncut novel on his table . Is he going up to read it ? Ah , my poor little novel , he 'll not cut you ! Oh , stupid , smiling sea ! I could cry  --  I could cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me dreadfully for letting you go . FELIX . Pray tell her to keep her scoldings for me . I 'm extremely sorry she 's under the weather . EMMA . She 's sure to have a headache whenever anything  --  anything pleasant occurs . FELIX . It 's enough to make one regret one is pleasant . EMMA . ( Aside . ) How nicely he turns things ! ( A pause . FELIX continues to arrange his portfolio . ) I should like immensely to have one of his drawings . If I were to ask for one ? Indelicate ! But it would be delicate to have it , and to keep it in a locked drawer .  --  I have been looking at your sketch ; I hope you do n't mind . FELIX . Not in the least . EMMA . ( Aside . ) If he would only offer it to me ! FELIX . By the way , I 'm stealing off without seeing your sister ; suppose you give her this sketch , with my compliments , as a peace-offering . ( EMMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I hope you like it . EMMA . ( After an interval . ) To tell the truth ,  --  I do n't . FELIX . ( Staring but smiling . ) Brava ! There 's nothing I like so much as a little criticism . EMMA . I am no critic ; but I do n't like it . I hate it . FELIX . ( Laughing . ) Nay , that 's not criticism ; it 's passion . EMMA . Passion ? Well , then , passion ! Look at that superb blue sea , Mr. Felix ; was there ever such a blue ? FELIX . Never , never , never ! ( Aside . ) Her eyes , at last ! Blue as well . I do n't know about the sea , after all . EMMA . I ca n't draw or paint of course ; but if I could , it seeems to me I would sketch that sea and sky and the rocks and the surge almost as I did then ; the blue flashing dark , and the white surf flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FELIX . And you think my clumsy pencilling a very poor substitute for all that ! I quite agree with you . It was the work of a stupid , disconsolate man . EMMA . You 've had a very dull visit . FELIX . No . I 've been a very dull visitor . You 'll be glad to get rid of me . EMMA . ( After a silence . ) I shall not particularly miss you . FELIX . ( Aside . ) Upon my word , she 's coming out . In point of fact , you have n't felt an overwhelming obligation to entertain me . EMMA . It seems to me , it was rather your place to entertain me . FELIX . ( Laughing . ) Oh , I beg your pardon . I came down here  --  EMMA . Oh , but not by my invitation ! FELIX . Dear me ! if you stand on the letter of the law ! EMMA . ( Blushing deeply , but smiling . ) Mr. Felix , have I been rude ? ( Aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Smiling back . ) Rude ! Rude 's a strong word ! EMMA . I need n't say I have n't meant it . My sister said to me an hour ago , " Do try , and do something for that poor man ! " I went and sat down in my room , and thought it over .  --  What can I do ? what can I do ? It was too hot , to propose to you to walk  --  and , besides , would it have been proper ? FELIX . Just improper enough to have made me assent , in spite of the heat ! EMMA . I do n't play , I do n't sing , I could have offered you no music . Besides , it 's Sunday . I do n't mind croquet , but if people had heard our balls  --  FELIX . We should have been lost ! I would gladly have shared perdition with you . But in fact , my dear young lady , you were shooting quite beyond the mark . Croquet and music and a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your mere presence  --  EMMA . My mere presence ! Would you really have observed it ? FELIX . Most attentively ! EMMA . ( After a silence . ) I 've been unjust . I beg a thousand pardons . FELIX . I forgive you , but the next time I come do n't treat me as a monster , to be fed at the end of a you accept ? FELIX . Not till I 'm invited .  --  What a jolly sunset ! EMMA . You had better sketch it . FELIX . Come , that 's rough ! I must be off . EMMA . How the crimson deepens as you look at it ! FELIX . Like a pretty girl , blushing as you stare ! I feel as if it were impolite . I must go in and put up my things . EMMA . You 're more polite to your pretty girl than to me . FELIX . ( Looking at her while he hesitates . ) Her eyes are not light blue either  --  they are dark blue .  --  If you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pack them up here . Pack them up I must ! EMMA . ( Turning away a moment , to herself . ) Does he wish to force me to ask him to stay ? Is there , in men , such a thing as coquetry ? We have missed the sweet afternoon ,  --  but the evening here will be sweet !  --  You insist on my formally inviting you . It 's simpler to do so while you 're in sight and in mind ; simpler , too , for you to stay than to go and come again . FELIX . You have really a genius for simplification . I wish I could solve the problem of existence as I used , as a boy , to do my algebra on the blackboard , by striking a chalk mark over the bothersome quantities . If I were to stay , you see , it would be easy ciphering ; but I should n't get my sum total ! EMMA . Oh , if it 's a matter of mathematics ! FELIX . It will be a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his finances left by the five dollars our friend Horace has been expending on my state-room . I 'm a poor man ! EMMA . ( Hesitating a moment ; then , half-bitter , half-arch . ) You 'll have to pay five dollars , you know , to come again . FELIX . ( Aside . ) Is she laughing at me ? Confound her ! Must I stay to be civil to her ? Bah ! I 've rather put my foot in it ; but consistency is dignity ! Perhaps , by that time , I may have sold a picture ! EMMA . ( With the same tone . ) Dear me , if you wait till then ! FELIX . You may be gentle ! Excuse me . I shall see you , of course , for farewell . ( EMMA makes him a grave courtesy and he enters the house . She looks after him for a moment and then drops on the divan , with her hands to her face . ) EMMA . " Gentle " ! Possibly ! I shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall play no part . Does he wish me to go down on my knees to him ! Ah , sir , thank Heaven you 're going ; it 's time . Thank Heaven you 're utterly insensate and cruel ! A little gleam ,  --  a hint , a word , a smile ; that would be enough . Where is he going ? where away on the wings of that fierce indifference ? Heaven bless him ! Heaven help me ! ( She bursts into tears . ) Oh , folly ! Have I come to this ,  --  to sit crying out my silliness before the solemn sea , which murmurs nothing to his ear ? You 've seen it all , now , gray glass of ocean ! Now let him come ! Am I to bid him farewell with red eyes ? Where is my precious Adelaide ? ( Looking . ) Gone ? Surely it was here I left it . Can he have taken it  --  with all my scribblings ? It must have been he . I ca n't imagine Horace with Adelaide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Am I to endure every humiliation ? Ah , Horace ! ( HORACE comes out from the parlor window . ) I wonder if he has got him a state-room . HORACE . ( Giving her the phial . ) This time , I believe it 's right . ( Aside . ) Tears ? At last ! Poor wounded heart  --  can I touch it ? EMMA . Thank you for your trouble . ( Aside . ) How he looked at me ! Does he notice ? Not he , thank Heaven ! ( With forced gayety . ) Are you tired ? Did you see the sunset ? I hope you found a good state-room . HORACE . The best that was left . I met on the way Mrs. Jay : she bade me tell you that she expected you to come this evening . Her son is at home : they are to have some sacred music . EMMA . Her son  --  some sacred music ! Much obliged . HORACE . About eight o'clock . EMMA . About eight o'clock . You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go to parties . EMMA . No more do I. I 've given it up . If you were a girl , I 'd make you a present of my finery . HORACE . Since when have you given up finery ? EMMA . Never mind ; you must go . It will be stupid here . I shall be upstairs . HORACE . ( Aside . ) Upstairs , crying again ! If I could only speak to her  --  or speak for her ! Now that her heart is wounded and tender , might I say a word for myself ? It 's hard lines to be able neither to console her nor to help her ,  --  to see it and be powerless ! Friend Felix ! I wish I had a little more of your superb stolidity.  --  ( With great softness . ) Emma ! EMMA . ( Unwrapping the phial . ) What is this stuff ? Is it laudanum ? I think I 'll take some . HORACE . Are you crazy ? EMMA . I believe I am . HORACE . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! EMMA . Do you think I 'm serious ? Simpleton ! ( She passes rapidly into the house . ) HORACE . ( Sits down on the divan and folds his arms . ) " Simpleton " ! That 's the best she can say to me ! Poor bewildered little mind ! She has given it all up ! she has given up gayety , and joy , and happiness  --  and all for him  --  or rather for the thankless , senseless memory of him ! That such a blossom as that maiden 's heart of hers should sit trembling on its stem , unnoticed , unplucked ! What possesses the man ? Is it simple dulness of vision or is it cruel hardness of heart ? If I might say a word ! Assuredly , in the name of my own poor throttled passion , I have a right to speak . Anything rather than see her lose her color , her smile , her prettiness ! What , after all , do I risk ? Would waiting twenty years serve my own cause ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to sit on a stool in a dark corner  --  hers with the wings of Ariel to flutter and frolic in the light . And the poor wings are ruffled and bound and bleeding ! If it were n't Sunday , I should like to swear a bit ! ( FELIX , at this moment , comes out from the house . ) FELIX . Our young lady is gone ! I want to bid her farewell . You got me a state-room , I suppose ? ( Taking the ticket which HORACE silently offers him and presenting a bank-note . ) Permit me to reimburse you . I 'm extremely obliged to you . HORACE . Do you know how you can express your obligation ?  --  By allowing me to remark  --  ( Pausing a moment . ) FELIX . Anything you please ! HORACE . That you 're an absolute fool ! FELIX . Upon my word  --  you exact good measure ! HORACE . Wait a moment and you 'll agree that I put it mildly . You wish to bid Emma good-by , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HORACE . You 'll just go up to her , and say ,  --  " Ah , Miss Emma , good-by ! " and march off ! You are an absolute fool ! Were you ever in love ? FELIX . If , as you so graciously affirm , I am an absolute fool , need you ask the question . HORACE . You know then , that the wind bloweth where it listeth . FELIX . Like your wit , my friend . What are you driving at ? HORACE . Do you think that young girl pretty ? FELIX . Pretty enough . I confess I only noticed just now the remarkable shade of her eyes  --  a lovely liquid blue . HORACE . Liquid indeed ! especially when they are streaming with tears . FELIX . With tears ? what do you mean ? HORACE . I mean that something has been going on here , fit to make angels groan ! I mean that the sweetest of girls has been crying her eyes out for the dullest of brutes ! I mean that love has kindled its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale vestal has scattered her ambrosial incense upon the very air you breathe . Is n't the air faint and sweet with its violet fumes ? Is n't the evening breeze scented with a maiden 's sighs ? Do n't the breaking waves murmur of a breaking heart ? Does n't your cheek turn crimson at my words ? Where are your wits , your senses , your manhood ? I confess I can stand it no longer . Common pity cries out ! No words of mine can make you over , or turn a log into a lover . I do n't speak for your sake , but for hers . Either , when she appears , go down on your knees to her , or vanish this instant without speaking to her , without seeing her , without forcing upon her again a sense of your colossal ingratitude ! FELIX . Tears , sighs , incense , perfumes ! Emma in love ! Are you sure ? HORACE . You may believe I would n't speak without a fair certainty . FELIX . ( Tapping his forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  with me ! HORACE . With you , incredible as it may seem . FELIX . Now I think , I assure you it 's not the least incredible . Admirable girl ! Of course she is ! By the way , my boy , to give me the news you need n't have put on the air of the angel Gabriel . In the angel Gabriel himself your tone would have been a bit pompous . But I forgive you . I wondered what the deuce was the matter with her ; avoiding me ; blushing at nothing , at Page 95 everything ; flitting to and fro ; now effacing herself altogether and then speaking up as clear as crystal and breaking into that agony of modesty ,  --  that divine impertinence ! Ah , the ewig Weibliche ! You 're a passive feminine creature , Horace ; you have a fellow-feeling for lovelorn maidens . Seriously , I 'm extremely obliged to you . This is real friendship . I fancied you were rather afraid of me ; I should n't have expected you to muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all in love with you . Happy man ! FELIX . Let me tell you , I have n't been so insensible as I seemed . I felt something ; a yearning ; a burning ! I thought it was Miss Walsingham . You 'll see what I can do ! I 've packed up my valise , but I sha n't go . See the moon just above the ocean ! HORACE . ( Aside . ) Heavens ! I ca n't stand this . I shall pack up my valise . You mean to stay ? FELIX . My dear fellow , do you take me for a brute ? HORACE . Give me your ticket , then . I believe I 'll use it . And here is your money again . FELIX . ( Laughing . ) Let me beg of you to keep it . You 've earned as much ! HORACE . Oh , I 've earned a little more ! But I do n't insist . Excuse me , I have only time to tie up my bundle . ( Enters the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with me . Why was I so bored ? I do n't generally find myself such poor company . It was that she was at hand  --  was and yet was n't . And then I wanted to make her ask me to stay ; I wanted , for my heart 's pleasure , to hear her say the very words . But she was proud and I was modest ! How the light flashes back into it all ! I 'll give her a touch of audacity ! Here she comes through the parlor . The pale vestal  --  that 's a pretty notion of his ! But now for the blushes ! ( EMMA steps upon the piazza and , going up to the young man , offers him her hand . ) EMMA . I hope I 've not kept you waiting . I believe you have still time . FELIX . ( Aside . ) How shall I say it ?  --  Plenty of time . I 'm not going . EMMA . Ah , you 've thought better of it ? FELIX . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What has happened ?  --  Your valise nevertheless is standing packed at your door . FELIX . ( Aside . ) I ca n't say I love her outright propos of a valise . Dear young lady , I have been reading my heart . ( Aside . ) How her blue eyes expand !  --  Emma , you 're terribly pretty . EMMA . Dear me , it 's very sudden ! FELIX . It 's very sudden you 're looking as pretty as you do . Paleness becomes you . EMMA . That 's a consolation . FELIX . Nay , now you blush , it 's even more becoming ! EMMA . Spare me , sir , or I shall blush quite too red for good looks . It 's a great honor to have you noticing my complexion . FELIX . For these three days I have done nothing else ; your complexion , your movements , the sound of your voice , everything that makes you the charming girl you are . EMMA . ( Aside . ) Gentle Heaven ! do I dream ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me be plain . I love you ! EMMA . Felix !  --  Weigh your words . I have a heart . Have a conscience ! FELIX . I love you , I love you ; on my conscience , I love you ! ( Falls on his knees . ) EMMA . But you do n't know me . You 've hardly exchanged a hundred words with me . FELIX . I have studied you in silence . Not a glance , not a movement , has escaped me . I held my tongue ; I wished to be sure . I 'm not wrong , Emma ? You do care for me ? EMMA . ( After a silence . ) A little . FELIX . ( Rising , to himself . ) She does n't quite fall into my arms ! There are women for you . Neglect them and they adore you ; adore them  --  and they are not so sure ! I 've been brutal , have n't I ? But if you knew what it cost me ! Do n't look at me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me . EMMA . I suppose I 'm very happy ; happiness stupefies a little . And what did you think of me , all the while ? I must have seemed a gracious , winning creature . FELIX . Your very reticence and reserve were charming . I would n't have had you running after me . EMMA . No , indeed , I hope not ! I have a proper pride . FELIX . It 's not yet quite melted away . Come , flatter a man a bit . Confess you do n't quite hate me . EMMA . Ah , the voracious vanity of men ! Nay , I kept my secret well ; I grew almost fond of it . It 's even hard to part with it at such short notice . Felix , you 'd better know it ; I 've a passion for dignity . FELIX . Dignity as a passion has a ravishing effect . It gives one the brightest little peeps and glimpses of the mysterious background of the heart . EMMA . If I thought any one had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , my dear  --  far off in the blue distance . I saw it lying in the shadow , but being a modest man , I hesitated to assume that the shadow was my shadow . Fortunately fate sent me a little telescope . EMMA . A little telescope ? My dear Felix , what are you talking about ? FELIX . Why , Horace just whispered to me ,  --  It is yours ; proceed . EMMA . Horace ? Pray what did Horace know about it , and what call had he to be whispering about my heart ? FELIX . Oh , I assure you , Horace is quite a knowing fellow . EMMA . ( After a silence . ) Horace  --  of all people ! When we 're engaged I shall scold him . FELIX . Not too hard . But for him , I might be rattling down to the boat . EMMA . Ah !  --  By the way , I ordered the carriage for you . I must go and countermand it . FELIX . You 'd better let Horace take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my state-room . EMMA . Indeed ! I saw him half an hour ago and he said nothing about it . What has happened to him ? FELIX . You can ask him ; here he comes . ( HORACE comes out prepared for departure . ) I say , give an account of yourself . Emma thinks you 're a bit uncivil . HORACE . ( Aside . ) He has spoken . Damnation ! ( To EMMA . ) He has perhaps told you I 'm going . EMMA . ( Sotto voce . ) What 's the matter with him ? He 's as grave as an undertaker.  --  Have you had bad news ? HORACE . No , but I 've suddenly remembered  --  I 've written a line for your sister ,  --  ( With force . ) I ca n't stay ! EMMA . ( Aside . ) What an odd tone , and how strangely he looks at me !  --  Perhaps you 'll come back . HORACE . I doubt it . I think of going to Europe . FELIX . Bully for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must go to Europe . ( EMMA is looking at HORACE askance , without answering . The latter stands for a moment hesitating and embarrassed . ) HORACE . ( Aside . ) So ! Things have gone fast .  --  I wish before I go to make a little request . I have here a little book of yours . ( Draws out the volume of Miss Proctor . ) EMMA . Ah ! my Adelaide Proctor ! You had it . Horace , you 're a singular being . HORACE . Let me claim the privilege of a singular being , then , and ask your permission to keep the volume . EMMA . Why , it 's all defaced with my scribblings . HORACE . That 's nothing . ( He replaces the book in his pocket . ) Emma , it 's everything . FELIX . ( Looking at his watch . ) My boy , you 'll be late for the boat . HORACE . Farewell . Be happy  --  be very happy ! ( She lets him take her hand ; he holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to his lips springs away through the house . When he has gone she stands silent and musing . ) FELIX . He might at least have bade me good-night ! By Jove , how the moon 's coming up ! We must go down on the rocks . EMMA . ( Still musing . ) Poor Horace ! FELIX . You do n't mind my lighting a cigar ? EMMA . I 'm curious ; I 'm very curious . How did he know  --  how did he know ? FELIX . Know what , my dear ? EMMA . What you told me ! FELIX . He guessed , he divined , he perceived . It do n't matter how at this time of day . Say he was in love with you , himself ! I beseech you to come down on the rocks . EMMA . In love with me himself ?

But even as he was telling his friends that he had washed his hands of the theatre and its " vulgarities and platitudes , " that he rejoiced in the Guy Domville incident as something that had disengaged him from the stage , he had begun a new flirtation with it . He still could be tempted  --  especially when temptation took the seductive  --  and authoritative  --  form of Ellen Terry . Henry James had never been a whole-hearted admirer of Miss Terry 's acting ; but he had always been conscious of her charm . " Miss Terry has charm  --  remarkable charm , " he had once written , adding , however , somewhat sharply " ... this beguiles people into thinking her an accomplished actress . " He considered her wholesome and English and womanly and he added this praise : " Miss Terry has that excellent thing , a quality ; she gives one the sense of something fine . " In 1895 she was forty-seven and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more , her soft side , Bernard Shaw has told us , was her " mothering side , her sensitive pity " and , after Guy Domville , Henry James must have been open both to sensitive pity and to mothering . We do not know what Miss Terry wrote to James after seeing the ill-fated production in which her sister had played , but , given her personality , we can imagine that she was moved to warm sympathy . It is clear she offered congratulations and condolences . But she also offered hope . Would Henry James come to see her ? Would he be interested in doing a one-act or two-act play with a central role for herself which she could produce during her forthcoming American tour ? Guy Domville was but three days in its grave when Henry James paid his call . The following morning , February 6 , 1895 , he noted as a possible theme for a play for Ellen Terry the idea of a Madame Sans-Gne in reverse  --  instead of a woman of the people being called upon to play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exalted lady called upon to play the role of a woman of the people . As he toyed with this idea he recalled a chance remark of Miss Terry 's that she would " have a fancy to do an American woman . " The idea appealed to James . The thought of Madame Sans-Gne in reverse drew him back to an idea he had sketched two years earlier for Ada Rehan when he had hopes of doing a second play for Augustin Daly : that of an American woman who , in given circumstances , turns out to be more British than the British . He had recorded this broad idea in his notebook : that this woman from the United States should step in to clear up a muddle or predicament in a British household . He now re-read this note and elaborated it , under the stimulus of his talk with Ellen Terry , arriving at the broad situation of Summersoft , " the bright , kind , comic , clever charming creature  --  in the agitated , convulsed , threatened , somehow troubled and exposed show house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have come rapidly into being , despite the fact that James strenuously resumed the writing of fiction and was working consistently during the summer of 1895 at another story about a " show house "  --  The Spoils of Poynton . An unpublished journal entry made nineteen years later , on the eve of the First World War , recalled that the play was posted to Ellen Terry from Torquay toward the end of August 1895 . Among Ellen Terry 's papers were found two letters from Henry James , one of August 24 , 1895 expressing the novelist 's satisfaction that the play had pleased her . " You are indeed the Gentle Reader ; you read with imagination and see what one meant and feel what one wanted . But you spoil one for the big , flat , vague , vacant public . ... I want to write you another ( already ! ) one-act play  --  yearn after such . There will be time to talk of this  --  but the very difficulty of the job preoccupies me and fascinates me , and in the one-act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for it . I hope you find yourself able to gird your loins as it were for that huge American circus  --  where you have to revolve in a ring 3,000 miles round ! " The second letter , written August 31 , acknowledges receipt of 100 in advance of royalties and suggests that James by this time knew the play would not be produced during the American tour " ... if the Americans are not to have the Gem , do excruciate them with a suspicion of what they lose . ... " He added , " It will seem a long year  --  but art is long , ah me ! " which would suggest that the actress spoke of doing Summersoft on her return . But Ellen Terry never produced the play and three years later Henry James reclaimed the script and turned it into a short story . It was published in The Two Magics as a tale of " white magic " and companion piece to the " black magic " of The Turn of the Screw under the title of Covering End . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country house in his tale The Lesson of the Master . We know , from a letter to the Countess of Jersey , that the house which served as model for the story , and therefore presumably for the play , was Osterley House , near Heston , Middle-sex , a red-brick mansion set in a park of some 750 acres ; the Countess tells us in her memoirs that Henry James first visited Osterley in the company of James Russell Lowell . The novelist is speaking of Osterley when he writes in The Lesson of the Master that its great gallery was " a cheerful upholstered avenue into another century , " and it is Mrs. Gracedew speaking before her time when he says : " It all went together and spoke in one voice  --  a rich English voice of the early part of the 18th century . ... " When he rewrote the one-act play into the short story he changed the name of the house to Covering End since he did not want to retain a name he had used in an earlier tale . If Summersoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry James 's " sense of the past , " and Mrs. Gracedew 's passionate plea for the preservation of the old and cherished things went back to James 's Passionate Pilgrim , to Christopher Newman 's search for the old values of " Europe , " to Caroline Spencer 's life-long dream of an Old World she barely glimpses , to his own musings as he sought to draw his " sketches " and " portraits " of places . " At Warwick the past joins hands so stoutly with the present , " wrote James in one of his travel sketches , " that you can hardly say where one begins and the other ends . ... " This is again the voice of Mrs. Gracedew as it could be the voice of Fleda Vetch in The Spoils of Poyton . Summersoft  --  Covering End is , in a sense , a by-product of the Spoils . Captain Yule 's old house is but a less elaborate , a down-at-the-heels Poynton . Like Poynton , it is the focus of a struggle over property , and the essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appreciating them , is also to be found here . Mrs. Gracedew , like Fleda , is an outsider who becomes involved in the struggle . Henry James 's account of Fleda , in the preface to the Spoils written a decade later , can very easily be applied to Mrs. Gracedew . He observes that " a subject residing in somebody 's excited and concentrated feeling about something has more beauty to give out than under any other style of pressure . " Mrs. Gracedew 's excited and concentrated feeling for the old house is the essence of play and story . She belongs in Henry James 's gallery of the American female in Europe . She is a product of what James once called the " age of Mrs. Jack "  --  Mrs. Jack being Mrs. John L. Gardner who shuttled between America and Europe in search of the " spoils " of the Old World now enshrined in Boston 's Fenway Court . That Mrs. Gracedew could be more English than the English was an irony James frequently evoked . He relates in his life of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who never went abroad , once surprised a London visitor at Cambridge by identifying an obscure London street of which the traveller himself was ignorant . Judge Story , James observed , " knew his London because even at that then prodigious distance from it , he had a feeling for it . " Mrs. Gracedew has an abundance of feeling for Summer-soft and its destitute owner , Captain Yule . Yule too has his antecedents in James . In The Portrait of a Lady Isabel Archer , talking to Lord Warburton 's sisters , inquires whether it is true that his lordship is " a great radical . " They assure her he is " immensely advanced " and Isabel then poses the question whether , as a radical , he would be willing to part with his estates and properties . The bewildered sisters fail to understand such a concept and Isabel observes " ... if I were he I should wish to be a conservative . I should wish to keep everything . " In the New York Edition James revised this speech so that Isabel speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Gracedew pleaded . He makes her say , " ... if I were he I should wish to fight to the death : I mean for the heritage of the past . I should hold it tight . " The problem thus adumbrated in The Portrait of a Lady became subsequently the central theme of The Princess Casamassima , and Yule 's conflict between his radicalism and the preservation of his property , sketched on a superficial comedy plane , has in it elements of the deeper conflict of young Hyacinth Robinson troubled between the status quo of a world attractive to him and the dynamic revolutionary theories to which he has committed himself . For James , who had stood among the barricades of the Commune in Paris , who had friends among nihilists and anarchists , who had known Prince Kropotkin  --  the James who had witnessed the social unrest of the 1880 's and noted the contrasts of wealth and poverty in his European travels  --  experienced that conflict himself . Intellectually oriented toward social progress and social reform  --  the heritage of his socially progressive father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world as it presented itself to his artist 's eyes , than the worlds-in-the-making . He was an historian rather than one who would change the course of history . One wonders , nevertheless , how a writer who had created Nick Dormer and his renunciation of Westminster for the artist 's studio could entertain even for a moment Yule 's renunciation of idealism for " property , " and make him implausibly fickle to the social reform that is his way of life , even under the verbal witchery of Mrs. Gracedew . We are led to the conclusion that for the stage ( and particularly in the tightness of the one-act ) Henry James was prepared as usual to make concessions . He was prepared to sacrifice verisimilitude in his other characters so long as he could make Mrs. Gracedew consistent . Was n't she the raison d ' tre of the play ? He was happy to create a spell-binding American woman and this counted for him more than anything else . And he counted on Ellen . Terry to do the spellbinding . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the theatre of the 1890 's finally parted company , except for one mild flurry , a momentary welling up of the old passion . It is recorded in the notebook , in an entry of January 22 , 1899 : " George Alexander writes me to ask for Covering End , for him and Miss Davis to do , and I 've just written to him the obstacles and objections . But I 've also said I would do him a fresh one-act thing ; and it 's strange how this little renewal of contact with the vulgar theatre stirs again , in a manner and moves me . ... " In its play form Summersoft had found no producer . In its story form it was attracting interest as a possible play . Now Johnston Forbes-Robertson wrote also suggesting that it be dramatized . James finally said " no " to both actor-managers . Alexander pleaded with James . The novelist had given his only copy of the script to Elizabeth Robins and in the late autumn of 1899 he appealed to her to send it back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander had read it and changed his mind . " I send you back poor Mrs. Gracedew , ( even as she has been returned on my hands , after all : ) for you to have and to hold , to do what you like with  --  above all to produce , absolutely at your freedom and discretion , when the right occasion rises . Obviously , in the light of the ' story ' in the volume of the Two Magics there is much more to be got out of her and put into her ; and indeed the tale constitutes for her rather a unique and rich prompt-book . " This was quite true . In the tale James considerably improved on his original one-acter . He elaborated the characterizations , softened the hard lines of the play , put more flesh on his stage puppets and strengthened the motivation . He did not , however , overcome its inherent weakness , the about-face of Yule . Miss Robins submitted the play to the reading committee of the New Century Theatre , a group formed to produce plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archer wrote a three-page single-spaced report on the play which began " I think the enclosed a gem with a single flaw ... " and ended " on the whole I think the piece a delightful one , which a few quite inessential alterations ought to render ( with good acting ) genuinely successful and popular . " The flaw was , of course , Yule 's capitulation . Archer believed it to be utterly implausible , and one that in real life would make a political figure the laughing stock of all England . The New Century decided not to do it and the play remained unproduced until 1907 when it suddenly acquired a new life and a new history , recounted in the preface to The High Bid in this volume . A NOTE ON THE TEXTS In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication , over a period of two decades , the editor was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . The corrections and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern play from the dramatist 's desk , through the production office into the theatre . James was called upon to revise his plays many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays , nor the textual problems arising from collation , warranted such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  that is of truth , fidelity to text and to the writer 's intentions  --  while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would serve : that of demonstrating their role in Henry James 's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some producer might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of at least some of them on the American stage . I therefore directed my editing to this end . It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of the London production , two of them from James 's own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors . It was thus possible to give the mutations of James 's first important effort in the theatre , including a variant fourth act . As regards the other plays , a simple principle was applied . Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the cuts restored ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alterations and where these were in James 's hand they were accepted as his final reading ; where there were simply cuts , these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable , the alternate readings have been given . There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons ' typescripts of the play , I decided that it would be of interest to publish the text as actually performed on the stage in 1909 , which James had approved , despite a number of alterations and cuts . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed ; as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took when it reached the stage . While James went over most of the manuscripts of his plays , making corrections and verbal changes , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's alternately referring to " Valentin " and " Valentine " are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization . In some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech ; these have been spelled out as an aid to readability . Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips 's Bibliography of the Writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 26-27 , 46-47 and 115-16 . CHARACTERS CAPTAIN CLEMENT YULE MR . PRODMORE CHIVERS MRS . GRACEDEW CORA PRODMORE VISITORS Main text The Scene is the hall , the spacious central apartment , of an old English country-house ; which has the mark of extreme antiquity and of several very beautiful and curious architectural and decorative features . It shows , definitely , the fallen fortunes  --  the reduced income  --  of the people who have , for ages , inhabited it , but still contains some very charming and valuable old objects , domestic treasures , portraits , relics of the past , carefully preserved . It is a Saturday afternoon in August , a hot , still day , and the windows stand open to the old park in one quarter , to the old garden in another . There are four entrances and exits , of which the most striking is a high staircase leading to an upper gallery . Another is the door or passage of the vestibule connected with the main entrance to the house  --  the way in from the park . Another is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden . CHIVERS stands at the foot of the staircase , looking up , as if in conversation with someone above , who appears to have been speaking or calling to him from the upper gallery . CHIVERS . Oh no , mum , there ai n't no one come yet : it 's all right . ( Coming down . ) If I leave her to range , ai n't it just my poor pickings ? ( As if hearing a voice from above . ) Lots of lovely  --  ? Lovely what , mum ? ( Back at the staircase . ) Little ups and downs ? As you say , mum  --  as many as in a poor man 's life ! ( Listening hard . ) Dear little crooked steps ? Please mind ' em , mum : they be cruel in the dark corners ! ( To himself , with vague pleasure . ) She do fancy the place ! ( Then again to the voice above . ) Coming up ? Not if you 'll indulge me , mum  --  I must be where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house-door rings out . ) Mercy  --  I can hear that ! ( Shuffles across to the vestibule , in which he disappears , re-entering from it the next moment with MR . PRODMORE . ) PRODMORE . ( Looking round , disappointed . ) No one here ? CHIVERS . No one has come , sir ; but I 've had a telegram from Captain Yule . PRODMORE . ( Apprehensive . ) Not to say he ai n't coming ? CHIVERS . He was to take the 2.40 from Paddington : he certainly should be here . PRODMORE . He should have been here this hour . And so should my daughter ! CHIVERS . ( Timid , tentative . ) Were they coming  --  a  --  together , sir ? PRODMORE . ( Shocked , staring . ) Together ?  --  for what do you take Miss Prodmore ? ( Then with a more conciliatory second thought . ) It is in a sense true , however , that their " coming together , " as you call it , is exactly what I 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should all punctually converge on this spot . Attended by her trusty maid , Miss Prodmore , who happens to be on a week 's visit to her grandmother at Bellborough , was to take the 1.50 from that place . I was to drive over  --  ten miles  --  from my most convenient seat . Captain Yule was at last to shake off for a few hours the peculiar occupations that engage him . CHIVERS . They must be peculiar , sir  --  when a gentleman comes into a property like this and goes three months without so much as a nateral curiosity  --  ! I do n't speak of anything but what 's nateral , sir ; but there have been people here  --  PRODMORE . ( Interrupting ; complacently . ) There are always people here ! CHIVERS . As you say , sir  --  to be shown over . And the master himself has never been shown ! PRODMORE . He shall be , from top to bottom  --  it 's precisely what I 've come for ! ( Looking round him . ) He 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such very different matters . CHIVERS . ( Timorous , wondering . ) But nothing but what 's right , sir  --  ? PRODMORE . ( With extreme emphasis . ) Everything that 's utterly wrong ! ( As the bell again sounds . ) Here he is . ( CHIVERS , dismayed , hurries off to the door and disappears in the vestibule . PRODMORE , alone , looks complacently round him . ) But if he resists the house  --  ( breaking off as he hears his daughter 's voice in the vestibule ) Cora ?  --  he wo n't resist the girl ! ( Re-enter CHIVERS , ushering in CORA PRODMORE , whom her father addresses severely . ) I 've waited . CORA . ( Flurried , breathless . ) I 'm so sorry , Papa ! PRODMORE . ( Suspicious , stern . ) Would you have wished then not to find me ?  --  Why are you late ? CORA . ( Agitated , embarrassed . ) I 'll tell you , Papa . ( Looking vaguely round her , in distress , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  could I have some tea ? PRODMORE . ( After considering the idea . ) Well , as I shall expect you to put forth your powers  --  yes . ( To CHIVERS . ) Some tea . CHIVERS . ( Taken aback . ) I do n't hardly know what you 'll make of my tea ! But you shall have it at least in the drawingroom . ( Exit to the drawingroom . ) CORA . It was my train , Papa  --  so awfully behind ! And then I walked up from the station  --  there 's such a lovely footpath across the park . PRODMORE . You 've been roaming the country , then , alone ? CORA . ( Conscious . ) Oh dear , no ; not alone ! There were ever so many people about . PRODMORE . There are sometimes too many !  --  And where 's your trusty maid ? CORA . ( Confused . ) I did n't bring her : she seemed so very unwell . PRODMORE . ( Blank . ) What on earth is the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that at Granny 's she eats too much . PRODMORE . ( With decision . ) I 'll put an end to that ! You expect then to pursue your adventures into the night ?  --  to return to Bellborough as you came ? CORA . ( With more confidence . ) Exactly as I came , Papa dear  --  under the protection of a new friend I 've just made , a lady whom I met in the train and who is also going back by the 6.15 . Like me , she was on her way to this place , and I expected to find her here . PRODMORE . ( Vague . ) What does she want at this place ? CORA . She wants to see it . PRODMORE . ( After an instant . ) To-day ? To-day wo n't do ! CORA . So I suggested  --  but she said it would have to do ! PRODMORE . ( Resentful . ) Why in the world  --  ? CORA . Because she 's a wild American  --  she says she is : so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know nothing about her , and I recommend you not to pick up wild Americans , or strange women of any kind , in trains . CORA . She 'll turn up , I 'm sure , because she was awfully keen . She is a strange woman  --  but she 's awfully nice . I noticed her yesterday at Bellborough . PRODMORE . What was she doing at Bellborough ? CORA . Staying at the Blue Dragon , to see the old abbey . She says she just loves old abbeys . It seems to be the same feeling that has brought her over to-day to see this old house . PRODMORE . She " just loves " old houses ? Then why the deuce did n't she accompany you , properly , to the door ? CORA . Because she went off in a fly to see , first , the old hospital . She just loves old hospitals . She asked me if this is n't a show-house . I told her I had n't the least idea . PRODMORE . It is . You 're an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , herself , that I evidently ai n't a show-girl . PRODMORE . I wish to goodness you were ! But she sounds distinctly vulgar . CORA . Do n't judge her till you see her . She 's tremendously clever  --  she knows everything about everything . PRODMORE . And you know nothing about anything ! You 're not tremendously clever  --  so I demand of you your best attention .  --  I 'm expecting Captain Yule . CORA . The owner of this property ? PRODMORE . He came into it , three months ago , by the death of his great-uncle , who lived to ninety-three , but who having quarrelled mortally with his father , had always refused to receive either of them . CORA . But now , at least , does n't he live here ? PRODMORE . So little that he comes to-day for the first time . I 've some business to discuss with him that can best be discussed on this spot ; and it 's a vital part of that business that you too should take pains to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own house ? PRODMORE . It 's not his own house . Practically speaking , it 's my house . It 's mortgaged , as it stands , for every penny of its value  --  and I happen to hold the mortgages . CORA . ( Surprised , thinking . ) To the full extent ? PRODMORE . If I went in at all , it was to come out the other side . It 's on the other side that I find the Captain . CORA . ( With a vague , faint , nervous laugh . ) Poor Captain !  --  Well , Papa  --  do n't be hard with him . PRODMORE . What do you call being hard with him ? CORA . I do n't understand business ; but I think I understand you , Papa , enough to gather that you 've got a fine advantage . PRODMORE . Fine if I use it finely . What you would like me to do is to give it up ? Thank you , Miss Prodmore , I do mean to use it , and what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stand  --  for it 's here we do stand , and very fast , thank heaven !  --  is that I look to you to see me through . CORA . Through what , Papa ? PRODMORE . Through my speculation . I want you to receive an impression , and I want you , even more , to make one . CORA . ( In dawning consternation . ) On Captain Yule ? ( Seeing the whole thing . ) To make him propose ? PRODMORE . If he does , it will be better for both of you ! And he will  --  for I shall do my part . CORA . ( Extremely discomposed and alarmed . ) How on earth can I do mine ? To begin with , I 've never seen him . PRODMORE . You 'll see him , now , ( looking at his watch ) from one moment to the other . He 's young , good-looking , clever ; he has one of the best and oldest , names in England  --  a name that , in this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to do everything , and it 's accordingly my plan that my daughter shall gracefully bear it . CORA . And pray is it also Captain Yule 's plan ? PRODMORE . ( After an instant . ) His plans have not yet matured . But nothing is more natural than that they shall do so on the sunny south wall of Miss Prodmore 's best manner . CORA . You speak as if they were little sour plums ! You exaggerate , I think , the warmth of Miss Prodmore 's temperament . I 'm a remarkably cold nature . PRODMORE . Then you 'll be so good as to start a blaze ! I 've spent twenty years in giving you what your poor mother used to call advantages , and they 've cost me hundreds and hundreds of pounds . It 's time now I should get my money back . I could n't help your temper nor your taste , nor even your looks  --  but I paid it out that you should have , damn you , a good manner . You never show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that after all  --  for  --  a  --  other persons  --  you have n't got one ? CORA . If you mean by other persons , persons who are nice to me  --  well , Captain Yule may not be so , and may not think so . PRODMORE . If you 'll be nice to Captain Yule , Captain Yule will be incapable of gross perversity ! CORA . I remember your saying once  --  some time ago  --  that that was just what he had been guilty of in going in for his dreadful ideas  --  PRODMORE . ( Taking her up . ) About the " radical programme , " the " social revolution , " the spoliation of the rich ? I shall forgive him the aberration if he renounces it for you . CORA . ( More and more adverse . ) He must n't renounce it ! He sha n't ! PRODMORE . You mean that you 'll take him as he is ? CORA . ( Determined . ) I wo n't take him at all ! ( Then , agitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) A fly  --  here he is ! Surely you do n't want me to pounce on him thus ! PRODMORE . ( Interrogative , eyeing her up and down . ) Your frock wo n't do  --  with what it cost me ? CORA . It 's not my " frock "  --  it 's his thinking I 've come here for him to see me . PRODMORE . He does n't think it , and he sha n't know it . CORA . But he knows that you want me to catch him ! PRODMORE . ( As if with offended delicacy . ) The way to " catch " him will be not to be vulgar . He does n't know that you know anything . ( As the house-bell rings . ) Await us in the drawingroom  --  and mind you toe the mark ! ( Re-enter , to answer the bell , CHIVERS , from the drawingroom , the door of which he leaves open . ) CORA . ( Really anxious , pleading , passionate . ) Do n't kill me , father  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing the door with a bang . ) PRODMORE . ( Alone ; CHIVERS having passed , before CORA 'S last speech , into the vestibule . ) If she could only look with such eyes at him ! ( Then , with florid cordiality , as he sees CAPTAIN YULE , who enters from the vestibule accompanied by CHIVERS . ) Delighted at last to see you here ! YULE . If I 've not come before , Mr. Prodmore , it was  --  very frankly speaking  --  from the dread of seeing you ! PRODMORE . But surely my presence is not without a motive  --  ! YULE . It 's just the motive that makes me wince at it ! Certainly I 've no illusions about the ground of our meeting . Your high financial genius has placed me at your mercy , and you hold me in the hollow of your hand . PRODMORE . ( Smiling fatuously . ) Well , I wo n't , on my side , deny that when I went in so deep , I knew pretty well what I was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood you , you can do quite as you like with this preposterous place . Have n't you brought me down to see you do it ? PRODMORE . I 've certainly brought you down to open your eyes ! ( Then , after a moment . ) Of couse you can clear the property  --  you can pay off the mortgages . YULE . ( Blank . ) Pay them off ? What can I pay them off with ? PRODMORE . You can always raise money . YULE . What can I raise it on ? PRODMORE . ( Laughing . ) On your great political future . YULE . I 've not taken the lucrative line , and I know what you think of that . PRODMORE . I think you keep , in public , very dangerous company ; but I hold that you 're extravagant only because you 've nothing at stake . A man has the right opinions as soon as he has something to lose by having the wrong ones . Have n't I already hinted to you how to straighten yours out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marry a nice little heiress ! YULE . ( Smiling ironically , but as if thinking . ) Of course I could do that in a moment ! PRODMORE . That 's exactly my danger  --  that any woman would jump at you . YULE . My danger , Mr. Prodmore , is as great , though of a different sort . I 've yet to see the woman I 'd " jump " at ! PRODMORE . Well , you know , I have n't asked you to risk your neck  --  I 've only asked you to consider . YULE . I 've complied with your request , and one of the strange results is that my eyes have got accustomed to my darkness . I seem to make out in the depressing gloom that at the worst I can let the whole thing go . PRODMORE . ( Anxious . ) Throw up the property ? YULE . Is n't it the property that throws me up ? If I can afford neither to redeem it nor to live on it , I can at least let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can say to you : " Take it and be hanged to you ! " PRODMORE . ( Apprehensive , conciliatory . ) You would n't be so shockingly rude ! YULE . Why not , if I 'm a firebrand ? Sacrifice for sacrifice , that might very well be the least ! PRODMORE . How do you know , if you have n't compared them ? It 's just to do that that you 're here to-day . Now that you stretch yourself  --  for an hour 's relaxation  --  in the cradle of your race , can you seriously entertain the idea of parting with such a venerable family relic ? YULE . ( Looking round the depressed old hall with a sad and skeptical eye . ) The cradle of my race looks to me much more like its tomb ! Melancholy  --  musty  --  mouldy ! Is this its character throughout ? PRODMORE . You must judge for yourself  --  you must go over the house . It looks a bit run down , but I 'll tell you what I 'll do  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll throw that in ! YULE . ( With a sarcastic , melancholy smile . ) Will you put in the electric light ? PRODMORE . ( Taking it seriously . ) Well  --  if you 'll meet me half way !  --  We 're dealing , here , with fancy-values . Do n't you feel a kind of thrill , as you take it all in ? YULE . Call it a kind of shudder , as at something queer and cold , and almost cruel : all the old mortality with which the place is saturated  --  the old presences  --  the old absences  --  the old voices  --  the old ghosts ! PRODMORE . The old ghosts , Captain Yule , are worth so much a dozen ! But look about you a little more . ( Encouragingly , patronizingly . ) Make yourself at home . YULE . Thank you very much , Mr. Prodmore . May I light a cigarette ? PRODMORE . In your own house , Captain ? YULE . That 's just the question  --  it seems less my own than before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights and begins to smoke a cigarette , offering one also to PRODMORE , which PRODMORE takes . ) As I understand you , you lump your two conditions ? I mean I must accept both or neither ? PRODMORE . You will accept both , for you 'll clear the property at a stroke . The way I put it is that if you 'll stand for Gossage you 'll get returned for Gossage . YULE . ( Completing . ) And if I get returned for Gossage I shall marry your daughter . Then if I marry your daughter  --  PRODMORE . ( Completing . ) I 'll put those vile obligations , before your eyes , into the fire ; there wo n't be a penny to pay ; and you 'll live here in honour and length of days ! YULE . Are you very sure of the " honour , " if I turn my political coat ? PRODMORE . You 'll only be turning it back again  --  the way it was always worn . Gossage will receive you with open arms and press you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaved but to sound Conservative principles . The cradle  --  or at least the coverlet  --  of your race , Gossage was the political property , so to speak , of generations of your family . Stand in the good old interest , and you 'll stand like a lion . YULE . I 'm afraid you mean that I must first roar like one ! PRODMORE . I 'll do the roaring  --  leave that to me . YULE . Then why the deuce do n't you stand yourself ? PRODMORE . Because I 'm not a handsome young man with the old home and the right name . If I have n't these advantages , my idea has been precisely that my daughter shall have them . YULE . I confess you have not yet made me understand the attraction you discover in so large a pecuniary sacrifice . PRODMORE . My sacrifices are my own affair , and as I never  --  on principle  --  give anything for nothing , I daresay I 've , myself , another name for ' em . You come high  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life ! YULE . ( After an instant . ) May I inquire if Miss Prodmore 's ideas of comfort are as modest as her father 's ? Is she a responsible party to this ingenious arrangement ? PRODMORE . Miss Prodmore , Captain Yule , is a sheet of blank paper ! No image of any tie but the pure and perfect filial has yet , I can answer for it , formed itself on the fair expanse . But for that image to be projected  --  YULE . ( Laughing , embarrassed , incredulous . ) I 've only to appear  --  PRODMORE . And , naturally , to be kind to her . Do you remember what you said when I first laid this question before you in London ? YULE . I think I said it struck me I should first take a look at the corpus delicti . PRODMORE . You should first see , in person , what you had really come into . I was not only eager for that , but I 'm willing to go further ; I 'm quite ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first see the young lady ! YULE . ( Laughing . ) There is something in that , then  --  since you mention it ! PRODMORE . I think you 'll find that there 's everything . ( Looking at his watch . ) Which will you take first ? YULE . ( Vague . ) First ? PRODMORE . The young lady or the house ? YULE . ( Much taken aback . ) Do you mean your daughter 's here ? PRODMORE . ( Indicating . ) In the drawingroom . YULE . ( Apprehensive . ) Waiting for me ? PRODMORE . ( Reassuring . ) As long as you like ! YULE . ( As if fearing CORA may burst in upon him . ) Ah , a few moments , I beg you !  --  Do you mean she knows  --  ? PRODMORE . That she 's here on view ? ( After a moment . ) She knows nothing whatever . She 's as unsconscious as the rose on its stem ! YULE . ( Relieved . ) That 's right  --  let her remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll first take the house . PRODMORE . Shall I go round with you ? YULE . I think , under the circumstances , I would rather go round alone . ( Re-enter CHIVERS from the drawingroom . ) CHIVERS . ( Timorously , tentatively , to YULE . ) There 's tea on , sir ! PRODMORE . ( To YULE . ) Then I 'll join my daughter . ( At the drawingroom door ; expressively . ) The rose on its stem ! ( Exit MR . PRODMORE . ) YULE . ( To CHIVERS , musingly , abruptly . ) I say , what colour is , the rose ? CHIVERS . ( At first bewildered , then catching on . ) A very brilliant red . ( Nodding out of the open door to the garden . ) It 's the only one left  --  on the old east wall . YULE . ( After a laugh . ) My dear fellow , I 'm alluding to the young lady in the drawingroom . Is she pretty ? CHIVERS . ( Embarrassed . ) Laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy ' em myself more merry-like . YULE . ( Struck , wondering . ) She is n't merry-like , poor Miss Prodmore ? Well , neither am I ! But it does n't signify . What are you ? CHIVERS . Well , sir , I 'm not that . Whatever has there been to make me , sir ? YULE . How in the world do I know ? I mean , to whom do you belong ? CHIVERS . If you could only tell me , sir ! I do seem to waste away  --  for someone to take orders of ! YULE . ( Amused . ) Who pays your wages ? CHIVERS . No one at all , sir . YULE . ( Producing a coin . ) Then there 's a sovereign . ( As CHIVERS accepts it with undisguised satisfaction . ) I have n't many . CHIVERS . ( With sudden , tender compunction . ) Ah then , let it stay in the family ! YULE . ( Struck ; very kindly . ) I think it does , old boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your house , sir . YULE . How long ? CHIVERS . All my life . YULE . Then I wo n't give you up ! CHIVERS . Indeed sir , I hope you wo n't give up anything . YULE . It remains to be seen ! ( Looking round him . ) Is that the garden ? CHIVERS . ( Sadly . ) It was ! Shall I show you how it used to be ? YULE . It 's just as it is , alas , that I require it ! ( At the garden-door . ) Do n't come  --  I want to think ! ( Exit CAPTAIN YULE . ) CHIVERS . ( Alone , vague . ) What does he want to think about ? ( Then as he hears MRS . GRACEDEW 'S voice calling from the gallery above , with great animation : " Housekeeper  --  Butler  --  Old Family Servant ! " ) Oh , I should have told him of her ! ( Enter MRS . GRACEDEW at the top of the stairs . ) MRS . GRACEDEW . ( As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got snapped down in an old box , like that girl  --  what 's her name ? the one that was poking round too  --  in the poem ? My dear man , why did n't you tell me ? CHIVERS . ( Vague . ) Tell you , mum ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Why that you 're so perfectly  --  perfect ! You 're beyond my wildest dreams ! You 're beyond my wildest dreams ! You 're everything in the world you ought to be , and not the shade of a shade of anything you ought n't ! CHIVERS . ( Bewildered . ) Me , mum ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Yes , you too , you old picture ! The house is a vision of beauty , and you 're worthy of the house . I ca n't say more for you ! CHIVERS . ( Fluttered , pleased . ) I think , mum , you say too much ! MRS . GRACEDEW . So everyone always thinks ; but I have n't come here to suffer in silence  --  to suffer , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly complete , you know  --  every fascinating feature that I had already heard of , and ever so many others that I had n't ! CHIVERS . I saw as soon as you arrived , mum , that you had heard of a good few more than I ever did ! MRS . GRACEDEW . I had got you by heart  --  from books , from photos ; I had you in my pocket when I came : so when you were so good as to let me loose up there I knew my way right through . It 's all there , every inch of it , and now at last I can do what I want . CHIVERS . ( Wondering . ) And pray , mum , what might that be ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Why , to take you right back with me  --  to Missourah Top . CHIVERS . ( Freshly bewildered . ) Do I understand you , mum , that you require to take me ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Staring a moment , then breaking out into glee . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Family Servant ? Then do , you nice , real thing : it 's just what I 'm dying for  --  an Old Family Servant ! You 're somebody else 's , yes  --  but everything , over here , is somebody else 's , and I want a second-hand one , all ready-made . You 're the best I 've seen yet . I wish I could have you packed  --  put up in paper and bran , as I shall have my old pot there : do n't let me forget my crockery ! ( As CHIVERS goes and takes up the pot which has been stood aside , on a table . ) It 's rare old Chelsea . CHIVERS . ( With the pot , looking at it and thinking . ) Where is it I 've known it this many a year  --  though not , to say , by name ? ( Then as it comes to him . ) In the sexton 's front parlour ! MRS . GRACEDEW . No , in his best bedroom  --  on his chest of drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass fender , and the chair his grandmother died in . Not in the fly  --  they 're to follow . CHIVERS . ( Handling the pot with agitated zeal . ) You did right to take this out when it went to the stables . Them flymen  --  they do be rough , with anything that 's delicate . ( Going to put down the pot again , he makes , in his nervousness , a false movement and lets it fall to the ground , where it breaks to pieces ; whereupon , overwhelmed with consternation , he collapses into the nearest chair . ) Mercy on us , mum , I 've brought shame on my old grey hairs ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Who has smothered a shriek of dismay ; after she has looked at him an instant . ) Oh , but the way you take it !  --  you 're too quaint to live ! The way you said that , now  --  it 's the very type ! That 's all I want of you  --  just to be the very type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor thing  --  you ca n't help it , and it 's what everything and everyone else is , over here . There was a type in the train with me  --  the " awfully nice girl " of all the novels , the " simple maiden in her flower " : she could n't help it , either ! ( Then suddenly remembering . ) By the way , she was coming here  --  has she come ? CHIVERS . Miss Prodmore is here , mum  --  she 's having her tea . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Eagerly . ) Yes , that 's exactly it  --  they 're always having their tea ! CHIVERS . With Mr. Prodmore  --  in the drawingroom . Captain Yule 's in the garden . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Vague . ) Captain Yule ? CHIVERS . The new master  --  he has also just arrived . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After an instant . ) She did n't tell me about him . CHIVERS . It 's such a cur'ous thing to tell mum . He had never seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before to-day ?  --  his very own ?  --  Well , I hope he likes it ! CHIVERS . I have n't seen many , mum , that like it as much as you ! MRS . GRACEDEW . I should like it still better if it were my very own ! CHIVERS . Well , mum , with all respect , I wish indeed it were ! But the Captain , mum , is the lawful heir . MRS . GRACEDEW . That 's another of your dear old things  --  I adore your lawful heirs ! He has come to take possession ? CHIVERS . He 's a-taking of it now . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Struck , immensely interested . ) What does he do  --  how does he do it ? Ca n't I see ? ( Then , disappointedly , as CHIVERS looks blank . ) There ai n't any fuss about it ? CHIVERS . I scarce think him the gentlemen to make any about anything ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Resignedly , smiling , thinking . ) Well , I like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round her , with a wistful , leave-taking , appreciative sigh . ) I also have taken possession ! CHIVERS . ( Smiling . ) It was you , mum , did it first ! MRS . GRACEDEW . Ah , but for a poor little hour ! He 's for life ! CHIVERS . For mine , mum , I do hope . MRS . GRACEDEW . I shall think of you together here . ( After an instant , as if reluctant to recognise that she must presently be going . ) Will he be kind to you ? CHIVERS . ( Simply . ) He has already been , mum . MRS . GRACEDEW . Then be sure to be so to him . ( Startled , as the house-bell sounds out . ) Is that his bell ? CHIVERS . ( Alert . ) I must see whose ! ( Exit to the vestibule . ) MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Alone , looking round her again , wandering about the room and detaching from the wall a small framed plaque of enamel , which she examines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish awfully I were a bad woman  --  then , I hope , I 'd just take it ! ( Re-enter CAPTAIN YULE from the garden ; on which she immediately greets him , keeping the object familiarly in her hand . ) Oh , Captain Yule , I 'm delighted to meet you . It 's such a comfort to ask you if I may ! YULE . ( Staring , mystified , charmed . ) If you may , Madam  --  ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Why , just be here , and poke round . Do n't tell me I ca n't now  --  because I already have : I 've been upstairs , and downstairs , and in my lady 's chamber ! I got round your lovely servant ;  --  if you do n't look out , I 'll grab him ! If you do n't look out I 'll grab everything ! That 's what I came over for  --  just to lay your country waste . Your house is just an old dream  --  and you 've got some good things . Oh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't ! Do n't you know it ? ( Handing him her enamel . ) Just look at that ! ( Then as he holds the plaque , bewildered , blank , looking only at herself . ) Do n't you know anything ? It 's Limoges ! YULE . ( Amused , interested . ) I do n't know my house  --  I 've never seen it ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Eagerly seizing his arm . ) Then do let me show it to you ! YULE . I shall be delighted . ( Then as he sees CHIVERS : re-enter CHIVERS from the vestibule . ) Who 's there ? CHIVERS . ( Excited . ) A party ! YULE . ( Vague . ) A party ? CHIVERS . Over from Gossage  --  to see the house . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With redoubled eagerness . ) Yes , let me show it ! ( Then with a second thought , to CHIVERS . ) Oh , I forgot  --  you get the tips ! But , you dear old creature , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ! ( After an instant , looking from CHIVERS back to YULE . ) Perhaps they 'll be bigger  --  for me ! YULE . ( Laughing . ) I should think they 'd be enormous , for you ! But I should like to go over with you alone . CHIVERS . ( To YULE . ) Shall I show them in ? YULE . By all means  --  if there 's money in it ! ( Exit CHIVERS to the vestibule . ) MRS . GRACEDEW . Oh , and I promised to show it to Miss Prodmore  --  do call her too . YULE . ( Taken aback . ) " Call " her ? Dear lady , I do n't know her ! MRS . GRACEDEW . You must  --  she 's charming . ( Re-enter CORA PRODMORE from the drawingroom ; on which MRS . GRACEDEW goes on , indicating her . ) Just see if she ai n't ! Miss Prodmore , let me present Captain Yule . Captain Yule , Miss Prodmore . Miss Prodmore , Captain Yule . ( Re-enter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this introduction , MR . PRODMORE from the drawingroom . ) CORA . ( Promptly , eagerly , on seeing her father . ) Papa , let me " present " you to Mrs. Gracedew . Mrs. Gracedew , Mr. Prodmore , Mr. Prodmore , Mrs. Gracedew . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With a little bow , all cordiality , to MR . PRODMORE . ) Mr. Prodmore . So happy to meet your daughter 's father . Your daughter 's such a lovely girl ! PRODMORE . ( Responding heartily and hurling the words at YULE . ) Ah yes , such a lovely girl ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Smiling benevolently at CORA . ) So fresh and natural and unexpected ! PRODMORE . ( In the same way as before , to YULE . ) Most fresh  --  most natural  --  MOST unexpected ! ( Re-enter , during the presentations , CHIVERS , from the vestibule , accompanied by four or five tourists , simple , awestruck , provincial folk . ) CHIVERS . ( As with the habit of years , immediately beginning . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of the ' ouse  --  the old ' istorical , feudal ' all . Bein ' , from all accounts , the most ancient portion of the edifice , it was erected in the earliest ages . Some say in the fifteenth century . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Who has followed with active attention ; irrepressibly . ) I say in the fourteenth  --  you 're robbing us of a hundred years ! CHIVERS . ( Confessing his aberration ; abashed . ) I do seem to go astray in them centuries ! The Gothic roof is much admired  --  the west gallery a modern addition . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( In the eagerness of her interest ; laughing . ) What on earth do you call modern ? It existed at the time of the visit of James the First , in 1611 , and is supposed to have served , in the charming detail of its ornament , as a model for several that were constructed in his reign . The great fireplace is Jacobean . CHIVERS . The tapestry on the left is Flemish  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if I take you up . The elegant woodwork is Flemish  --  the tapestry on the left Italian . ( Smiling , pleading , to CHIVERS . ) Do you really mind if I just do it ? Oh , I know how  --  like the housekeeper , last week , at Castle Gaunt . Footnote : 1Kb ( To the party , comprehensively , sociably . ) How do ye do ? ai n't it thrilling ? ( Then as she laughingly does the housekeeper . ) Keep well together , please  --  we 're not doing puss in the corner ! I have my duty to all parties  --  I ca n't be partial to one ! ( To an individual who appears to have asked a question . ) How many parties ? The party up and the party down . ( Pointing to an escutcheon in a stained-glass window . ) Observe the family arms . ( Then to an old full-length portrait , a long-limbed gentleman in white trunk-hose , relieved against a black background . ) And observe the family legs ! Observe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banner carried at Blenheim . ( Then on a graver note , but still with brightness , looking round at them all , in their circle , and taking in particularly CAPTAIN YULE , down at right or at left . ) Observe , above all , that you 're in one of the most interesting old houses , of its type , in England ; for which the ages have been tender and the generations wise ; letting it change so slowly that there 's always more left than taken  --  living their lives in it , but letting it shape their lives ! PRODMORE . ( In high elation . ) A most striking tribute to Summersoft !  --  You do , Madam , bring it out ! A VISITOR . ( To another . ) Does n't she , Jane , bring it out . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Staring , laughing . ) But who in the world wants to keep it in ? It ai n't a secret  --  or a mean government ! ( With a free indication of the fine arch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at those lovely lines ! ( The visitors nudge each other , exclaiming , under their breath , " Look  --  look ! " and all heads , save YULE 'S , are jerked up , everyone staring at the roof and much impressed . Then pointing successively to the high ancient window and the other objects , to which all turn . ) Just look at the tone of that glass  --  and the cutting of that oak  --  and the dear old flags of the very floor . To look , in this place , is to love ! A VISITOR . ( Sniggling . ) Laws  --  to love ! ANOTHER . It depends on who you look at ! PRODMORE . ( Exhilarated , arch . ) Do you hear that , Captain ? You must look at the right person ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Who has been watching YULE during this last moment . ) I do n't think Captain Yule cares . He does n't do justice  --  ! YULE . ( After an instant during which he gives her back a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRACEDEW . To the value of your house . YULE . I like to hear you express it ! MRS . GRACEDEW . I ca n't express it . ( After an instant , as if she has tried . ) It 's too inexpressible ! PRODMORE . ( Encouraging . ) Have a little try , Madam  --  it would bring it quite ' ome to us . MRS . GRACEDEW . Well  --  the value 's a fancy-value ! PRODMORE . ( Triumphant , to YULE . ) Exactly what I told you ! MRS . GRACEDEW . When a thing 's unique , it 's unique ! PRODMORE . It 's unique ! A VISITOR . ( Very assentingly . ) It 's unique ! MRS . GRACEDEW . It 's worth anything you like . PRODMORE . Anything you like ! A VISITOR . ( With increasing boldness . ) Twenty thousand , now ? MRS . GRACEDEW . I would n't look at twenty thousand ! PRODMORE . ( Eagerly , to YULE . ) She would n't look at twenty thousand ! THE VISITOR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Looking round her , hesitating . ) It would be giving it away ! PRODMORE . ( To YULE . ) It would be giving it away ! ANOTHER VISITOR . You 'd hold out for forty , eh ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After another consideration , fixing her eyes , with a smile , on YULE . ) Fifty , Captain Yule , is what I think I should offer ! A VISITOR . ( In admiration . ) Fifty thousand pound ! ANOTHER . ( In stupefaction , simultaneously . ) Fifty thousand pound ! PRODMORE . ( Victoriously to YULE . ) Fifty thousand pound ! ( Then with gaiety and decision to MRS . GRACEDEW . ) He 'll never part with his ancestral ' ome ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With equal gaiety . ) Then I 'll go over it again while I 've a chance ! ( To the party , doing again the housekeeper . ) We now pass to the grand staircase ! YULE . ( Who has assisted at this scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; abruptly addressing MRS . GRACEDEW . ) Please let them pass without you ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Surprised , staring . ) And stay here with you ? YULE . If you 'll be so good . I want to speak to you . ( With perceptible impatience , to CHIVERS , hurrying the others off . ) I say  --  take them ! CHIVERS . ( With instant obsequiosity , to the party . ) We now pass to the grand staircase . ( Exeunt the visitors to the staircase , marshalled and conducted by CHIVERS . ) CORA . ( Breaking out , uneasily . ) Mrs. Gracedew  --  may I speak to you ? PRODMORE . ( Interposing sharply . ) After Captain Yule , my dear . You must also see the house . ( He pushes her off peremptorily  --  while YULE moves nervously away , with his back turned  --  in the wake of the party . Then he exclaims , quickly and privately , to MRS . GRACEDEW . ) Pile it on ! ( Exit , by the staircase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes to communicate again with MRS . GRACEDEW , who gaily and unsuspiciously kisses her hand to her , he hurries off . ) YULE . ( After an instant of embarrassed silence , when he is left alone with MRS . GRACEDEW . ) How do you come to know so much about my house ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Laughing . ) How do you come to know so little ? YULE . ( After an instant . ) A combination of misfortunes has forbidden me , till this hour , to enter it . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With the friendliest compassion . ) Why , you poor thing  --  now that you 've got here I hope you 'll stay ! Do make yourself comfortable  --  do n't mind me ! YULE . That 's exactly what I wanted to say to you ! MRS . GRACEDEW . Well , I have n't minded you much , have I ? YULE . Oh , it 's you who seem in complete possession , and I the vague outsider . MRS . GRACEDEW . Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After an instant , smiling ; more and more charmed . ) Up to what ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Up to everything !  --  You were smoking when you came in . ( Looking about her . ) Where 's your cigarette ? YULE . ( Producing a fresh cigarette . ) I thought perhaps I might n't  --  here . MRS . GRACEDEW . You may everywhere . YULE . ( With docility , receiving instruction . ) Everywhere . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Laughing at the way he says it . ) A rule of the house ! YULE . ( Looking round him , pleased . ) What delightful rules ! MRS . GRACEDEW . How could such a house have any others ? ( After an instant , full of her happy sense of the place . ) I may go up again , may n't I ? to the Long Gallery ? YULE . ( Vague . ) The Long Gallery ? MRS . GRACEDEW . I forgot you 've never seen it ! It 's a glory ! ( Thinking but of seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! YULE . ( Smoking , without moving . ) There 's a party up . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Laughing , remembering . ) So you must be the " party down " ? Well , you must give me a chance  --  that Long Gallery 's the principal thing I came over for . YULE . ( After smoking a moment and staring at her in candid mystification . ) Where in heaven 's name , did you come over from ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Missourah Top , where I 'm building  --  just in this style . I came for my plans  --  I felt I must look at you . YULE . ( Amazed . ) But what did you know about us ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Everything ! YULE . ( Incredulous . ) At Missourah Top ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Why not ? It 's a growing place  --  thirty thousand the last census . My husband left it to me . YULE . ( After an hesitation . ) You 're a widow ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a sad smile . ) My loneliness is great enough to require a great receptacle  --  and my taste is good enough to require a beautiful one . You see , I had your picture . YULE . ( Bewildered . ) Mine ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Smiling . ) A watercolour I chanced on  --  ( nodding in the direction ) of that divine south front . So I got you up  --  in the books . YULE . ( Surprised , artlessly . ) Are we in the books ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Equally surprised . ) Did you never discover it ? ( After an instant . ) Where , in heaven 's name , Captain Yule , have you come over from ? YULE . The East End of London . MRS . GRACEDEW . What were you doing there ? YULE . Working . When I left the army  --  it was too slow  --  I began to see that , for a fighting man  --  MRS . GRACEDEW . There 's always somebody to fight ? YULE . The enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice  --  injustice and privilege and wrong ! Such as you see me  --  MRS . GRACEDEW . You 're a rabid reformer ? I wish we had you at Missourah Top ! YULE . ( Smiling . ) I fear my work is nearer home . I hope  --  as a representative of the people  --  to achieve a part of it in the next House of Commons . My electors have wanted me  --  MRS . GRACEDEW . And you 've wanted them  --  and that has been why you could n't come . YULE . From my childhood up , there was another reason . ( Smiling . ) A family feud ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Delighted . ) Oh , I 'm so glad  --  I hoped I 'd strike a " feud " ! That rounds it off , and spices it up , and , for the heartbreak with which I take leave of you , just neatly completes the fracture ! ( As if the time for her departure is already there  --  looking round her for some personal belonging she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up ? YULE . ( After an instant . ) Only till you tell me this : if you literally meant  --  a while ago  --  that this place is so wonderful . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( As if in astonishment , almost in compassion , at his density . ) Do you literally require me to say it ? Can you stand there and not feel it ? ( Looking round her again ; then with a fresh rush of her impression . ) It 's a place to Love  --  YULE . ( As she hesitates an instant . ) To Love ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Well , as you 'd love a person ! ( With abrupt decision , going up . ) Goodbye ! YULE . ( As she reaches the foot of the stairs . ) I think I feel it  --  but it 's largely you who make me . The greater the pity  --  that I shall have to give it up ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Turning , with a sudden stop and stare . ) Give it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't afford to keep it . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Coming down again , promptly ; thinking . ) Ca n't you let it ? YULE . ( Smiling . ) Let it to you ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With a laugh . ) I 'd take it in a minute ! YULE . I should n't have the face to charge you a rent that would make it worth one 's while , and I think even you , dear lady , would n't have the face to offer me one . My lovely inheritance is Dead Sea fruit . It 's mortgaged for all it 's worth , and I have n't the means to pay the interest . If by a miracle I could scrape the money together , I should n't have a penny left to live on . So I see it at last ( looking round the place )  --  only to lose it ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Immensely disconcerted . ) I never heard of anything so dreadful ! Surely there 's a way of arranging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed to me . MRS . GRACEDEW . For heaven 's sake , then , accept it ! YULE . I 've made up my mind in the last quarter of an hour that I ca n't . It 's too peculiar . MRS . GRACEDEW . What 's the peculiarity ? YULE . A change in my essential attitude . The mortgages have all found their way , like a flock of silly sheep , into the hands of one person  --  a devouring wolf , a rich , a powerful capitalist . He holds me in this manner at his mercy . He consents to make things comfortable for me , but he requires that , in return , I shall do something very serious for him . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Wondering . ) Something wrong ? YULE . ( Decided . ) Yes  --  exceedingly so . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After a moment . ) Anything immoral ? YULE . Yes , I may literally call it immoral . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After another hesitation . ) Is it too bad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving her to judge . ) He wants me to change my opinions ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Amazed . ) Your " opinions " ? Is that all ? YULE . Surely it 's quite enough  --  considering how many I have ! MRS . GRACEDEW . Well , I 've a neat collection too , but I 'd change the whole set for  --  ( looking about an instant for an equivalent , then pointing to the chimneypiece ) that set of old fire-irons . YULE . ( With amused compassion . ) I do n't think you understand me . He wants me to change my politics . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Undaunted . ) I 'd change them for the hearthbrush ! YULE . ( Laughing . ) You 've not issued a scorching address . You 're not a pure , pledged Radical , suddenly invited to present yourself to this neighbouring borough of Gossage as a full-fed Conservative . MRS . GRACEDEW . Is it Mr. Prodmore who invites you ? YULE . I did n't mean to mention his name ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's he who 's the devouring wolf  --  it 's he who holds your mortgages ? ( Then , after an instant , on YULE 'S assent . ) Why does n't he stand himself ? YULE . Well , like other devouring wolves , he is n't personally adored . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Catching on ; seeing clear . ) I see . You would be , you poor lamb , and that 's why he wants you ! YULE . I 'm the bearer of my name , I 'm the representative of my family ; and to my family  --  since you 've led me to it  --  this countryside has been for generations indulgently attached . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Who has listened with deep interest . ) You do what you will with the countryside ? YULE . If we do it as genuine Yules . Now your genuine Yule 's a Tory of Tories . It 's Mr. Prodmore 's view that I should carry Gossage in that character , but that they would n't look at me in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary interest that he attaches  --  ? YULE . ( Taking her up . ) To the return of a Tory ? Oh , his desire is born of his fear  --  his terror on behalf of Property . He has got so much  --  and he has n't got anything else . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Gaily . ) He has got a very nice daughter ! YULE . ( After an instant . ) I really did n't look at her  --  and moreover she 's a part of the Property . He thinks things are going too far . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With abrupt , high decision . ) Well , they are ! YULE . ( Struck , more grave , as if surprised at her tone . ) Are n't you a lover of justice ? MRS . GRACEDEW . A passionate one ! ( After an instant . ) Where 's the justice in your losing this house ? To keep it  --  ( with renewed decision ) you must carry Gossage ! YULE . ( Aghast . ) As a renegade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What business have you to be anything else ? You must close with Mr. Prodmore  --  you must stand in the Conservative interest . ( After an instant . ) If you will , I 'll conduct your canvass ! YULE . ( Laughing . ) That puts the temptation high ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Impatient . ) Ah , do n't look at me as if I were the temptation ! Look at this sweet old human home , and feel all its gathered memories . Do you want to know what they do to me ?  --  they speak to me for Mr. Prodmore ! YULE . Well , dear lady , there are other things that speak to me  --  things for which I 've spoken , repeatedly and loudly , to others . One 's " human home " is all very well , but the rest of one 's humanity is better .  --  I see  --  you 're disgusted with me , and I 'm sorry ; but one must take one 's self as circumstances and experience have made one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very modern man ! I see something else in the world than the beauty of old show-houses and the glory of old show-families . There are thousands of people in England who can show no houses at all , and I do n't feel as if it were utterly shameful to share their poor fate ! MRS . GRACEDEW . We share the poor fate of humanity whatever we do , and we do something precious to show . What on earth is more precious than what the ages have slowly wrought ? They 've trusted you to keep it  --  to do something for them . It 's such a virtue , in anything , to have lasted  --  it 's such an honour , for anything , to have been spared . To a struggler from the wreck of time  --  hold out a pitying hand ! YULE . ( Struck by what she says and the way she says it , but turning it off with a laugh . ) What a plea , dear Mrs. Gracedew , to come from Missourah Top ! MRS . GRACEDEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as ever we can  --  and I should like to see you lay your hand on an hour of the one that we 've made ! It 's a tight fit , as yet  --  I admit  --  and that 's just why I like , in yours , to find room to turn round . You 're in it , over here , and you ca n't get out ; so just make the best of it and treat it as part of the fun ! YULE . The whole of the fun , to me , is in hearing you defend it ! It 's like your defending chronic rheumatism  --  something that I feel aching in every bone of these walls and groaning in every draught that , I 'm sure , blows through them . MRS . GRACEDEW . If there are draughts ( looking about her )  --  there may be  --  you 're here to stop them up . And do you know what I 'm here for ? If I 've come so far and so straight , I 've almost wondered myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now I see why I 've felt . I 'm here for an act of salvation  --  I 'm here to avert a sacrifice ! YULE . ( With great acknowledgment and admiration . ) You 're here , I think , Madam  --  to be a memory for my future ! MRS . GRACEDEW . You 'll be one for mine , if I can see you by that hearth . Why do you make such a fuss about changing your politics ? If you 'd come to Missourah Top you 'd change them quick enough ! What do politics amount to  --  compared with religions . Parties and programmes come and go , but a duty like this abides . There 's nothing you can break with that would be like breaking here . The very word 's a violence  --  a sacrilege : your house is a kind of altar ! You must have beauty in your life  --  that 's the only way to make sure of it for the life of others . Keep leaving it to them , and heaven knows what they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that ?  --  to preach you the truth ? Then it 's good we come over , to see what you 're about ! We know what we have n't got , and if you 've luckily got it , you 've got it also for us . You 've got it in trust , and oh ! we have an eye on you . You 've had it so for me , all these dear days , that , to be grateful , I 've wanted to do something . ( Pleading . ) Tell me now I shall have done it  --  I shall have kept you at your post ! YULE . ( Strongly troubled , rendered nervous and uncertain by her appeal ; moving restlessly about . ) You have a strange eloquence ! Of course I do n't pretend that I do n't care for Summersoft . MRS . GRACEDEW . You have n't even seen it , yet ! I think you 're afraid . YULE . ( After an instant . ) Perhaps I am ! But if I am  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRACEDEW . ( Vague . ) What else is it ? YULE . It does n't matter  --  you may be right . When we talk of the house , your voice seems somehow its very soul . I like to listen . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With joyous relief . ) Then I 've done a good day 's work ! YULE . Not yet : I must wait  --  I must think . MRS . GRACEDEW . When have you to answer Mr. Prodmore ? YULE . ( Thinking , fidgetty . ) He gives me time . MRS . GRACEDEW . I would n't ! For God 's sake , go upstairs ! YULE . ( Reluctant . ) And meet Mr. Prodmore ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Seeing CORA on the stairs . ) He 's coming down . ( Re-enter CORA PRODMORE by the staircase . ) YULE . ( After a straight , distracted stare at CORA , hesitating a moment more , then sharply deciding . ) I 'll go up ! ( Exit rapidly by the staircase . ) CORA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you  --  I 've wanted so to speak to you ! ( With intensity . ) May I confide in you ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Staring , struck , amused . ) You too ? It is good we come over ! CORA . It is indeed ! You were so kind to me  --  and I 'm alone with my tremendous news , which met me at the door . ( Bringing it out with all the force of her excitement . ) He wants me to marry him ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Not following . ) " He " wants you  --  ? CORA . Papa , of course . He has settled it ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Blank ; thinking . ) That you 're to marry whom ? CORA . Why , Captain Yule , who just went out . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Startled , but still vague . ) Has Captain Yule asked you ? CORA . No  --  but he will : to keep the house . It 's mortgaged to Papa  --  he buys it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By " marrying " you ? CORA . ( Lucid . ) Giving me his name and his position . They 're the price  --  Papa wants them . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Bewildered . ) But his name and his position  --  are his dreadful politics ! CORA . You know about his dreadful politics ? He 's to change them  --  to get me ! And if he gets me  --  MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Taking her up with intensity . ) He keeps the house ? CORA . I go with it  --  he 's to have us both . But only if he changes . The question is : Will he change ? MRS . GRACEDEW . I see . Will he change ? CORA . ( Thinking , speculating . ) Has he changed ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With a note of irritation . ) My dear child  --  how in the world should I know ? CORA . He has n't seemed to care enough for the house . Does he care ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he does , he 'll propose . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Seeing YULE on the stairs ; after an instant , convinced , struck . ) He 'll propose . ( Re-enter CAPTAIN YULE by the staircase . ) CORA . ( Fluttered , alarmed . ) Then I fly ! YULE . ( As CORA has moved to the garden-door . ) I drive Miss Prodmore away . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Very promptly . ) It 's all right ! ( To CORA . ) I 've something to say to Captain Yule . CORA . I 've something more to say to you  --  before you go . MRS . GRACEDEW . Come back then  --  I 'm not going ! ( Exit CORA to the garden . YULE stands there gravely , rigidly , with his eyes fixed to the ground . There is a considerable awkward silence , during which MRS . GRACEDEW moves vaguely about the room without looking at him . ) YULE . ( At last . ) It will doubtless give you pleasure to know that I 've closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another silence . ) I thought you said he gave you time . YULE . ( Still very grave . ) You produced just now so deep an effect on me that I thought best not to take any . I came right upon him there  --  and I burnt my ships ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Without looking at him . ) You do what he requires ? YULE . I do what he requires . I felt the tremendous force of all you said to me . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After a moment . ) So did I  --  or I should n't have said it ! YULE . You 're perhaps not aware that you wield an influence of which it 's not too much to say that it 's practically irresistible ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Graver even than YULE : thinking ; just faintly ironical . ) You 've given me the most flattering proof of my influence that I 've ever enjoyed in my life ! YULE . ( As if beginning to be struck by her manner ; explanatory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the moment you had promptly converted me into the absolute echo of your raptures . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Vague , as if she has suddenly forgotten them . ) My " raptures " ? YULE . ( Surprised . ) Why , about my home . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Recalling ; with indefinable dryness . ) Oh yes  --  your home . It 's a nice tattered , battered old thing .  --  It has defects , of course ; but it 's no use mentioning them now ! YULE . ( Uneasy , sad . ) I 'm singularly sorry you did n't mention them before ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After a moment . ) If you had gone over the house , as I literally besought you to do , you might have discovered some of them yourself . YULE . I was precisely in the very act of it ; but the first person I met , above , was Mr. Prodmore ; when , feeling that I must come to it , sooner or later , I just yielded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well over . MRS . GRACEDEW . Let me then congratulate you on at last knowing what you want ! YULE . I only know it so far as you know it !  --  I struck while the iron was hot  --  or at any rate while the hammer was ! MRS . GRACEDEW . Of course I recognise that it can rarely have been exposed to such a fire . I blazed up , and I know that when I burn  --  ! YULE . ( As she pauses , thinking . ) When you burn ? MRS . GRACEDEW . I burn as Chicago burns . YULE . Down to the ground ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Throwing up her arms . ) Up to the sky !  --  I suppose you 've still formalities to go through . YULE . With Mr. Prodmore ? Oh , endless , tiresome ones , no doubt ! MRS . GRACEDEW . You mean they 'll take so very long ? YULE . Every hour , every month , that I can possibly make them last ! MRS . GRACEDEW . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out too much  --  must you ? or he 'll think that you perhaps want to retract . YULE . ( With abrupt expressiveness . ) I should n't be so terribly upset by his mistake if he did ! MRS . GRACEDEW . Oh , it would never do to give him any colour whatever for supposing that you have any doubt that , as one may say , you 've pledged your honour . YULE . Of course not  --  not when I have n't any doubt ! MRS . GRACEDEW . How can you possibly have any , any more than you can possibly have that one 's honour is everything in the world ? YULE . Oh yes  --  everything in the world . MRS . GRACEDEW . We spoke of honour a while ago  --  did n't we ?  --  and of the difficulty of keeping it unspotted ; so that there 's no more to be said except that I leave you to that engrossing occupation . I hope you 'll enjoy your cosy little home , and appreciate such a fury of affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suppose it will be a " fury " ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Representing surprise . ) Why , what do you call the love of twenty thousand ? ( Then on his gesture of consternation . ) That 's my rough estimate of the population of Gossage . Such a lovely figure ! YULE . ( Struck , off his guard , confused . ) Who has a lovely figure  --  ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( With a nervous laugh . ) Gossage !  --  Goodbye . YULE . ( More and more disconcerted . ) You do n't mean to say you 're going ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Have n't I done what I told you I had been mysteriously moved to come for ? ( Looking about ; addressing herself to the house . ) You 're saved ! YULE . ( Troubled , earnest . ) For God 's sake do n't go till I can come back to thank you ! I promised to return immediately to Prodmore . MRS . GRACEDEW . Oh , do n't let me stand in Prodmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably over ! YULE . ( Agitated . ) I certainly feel that I must see him again .  --  Yes , decidedly , I must ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( As if this is highly obvious . ) Then go to him ! YULE . ( Pressing . ) Will you wait for me ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Having first hesitated , then looked round her for a chair , into which she drops . ) Go to him . ( YULE goes to the staircase and begins slowly to mount it , looking back at her as she sits there by his  --  as it were  --  quiet fireside . Half way up he pauses , hesitates , and then comes down a few steps again , as if to approach her once more and break out into something . His doing this startles her , so as to make her turn round , rising again and looking at him . Hereupon he stops a second time and stands there  --  still on the staircase  --  exchanging with her a fixed , silent gaze ; after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very rapidly ascends the rest of the steps . Exit CAPTAIN YULE . MRS . GRACEDEW then comes down . ) Why did n't he tell me all ? ( After an instant , taking herself up , repudiating the question . ) It was none of my business ! ( Wondering again . ) What does he mean to do ?  --  What should he do but what he has done ?  --  and what can he do when he 's so deeply committed , when he 's practically engaged , when he 's just the same as married ?  --  The thing for me to do is just to go : to remove from the scene they encumber the numerous fragments ( seeing CORA reappear and spying , on the table on which he has gathered them together , the pieces of the vase CHIVERS has smashed  --  ) of my old Chelsea pot ! ( Re-enter CORA from the garden . ) CORA . Ah , Captain Yule 's gone ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Upstairs again  --  to rejoin your father . CORA . Papa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , to rejoin me . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After an instant . ) He can do so here  --  I 'm going . CORA . ( Disconcerted . ) Just when I 've come back to you ( slightly arch )  --  at the risk of again interrupting your conversation with Captain Yule ? MRS . GRACEDEW . I 've nothing to say to Captain Yule . CORA . You had a good deal to say a few minutes ago ! MRS . GRACEDEW . Well , I 've said it  --  and it 's over ! ( With great decision . ) I 've nothing more to say at all ! ( Then , as if to change the subject and involuntarily lingering , in spite of her successive announcements of departure . ) What 's become of the " party " ? CORA . Dismissed , through the grounds , by the other door . But they 've announced the arrival of a fresh lot . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Gaily . ) Well , you must take the fresh lot  --  since the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mine ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Surprised at her surprise . ) Why , if you 're going to marry Captain Yule . CORA . ( Very resolute . ) I 'm not going to marry Captain Yule ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( In stupefaction . ) Why on earth then did you tell me just now you were ? CORA . ( Extremely astonished that MRS . GRACEDEW has believed this . ) I told you nothing of the sort . I only told you he had been ordered me ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Amused , wondering . ) Like a dose of medicine or a course of baths ? CORA . As a remedy for the single life . But I wo n't take him ! MRS . GRACEDEW . Ah then , why did n't you tell me ? CORA . I was on the very point of it when he came in and interrupted us . It 's what I came back for . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Relieved , smiling . ) Excuse me  --  I misunderstood . I somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted I 'd jump at him ? Well , you see I do n't ! MRS . GRACEDEW . You prefer the single life ? CORA . No , but I do n't prefer him ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Struck , interested . ) You prefer someone else ? ( Then as CORA turns away from her , nervously faltering a moment ; gently , encouragingly . ) He seems remarkably nice . CORA . ( Impatiently . ) Then why do n't you marry him yourself ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Staring ; with a laugh . ) Well , I 've got fifty reasons ! I think one of them is that he has n't asked me . CORA . I have n't got " fifty " reasons , but I 've got one ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Struck , then smiling . ) I see . An older friend ! CORA . ( With emotion . ) I 've been trying , this hour , in my need of advice , to tell you about him ! After we parted at the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little quiet walk with him which gave you time to get here before me and of which my father is in a state of ignorance that I do n't know whether to call desirable or dreadful . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Who has taken this earnestly in ; turning it over . ) You want me then to inform your father ? CORA . ( Embarrassed , distressful . ) I really do n't know what I want ! I think I want support . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Thinking , then taking a large resolution . ) Then I 'll support you ! CORA . ( With effusion . ) You dear woman !  --  He 's intensely sympathetic . MRS . GRACEDEW . So are you  --  and he must have a nice nature , to be conscious of an affinity with you ! CORA . His affinity is greater than poor Captain Yule 's  --  I could see at a glance that he had none ! Papa has seen him , but we 've been so sure Papa would hate it that we 've had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest man at Bellborough , he 's Granny 's godson , and he 'll inherit his father 's business , which is simply immense . He has been away for three days , and if he met me at the station , where , on his way back , he had to change , it was quite by the purest chance . He 's clever , and he 's good  --  and I know he loves me ! MRS . GRACEDEW . Then what 's the matter with him ? CORA . ( Faltering . ) His name . MRS . GRACEDEW . What is it ? CORA . ( Bringing it out . ) Buddle . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Repeating it interrogatively and a trifle dubiously . Then with courageous decision . ) Well  --  Buddle will do ! CORA . Then , for heaven 's sake , make my father think so ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After a moment . ) I 'll make him  --  if in return you 'll do something for me . Give me a clear assurance . CORA . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That if Captain Yule should propose to you , you 'd unconditionally refuse him . CORA . With my dying breath ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After an instant . ) Will you make it even a promise ? CORA . ( Emphatically . ) A promise . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( In whose hand CORA has placed her own . ) Then let me kiss you ! CORA . ( After the embrace , at the door of the vestibule . ) We 'll meet at the station . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Vague . ) Where are you going ? CORA . ( Smiling . ) Ca n't you guess ? ( Exit to the vestibule . ) MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Alone . ) To Mr. Buddle ! ( Then , with great decision , as if she herself now knows thoroughly what she 's about . ) Thank goodness for Mr. Buddle ! ( Re-enter MR . PRODMORE from the garden . ) PRODMORE . My daughter 's not here ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Your daughter 's not here . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are , for I 've something very particular to ask you . PRODMORE . ( Who has crossed to the drawingroom . ) I shall be delighted to answer your question , but I must first put my hand on Miss Prodmore . ( Then having checked himself at the door . ) Unless indeed she 's occupied in there with Captain Yule . MRS . GRACEDEW . I do n't think she 's occupied  --  anywhere  --  with Captain Yule . PRODMORE . ( Uneasy . ) Then where the deuce is Captain Yule ? MRS . GRACEDEW . His absence , for which I 'm responsible , is just what renders the inquiry I spoke of to you possible .  --  What will you take  --  for your interest in this property ? PRODMORE . ( Staring , coming down . ) Eh ?  --  You know about my interest ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Everything . PRODMORE . Then you must know it has just ceased to exist . I 've given it up  --  for an equivalent . MRS . GRACEDEW . For a son-in-law ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designation . MRS . GRACEDEW . Then Miss Prodmore has already accepted him ? PRODMORE . In spite of the doubt which you appear to throw on the idea , it is my intimate conviction that she is accepting him at this moment . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After a moment ; abruptly . ) Dear Mr. Prodmore , why are you so imprudent as to make your daughter afraid of you ? You should have taught her to confide in you . She has clearly shown me that she can confide . PRODMORE . ( Blankly anxious . ) She confides in you ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Completely . Let me suggest that as fortune has thrown us together here , for a moment , you follow her good example .  --  Tell me , for instance , the ground of your objection to poor Mr. Buddle . I mean Mr. Buddle of Bellborough , the godson of your daughter 's grandmother and the associate of his father in their flourishing house  --  to whom ( as he is to her ) Miss Prodmore is devotedly attached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone as far as that ? MRS . GRACEDEW . It has gone so far that you had better let it go the rest of the way ! PRODMORE . ( Astounded , indignant . ) It 's too monstrous , to have plotted to keep me in the dark  --  ! MRS . GRACEDEW . I 'm afraid it 's only when you 're kept in the dark that your daughter 's kept in the light ! It 's at her own earnest request that I plead to you for her liberty of choice . She 's an honest girl , and she 's not a baby : she has a perfect right to her preference . PRODMORE . And pray have n't I a perfect right to mine ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Not at her expense . You ask her to give up too much . PRODMORE . And what does she ask me to give up ? The desire of my heart and the dream of my life ! Captain Yule announced to me but a few minutes since his intention to offer her his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his hand will be simply declined . PRODMORE . ( Resolutely . ) It wo n't be declined ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Still more resolutely . ) It will ! PRODMORE .

( Then after a moment , while he stands arrested , bewildered . ) Now tell me how much ! PRODMORE . How can I tell you anything so preposterous ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Simply by computing the total amount to which , for your benefit , this unhappy estate is burdened .  --  If I 've troubled you by showing you that your speculation is built on the sand , let me atone for it by my eagerness to take off your hands an investment from which you derive so little profit . PRODMORE . ( Blank , wondering . ) And pray what profit will you derive  --  ? MRS . GRACEDEW . That 's my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I , damme !  --  and that 's why I 've practically paid for it ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Pleadingly . ) I 'll practically pay for it , Mr. Prodmore , if you 'll only tell me your figure . PRODMORE . ( As if struck , dimly , with a new light ; thinking . ) My figure ? MRS . GRACEDEW . Your figure . PRODMORE . ( After an instant , dryly ; dismissing the question as if vain . ) My figure would be distinctly high . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Smiling . ) You have all the greater interest in letting me know it . As soon as you 've done so I cable to Missourah Top to have the money sent right out to you . PRODMORE . ( Contemptuously amused at her simple notions of business . ) Having the money sent right out to me wo n't make you owner of this place . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Thinking , conceding . ) No  --  not quite . But I 'll settle the rest with Captain Yule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to sell . MRS . GRACEDEW . ( After an instant . ) Then what have you been trying to buy ? PRODMORE . ( Starting , staring . ) Do you mean to say you want to buy that ? ( Then as she turns away disgusted , protesting , but slightly embarrassed . ) Is your proposal that I should transfer my investment to you for the mere net amount of it your idea of a fair bargain ? MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Vague . ) Pray , what is yours ? PRODMORE . Mine would be , not that I should simply get my money back , but that I should get the effective value of the house . MRS . GRACEDEW . But is n't the effective value of the house just what your money expresses ? PRODMORE . ( After an instant ; triumphant . ) No , Madam  --  it 's just what yours does ! It 's moreover just what your lips have already expressed so distinctly ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Thinking , recalling . ) To those people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Categorical . ) You said it was " unique . " You said it was the perfect specimen of its class in England .

( After a moment . ) I 'm in to the tune of fifty thousand ! MRS . GRACEDEW . ( Disconcerted , staggered ; after an instant . ) That 's a great deal of money . PRODMORE . ( Imperturbable . ) So I 've often had occasion to say to myself . MRS . GRACEDEW . If it 's a large sum for you then , it 's a still larger one for me !

I think it 's this intrigue , as you call it , that has protected me ! Drive after them , overtake them and forgive them . If you 'll do that , I 'll give you your price ! PRODMORE .

On a Sunday morning in May 1889 , Henry James recorded in his notebook that he had agreed to do a play for Edward Compton of the Compton Comedy Company , a theatrical troupe which for the past decade had toured the British Isles playing the old classical comedies and " costume pieces . " Compton had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished writer he felt he would be able to set himself up in a West End theatre and join the ranks of the capital 's actor-managers whose acknowledged peer was Henry Irving . Compton proposed that James dramatize The American and the novelist noted that he would have to " extract the simplest , strongest , baldest , most rudimentary , at once most humorous and most touching play " from his twelve-year-old novel . ( " Oh how it must not be too good and how very bad it must be ! " ) He first gave the play the name of The Californian , but later returned to his original title . A note indicates that in February 1890 he completed and sent off to Compton the second act of the play . In April he was confiding to his old friend in Paris , Henrietta Reubell , " I have ... written a big ( and awfully good ) four-act play , by which I hope to make my fortune ... now that I have begun , I mean to follow it up with others . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister a typescript of the play and when she wrote an enthusiastic note to him he poured out an excited twenty-five page letter of gratitude . He felt he had met " exactly the immediate , actual , intense British conditions , both subjective and objective " ; the play would run , to the minute , two and three-quarter hours ; the writing of the piece had been an education ; superior acting would help but " mediocrity of handling ( which is all , at the best , I am pretty sure , that it will get ) wo n't and ca n't kill it . " Wolcott Balestier , who had agreed to act as his agent , had settled with Compton that James would receive ten per cent of the gross and the novelist received a 250 advance on royalties . And James day-dreamed in his letter to his sister of receiving $400 a week during the provincial run and $1,500 a month during the London run , of road companies in England , in America , of tours elsewhere in the British Empire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was back in London late in the summer to begin preparations for the provincial production . He submitted grudgingly to the first managerial cuts and alterations and dashed into the provinces through the rain , damp and fog of the autumn to attend rehearsals wherever the touring company might be . Gradually he found himself coaching the actors and participating in the direction of the play . Most important of all was to teach the tall and handsome Edward Compton how to act like a rich American from California , and what is more , how to talk like one . The typescript sent to the Lord Chamberlain 's Office for the licensing of the play seems to have been Compton 's ; in it , in James 's hand , are written the pronunciations of key words for Compton 's guidance . The basic principle seems to have been incorporated in a stage direction which instructs Christopher Newman , the American , to speak " a little from the nose . " Southport , near Liverpool , was selected for the first performance of the play . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the presence of a large winter population . Compton may have also had a sentimental reason for the choice . Here , in the Winter Gardens Theatre , the Compton Comedy Company had made its start ten years earlier on a bitingly cold winter night , the night of the " great snowstorm . " He was returning now to the scene of that snowy debut . Henry James arrived at Southport on New Year 's Day 1891 in a state of feverish excitement . He took rooms at the Prince of Wales Hotel where Compton and his wife , the American actress Virginia Bateman , were staying . The dramatist set himself to the task of reviewing the final rehearsals . The last , a " supreme , complete , exhaustive rehearsal " was held on January 2 . The playwright sat alone in the stalls listening and watching , and it seemed to him that someone else had written The American . It was an old-fashioned but roomy theatre ; the settings were meagre , but he felt a " kind of mystic confidence in the ultimate life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it was acted . The actors had all been conditioned to traditional roles in British classical comedy and drama . Now they found themselves playing the life of the Faubourg St. Germain ( which Compton was carefully instructed to pronounce ldquo ; Saint-Germane " ) into which the Californian intrudes . The play 's strength lay , James felt , in its intrinsic vitality . He placed all his hope on this . Such , at least , was the impression James set down after the last rehearsal as he watched Christopher Newman , in a florid chocolate-colored coat with saucer-like buttons , and similarly extravagant costumes , first win , then lose , then win again the beautiful Madame de Cintr , played by Mrs. Compton . James had substituted a happy ending for the unhappy one of the novel . In 1877 , when the novel appeared , he had written to Elizabeth Boott , who wanted a happy ending , that he deemed his denouement " the only possible one . What would you have had ? Come , now , they could n't have married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theatre ; here he could give his hero the victory he had denied him in his fiction . The final rehearsal over , the company , which had been playing in classic repertory in Southport since Christmas night , was given twenty-four hours of rest . Henry set himself to ticking off the nervous hours until the rise of the curtain . It seemed like an eternity . In the short story Nona Vincent James published the following year , dealing with the trials of a dramatist , James 's hero was " unable to eat or sleep , or sit still , at times almost in terror . He kept quiet by keeping , as usual , in motion ; he tried to walk away from his nervousness ... " but always the path led back to theatre or hotel , to the members of the cast . Wolcott Balestier arrived full of confidence and enthusiasm . Balestier had been in England for the past two years as representative of a New York publishing house and the friendship between him and James had grown . James later wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two weeks before the Southport first night the young man wrote to William Dean Howells , " My friendship with James is the most precious thing in my ' London life . ' We see much of each other and I feel his place a kind of nest or refuge . " Balestier was the first of a whole group of younger men who from the 1890 's on gathered around James and gave him the admiration and appreciation he craved . " My dear Suzerain of the Drama , " he had written to the novelist : " If you will still let me ' assist ' at the first performance of the first play of our first dramatist this is to intimate that nothing short of legal proceedings to restrain my liberty can prevent my being present . " James could n't resist this flattery . The novelist had also received a letter from William Archer , the translator of Ibsen and one of London 's leading drama critics . Archer also wanted to come to Southport . He held James in high esteem . James 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which he had complained at the absence of good plays in England , had provoked Archer to reply that the theatre needed the active collaboration of writers such as Henry James . The novelist put up a show of trying to dissuade him from coming : " I wo n't deny that I should be glad to know that the piece was seen by a serious critic , and by yourself in particular , but I shrink from every responsibility in the way of recommending such a critic to attempt so heroic a feat . The place is far , the season inclement , the interpretation extremely limited , different enough , as you may suppose , from what I should count on for representation in London . The circumstances may be definitely uncomfortable ... my hope is greater than my confidence . " William Archer arrived on the evening of the production . January 3 dawned wet , windy , cold . The Southport papers formally announced that The American would be " played this night for the first time on any stage . " The scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at his writing table trying to write away his anxiety and terror . He wrote to his brother William , " I am at present in a state of abject , lonely fear . ... I am too nervous to write more  --  and yet it 's only 3 o'clock and I 've got to wait till 8 . ... " He wrote to a French friend , Urbain Mengin , inviting his prayers , as he did those of all of his friends and relatives , with an elaborate flourish . " Je fais du thtre  --  je suis tomb bien bas  --  priez pour moi . ... " To the ever-busy man of letters , Edmund Gosse , he wrote , " After 11 o'clock tonight I may be the world 's  --  and I may be the undertaker 's . I count upon you ... to spend this evening in fasting , silence and supplication . ... I am so nervous that I miswrite and misspell . ... " All Southport seemed to be at the theatre that night . In the flare of the gas-light a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Italian opera night or of a fancy dress or political ball . The audience was " select as well as numerous . " All of the 1,500 seats were filled , including those affording so bad a view of the stage that they were seldom sold . Alice James reported that her brother told her he became " as calm as a clock " just before the curtain went up . Compton allowed his author to come back-stage , giving him a seat in a corner of the right wing , beside the curtain , and from this point of vantage the novelist saw his first publicly-performed play . The portrait that Henry James drew of Christopher Newman was a very broad caricature of the Christopher Newman of his novel . He did not hesitate to " play " him for every possible laugh at the expense of his countrymen  --  but always in an easy , good-natured fashion . He is the same American as in the novel , but where , in the work of fiction , he engages our affection throughout by his directness , simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . " I want to have a regular good time , " he announces early in the first act . " I 've been whistling Yankee Doodle all my life and now I should like to try another tune . " And yet for all this , he remains one of nature 's noblemen , warmhearted , generous , a figure of stature and authority . The voice of Newman ends by being the voice of a democratic American bringing a gust of fresh air into the Faubourg St. Germain . There were no first night accidents . The cast was somewhat nervous , but nervousness bred caution and caution aided perfection . The players , long rehearsed , were letter-perfect in their parts , even though some of them later admitted they did n't fully understand them . The curtain that fell after the first act on a hushed and gratified house which had followed the play with close interest , applauding at moments , laughing in all the right places , brought the author out from his " cubby " where he described himself as having clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting that he too had been offering prayers ) . He wrote to a friend later : " I flung myself upon Compton after the first act : ' In heaven 's name , is it going ? ' ' " Going " ? - Rather ! You could hear a pin drop ! ' " In the story Nona Vincent James 's young dramatist lives through the same experience : " Has it gone ?  --  has it gone ? " he gasped to the people around him ; and he heard them say " Rather  --  rather " ... he felt it to be long before he could back away , before he could , in his turn , seize the manager by the arm and cry huskily  --  " Has it really gone  --  really ? " For the first time in his already long career as an artist Henry James heard his work applauded . The play ended and the storm of provincial applause that mounted was sweet music to the nervous novelist . From beyond the gaslight came the shout of " Author , author . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time a crowd in the wing , all with strange grimacing painted faces ... he stood for an instant in the glare of the footlights , looking blindly at the great vaguely-peopled horseshoe and greeted with plaudits which now seemed to him at once louder than he deserved and feebler than he desired . ... At the third bow and round of applause , Compton turned and seized Henry James 's hands and wrung them . With genuine relish the novelist described the scene in a letter to his friend Mrs. Hugh Bell : " ... at the end of all , one ( after a decent and discreet delay ) simpered and gave oneself up to courbettes before the curtain , while the applausive house emitted agreeable sounds from a kind of gas-flaring indistinguishable dimness and the gratified Compton publicly pressed one 's hand and one felt that , really , as far as Southport could testify to the circumstance , the stake was won . Of course it 's only Southport  --  but I have larger hopes . ... " A month later he was writing to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a provincial success is confined to the provinces . " William Archer called on James at the hotel where the novelist was waiting in his rooms to entertain the Comptons and Balestier at a late supper . With a want of tact that was all the more disturbing since he was speaking to a dramatist in whose ears applause was still ringing , Archer told him ( and it was entirely true ) , " I think it 's a play that would be much more likely to have success in the provinces than in London . " He proceeded then and there , taking his critical role with the high seriousness he had always attached to it , to give the author an oral review of the play . After James described the incident to his sister , a few days later , she wrote in her journal : " To H. of course , heated with his triumph these uncalled for amenities ... seemed highly grotesque . ... H. was able to receive it with perfect urbanity and the Comptons etc. coming in to supper before long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delectable dish of roast prig done to a turn . " Supper after the play , with the author as host to his principal actors , was accepted by James as an inflexible tradition of the theatre . His guests on this occasion were limited to the Comptons and Balestier . It was a dinner he wrote later , " half-histrionic and wholly confident . " The battle , the first major engagement , was over and James felt his hero and heroine " were really as radiant as if we were carousing among the slain . They seem indeed wondrous content . " And wondrous content they all were . Balestier was in his characteristically buoyant spirits  --  Balestier who was to die of typhoid in Germany before the year was out  --  and James seems to have been in. an equally exultant mood . Mrs. Compton , who had recently been ill , said she felt " cured right up . " Amid popping corks , and over a gaily bedecked table , the little party was prolonged from 11 o'clock until 1:45 a.m. when the guests retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry James rose early the following morning . The first thing he did was to dispatch a promised wire to his sister : " Unqualified triumphant magnificent success universal congratulations great ovation for author great future for play Comptons radiant and his acting admirable writing Henry . " Alice received the telegram at her South Kensington hotel and promptly cabled it to William James as had been arranged . In far-off Cambridge , William sat down and wrote to his brother : " Dear Old Harry , A telegraph from Alice this a.m. announces ' unqualified triumph  --  great future author  --  ovation . ' I am almost as glad as you are , and hope that it is only the beginning of a sort of Sardou or Dumas career . It will of course inspire you with the nine or 90 other plays which you have in mind . " William in turn sent the cable on to James Russell Lowell who wrote to Henry James on January 11 : " I please myself with fancying how long your piece will run and how much you will get for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his rooms and wrote a long letter to his sister . He described the performance , the calls for the author , the general enthusiasm , the gay supper , Compton 's acting . He promised " a droll anecdote of William Archer 's behaviour and attitude " and reiterated his confidence in the future of the piece . At noon he added the following postscript : " Compton has just come in to tell me that he has already seen a number of people present last night who were unanimous about the success of the piece , the great hit he has made it and ergo  --  the large fortune that opens to it . His own high spirits indeed tell everything . " James and Balestier accompanied the players when they left Southport that afternoon . In the memoir of Balestier that the novelist wrote a year later , he recalled the afternoon as " our sociable amused participation in a collective theatrical fitting , effected in pottering Sunday trains , besprinkled with refreshment room impressions and terminating in all but inaccessible Birmingham , in independent repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham and went on to Cheltenham the following morning to pay a visit . He was back in London Tuesday evening , January 6 , recounting the whole adventure to Alice , and on Wednesday , January 7 , she recorded the " Dear Being 's " account in her journal . " The great family event ... has come off ... it was delightful to hear and see him Harry flushed with the triumph of his first ovation . ... The ' first nights ' to come , we shall be less quivering about . " The World , with William Archer 's account , came out on the morning of Henry James 's return to London . It was a good notice . The critic , in a brief paragraph dated Southport , spoke of finding in James a real " theatrical talent . " He wrote : " As the first theatrical essay of a distinguished man of letters is not , to me , an inconsiderable event I determined ... to be present on the occasion ... and here I am , mightily pleased with my adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alert and telling dialogue and incidents which show a keen eye for stage effect . " The first act he pronounced to be a little masterpiece of exposition . But he withheld any further judgment , until the London production . This was high praise from London 's most advanced critic . The provincial scribes who had more space in which to discuss the play , did not ignore its faults . All felt it required pruning . Some found the literary flavor too pronounced . The critic of the Southport Guardian remarked that James made his British Lord Deepmere like a fire-eating Frenchman , while the French Valentin was too like a cheery Englishman . The Southport Visiter , discussing Compton 's accent , said : " He was quite consistent in the maintenance of the Yankee tone  --  we shall not say twang nor nasal drawl  --  in the purely colloquial portions of the dialogue and though in some of the more lengthened declamatory passages he sometimes relapsed into an Englishman the occurrence was so rare as not to be noteworthy . ... " The Southport Standard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when he shall have learnt to retain it in the more impassioned portions of his dialogue . " The Southport Visiter observed that " the author has taken a recognized place in the ranks of British dramatists , for the judgment of Southport audiences is never reversed . " That , however , remained to be seen . London , September 26,1891 Two weeks after the Southport first night Balestier wrote to Howells : " The most delightful feature of the success of the piece is its effect on James . He is like a runner ready to run a race . He has the air of one just setting out  --  a youngster with an oldster 's grip and mastery : surely the most enviable of situations . " William sensed this change in Henry , writing to him : " It is an extreme delight to see you in your old and sedate age going in for experiences as keen and uproarious as this , and I do most devoutly hope , now that you 've made your plunge , that you 'll keep at it and become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . By this time he had completed two more plays and was filled with plans for the London production of The American . Compton decided to keep the play in his repertory throughout the spring in a tour that took him to Scotland and Ireland as well as over his usual circuit in England , and to open the play in London in the autumn . The Compton Comedy Company usually made one-week stands , changing its bill every night , and The American was given on an average once a week . In all it was probably performed about twenty-five times on the road , including performances in Edinburgh , Belfast and Dublin , where it was well received . James caught the play at its second performance at the Theatre Royal , Wolverhampton , and a few days later in the Memorial Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon , where he was noticed in the audience and came forward to take a bow at the end of the evening . He saw it once more at Leamington , on January 16 , where he was still rehearsing some of the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it  --  and even then they do n't know ! " he wrote to Henrietta Reubell . Compton had taken a long lease on the old Opera Comique Theatre in the Strand where the early Gilbert and Sullivan operas had been performed . He invested a substantial sum in renovation , installing the " latest sanitary arrangements " and adding two new stone staircases . He could not , however , alter the theatre 's basic design which included a long subterranean passage leading to the stalls , described as " discouraging to playgoers . " James had from the first intimated that the play would need better actors for the London production . He began now a systematic search for some key players , in particular for the women 's parts . On January 27 , at a matinee of Ibsen 's Doll 's House with Genevive Ward  --  it was the first Ibsen performance he attended  --  he saw for the first time his compatriot , Elizabeth Robins ; later that spring he saw her again at the Vaudeville where he was greatly taken with her performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lately revealed herself , strikingly , here , as Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler , and has quite leaped into fame . She is slightly uncanny , but distinguished and individual , and she is to do my heroine , a short part , but a very pretty one ... " he wrote to Mrs. John L. Gardner . He took Compton to see her perform , and it was settled that she should replace Mrs. Compton as Madame de Cintr . Miss Robins was " uncanny "  --  young , striking , intense , quick , intelligent . She had been an actress at the Boston Museum with Edwin Booth ; visiting Norway she had fallen under the spell of Ibsen and now , with singular conviction and not a little courage , she was in the vanguard of the Ibsenite forces assaulting the Victorian theatre . That such a woman , bristling with energy , and whose forte was the strong-minded women of Ibsen , should have been cast by James in the passive renunciatory role of Madame de Cintr is a little puzzling . Mrs. Compton 's older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play Madame de Bellegarde and the services of a young and vivacious French actress , Adrienne Dairolles , who had been playing in English in London , were obtained for the role of Nomie Nioche . Louise Moodie , a popular character actress " supposed to be one of the two or three first ' old women ' in London , " got the part of Mrs. Bread . The new scenery was completed by the end of the summer ; the furniture ordered from Paris was arriving and James , who had insisted on supervising the choice of dresses for the women , threw himself again strenuously into rehearsal . Although there is no record that he had a hand in the men 's costumes , we must assign some measure of responsibility to him for the extravagant garb he allowed Newman to wear on the London stage . A. B. Walkley , one of the critics sympathetic to James , said that " why the outer man of Christopher Newman should be clothed in a garment of chocolate faced with sky-blue remains a mystery known only to himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noah-ark coat of yellowish brown , with blue facings and mother of pearl buttons almost as large as cheese plates . " Justin McCarthy called it " an amazing costume of brown velveteen coat and buff overcoat , which recalls rather the garb of a travelling showman than the costume of an American millionaire . " Elizabeth Robins has described James at the rehearsals . His experience in the provinces gave him confidence ; he seemed at his ease among the actors . He Figure : 243KBwas " intensely observant , gravely and happily ' there ' to help us . We felt his approach to matters of the Stage to be fresh and exciting . We were flattered when he took trouble with us , more hopeful of ourselves . " He exchanged gallantries in French with Mile . Dairolles ; he showed concern over the long hours of rehearsal and was disturbed at the irregular meal hours of the actors . Presently he was having his cook and butler bring down hampers of delicacies ; sandwich in hand he would , during waiting periods , quietly steer the actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Robins recalled , " in my tolerably wide experience ever thought of feeding his company . " Alice James was dying . After years of suffering from a nervous illness , a tangible fatal symptom finally had appeared . She had a tumor of the breast . No part of the story of The American is more touching than the simple faith and joy with which Alice , from the four walls of her sick room , let her imagination soar to the footlights , following through Henry James the vicissitudes of his play and then dictating her report of its progress for her intermittently-kept journal . Anecdotes turn up every few pages showing that Henry James was putting forward the most cheerful side of the story for the patient . In his letters to William he later spoke of his two invalids , Alice and the play . For his sister , the episode was " so shot through with the golden threads of comedy that we grew fat with laughter . " But for her nervous and agitated brother , the laughter masked an acute anxiety over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Six days before the opening night in London  --  which was set for September 26 , 1891  --  William James appeared from America , after a sudden crossing of the Atlantic , to see his sister before the end . He was thus able to attend his brother 's first night and to go to the gay supper held in De Vere Gardens at the close of the evening . For the Harvard psychologist-philosopher , basking in the success of his recently published Principles of Psychology , this part of his ten-day London visit was " one of my finest exotic memories . " The first night in the refurbished theatre was a dubious artistic , but a great social , success . Robert Lincoln , the American Minister to London attended in a private box and several of the stage journals alluded to the presence of " millionaires " from the other side of the Atlantic . The Echo reported that " the majority of the ladies conversed in the tongue of the States , while all wore the prettiest frocks . " Decidedly the American colony had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the audience was one of the most cultured ever brought together in so small a space . " It included the painters John Singer Sargent and George Frederick Watts , George du Maurier , editor Frank Harris , novelists W. E. Norris , Mrs. W. K. Clifford , Rhoda Broughton , the playwright Arthur Pinero , the American producer Augustin Daly , the actress Genevive Ward who had hopes then of appearing in James 's next play . George Meredith , seldom seen at a London theatre , came up from Dorking with his daughter . Constance Fenimore Woolson , whose stories of the American South and the Lake country James had admired , and who was then living at Oxford , went to London to attend the premire and we can glance at it through her eyes : I put on my best , and we looked well enough , but were nothing to the others ! Pink satin , blue satin , jewels of all sorts , splendor on all sides of us . The house was packed to the top , and the applause great . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " swells " also . ... When the performance was ended , and the actors had been called out , there arose loud cries " Author , author . " After some delay , Henry James appeared before the curtain and acknowledged the applause . He looked very well  --  quiet and dignified , yet pleasant ; he only stayed a moment . The critics have , since then , written acres about the play . It has been warmly praised ; attacked , abused , highly commended , etc . The critics did write " acres " about the play and to read them today is to get a clear picture of the production ; they were generally unanimous that the play was more melodramatic than the novel had warranted ; they thought the writing obscure at points ; they found Elizabeth Robins 's playing of Claire somewhat hysterical , and they felt Compton 's American to be too much of a caricature . " We are as anxious as the critics of the newest school to hail the advent on our stage of literary men , " the critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on condition that they bring their literature with them . " William Archer found in some passages the " touch of the born playwright " and defended the happy ending as not " a mere concession to cheap popular optimism but human and probable . " He spoke of the " neat and charming dialogue which is grateful to the ear even when it does not ring dramatically true " ( a remark Bernard Shaw was to use on a number of occasions in later years concerning James 's dialogue ) . A. B. Walkley , in The Speaker , marvelled at the quality of scrambled action which James had infused into his play : " What , Mr. James ? " he asked , alluding to The Tragic Muse . " All this ' between dinner and the suburban trains ? ' Allons donc ! as our dear Gabriel Nash would say . " A review in the Star , by " Spectator , " who almost certainly was also Walkley , urged James to write an original comedy , and twitted him for his " stage American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strong accent , a fearful and wonderful coat and a recurrent catch-word . " Arthur Symons , in The Academy , asked , " Is it conceivable that the play satisfied the author of the novel ? " Clement Scott suggested that an American rather than English actor  --  say John Drew  --  should have been cast as Newman . The reviews in the daily journals , from the august Times to the eveningers , were tepid . It was generally agreed that Compton had the accent , but that there was not a great deal else , " except in the first act , " observed one paper , " where there is a great deal of ugly overcoat . " It was inevitable that the trains-Atlantic criticism would be sharper . The New York Times carried a dispatch on the morning after the first night on its front page ; its London correspondent labelled the play " a mass of bold melodrama " and alluded to the portrait of Newman as resembling that of " the advance agent of a circus . " The American accent was characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however to the Atlantic Monthly to give a full evaluation of the play of its distinguished contributor . " American vulgarity , " observed the review , " is always a tolerably welcome spectacle upon the London stage and even Mr. Compton 's American , in some respects an excellent conception , is made quite vulgar enough to atone for many of his virtues . " As for Miss Robins , she imported into the play " the hysterical manners of Ibsen 's morbid heroines . " Henry James began a death-watch on his play . It was early in the season ; much of the stall-buying public was still out of town ; the critics had not been helpful , and the play carried at least four poor actors " too terrible a number for any play to carry . " He said , in a letter to William , " We shall probably fight it through this month and then the fates must decide . Unfortunately their decision appears only too clear . ... " Before the month was over , assistance came from an unexpected quarter  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future Edward VII , decided to see The American . Here was a windfall indeed ! Compton on receiving word hastily telegraphed to James to " dress up " a couple of boxes with " smart people , " which the mondain American had no difficulty in doing . Calling on his sister that day , Henry James ruefully told her , " I 'd do anything for the good Compton , but it will make me charitable to the end of my days . " The Royal visit , however , had the desired effect . It gave the play a " lift . " Booking for seats improved and the advertisements now read : " The American ( An unmistakeable success . ) " " I am ashamed , " wrote Henry to William on October 21 , " to say that the P. of W. on Saturday last , gave it a lift by coming and manifesting an intense absorption . It is humiliating to be so beholden  --  but it is n't all the Prince . " Presently the play had run almost fifty nights , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . James had by that time made a number of revisions , writing a new love scene into the third act between Newman and Claire , bringing Valentin on-stage to die and taming the Bellegardes somewhat . For the fiftieth night the critics were again invited to see the play in what some of them described as its " second edition . " They found this flattering and they announced with pleasure that their strictures had been taken seriously . " The third act , " wrote Walkley , " has been reconstructed , simplified and greatly improved ... and there is less of the hypnotised ' subject ' or somnambulist in Miss Robins 's Claire . But Mr. Edward Compton has not been persuaded to doff his atrocious garment of chocolate and sky-blue and he still sprinkles his gag ' That 's what I want t'see ' over the dialogue . ... " James was cheered ; whatever the outcome , the play had now had an " honorable " run . " Whatever shall happen , I am utterly launched in the drama , resolutely committed to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American has distinctly done me good , " he wrote to his brother . It closed after its seventieth performance , on December 3 , 1871 . " Honor is saved , " wrote Henry James , " but I grieve to say nothing else , for the piece made no money . ... " Ten days later , hastily summoned to Dresden , Henry James stood at the graveside of his young friend , Wolcott Balestier , dead at twenty-eight of typhoid . He had rendered James valuable services and the novelist was deeply attached to him . Gloom settled on him as he recrossed the Channel to London . In her journal Alice wrote : " The young Balestier , the effective and the indispensable , is dead !  --  swept away like a cobweb , of which gossamer substance he seems to have been himself composed ; of simply spirit and energy , with the slightest fleshly wrapping . " Alice James was writing a tribute of the dying to the dead . Three months later , on March 6 , 1892 , Henry James stood beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , and felt her flickering pulse . He described the scene minutely to William : " The pulse ... came and went , ceased and revived a little again . ... Her face then seemed in a strange , dim , touching way to become clearer . I went to the window to let in a little more of the afternoon light upon it ... and when I came back to the bed she had drawn the last breath . ... " After writing this he crossed out the word last and wrote , " the breath that was not succeeded by another . " On March 9 , Alice James was cremated at Golder 's Green . And Henry James wrote to William : " It is the last  --  the last forever . " A NOTE ON THE TEXTS In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication , over a period of two decades , the editor was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of a modern play from the dramatist 's desk , through the production office into the theatre . James was called upon to revise his plays many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays , nor the textual problems arising from collation , warranted such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  that is of truth , fidelity to text and to the writer 's intentions  --  while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would serve : that of demonstrating their role in Henry James 's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for the appearance of at least some of them on the American stage . I therefore directed my editing to this end . It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of the London production , two of them from James 's own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors . It was thus possible to give the mutations of James 's first important effort in the theatre , including a variant fourth act . As regards the other plays , a simple principle was applied . Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts followed by alterations and where these were in James 's hand they were accepted as his final reading ; where there were simply cuts , these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable , the alternate readings have been given . There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons ' typescripts of the play , I decided that it would be of interest to publish the text as actually performed on the stage in 1909 , which James had approved , despite a number of alterations and cuts . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final form it took when it reached the stage . While James went over most of the manuscripts of his plays , making corrections and verbal changes , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's alternately referring to " Valentin " and " Valentine " are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization . In some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech ; these have been spelled out as an aid to readability . Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips 's Bibliography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930 ) , pp. 26-27 , 46-47 and 115-16 . A listing and evaluation of the texts collated for this edition follows : The American : ( 1 ) The Lord Chamberlain licensed The American for production at the Winter Gardens Theatre , Southport , on December 12 , 1890 . The typescript submitted to the Lord Chamberlain 's Office appears to have been Edward Compton 's . It contains many corrections and several inserted pages in James 's hand as well as his indications of action and pronunciation for Edward Compton . ( 2 ) The printed prompt-book for the London production , set up by William Heinemann , but never published . This differs in a number of instances from the Southport typescript . Speeches have been tightened and rendered more colloquial . The stage directions have been retained and elaborated and the exact position and movements of each actor are indicated . In a number of instances speeches in the original text have been made to serve as stage directions in the revised text  --  where James had used words which had , in production , been supplanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the same style as the published plays , with the names of the characters centered over the speeches . It is clear from the care taken in the setting that James intended to have this type used for an edition of the play , had it proved a greater success . The following copies were examined : ( a ) A copy from Henry James 's library , now in the Houghton Library , interleaved with corrections inserted in his hand . This copy contains a number of changes in Act IV , apparently those made for the " second edition " of the play on the fiftieth night of the London run . ( b ) A copy formerly in the James Collection of the late Paul Lemperly of Cleveland , Ohio now in the Colby College Library , Waterville , Maine , with Henry James 's signature on the cover and containing a number of corrections in James 's hand . ( c ) A copy from Henry James 's library now in the Houghton Library , with his autograph on the front cover . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently reminders to himself  --  the word " girl " and under it " Mme. de B 's getup " and under this " Music before 3rd Act . " This copy contains a number of changes similar to those in ( b ) as well as some other emendations. ( d ) Elizabeth Robin 's copy containing a few of her notes on the role of Madame de Cintr . The copy is dated in her hand Sept. 10 , 1891 , clearly the day she received it , since James wrote to her on Sept. 9 , 1891 , " I hope to be able to send you today the printed prompt-book. " ( e ) A copy in the possession of John L. Balderson , who dramatized Berkeley Square from James 's unfinished novel The Sense of the Past . There are no corrections.

( Looks at the picture on the easel , while she daubs at it . ) Everything is crooked  --  more 's the pity ! ( Calling again . ) Come in , Count , come in ! ( Enter , from back , VALENTIN DE BELLEGARDE . ) I 've dusted a chair for you to sit on , and I 've put out the little Greuze . VALENTIN . ( On right of NOMIE before the picture . ) I shall miss this very much when I go to the Muse . NOMIE . The original will always be there . VALENTIN . I know your copy better  --  it 's the more original of the two . NOMIE . You 're laughing at me , but I do n't care , for I have found someone to take my work seriously . ( VALENTIN shrugs shoulders , laughs , goes down to fireplace and puts hat on chest of drawers at left . ) I brought it home yesterday to give it the finishing touches , and when you rang at the door I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning and approve . VALENTIN . You must have been disappointed ! But I approve ! I always approve , you know . NOMIE . It 's more than I do , when you come at the wrong time . VALENTIN . There 's no wrong time for seeing you . And you would understand my coming if you knew the good people I live with at home , my cosy family circle , as sociable as a pyramid and as cheerful as your tailor 's bill ! ( Yawning . ) Ah , they make me like Bohemia ! ( Comes down , right centre , above easel . ) NOMIE . ( Who has crossed to left centre . ) Bohemia ? I 'm much obliged to you ! ( Curtsies . ) VALENTIN . It 's a charming country , and when I 'm with you I feel as if I were in the capital ! Who is this happy explorer of the delightful region whom you are expecting alone ? ( Sits on table . ) NOMIE . He 's very different from you  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ! NOMIE . ( Coming to him severely . ) I 'm not to see him alone  --  papa is to be here . He 's a pupil of papa 's . ( Leans on back of chair to talk to VALENTIN . ) VALENTIN . Ah , no wonder he 's innocent ! NOMIE . You need n't stay  --  you 'll be of no particular use . VALENTIN . My right 's as good as his  --  I 'm a pupil of yours . ( He kisses her hand ; she pretends to be offended . ) What does your father teach him ? NOMIE . He gives him lessons in French ; he 's an ambitious , inquiring American . VALENTIN . Had n't he better give him lessons in English ? NOMIE . I like the way he speaks  --  it 's so distinct . VALENTIN . Distinct , but not distinguished . I shall certainly stay to see him . NOMIE . You may see him any time at the Grand Hotel . He sits smoking in the court . VALENTIN . Is that where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to such places ? Do n't you know how Papa 's employed there , as commissioner and interpreter ? VALENTIN . Oh yes ; he interprets his daughter ! NOMIE . As a copyist of the old masters , yes ; he brought Mr. Newman to see me at the Louvre . Mr. Newman wants to see more of my copies ; he wants to buy some , and that 's why he is coming this morning . ( Returns to easel , and resumes work . ) VALENTIN . Your father has taught him very well . ( Rises and comes to centre . ) NOMIE . Ah , but he wo n't speak French  --  though he engaged papa on purpose to practice . Papa 's English is so good . VALENTIN . It is n't so good as yours . You have n't a trace of an accent . NOMIE . We were in London , you know , for years , when I was a child . VALENTIN . Yes , I have never been able to make out what you did there . NOMIE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the interpreter for French tourists . ( A timid tinkle at the outer bell . ) There 's Papa . You had better go . ( Indicating door on right . ) VALENTIN . Oh , I 'm a French tourist . I 'm all in your father 's line . ( Goes , in front , to fireplace . ) NOMIE . Well , he does n't mind you , and a Count , in the house , looks well ! Americans like them . ( Exit NOMIE centre . ) VALENTIN . Poor Mr. Newman  --  I 'm glad he 's going to like me ; I take already such a charitable interest in his fate ! ( Re-enter , centre , NOMIE , and enter NIOCHE , who carries a small basket and a parcel done up in a cotton pocket-handkerchief , both of which his daughter takes from him , going with them to table on right . NIOCHE is a little old man , dressed with studied , though slightly seedy , gentility , in black . He has a wig , gloves and spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hat is on at first . ) NIOCHE . ( Centre . ) Bonjour , M. le Comte . I salute you very low . VALENTIN . M. Nioche is always saluting low . You 'd salute the executioner if he were going to break you on the wheel . NOMIE . ( Looking into the basket while NIOCHE polishes his hat with his handkerchief . ) Well , you wo n't be tortured for stealing , at any rate . Three unhappy little cutlets ! If the Count stays there wo n't even be one apiece . VALENTIN . The Count will certainly stay . NIOCHE . ( Putting on his hat again . ) Then I 'll go and get another cutlet . ( Goes to door , right . ) NOMIE . It does n't matter ( picking up basket and contents and going up centre ) we 've got half a cold pie . Mr. Newman knows the difficulties of our life . VALENTIN . Assuredly , since he comes to relieve them . ( The bell rings again , pretty loud and sharp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coming ! ( Exit , centre , with the basket and parcel . ) NIOCHE . He is a philanthropist , M. le Comte . ( Fumbles out snuffbox . ) VALENTIN . And what am I then ? NIOCHE . ( Taking snuff . ) You 're the purest relic of our old noblesse . VALENTIN . Rather an object for philanthropy ! ( Re-enter NOMIE , centre ; enter , behind her , CHRISTOPHER NEWMAN , with hat and stick . ) NOMIE . This way , Mr. Newman ! ( Pointing to the picture on the easel . ) There 's the little thing you toot such a fancy to . NEWMAN . ( Looking at picture . ) That 's just what I want Footnote : 1Kb to see ! ( Stands before picture . ) NOMIE . I think I 've improved it . NEWMAN . Well , yes , I suppose you 've improved it ; but I do n't know but I liked it better before it was quite so good ! However , I guess I 'll take it . ( Goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) There are plenty more in the other room . ( Pointing centre . ) The light 's better there . NIOCHE . ( Obsequiously , to NEWMAN , dusting and giving him chair , right centre . ) I feel it a great honour to receive my munificent patron in my humble home . NEWMAN . ( Seating himself . ) Oh , I was very glad to come round . When I come to a new country I like to see the private life . NOMIE . Oh , sir , we have n't always had it so rough as this ! NEWMAN . Do you call this rough ? I 've seen it rougher , in my time . I 've lived on the beaten earth , between the bare logs . NOMIE . Ah , but you 're making that up  --  at the Grand Hotel ! NEWMAN . My dear young lady , ten years ago , when I was your age , my hotel was grander still  --  it was sometimes the vault of heaven  --  the starry night ! NIOCHE . But did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other ? NEWMAN . Lose a fortune ? Why , I 've lost about a hundred ! ( Rises . ) NOMIE . Ah , but how many have you made ? ( Going up , centre . ) You must come and look at my copies before you lose another . NEWMAN . Oh , I guess I 'm safe now ! ( Exit , centre ; exit NOMIE , centre , preceding . ) VALENTIN . ( To NIOCHE . ) I like your American , and his ideas of private life ! ( Comes down , centre . ) NIOCHE . We 're more than private , sir  --  we 're obscure ! But he 's a grand man . VALENTIN . Do you mean a Grand Hotel man ? NIOCHE . You remember the capacity in which I 'm attached to that establishment ? He had just arrived in Paris and he wanted me to point him out the most remarkable objects . VALENTIN . ( Pointing with his thumb to back . ) So you 're pointing out your daughter ! NIOCHE . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him first , M. le Comte ; I was thoroughly conscientious . VALENTIN . Certainly ; you knew he would find your daughter there . NIOCHE . We came upon her , in fact , copying a beautiful picture with her usual devotion . VALENTIN . Yes , I know ; that 's the way I came upon her  --  last year ! NIOCHE . I remember the visit with which you honoured us here in consequence . You gained our confidence  --  you enjoy it still . VALENTIN . I enjoy it very much , M. Nioche ; it 's my principal enjoyment . NIOCHE . I esteem you for not having abused it . VALENTIN . That certainly , in Paris , makes me one of the remarkable objects you just spoke of . ( Goes down , left . Re-enter NOMIE and NEWMAN , the latter without hat and stick . ) You should point me out to Mr. Newman . NEWMAN . ( Left centre , to NIOCHE . ) Well , sir , they seem to me first-rate , and you may put me down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes note . ) NOMIE . ( Right , aside to NIOCHE . ) Three thousand francs ! NIOCHE . ( Right centre , aside . ) My precious child ! ( Aloud to NEWMAN . ) Allow me , sir , to introduce you to our noble friend , the Count Valentin de Bellegarde . ( Goes up to centre . ) NEWMAN . ( Shaking hands . ) Happy to make your acquaintance , Count Valentine . VALENTIN . ( Left . ) I 'm afraid you 've lost another fortune . NEWMAN . Perhaps you can help me to get it back ! ( They go together to fireplace . ) NOMIE . Oh yes , he 'll help you , if it 's to play me a trick ! But while you talk that over , Papa and I 'll look after lunch . NIOCHE . I 'll put on the cutlets . ( Exit centre . ) NOMIE . ( Raising the lid of ottoman and taking out knifeboard and knives , VALENTIN assisting in the whole movement . ) We must help ourselves ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't I help you ? NOMIE . ( Graciously . ) You have already . But M. de Bellegarde has done nothing , so he can clean these knives . ( Exit centre . ) VALENTIN . ( At chair right of table , right , cleaning a knife . ) Used you to do this when your life was so rough under the vault of heaven ? NEWMAN . ( Half seated on back of chair , left . ) I guess we did n't polish them ! And they were sometimes of another kind . VALENTIN . Bowie-knives  --  a foot long ? Oh , I should like to hear your adventures . NEWMAN . This is my principal adventure , sir  --  visiting your beautiful city . VALENTIN . I 'm glad you like our city , and I hope your adventure will turn out well . If I can help that , it will give me great pleasure . NEWMAN . You 're very kind ! It would be rather a comfort to have a pleasant , bright companion to show me around . Someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have made a good beginning . NEWMAN . Well , I 've begun the study of French ! I asked for a teacher at the hotel , and they trotted out the old gentleman there . He came in as quick as if he had been behind the door . VALENTIN . It 's where he was , I suppose ! NEWMAN . Well , he seems a regular patriarch  --  one of the old school . VALENTIN . Oh , the old school  --  I could show you the old school ! NEWMAN . That 's just what I want Footnote : 1Kb to see ! ( Comes centre ; foot on seat of chair left of table . ) I want to see something that will strike me with awe . Only , it 's a pity  --  if I want to learn the language  --  that you seem all to speak such fine old English . VALENTIN . I would n't , if I could help it ; but I ca n't . My dear mother is English ; she has always , from our infancy , addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had had a dear mother  --  from my infancy  --  to address me in a tongue  --  VALENTIN . You would have learnt it , you may be sure , if she had been anything like mine ! NEWMAN . ( Seated on chair , left , his head on the hand of which the arm is on back of chair . ) Well , I 'm afraid I 'm rather ignorant  --  I have n't a relation in the world . VALENTIN . One certainly learns many things from one 's relations . NEWMAN . I have n't worked round to the English yet . I 'll see them later . VALENTIN . Oh , the English 'll keep  --  they wo n't run away . NEWMAN . I do n't know as they 'll keep me . I sailed straight for a French port  --  I wanted to see Paris worst of all . VALENTIN . That shows you 're a good American . NEWMAN . Because the proverb says they come here when they die ? Oh , I ai n't dead yet ; at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see ! I want to have a regular good time . I 've been whistling " Yankee-Doodle " all my life , and now I should like to try another tune . ( Rising . ) I want a little change . ( Goes over to table , right . ) As you were so good as to say just now that you 're ready to help me , do you know how you can do it ? Help me to a little change ! ( Sits left of table , right . ) VALENTIN . ( Finishing his knives . ) I 'm afraid I have n't got change for several millions ; but I will do what I can for you . Will you have a cigarette ? ( Offers case . ) NEWMAN . Do you think we can smoke here ? VALENTIN . I always do . ( Lights up . ) NEWMAN . Wo n't the young ladyFootnote : 1Kb object ? ( Takes cigarette and gets light from VALENTIN . ) VALENTIN . My dear fellow , she smokes herself ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) NOMIE . ( To VALENTIN . ) You are lazy ! Is that the way you clean my knives ? ( Taking the knives up , between the two men . ) VALENTIN . They 're as bright as your eyes and as sharp as your tongue ! NEWMAN . This gentleman assures me we may smoke ; may I , therefore , offer you a cigarette  --  one of mine ? NOMIE . ( Smiling and taking the cigarette , which NEWMAN lights for her . ) Anything of yours ! ( Action with cigarette . ) The cutlets are almost done . ( Exit , centre , with knifeboard . ) VALENTIN . I might be jealous of you  --  if I did n't want to like you . I daresay you 've got a bowie-knife somewhere ? NEWMAN . Yes , somewhere in a cupboard , in California . If you want to like me I 'll show you how , as far as I know . But I do n't see what you haveFootnote : 1Kb to envy me  --  judging from the familiarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarity  --  say contempt ! I 'm the cold dish on the sideboard ; who wants it when there 's a charming entree ? NEWMAN . What do you mean by that foreign expression ? VALENTIN . I mean you  --  for instance ! NEWMAN . Oh , I sha n't show her how to like me ! VALENTIN . Are n't you paying a good deal for pure aversion ? NEWMAN . A good deal ? Why , I thought the whole thing so cheap ! ( Re-enter NOMIE , and goes to the chest , left , where she pulls out a drawer . ) NOMIE . There 's a clean napkin somewhere for Mr. Newman . VALENTIN . Ah , if she throws in a clean napkin ! NOMIE . The cutlets are almost done  --  papa is opening the wine . ( Exit , centre , with the napkin . ) VALENTIN . A fresh bottle ! My dear fellow , she is throwing you the handkerchief . NEWMAN . You mean the napkin ! Oh , that 's no use ! ( Snaps fingers , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VALENTIN . I do n't see how you escape ! NEWMAN . Oh , the dangers are too small . I want a big one . I 've got a sort of preconceived theory of the finest woman on earth . VALENTIN . And to realise that theory you have left your own country , where I 'm told the women are so charming ? NEWMAN . So they are , but they 've all come over here . I want Footnote : 1Kb a first-class woman , and I do n't care what she is , so long as she 's only perfect : beautiful , amiable , clever , good , the product of a longFootnote : 1Kb civilization and a great cultivation ! I shall expect her to have everything the world can give  --  except a fortune . I do n't care a fig for that  --  I 've enough for two . ( Rises and goes above chair . Left hand out . ) VALENTIN . ( Looking at NEWMAN from head to foot with a smile of mingled impudence and urbanity . ) My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've enough for a dozen  --  I mean enough confidence . And also if I ask you what are your titles to the hand of so exalted a being ? NEWMAN . My titles ? Oh , I 'll show them to her ! Meanwhile , I stick to my idea that she must be the rarest flower that grows . I 've had a hard life , I 've had a rough life , I 've had rather an ugly life , and I 've had , if I may say so , as regards the inner comfort of the thing , a very lonely life . I 've come out all right , but it was n't all roses and cakes . In that roaring big country of mine everything is big , even to the difficulties and disappointments , the temptations and defeats . But I have come out , thank God , Footnote : 1Kb without leaving behind too much of my youth , or too many of my illusions . I 've had a longFootnote : 1Kb working-day , and ( stretching himself ) now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) VALENTIN . Might I venture to intimate sympathetically that you yourself are a big treat ? NEWMAN . ( At easel . ) What else have I toiled and struggled for all these years ? I 've succeeded , and now what am I to do with my success ? To make it a big one , some woman I shall love and admire must be perched on the pile like a statue of marble on a pedestal of gold . VALENTIN . A very becoming position for the woman you love and admire ! ( Rises and comes to NEWMAN . ) May I ask if you have yet come across the lady who would serve for your statue ? NEWMAN . No , hang it  --  have you ? VALENTIN . ( Putting his hand , with cigarette in it , on NEWMAN 'S sleeve , as if to speak ; then withdrawing it and smoking with hands in his pockets . ) I 'll tell you when I know you better ! NEWMAN . Well , I mean to look round . VALENTIN . Why should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid the lady 'll like you best ! VALENTIN . She 'll like me for liking you . NEWMAN . Then you know one of the kind I mean ? ( Takes out note-book . ) VALENTIN . Oh , thank heaven , I know some charming women . NEWMAN . ( With his memoranda . ) Will you just give me their addresses ? VALENTIN . ( Laughing . ) I 'll take you to see them ! ( Goes to right while NEWMAN goes to chair , left , and sits astride . ) Here comes M. Nioche to announce the feast . ( Re-enter NIOCHE , with a bottle and a corkscrew . ) NIOCHE . In a moment , M. le Comte ! My daughter begs you will do her the honour to go and make her an omelette . Footnote : 1Kb VALENTIN . Certainly , if I may break enough eggs ! ( Exit VALENTIN , centre , going round up . ) NIOCHE . ( Struggling unsuccessfully with the cork of his bottle . ) It 's a great pleasure to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociability with our distinguished visitor . NEWMAN . Is he very distinguished ? NIOCHE . One of the purest relics of our old noblesse  --  brought up in all the traditions . NEWMAN . The traditions ? That 's just what I want to see ! But your daughter seems to treat him as the family cook . NIOCHE . He 's the only one we have , sir . The traditions of cookery have always been cherished by the French aristocracy . His family is illustrious and historical . NEWMAN . That 's just what I want to see ! See here  --  askFootnote : 1Kb him to show me his family . Footnote : 1Kb NIOCHE . I should think he would do it sir . ( Aside . ) That will go down in my bill : " Introduction to the Faubourg Saint-Germain , five thousand francs . " ( Struggling still with his cork . ) NEWMAN . I 'm afraid it sticks . ( He throws away cigarette into fireplace . ) Let me have a try . NIOCHE . It 's not work for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd seen some of the work my honoured hands have done ! Does our friend there live in Paris ? NIOCHE . In the Faubourg Saint-Germain , in the grand old family mansion . It dates from hundreds of years back . NEWMAN . Hundreds of years ? That 's just what I want to see ! Been there yourself ? NIOCHE . Respected sir , I 've been everywhere , and I know everything ! NEWMAN . I see ( sits on table , right ) ; that 's why they have you at the Grand Hotel . NIOCHE . My profession is to answer questions , and it 's to my honour that none has ever been asked me to which I have n't instantly produced a reply . For instance I can go straight through the great house of Bellegarde . ( Puts bottle down by fire . ) NEWMAN . The great house of Bellegarde ? NIOCHE . The relations of my noble guest . It 's true there are very few left today  --  that makes it easy . Only his mother , his elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who has been looking at a book on table , right , here turns quickly , leg up on chair . ) Has he got a beautiful sister ? NIOCHE . As beautiful as an old picture  --  some delicate pastel  --  and a saint into the bargain . NEWMAN . That 's just what I want to see ! ( Quickly taking out again his memorandum-book . ) Her name , please ? NIOCHE . ( Importantly . ) Madame la Comtesse Claire de Cintr . NEWMAN . Damn it then  --  she 's married ? NIOCHE . She was , sir ; but that 's all over . She 's now an elegant young widow . NEWMAN . ( Jotting down . ) That 's just what I want to see ! ( He sits in chair , right , and , with his legs stretched well out , takes notes as NIOCHE speaks . ) NIOCHE . Her mother arranged for her , in her tender youth and terribly against her inclination , a marriage that was expected to be brilliant , but that turned out like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell . Fortunately , after three or four years , the Comte de Cintr died  --  died of his disorders and vices . ( Lowering his voice and giving half a dozen backward nods of the head . ) I believe they were something awful , sir . NEWMAN . Lord , how mean ! How could she do it ? NIOCHE . She did n't do it , sir  --  her mother did it . NEWMAN . And her father  --  had he nothing to say ? NIOCHE . I believe he had a great deal to say , but the old lady shut him up . NEWMAN . Shut him up  --  in a lunatic asylum ? NIOCHE . No , no ; in his own private room  --  in his own curtained bed . The poor gentleman turned sick and died there , just when he wanted most to be afoot  --  and his high and mighty wife could do what she liked . Footnote : 1Kb NEWMAN . She must have curious likings . Was there no one to step right in ? NIOCHE . Two sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving the younger , our accomplished guest ; he was only a boy of twenty , and he was got out of the way  --  he was sent to England for a year . The present Marquis ( the eldest son ) is simply second fiddle to his mamma . NEWMAN . Well , between them they seem to play pretty airs ! ( Putting away notebook . ) I 've seen rough things in my country , but I have n't met that style . NIOCHE . Oh , they 're very remarkable  --  in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ! NEWMAN . ( Rising . ) See here  --  I want to go there ! NIOCHE . ( Shrugging his shoulders and pressing his finger-tips together . ) It 's very difficult to get the entre . ( Takes up bottle . ) NEWMAN . Yes ; but with our friend who 's making the omelette  --  NIOCHE . Oh , sir , if you 're agreeable to him ! ( Looking at his watch . ) He takes an extraordinary time to make it . NEWMAN . I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIOCHE . ( After another vain tussle with his cork . ) I 'm ashamed , sir ; but we 're so dilapidated that my corkscrew does n't act . We have an accommodating neighbor  --  I 'll borrow a better one . ( Going to door , right . ) NEWMAN . Just tell me first if she 's all right now . NIOCHE . ( Staring . ) Our accommodating neighbor ? I 'm afraid she 's behind with her rent . NEWMAN . No , no ; I mean the widowed young Countess  --  in the grand old house . NIOCHE . Oh , she just lives on there  --  in great seclusion . She has never married again . NEWMAN . Do you suppose she would ? NIOCHE . ( Staring a moment , then aside . ) Ciel !  --  what could we get for that ? ( Aloud . ) I 'm afraid that 's a question you must put to the lady herself . NEWMAN . Then I 've invented the first you ca n't answer . NIOCHE . At the Grand Hotel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done with the Grand Hotel ! I shall take a house . ( Goes down to chair , left , and sits . ) NIOCHE . ( Eagerly . ) I shall be very glad to help you find one . NEWMAN . Please look out , then , for a fine big , bright one , a regular old palace . Try in the Faubourg Saint-Germain . Footnote : 1Kb NIOCHE . As near it as possible . ( Aside . ) Mercy on us , there is a chance ! ( Aloud , glancing at the other room , of which the doors are closed . ) Footnote : 1Kb I ca n't fancy what they 're doing there  --  an omelette 's so quick ! NEWMAN . Ai n't it rather slow when there are two ? ( Rising and crossing to window and looking out ; then in another tone . ) What do you suppose made her go back ? NIOCHE . My little daughter , sir ? NEWMAN . No , no  --  the young Countess . Why did she return to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those are the traditions , sir . She could n't live alone , and when they ca n't live alone they have to live with each other  --  there 's no one else grand enough . NEWMAN . ( Aside . ) I wonder if I should be grand enough ! ( Aloud . ) Why could n't she live alone ? NIOCHE . I fear there was very little money , sir : there is n't much , in some of those stately homes . NEWMAN . Wo n't that make it easier for you to scare me up one ? NIOCHE . ( Considering a moment . ) It will make them put on their price , sir ! NEWMAN . Oh , give them their price . ( Crosses to fireplace , below table . ) Was n't he at least rich , then  --  the old scallawag ? NIOCHE . The Comtesse 's husband ? Ah , that was Madame de Bellegarde 's fond calculation . But he had run through everything  --  he left nothing but debts . That 's how she was punished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should like to punish her a little more ! ( Re-enter VALENTIN , centre . ) VALENTIN . The omelette has fallen on its feet , and Monsieur Nioche is served ! NIOCHE . Served by a son of the crusaders ! I 'll be with you in a moment . ( Exit with his bottle , right . ) NEWMAN . ( As he goes . ) Do n't forget the house ! VALENTIN . Are you going to take a house ? NEWMAN . With the help of that good old man . Footnote : 1Kb VALENTIN . That 's capital news if it means that you 're to stay with us . NEWMAN . I 'll stay as longFootnote : 1Kb as you make it attractive . VALENTIN . I 'll make it as attractive as I can . ( Sits on the table , back to audience . ) To me , here , you know , it 's all rather stuffy  --  and you 're so ventilating ! NEWMAN . ( Looking at him a moment and laying a hand on his shoulder . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  to give and take ? If I 've got something you want , perhaps you 've got something I want . VALENTIN . The bargain would be very unequal  --  I 've got so very little ! But perhaps I can help you to find a house  --  or help your deputy there . NEWMAN . Oh , do n't go round with him  --  go round with me ! You must come and see me . ( Puts out his hand . ) VALENTIN . ( Taking NEWMAN 'S hand . ) Delighted , and you must return my visit . ( Shakes NEWMAN 'S hand and looks out of window . ) NEWMAN . ( Aside , going to left and round to back . ) Good  --  perhaps I shall see the old pastel . That treatment sticks in my crop ! ( Aloud . ) Oh yes , you must show me Paris . VALENTIN . ( At the window . ) If I do , I shall show you some queer things . NEWMAN . ( Going to the easel . ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VALENTIN . The best are the queerest ! ( As NEWMAN stands before NOMIE 'S picture . ) Well , what do you think of that ? NEWMAN . I was thinking of something else . But is n't this a little queer ? VALENTIN . ( Going left and laughing . ) Decidedly , though it 's not the best ! ( Re-enter NOMIE , briskly , centre . ) Mr. Newman ca n't take his eyes off that gem . NOMIE . You may well say gem , since he has given it a golden setting ! Everything is ready  --  please go in . I only want to put on a ribbon , in honour of my munificent patron . ( Exit , left . VALENTIN comes centre , right of NEWMAN , above easel . ) NEWMAN . I 'm much obliged to her , but I was n't thinking either of her gem or of its setting . I was thinking of something the old man has just told me . ( Going to VALENTIN . ) VALENTIN . Oh , I know he deals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VALENTIN . Ah , that is a wonder ! But you must see it for yourself . NEWMAN . He says you keep it boarded up . VALENTIN . That 's just the reason for you to come in  --  it wants ventilation ! NEWMAN . Oh , I 'll create a draught ! ( Takes VALENTIN 'S arm and they go up . Exeunt , centre , VALENTIN and NEWMAN . While they are turning away , re-enter NOMIE , left , with a ribbon in her hand , and quickly closes the central doors be-behind them as soon as they have gone out . ) NOMIE . ( Putting on her ribbon , using powder-puff and arranging her dress before the glass over mantel . ) I 'm dreadfully nervous lest the Peer of the Realm should come back before the coast is clear ; and yet I do n't want to lose him  --  he 's too good for that ! He 's better than the American , if the American is going to be whirled away by the Frenchman . Papa considers he 's so clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make him a charge for it . It would have been cleverer to keep him for ourselves  --  we could make him a charge for that too . Well , whatever happens , we 'll make him a charge ! ( Pulls down back of her dress . ) I do n't know what he thought of me , shut up so long there with a young man distinguished for gallantry ! The Count chattered and chattered ; but I made him chatter to some profit , since I drew him , cunningly , on the subject of Lord Deepmere , who wants  --  the double-faced wretch !  --  to make up to the Count 's grand sister . The Count , however , does n't favour him as a brother-in-law . Well , it serves him right ! I did n't let on to the Count that I know him and that I do favour him a little ; that 's just what I want to keep dark . It wo n't be easy , either , if he comes flaming in . ( Re-enter LORD DEEPMERE , slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Here he is  --  flaming enough ! DEEPMERE . Charming creature , is n't my time up ? NOMIE . Do you call this an hour ? How did you get in ? DEEPMERE . The door on the landing is gaping open . NOMIE . ( Aside . ) Idiotic papa  --  foraging for his cockscrew ! ( Aloud . ) Then it 's just right for you to pass out again . DEEPMERE . ( Coming in . ) Not till you confess that you tricked me just now , turning me out for fear of your stern parent . I heard the voice , I was sure I knew it , and it has come back to me who the person is . He 's neither a parent nor stern . NOMIE . ( Coming centre . ) I do n't know what you 're talking about , and I 've no more time to give you . DEEPMERE . That only clinches my conviction that Count Valentin is on the premises . NOMIE . Count Valentin ? How do you know that I know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Struck . ) Then you know he knows me ? He has told you that ! ( Goes up to central doors . ) NOMIE . ( Aside . ) Crac !

( Listening to sounds from back . ) Do you still pretend that 's your father 's voice ? ( Goes toward the doors  --  movement from NOMIE , barring the way . ) NOMIE . You 'll please to keep away from there  --  your suspicions are insulting . My father has a pupil  --  taking a lesson . DEEPMERE . A lesson in sword-practice ? Count Valentin may need it ! NOMIE . ( As if struck with this . ) Why on earth do you dislike him so ? DEEPMERE . Why on earth does he dislike me ? NOMIE . It 's absurd  --  he does n't . DEEPMERE . Does he say so ? Then you have seen him ! Open the doors yourself , and prove to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your preposterous pupil  --  produce him ! NOMIE . ( Embarrassed and impatient , going back , left , to her glass . ) I ca n't be bothered with you any longer . Good-bye ! DEEPMERE . ( Rather mock-sentimental . ) You choose to lose me then forever ? Do n't think that if I go now I shall ever come back ! ( Goes to chair , right . ) NOMIE . ( Aside . ) Perhaps he wo n't ! It 's a bore , because I like to keep my interests separate . ( Aloud , coming to centre . ) I do n't care whether you come back or not ; but I wo n't be falsely accused and I will produce the pupil . ( Goes back , opens partly one of the leaves of the door and looks in . ) Mr. Newman , will you be so good as to speak to me a moment ? ( To DEEPMERE . ) Now you 'll see your folly . ( Re-enter NEWMAN , from back , NOMIE closing the door behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you do me a great favour ? Will you let this gentleman look at you ? NEWMAN . If it gives him any comfort . ( The two men stand , centre , face to face a moment . ) I hope he 'll know me again . DEEPMERE . I shall certainly know you again . I 'm much obliged to you ( and to NOMIE ) and to you . Good day ! ( As if confessing his error , he goes quickly to the door on the right ; but before leaving the room he stops and exchanges another look with NEWMAN . Exit LORD DEEPMERE , right . Action from NOMIE . ) NEWMAN . ( As the Curtain falls . ) I was n't what he wanted to see ! ACT SECOND One of the smaller salons at the Htel de Bellegarde , arranged and lighted for a reception .

And please bring another lamp for that table ( indicating table , left ) it always seems to me there never can be light enough in this dark house . SERVANT . I 'm sure it 's blazing to-night  --  with twenty people at dinner and five hundred more expected ! ( Exit , to come back presently and place a lamp on the table , left , indicated by MRS . BREAD , who is going off left , when enter VALENTIN , right . ) VALENTIN . Wait a moment , my dear old friend  --  you 're the very person I want . I never have a moment 's talk with you now .

( Looking at him affectionately . ) When did I ever snub the creature in the world I love best and have known the longest ? VALENTIN . Since the hour I was born , stern superintendant of my childhood ! MRS . BREAD . And since the hour your sweet sister was born  --  Heaven help her , poor lady ! VALENTIN . Heaven is helping her , by one of it 's messengers ; it looks very much like it . MRS . BREAD . Do you mean that your showy American friend is a messenger from Heaven ? VALENTIN . I mean , my dear Catty , that the more I 've seen of Mr. Christopher Newman , the more I 've liked him , and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brings her down stage . ) MRS . BREAD .

BREAD . Let him try  --  let him try . She does n't turn her back . VALENTIN . ( Walking about while MRS . BREAD arranges tables . ) She would be perverse if she did , for from the hour I brought him here , five weeks ago , he seemed to fling open the windows of this temple of staleness and stagnation  --  he laid the irrepressible ghost . MRS . BREAD . ( Looking round . ) Hush !  --  do n't talk of the ghost ! VALENTIN . There 's nobody to hear .

And trying to guess what your mother means this unparalleled entertainment for . VALENTIN . What can she mean it for but as a sign to Mr. Newman that , like a good American , he may go ahead ? She has beaten the drum for our friends and our enemies , as if to say to him : " There they are ! Ai n't they grand ? You may enter the magic circle ! " MRS . BREAD . But what does she say to them ? VALENTIN . Only three words : " He has ever so many millions ! " MRS . BREAD . And what does she say to Lord Deepmere ? VALENTIN . There has been no need to say anything  --  he has gone back to England . MRS . BREAD . But wo n't he turn up again ? VALENTIN . A day after the fair . MRS . BREAD . He wo n't like being too late , for I 've an idea he has received a bit of encouragement . VALENTIN . From the heads of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully civil , and if they 've hung back a little , it 's only because the figure of his income , though high , is n't quite up to their standard . Everything 's low compared to that ! MRS . BREAD . ( Rising . ) So that if they throw him over now  --  ? VALENTIN . He 'll have a perfect right not to enjoy it ! MRS . BREAD . Oh , if my lady and the Marquis have given him their word  --  VALENTIN . Trust them to take it back ! MRS . BREAD . Gracious , I 'm glad he 's gone  --  and I ought n't to give you a chance to utter such horrors ! ( Exit MRS . BREAD , left . ) VALENTIN . ( Looking after her . ) Poor old Catty , you have helped us before ( enter CHRISTOPHER NEWMAN ) , you shall help us again . NEWMAN .

To appreciate that tribute , I must know whom you are looking for . NEWMAN . ( With his back to fireplace . ) For whom but Madame de Cintr ? I want particularly to speak to her . I could scarcely break away from some of your folks . VALENTIN . ( Seated on the ottoman . ) My dear fellow , you 're a great success ; but you do n't know  --  you can never know  --  what a new departure , for us , this is to-night ! NEWMAN . Oh , I guess I 've guessed ! VALENTIN . You 're in a situation in which your national faculty will find plenty of application . But do n't shout till you 're out of the wood . NEWMAN . Why ai n't I out of it , if Madame de Cintr thinks me a gentle savage , as you 've told me she does ? VALENTIN . What I 've told you is that you 've given a good turn to her life . NEWMAN .

I want to speak to Claire myself , and I 'll bring her this way . NEWMAN . Oh , Count , if you want to speak to her , speak to her of me ! Footnote : 1Kb VALENTIN . I never do anything else ! ( Exit VALENTIN , right , and at the same moment enter , by the other door , left , LORD DEEPMERE . ) NEWMAN . ( Aside . ) Hallo ! Is he one of the guests ? DEEPMERE .

I certainly shall not shirk any of the consequences of my rashness . ( Leaning on chair , right of table . ) I should have been sooner in a position to learn what they may be , if I had not been called over to England for a couple of months . I came back only a few hours ago . NEWMAN . Let me congratulate you on returning to so pleasant a place  --  and on having lost so little time in finding out the pleasantest corner in it . DEEPMERE . My dear sir , I found out the Htel de Bellegarde long before I found out  --  some other things ! NEWMAN .

( To NEWMAN . ) Do you know the little blue room ? My sister 's there , and I daresay she 'll be free to see you . NEWMAN . ( Jumping up . ) I 'll free her , if she ai n't ! ( Exit NEWMAN , right centre . ) DEEPMERE . ( To VALENTIN . ) Madame de Cintr is just the person I was hoping to come across . VALENTIN . ( Stopping him . ) Please do n't go to her now  --  I 'm sure she 's engaged . DEEPMERE . ( Aside . ) Engaged  --  with that customer ? ( Aloud . ) I 've seen your mother and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on such a brilliant fte . I hope I 'm not indiscreet if I inquire if there 's any extraordinary reason  --  VALENTIN . For our lighting so many candles ? Yes , at last we have something to show . ( Goes to fireplace and stands with his back to DEEPMERE , who is at the ottoman , kneeling on it . ) DEEPMERE . Do you mean a very surprising guest ? VALENTIN . Mr. Newman is surprising  --  to us scions of effete aristocracies ! DEEPMERE . I congratulate you on his want of resemblance to other gentlemen , when he 's locked up with young ladies you 're interested in ! VALENTIN . ( Turning round . ) Locked up  --  with young ladies ? ( Staring . ) Bless my soul , was it you that day , when we were at breakfast with a charming person who suddenly called him out ? DEEPMERE . ( Staring in turn . ) Were you at breakfast too ? ( Rises and goes left centre . ) Then I was humbugged ! VALENTIN . ( Moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ? DEEPMERE . I thought you were alone with her !

I believed you were the pupil ; and indeed , among you , you seem to form a promising little class ! VALENTIN . I do n't recognise your warrant for interrupting our lesson . DEEPMERE . My warrant , Monsieur de Bellegarde , is simply that , wherever I find you , you stand , and you have the evident intention of standing , in my way ! ( Movement . ) VALENTIN . ( Seeing MME . DE CINTR , left . ) See , after all , then , how little I succeed , and how fortune favours you ! ( Enter MADAME DE CINTR , right ; greets LORD DEEPMERE , and moves to centre . To MME .

Oh , I have my eye on a very different sort of triumph . I came this way , by my mother 's request , to make sure there are enough teacups and spoons .

So before any one comes , let me tell you frankly what I have returned to Paris for . CLAIRE . ( Abstractedly . ) Have you been away ? ( Counting teaspoons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Have n't you observed it ? I went back to England , for a few weeks , in consequence of a conversation I had with your mother . I promised her I would make a thorough examination of the state of my property , with which Madame de Bellegarde was unfortunately but half satisfied . She wanted me to dot my i 's . CLAIRE . What had my mother to do with it ? ( Crosses to table , left . ) DEEPMERE . What is there , in this house , that your mother has not to do with ? CLAIRE . ( Crossing to top of card-table , left . ) Dear Lord Deepmere , your property is not in this house . DEEPMERE . The thing I value most in the world is ! There are , however , other things  --  many other things  --  in England . I have spent more than a month going into everything , riding over everything , turning everything inside out . I 've had up all my people , and I 've kicked out more than half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! CLAIRE . ( Turning over cards . ) Poor people , I 'm sorry for them . DEEPMERE . It serves them right . They were cheating me . CLAIRE . ( Putting down cards going down left . ) Ah , take care you 're not worse cheated ! DEEPMERE . ( Following her . ) What do you mean ? CLAIRE . ( Moving from him . ) I mean that what you tell me is very interesting , but that I have no desire whatever to elicit a report from you . ( Waltz music , pianissimo , off right ; musicians on stage . ) DEEPMERE . Oh , but listen , and see if you do n't like my report ! ( His hand is on the back of a chair ; he moves it a little to one side . ) Everything is now in the best hands  --  every mortgage is paid off . I do n't want to swagger , but I 've got half a dozen places . I do n't want to bore you , but I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear it . CLAIRE . ( Moving up centre , DEEPMERE following her . ) I congratulate you with all my heart on your prosperity , but I ca n't aspire to contribute to it . DEEPMERE . ( Pleading ; trying to take her hands . ) You wo n't care for me  --  never , never ? CLAIRE . It 's utterly impossible ! DEEPMERE . And will you give me no reason ? CLAIRE . I thank you humbly . Please excuse me and let me leave you . ( Re-enter NEWMAN , right , as MME . DE CINTR is turning quickly away . They meet and talk . ) NEWMAN . You 're just what I wanted to see ! DEEPMERE . ( Aside . ) Can that barbarian be her reason ? It 's inconceivable ! The old lady and her prig of an elder son shall tell me ! ( Exit LORD DEEPMERE , left . ) CLAIRE .

( With his knee on the ottoman . ) It will be time to call my success universal when you have given me the supreme proof of it .

DE BELLEGARDE . The sooner the better  --  we 'll come to-morrow . NEWMAN . Wo n't you come round to lunch ? I 'll show you my new place . I 've left that hotel  --  I 've taken a big house . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . A big house ? NEWMAN . A big house , with a big garden . There 's another garden , too , in the rear of it , that I 've made arrangements to add on . MARQUIS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall : a kind of virgin forest  --  the finest , greenest , airiest thing in Paris , with lots of margin and elbow-room . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Your margin must remind you of California . NEWMAN . That 's just why I bought it ! MARQUIS . You 've bought it ? NEWMAN . For Madame de Cintr ! VALENTIN . ( Aside . ) They thought he had only hired it . Oh , he 'll do ! NEWMAN . I 'm having the whole place rearranged and furnished and decorated . You must tell me , and above all Madame de Cintr must tell me , how I had better have it fixed . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . My daughter will accompany us . NEWMAN . ( Turning to VALENTIN . ) That 's just what I wanted to see ! I 'm fixing up the gardens too , and  --  just for the first ideas , in the whole thing  --  some clever artistic friends are helping me . VALENTIN . ( Startled , aside . ) Artistic friends ? Papa Nioche and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To VALENTIN . ) Of course you 'll come too ? VALENTIN . Rather , my dear boy . ( Aside . ) Fancy Nomie let loose in California ! I must go , if only to get her out of the way ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( To NEWMAN . ) You may expect us early . VALENTIN . The early bird takes the worm ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( To VALENTIN . ) You 're incorrigibly profane . Go away this moment and tell your sister to come to me here . ( Exit VALENTIN , right , while MME . DE BELLEGARDE continues , to NEWMAN . ) It 's only fair I should warn you that I 'm very proud  --  that I hold my head very high . Do n't flatter yourself that my daughter is n't proud . The form is different , but the feeling is the same . Even Valentin is proud , if you touch the right spot  --  or the wrong one . Urbain , there , is proud ; that you can see for yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I see ! Well , put your pride in keeping your word to me , and you may all be a set of little Lucifers ! MARQUIS . ( Rising . ) Keep yours to us , sir . ( Re-enter MME . DE CINTR , right , and comes right centre . ) NEWMAN . ( Rising . ) My word is to Madame de Cintr . I 'll repeat it to her before you . CLAIRE . ( To MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ) Valentin tells me you want me , mother . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Yes , so that we may hear what Mr. Newman promises . NEWMAN . ( Taking MME . DE CINTR 'S hand . ) To make you as rich as I possibly can , and to make you far happier than you 're rich . ( MME . DE BELLEGARDE rises ; she and the MARQUIS go up left centre . ) CLAIRE . ( After she has held his hand and looked at him gravely and in silence . ) What a pity Valentin could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEWMAN . What 's the matter with him ? CLAIRE . Lord Deepmere pounced on him and walked him away . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Poor Lord Deepmere ! MARQUIS . He 's very unreasonable ! ( Exeunt , left , MARQUIS and MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ) NEWMAN . ( Jubilant . ) It 's all right  --  they 've caught on ! ( Going round the ottoman , he seats , himself on it with CLAIRE . ) They 're coming to see me to-morrow , to arrange some technicalities . CLAIRE . Do n't speak to me of your technicalities  --  I care nothing about them . NEWMAN . They 're not mine  --  they 're theirs ! Wo n't you give me a foretaste of happiness by coming too ? CLAIRE . I should like to see your house . I 'll look at that . NEWMAN . That ai n't mine either  --  it 's already yours . CLAIRE . Shall you , then , insist on our living in Paris ? NEWMAN . Oh , yes  --  insisting will be quite in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go where you like . CLAIRE . What then , will you do with the house ? NEWMAN . We 'll give it to Valentine . CLAIRE . I should like to see your great country . NEWMAN . The land of gold  --  the blue Pacific ? We 'll start as soon as we 're married . Footnote : 1Kb CLAIRE . You take my breath away . NEWMAN . Did n't you take mine  --  the first time I ever saw you ? CLAIRE . You live too fast . NEWMAN . It 's you that make me  --  I 've had to catch up ! But after we 're once off we shall go slower  --  to make it last ! CLAIRE . ( As if with vague uneasiness . ) Do you think it will last ? NEWMAN . Will the fish last in the sea ?  --  will the stars last in the sky ? Do n't you feel safe ? CLAIRE . I shall ( hesitating a moment and smiling dimly ) in the blue Pacific ! NEWMAN . ( Laughing . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With both her hands in his , drawing her closer . ) My own darling  --  we 're going to the top ! CLAIRE . ( Closing her eyes an instant . ) You 'll make me dizzy ! NEWMAN . You can be as dizzy as you like , with my arm round you ! We 're going up into the light and the sweet , high air , into the fields of flowers and the great places of love , where we shall look down with pity at the desert in which we did n't know each other . CLAIRE . Ah , we 're out of that  --  we do know each other ! NEWMAN . We shall have more to learn , but the more we do learn the more we shall like it . I shall find new things and bigger things to do , but it will be all for you I shall do them ! CLAIRE . You 've done the newest  --  and ( smiling ) I think I may say the biggest !  --  in winning your victory to-night . NEWMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there are always new worlds to conquer . We 'll explore them and annex them to-gether , and find at every turn some use that we can be , some good that we can do . The good that you 'll do , dearest  --  CLAIRE . ( Longingly , as he pauses from the fulness of his emotion . ) Ah ! if you 'll show me that ! NEWMAN . ( With ardent responsiveness . ) I 'll show it to the whole earth ! Footnote : 1Kb CLAIRE . ( Laying her hand upon his , with a deliberate movement of his her ? own , the only one of this particular kind that she makes during the play . ) I 'll follow you , I 'll help you , I 'll cherish you . But ( withdrawing her hand , and in another tone , half melancholy , half gay ) I may mention to you that , when I used to think , as a girl , of what I would do if I were to marry freely and by my own choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's nothing against me  --  your taste was n't formed . Footnote : 1Kb CLAIRE . Have you formed it ? NEWMAN . ( Looking at her a moment . ) Do you know there 's something I should like to form ? It 's formed with the lips ! CLAIRE . ( Rising . ) Not now  --  not here ! NEWMAN . ( Rising . ) To-morrow , then , when you come ! CLAIRE . ( Smiling . ) In that case I 'm not so sure I shall come ! NEWMAN . ( Delighted with her . ) You are what I wanted to see ! ( Kisses her hand . ) ( Re-enter VALENTIN , right , and goes slowly left at once . ) VALENTIN . If you 've got so far as that , you had better go a little further ! Just walk through the rooms together  --  show yourselves all over the place . NEWMAN . ( Humorously , to CLAIRE . ) Did n't you tell me awhile ago that you wanted to pass unnoticed ? CLAIRE . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! VALENTIN . You 've no time to lose , then . ( Re-enter MRS . BREAD , left . ) NEWMAN . We 'll begin with Mrs. Bread . Mrs. Bread , give us your blessing . MRS . BREAD . ( To MME . DE CINTR , who comes to her and kisses her . ) I gave you them all , my sweet lady , when you needed them more ! ( MME . DE CINTR remains with her during the next words spoken by NEWMAN and VALENTIN . ) NEWMAN . ( At back of armchair . ) What 's the hitch ? VALENTIN . It will be a good precaution against hitches for you to go and bid everyone good night and tell as many people as you can . ( NEWMAN goes up . ) NEWMAN . ( To MME . DE CINTR . ) Please accept my arm . I 'll tell every man and woman in the house . ( Mazurka music , pianissimo , off right . MME . DE CINTR takes his arm . Exeunt NEWMAN and MME . DE CINTR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and looking a moment at VALENTIN , who has thrown himself into armchair . ) I do n't like my boy 's looks . You 're flushed and excited . VALENTIN . Give me something cool to drink  --  I 'm all right ! MRS . BREAD . A little iced lemonade , made by my own hands . ( She goes to the buffet , and comes back with a glass , VALENTIN meanwhile sitting in thought . ) VALENTIN . ( After he has drunk the lemonade and given her back the glass . ) Dear old Catty , keep the heads of the family  --  or rather its feet  --  in the straight and narrow path ! MRS . BREAD . There 's something you do n't tell me . VALENTIN . It 's merely that our noble friend Deepmere is raging over the place like a young vindictive archangel , with a crush hat and a white waistcoat ; he has cornered them there and is giving them a piece of his mind . But do n't let me detain you  --  you must be wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round her . ) It does n't matter ; almost everyone 's gone . VALENTIN . Go and blow out the candles then . MRS . BREAD . I 'm afraid to leave you . Something 's in the air  --  you 're waiting for Lord Deepmere . Do n't , do n't have words with him . ( Exit , left . ) VALENTIN . Not a word too much ! ( Re-enter LORD DEEPMERE , right . ) DEEPMERE . You referred me to the responsible parties , and I have seen the responsible parties . You told me I should find you here  --  VALENTIN . And you find me here ! DEEPMERE . I congratulate myself , because it gives me an opportunity to tell you that I have had the satisfaction of convicting Madame de Bellegarde and your brother of gross and shameless duplicity . They 've deceived me , they 've outraged me , and I think they wo n't soon forget the , five minutes I 've just had the honour of spending with them ! VALENTIN . ( Rising . ) I certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 've not done with them yet  --  I 've still my reparation to demand . VALENTIN . ( After an instant . ) May I consider that you demand it of me ? DEEPMERE . My complaint 's of your brother  --  it 's from him the apology should come . VALENTIN . I 'm afraid we do n't make apologies . But we embrace each other 's quarrels . DEEPMERE . Oh , the Marquis does n't quarrel  --  he gets out of the way ! VALENTIN . You see I do n't , milord . DEEPMERE . Oh , I do n't accuse you of double dealing ! If you 've tried to trip me up from the first , you 've done it frankly  --  you 've done it consistently , you 've done it elsewhere as well as here ! VALENTIN . The less you say about elsewhere the better . Here will do . DEEPMERE . ( After a moment . ) It will do very well , then  --  to choose another place . VALENTIN . A couple of our friends will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet any gentlemen you may designate . DEEPMERE . The earlier the better . I shall go straight home . Good night . VALENTIN . ( Right centre . ) Good night ! ( As LORD DEEPMERE is going at back to left . ) I may just mention the circumstance that it would be a convenience to me not to go far . DEEPMERE . The nearer the better . VALENTIN . There are quiet places in Paris  --  with a little ingenuity . DEEPMERE . The quieter the better . Any friends of yours will be sure to be ingenious . Good night . VALENTIN . Good night . ( They formally bow to each other . Exit LORD DEEPMERE , left , after which VALENTIN , alone , remains a moment in thought . ) No , no ; I must n't be out of it . ( Goes to the fireplace . ) Who was it was talking of a big disused garden  --  a tract of country in the midst of old Louis Quatorze mansions ? By Jove , it was Newman himself  --  the convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Hallo  --  it 's nearly to-morrow now . I must put my hand on a couple of the right ones  --  all the men have gone . It 's not a nice thing to have to tell them ; for there 's no doubt Deepmere has been trifled with . Bah ! I 'll tell them something else . One has to stand up for one 's nearest and dearest , even when one knows what they are ! ( The music ceases . As VALENTIN is going off he is met by the MARQUIS , who re-enters hastily , right . ) MARQUIS . ( Breathless . ) Have you seen Lord Deepmere ?  --  do you know where he is ? VALENTIN . ( Aside . ) That 's the sort of thing they 're up to ! Do they want a little more ? ( Aloud . ) I have n't the least idea of his lordship 's whereabouts . MARQUIS . Your mother wishes to speak to him  --  I hope he has n't gone ! ( Exit MARQUIS , rapidly , left . ) VALENTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God forgive me , if he 's not , they want to catch him again before he has time to cool ! He has poured forth rent-rolls and vouchers like scalding water , and , seeing that they dropped him too soon , they want to pick him up again ! Poor Newman ! ( Goes right , and as he is going off meets NEWMAN coming in . Re-enter NEWMAN , right . They come down , NEWMAN , left ; VALENTIN , right . ) NEWMAN . Well , we made the grand tour  --  everyone seemed to like it . ( Seats himself in armchair . ) VALENTIN . I do n't see how they can get out of that . What have you done with Claire ? NEWMAN . Your mother called her off  --  she must have sent her to bed . VALENTIN . That 's where we all ought to be . NEWMAN . I want to sit up all night  --  such a grand night as this ! VALENTIN . How much you 're in love ! You ought to get home to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make the most of them ! NEWMAN . ( Rising and looking at VALENTIN . ) What 's the matter with you ? ( Movement from VALENTIN . ) I 'll go as soon as I 've seen Claire again  --  she has n't bidden me good night . ( Looking about and going up and round to right . ) VALENTIN . How can she , if she has been sent to bed ? NEWMAN . She ai n't a little girl of six ! She wo n't go to bed  --  or else she 'll get up again . VALENTIN . She 's in love too , then ! NEWMAN . ( Still looking . ) She 'll make me doubt it if she does n't come back a moment . VALENTIN . Well , I must go to bed at any rate . ( Goes up to left . ) NEWMAN . Good night , then . Take care of yourself . VALENTIN . ( About to go , left , coming down again . ) Do you know I 've got an idea ? I should like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to-morrow  --  rather on the quiet . NEWMAN . I 'd rather you came with a band of music ! Footnote : 1Kb VALENTIN . No ; I should like to appear at the crisis  --  unexpectedly , dramatically ! NEWMAN . Hide under the table , then , and suddenly pop out . VALENTIN . I 've thought of something better  --  since you 've got a garden . NEWMAN . A garden ? VALENTIN . The " virgin forest , " you know  --  the big place you swaggered about . I 'll come in that way  --  NEWMAN . You may come down the chimney if you like ! VALENTIN . Is there room there to hide ? NEWMAN . ( Staring . ) In the chimney ? VALENTIN . No , no ; in the virgin forest ! How do you get in ? NEWMAN . Why , by the gates on the three back streets . I 'll send you the keys . ( Moves to centre . ) VALENTIN . ( Aside . ) Bravo ! ( Aloud . ) I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know your little games ! VALENTIN . So you 'll send me the keys early ? NEWMAN . With the peep of dawn . VALENTIN . God bless you ! ( They shake hands . ) Good night . ( Goes up . ) Good night ! ( Exit VALENTIN , left . ) NEWMAN . ( Alone , looking after him a moment . ) What in creation 's his little game ?  --  what 's his elaborate plan ? ( Reenter MME . DE BELLEGARDE , right . ) They are elaborate , over here ! ( Moves to right . ) MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Mr. Newman ? ( Coldly . ) I had an impression you had taken leave of us . NEWMAN . Not yet , Madam ! I 've not yet taken leave of your daughter . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Is that ceremony indispensable ? NEWMAN . ( After a moment 's look at her . ) I think that in this house every ceremony is ! Will you be so good as to tell me where you left Madame de Cintr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ! NEWMAN . I 'll try ! ( Exit NEWMAN , right . ) MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( Alone . ) Find her if you can ! ( Seats herself on ottoman . ) ( Re-enter the MARQUIS , left upper entrance . ) MARQUIS . Deepmere has left the house . ( Crossing at back . ) Damn his manners ! ( Goes to fireplace . ) MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Do you think his manners would have been better if he had stayed , after that scene ? Where 's Valentin ? Footnote : 1Kb MARQUIS . He has also gone out . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . At this hour ? MARQUIS . You know his habits ! I saw him cross the court with two gentlemen . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . To begin the evening , I suppose . A merry party ! MARQUIS . Frankly speaking , they must be merrier than we . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . It was a bad quarter of an hour ; but I 'm not in despair . Lord Deepmere will come back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But have n't you had enough ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . One can never have enough of hearing about such a magnificent property . The whole thing cleared  --  a beautiful fresh start . Four English seats and a house in Park Lane . MARQUIS . He 's better , after all , than Newman ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Yes , and he 's a gentleman . MARQUIS . You felt he was a gentleman when he let you have it ? You sent him away , a month ago , to dot his i 's , and I hope you felt he was dotting them ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . He has dotted them with great gold pieces ! He has taken the bad taste of your American out of my mouth . MARQUIS . Ah , we took a bigger bite of the poor American than we can swallow ! But Mr. Newman , to do him justice , has never insulted us . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . He will  --  he will ! Give him time . MARQUIS . Definitely , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . How could I do it before I knew what we have missed ? But we have n't missed it yet ! MARQUIS . I 've known you long , mother ; but there are still moments when you frighten me . What do you mean to do ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( Rising . ) I must think it over . I 'll tell you to-morrow . MARQUIS . But to-morrow we go to the American 's . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . That will be just our opportunity  --  it 's providential . MARQUIS . The day after our promise ? And on what pretext ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . I 'll find a pretext ! ( After a pause . ) We made no promise to Mr. Newman that did n't strictly depend on his conditions . MARQUIS . He 'll make any conditions we like . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . I defy him to make any I like ! ( Re-enter MRS . BREAD , right . As she sees MRS . BREAD . ) Hold your tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To MRS . BREAD , crossing her . ) Everything is upside down , but we shall recover ourselves to-morrow . MRS . BREAD . Yes , my lady : after such an affair ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . We shall have a grand putting to rights . Is Mr. Newman gone ? MRS . BREAD . I believe he has just left the house . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Then see that the lights are out and that everything is closed . ( Exeunt MME . DE BELLEGARDE and MARQUIS , left . ) MRS . BREAD . ( Alone . ) I 'm afraid nothing will ever be open again ! ( Re-enter NEWMAN , right . To NEWMAN . ) I just told a fib for you , sir  --  I knew you were n't gone . NEWMAN . I want no fibs  --  I only want Madame de Cintr . ( Goes to right . ) MRS . BREAD . She 's coming  --  she took refuge with me . NEWMAN . Refuge ? ( Re-enter MME . DE CINTR , right . NEWMAN opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand that your only refuge is in my arms ! ( MME . DE CINTR throws herself into them as the Curtain falls . ) ACT THIRD A large deep saloon in the fine old house into which NEWMAN has just moved . The whole place handsome , but rather bare ; slight disorder , signs of recent arrival . It must be sufficiently visible that the rooms belong to a set of apartments on the ground floor . The main entrance from outside , is to the left , considerably down to the front . Further up , between left and middle , a wide , high window , opening into the great court of the htel . In the middle a door , draped in old tapestry , opening on a passage which leads to a bedroom . To the right of this , balancing with the window , a large open door , leading to staircase and rooms above . Quite at the right , near the front , the entrance of a conservatory which communicates with the grounds . NOMIE , expensively and showily dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divested of her jacket and gloves , though wearing a very smart hat , discovered just after she has hung up , in a florid gilt frame , one of her garish " copies . " NOMIE . ( On a step-ladder . ) With all the rest upstairs , this makes the seventeenth ; I am working them off ! ( Enter , left , hat in hand , VALENTIN DE BELLEGARDE . ) Good morning ; you get up early ! VALENTIN . So do you , if you come to that ! NOMIE . Oh , we 've been here an hour  --  hanging pictures ! Papa has gone to get more cord . VALENTIN . ( Who has looked first on table , left , and then locked , in a different manner , out of window . ) You seem indeed to have the place to yourself . I have n't met a soul . NOMIE . The establishment is still very small . VALENTIN . Does it consist entirely of you ? NOMIE . I 'm not a member of it  --  I 'm only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they 're not so easy to meet . VALENTIN . ( Looking on piano . ) One of the best people was rather easy to meet when you met the master of this house ! May I inquire if he 's still in bed ? NOMIE . For what do you take him ? He dashed out half an hour ago . VALENTIN . ( Aside . ) Confound him ! What then shall I do for my keys ? ( Looking vaguely about him . ) NOMIE . ( Coming down from her ladder . ) Is there anything particular you want of him ? VALENTIN . ( Moving toward sofa . ) He promised to do something for me  --  very early ; but he has n't done it . It does n't matter ; I daresay I can get on . ( He continues to look , covertly , for the keys , and suddenly spies them in a silver bowl on the table , left . Aside . ) Bravo !  --  there they are . If I could only pick them up ! NOMIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns round on stool . ) You must excuse Mr. Newman if he has forgotten  --  he 's so awfully full of something else . Has he told you about his necklace ?  --  the finest pearls that can be found in Paris  --  half a dozen rows ! He has gone out to buy them , but he 'll be back to receive his visitors . ( Suddenly arranging her hat and her hair . ) Do I look very badly ? VALENTIN . Charmingly ill ! Are you going to help to receive them ? See for yourself if you 're not in the best form to make an impression . NOMIE . For a wonder , there is n't a mirror in the room ; but there are fifty upstairs . Excuse me a moment . ( Exit NOMIE , right upper entrance . ) VALENTIN . Vanitas vanitatum  --  now for my keys ! ( Snatches them , at the table , out of the silver bowl . ) These must be right  --  yes , they 're labelled . With those good fellows waiting for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and admit them from the inside . The very absurdity of such a place is our protection ! If we 've only not kept the others waiting ! ( Just as he has thrust the keys into his pocket and is hurrying off , he finds himself face to face with NIOCHE . Enter NIOCHE , left with big roll of red cord . ) NIOCHE . Our noble friend all alone ? VALENTIN . Your daughter left me this moment . I wo n't wait to see her again , but please tell her I left these words for her : " Good-bye  --  be a good girl ! " ( Exit VALENTIN , rapidly , through the conservatory . ) NIOCHE . ( Alone , putting cord down on table , right , and staring after him a moment . ) What 's the matter with him ? She 's good enough for me ! ( Enter NEWMAN , left . ) NEWMAN . You 're just what I want to see . NIOCHE . Comte Valentin has this moment gone out , but you wo n't have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who carries a small box , reminded , snapping his fingers . ) Ah , poor dear fellow , he must have come for his keys  --  why could n't I remember ? But it 's all right ( looking into the silver bowl ) ; you gave them to him . NIOCHE . Begging your pardon , sir  --  I gave him nothing . NEWMAN . Then whom else did he see ? NIOCHE . He appeared to have seen my daughter . NEWMAN . Oh then , she gave them . If he has got them , for some fantastic purpose  --  some " little game "  --  it does n't matter how he came by them . ( Opening the flat jewel-case which he carries in his hand and exhibiting its contents to NIOCHE . ) I could think of nothing but this ( re-enter NOMIE without her hat ) till I had scrambled out and got hold of it . ( As NIOCHE , clasping his hands , gives signs of wonder and admiration . ) Do you think she 'll like it ? NIOCHE . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Left centre to NOMIE , who comes down . ) I 'll try you , Miss Nomie . ( Showing her the pearls . ) Do you think they 're fine ? NOMIE . ( Taking the case from him , with an emotion that breaks out as soon as she looks at it . ) Oh , the lovely darlings ! It 's you that are fine , Mr. Newman ! NEWMAN . I shall be finer when I 've put on some clothes . ( Crosses her , going up right . ) Look at it well , and tell me if there 's anything the matter with it . ( Exit NEWMAN , right upper entrance . ) NOMIE . ( Gazes at the jewels for some minutes ; after which she raises her eyes in silence to her father 's . ) To think we 're going to lose such a man . NIOCHE . ( Going to sit at top of table . ) It 's very dreadful  --  but there are others besides . I found a letter for you at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A letter with a coronet on the paper . NOMIE . ( Taking the letter , after having deposited the jewel-case reverently on table , right . ) Yes , there are others besides . It 's from Lord Deepmere , about a copy he wants me to do . I shall have to write three lines of answer  --  just wait for me . ( Goes up to door , right . ) NIOCHE . ( Crossing to sofa . ) I should tell you Comte Valentin left a message for you  --  a solemn injunction to be a good girl . NOMIE . I 'll be too good for him ! ( Exit NOMIE , right . ) NIOCHE . ( Alone , goes to the table , and carefully lifting the pearl necklace out of its case , holds it to the light and looks at it , examines it like an old Jew . ) Does he want me to see if there 's anything the matter with it ? The only thing that 's the matter with it is that it is n't ours ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands on the threshold a moment with her glass up , watching him before he sees her . As soon as he does so he quickly puts down the necklace , rubbing his hands , and bowing and backing as she advances . ) MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( Aside . ) What an extraordinary person  --  an old pedlar with jewels ! ( Aloud . ) If you 're a servant , you had better have been at your post . For want of some one to announce me , I 've made my way in alone . My son , who accompanies me , is wandering off into the court in quest of assistance . NIOCHE . ( Obsequiously , apologetically . ) The staff is only half sketched out ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Is that the way you sketch it ? ( Re-enter NOMIE , right upper entrance . ) Announce Madame de Bellegarde . NOMIE . ( Aside . ) Madame de Bellegarde ? I do help to receive them ! ( Advances and curtsies low to MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ) Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking about her . NOMIE gives her father a note . ) Here are two words , in answer to the note  --  to be taken immediately . NIOCHE . ( With the note . ) I must first let Mr. Newman know  --  NOMIE . Never mind that  --  I 'll let Mr. Newman know . NIOCHE . ( Crossing to left . ) Just as you direct . ( About to retire , bowing and retreating before MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ) Madame ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( Having , on NOMIE 'S appearance , gazed at her in amazement , without acknowledging in any manner her salutation , aside . ) A bold young woman  --  dressed like a mountebank and quite at home ! ( Aloud to NIOCHE . ) Look for Monsieur le Marquis , and tell him where I am . NIOCHE . ( Left down , obsequious , as before . ) Madame ! ( Exit NIOCHE , left down , with note , while MME . DE BELLEGARDE scans NOMIE from head to foot . ) NOMIE . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aloud , as if going . ) Shall I have the honour of announcing Madame la Marquise ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Wait till I 've been rejoined by my son . ( Aside , seating herself on sofa . ) I 'll go into this . ( Aloud , after another stern survey of NOMIE . ) May I inquire if you 're a member of the staff ?

( She checks herself on seeing the MARQUIS ; then aside . ) Gracious , he 's not much like the Count .

( Taking a cigar out of the box and sniffing it appreciatively . ) Perhaps the cigars are a present for me ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Be firm  --  be firm ! MARQUIS . ( Sniffing still at his cigar . ) I 'll be a rock ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . I told you I would find a pretext . Very well , I have found a pretext . MARQUIS .

( Aside , as his mother 's tactics dawn upon him . ) I see  --  magnificent mother ! NEWMAN . I do n't know what you 're talking about ! That young lady 's a charming artistFootnote : 1Kb  --  she does odd jobs for me . MARQUIS . ( Aside . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BELLEGARDE . Your defence of her is compromising ! It 's even more fortunate than I could suspect that Mme. de Cintr remained at home . I do n't mean to say for a moment that we could have apprehended such an encounter . She stayed simply as an unmistakable sign to you that she withdraws from her engagement . ( She rises ; the MARQUIS rises . ) NEWMAN . ( Falling back to chair up right centre . ) An unmistakable sign ? Do you expect me to take that ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . You can take it or leave it . It 's what we came to tell you .

NEWMAN . No further ? AfterFootnote : 1Kb we blazed through the rooms and announced our engagement to five hundred people ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . You made too much noise  --  you must pay for your advertisement ! NEWMAN . And must she pay too ? She told me she wanted every one to know . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Now she wants them to know something else . NEWMAN . Something else indeed ! That you 're incapable of keeping common faith , of being honest for twenty-four hours ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE .

Call them even narrow , call them bigoted , if you will  --  they are , after all , our religion , our faith , the faith of our ancestors . It has come over us , with the wholesome morning light , which restores the true proportions of things and the true perspective of honour , that we shrink from an intensely new responsibility .

( Passing her hands into her son 's arm . ) We 're quite conscious that we 're not like all the world ; those who cling to lost causes are certainly less in fashion than the representatives of trade ! Let me add , before we retire , that we made no promise to you that did n't explicitly depend on your meeting our conditions . NEWMAN . And what conditions have I failed to meet ? You have n't even mentioned one of them . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . I 'll mention one now . Your having a decent house ! NEWMAN . You go back to that folly ? It 's too monstrous ! What do you want me to do with the poor girl ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Anything in the world you like ! MARQUIS . ( Looking at the stitching of his glove . ) Only wait till we get out of the house ! ( He gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come in . ) NEWMAN . I refuse to accept your statement that Madame de Cintr has given her assent to this hideous proceeding . She 's not a child  --  she 's not a slave . She 's a woman grown  --  she 's her own mistress . What have you done to her  --  what have you done with her ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( Going toward table , right , with MARQUIS . ) My happy power is in the grateful submission of my family . Filial obedience is the oldest tradition of our race .

He ca n't smile and bow , but when he 's face to face with a dead wall he can have the intelligence to see it and turn round . He can be clever enough for that . MARQUIS . ( Fatuously , repeating . ) He can be clever enough for that ! NEWMAN . He must try and be as clever as you , Marquis . ( Goes up towards right upper entrance . ) You ca n't expect me to let you go without a protest , without a supplication . Pity me enough to think it over once more  --  not to turn your backs on me yet  --  to stay a little longer . Be generous , Madame de Bellegarde  --  just wait ten minutes ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE .

Yes , spare me , in this dreadful hour  --  spare me and save him ! He was all I had ! ( Giving way , weeping prostrate . ) NEWMAN . You have me  --  you have me  --  and you wo n't take me ! CLAIRE . I told you last night that I was afraid of happiness . See how right I was , and what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa , with head on back . ) NEWMAN . Ai n't you afraid of something else ?  --  of turning joy to bitterness ?  --  of broken pledges and blighted hopes ? Ai n't you afraid to go away , as I find you in the inexorable act of doing , and leave me gnashing my teeth and cursing my fate ? ( As she makes no answer but to burst into tears he goes on , abruptly , in another tone . ) Where is Mrs. Bread ? Has she stayed behind ? CLAIRE . ( Rising . ) I took the carriage , but she follows . Once away , when I can breathe , when I can think , you shall hear from me . NEWMAN . When you can think ? Do you mean when you can repent ? CLAIRE . My repentance will be all my future ! But I 'm sick with this delay  --  am I not to see my brother ? NEWMAN . Come to him now  --  let me show you ! ( He goes with MME . DE CINTR quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely , bows MME . DE CINTR in and follows . Exit MME . DE CINTR , centre door . While this takes place , re-enter MRS .

Ah , the fatal folly , that I did n't prevent it last night , when I felt it in the air ! NEWMAN . I did n't feel it , God knows ! But you can help us all yet . You know something . ( Movement of MRS , BREAD . ) Something that happened at Fleurires  --  ten years ago . Something secret  --  something shameful ! MRS . BREAD . Ah , did the Count tell you ?

When they 're hard pressed they have a refuge . NEWMAN . A refuge . Do you mean the convent ? A convent for her  --  for that woman  --  for my promised wife ? MRS . BREAD . It 's too hideous  --  you must help me to prevent it ! NEWMAN . Trust me  --  if you 'll show me how ! MRS . BREAD . Come then to Fleurires  --  come to Fleurires ! NEWMAN . ( Eagerly . ) Will you tell me , there ? MRS . BREAD . Will I tell you what ? NEWMAN . The great secret  --  the great shame ! MRS . BREAD . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's too late ! ( Exit MRS . BREAD , left down and re-enter NIOCHE centre ; NEWMAN goes right . ) NIOCHE . ( Gazing mournfully at NEWMAN . ) Lord , sir , what a sad inauguration of your beautiful house ! NEWMAN . My beautiful house be hanged  --  I 've done with my beautiful house ! ( Crosses to left . ) NIOCHE . Done with it ? And what 's to become of it ? NEWMAN . ( Going up , left . ) I do n't care a rap ! Keep it for yourself ! NIOCHE . ( Staring . ) For myself ? With all the valuable objects ? NEWMAN . ( At back . ) Damn the valuable objects ! NIOCHE . ( At the table on which the pearl necklace , which he lifts up , is still lying . ) The most valuable of all  --  the priceless pearls . NEWMAN . Give ' em to your daughter !

( At this moment his eyes rest on the SISTER OF CHARITY , summoned by MARIGNAC , who has entered left down , and stands silently just within the threshold . He bows to her solemnly . ) You come too late to nurse , good Sister  --  but not too late to pray ! NEWMAN . ( Becoming aware of her . ) Good Sister , pray for me ! ( Action from SISTER . ) Ah , Valentine , Valentine ! ( Flings himself down on the sofa and buries his face on the arm while the Curtain falls . ) Selfish brute that I am ! ACT FOURTH At the old Chteau de Fleurires ; the closing hours of an early spring day . A high , paneled , central drawing-room. , with " subjects , " little oval or circular pictures , above the doors , let into the white boiserie , and very tall French windows , with small square panes and long , straight , flowered , faded curtains . Nothing but sparse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the left , near the front , a door leading to MME . DE CINTR 'S apartments or " wing " ; another on the same side , higher up , quite at back , communicating with the general entrance . On the right , at back , balancing with this principal entrance , a large window , opening , down to the ground , upon the visible , melancholy , moated terrace of the chteau . Further down , on the same side , the door of the special apartments , or " wing , " of MME . DE BELLEGARDE and the MARQUIS . During the act the dusk slowly gathers , and at a given moment a pair of candles are lighted . Enter , left upper entrance , a SERVANT , the same who has appeared in the second act , but who is now in a mourning livery , preceding M. DE MARIGNAC . Enter M. DE MARIGNAG , in a high hat with a crape band , carrying in his hand a large bunch of early violets . MARIGNAC . ( Crossing SERVANT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have written a word on this card . ( The SERVANT takes the card on salver and exit left , while MARIGNAC , alone a moment , has taken off his hat and put it down on table right , looking about the place with a certain wonder . ) It fairly smells of the past  --  I like my violets better ! ( Goes right , sniffing them , while re-enter SERVANT , left , holding the door open for MME . DE CINTR . Enter MME . DE CINTR , left , in the deepest mourning . Exit SERVANT left upper entrance , and MARIGNAC , advancing to MME . DE CINTR with an expression of the greatest sympathy and consideration , takes her hand and , bowing over it , raises it to his lips . ) It 's so like your gracious goodness to make an exception in my favour . CLAIRE . It 's only for once ; I shall never see you again . MARIGNAC . Do you mean as the penalty of my participation ? We could n't do less for him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellegarde of old , with his hand on his sword . CLAIRE . Yes , thank God ; he was a Bellegarde of old , not one of to-day . ( Crosses to right , MARIGNAC goes left . ) But I do n't mean anything vindictive ; it would become me strangely little at this hour . I accept the fact , I almost rejoice in it , that my brother has done forever with the troubles of this world . ( Leans on window , resting on her arm . ) For the troubles of this world are too heavy to be borne . MARIGNAC . You speak as if you were going to leave it ! There 's something in your face that I guess the intention of , and it makes my heart sink . CLAIRE . ( Turning to him . ) Envy me , envy me ! ( Turning back to window . ) Farewell ! MARIGNAC . Is there no comfort I can give you ? Is there no service I can render you ? CLAIRE . Think of me as more at peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble for me than that . MARIGNAC . I took a very small trouble half an hour ago . I gathered these violets for you ( CLAIRE comes down to him ) , almost the very first of the spring , in the sweet old churchyard on the side of the hill , where we laid him to rest this morning . CLAIRE . ( Taking the flowers and kissing them . ) Thank you , thank you . Good-bye . ( Crosses to left. , and is going . ) MARIGNAC . A moment more . Your brother , the last hour of his life , charged me to give this to you ( taking from his waistcoat-pocket a small packet ) : he usually wore it ; he took it off before this lamentable affair . CLAIRE . ( Taking the little packet ; after a look . ) It 's a blessed relic ; a little cross that belonged to my father , he wore it round his neck . ( Fulls into chair , at table , left , and kisses it as she has kissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounce , Footnote : 1Kb but I shall carry this  --  beneath ! MARIGNAC . Beneath the rigid folds of the nun ? Heaven help me  --  I should like to prevent that ! CLAIRE . You ca n't prevent it , Monsieur de Marignac . MARIGNAC . Upon my honour , I can try ! CLAIRE . You can do nothing . MARIGNAC . I shall see what I can do . Excuse me if I say I warn you . CLAIRE . Do you mean that you 'll communicate ( rising and nodding across the stage to right down. ) with them ? MARIGNAC . Your mother and the Marquis ? Do n't they know it ? CLAIRE . They do n't dream of it . It 's my own affair , and I appeal to your honour not to betray me . ( Goes to left down . ) Farewell ! MARIGNAC . Oh , I shall see you again ! CLAIRE . Never  --  never ! ( Exit MME . DE CINTR , left down . ) MARIGNAC . If I do n't , may charming women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to back . ) ( Re-enter the SERVANT , left upper entrance , introducing NEWMAN , as he has introduced MARIGNAC . Enter NEWMAN , left upper entrance . ) NEWMAN . ( To the SERVANT . ) All right , I 'll wait here while you tell her . Mind you tell her it 's me ! SERVANT . Oh , she 'll come to you , sir . ( Exit SERVANT , left upper entrance , MARIGNAC comes down . ) NEWMAN . ( To MARIGNAC . ) You 're just what I want to see ! There 's a sickly satisfaction in putting my hand on you . ( With his hand on MARIGNAC 'S shoulder . ) I 'm going to wantFootnote : 1Kb you . ( They go up to fireplace ; MARIGNAC sits on couch . NEWMAN leans on mantelshelf , after putting his hat on table by fireplace . ) MARIGNAC . Oh , I want to be wanted  --  if it 's for the right thing ! NEWMAN . It 's for the right thing this time  --  you may bet your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1Kb  --  across the churchyard  --  at those dismal dreadful proceedings ; but I was afraid you would have returned to Paris . At what time is your train ? MARIGNAC . I 'll take the train that suits you . I 'll do anything in fact that suits you  --  as a friend of the friend we buried to-day . NEWMAN . We were both the friends of that friend  --  but there he lies , in spite of us . ( Looking at his watch . ) Ah , if Mrs. Bread would only come ! I 've an appointment with her . MARIGNAC . I 'm waiting for her too , to put into her hand a little supreme remembrance ( taking out another little packet ) that poor Bellegarde committed to me . NEWMAN . If you do n't want to wait , and will give me the object , I 'll answer for her receiving it safely . MARIGNAC . You 'll oblige me very much  --  I 'll put the parcel here . ( Coming down and depositing it on table . ) If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , and I give you up the field . NEWMAN . It 's for two private ends , but I do n't mind telling you what one of them is . ( MARIGNAC comes back to left . ) It 's to ask her to obtain for me an interview with Madame de Cintr . MARIGNAC . ( With his hand on NEWMAN 's arm . ) The other night  --  at the Htel de Bellegarde  --  that did n't seem to depend on Mrs. Bread ! NEWMAN . It depended on more than you know  --  or than I know , either ! I wo n't pretend to conceal from you  --  sore and sombre as I am !  --  that I 'm a man with a grievance , and with more than one . MARIGNAC . I think I 've just learned one , at least , from Madame de Cintr 's lips . NEWMAN . ( Eagerly . ) You saw her ? She was here , and I missed her ? Curse my luck ! ( Goes to cabinet and round at back . ) MARIGNAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . NEWMAN . That 's just what I want to see ! What then did you learn from her lips ? MARIGNAC . ( Looking at him a moment in silence . ) Do n't you know ? Do n't you guess ? It 's more your business than mine ! NEWMAN . Do you mean that atrocity of the convent ? ( Comes to centre . ) Yes , that 's my business  --  that 's why I 'm here ! MARIGNAC . You 're none too soon ! But I myself let her know that , meddler as I might seem to her to be , I was capable of attempting to make such a step impossible . NEWMAN . Well , that was good . MARIGNAC . Yes , but she asked me what I could do . NEWMAN . And what did you say to that ? MARIGNAC . I said I would see . But unfortunately I do n't see ! NEWMAN . Then I 'll show you ! ( Taking him sharply by the arm , and pointing to the long window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that terrace  --  go out into those grounds  --  stand there till I call you . Be patient . Footnote : 1Kb Do you understand ? MARIGNAC . Not a bit ! NEWMAN . Then you wo n't do it for me ? MARIGNAC . I 'll do anything for you ! ( They shake hands . ) NEWMAN . Be quick , then , here comes Mrs. Bread ! ( MARIGNAC , pushed by NEWMAN , who opens it for him , passes out of the window to the terrace . NEWMAN closes the window and turns to meet MRS . BREAD , who has entered left down . ) I 've kept my tryst  --  I suppose you saw me this morning . MRS . BREAD . ( In deep mourning , with reddened eyes , shakes her head tragically . ) Oh , this morning , I could n't see ! Nor can I make out what now you 're doing at that window . NEWMAN . I 've a confederate . MRS . BREAD . M. de Marignac ? NEWMAN . He has brought you a sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , something the Count gave him for you on that abominable morning . MRS . BREAD . ( Crossing and taking the little packet , which consists of a small case that she opens ; she seats herself with it at table , right . ) The rare old ring that he used to wear on his blessed , beautiful hand ! Oh , and he thought of me ? ( Bursts into tears . ) My boy , my boy ! NEWMAN . ( Who has gone to the fireplace , where he stands , with his back to the audience , waiting an instant , in respectful silence , while she sobs . ) Now you know how I feel , and how I want to see her ! MRS . BREAD . ( Drying her eyes . ) I 've been with her , that 's what has kept me . ( NEWMAN turns round . MRS . BREAD rises . ) She bids me tell you she 'll come to you . But you 'll find it a sorry joy ! NEWMAN . I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'll know the reason why ! MRS . BREAD . You know it already . The reason why is a horrible big house , twenty miles from here , with high grey walls and little cold cells , full of wasting women who are for ever , on the hard stones , on their knees . NEWMAN . Well , if it 's twenty miles from here it ai n't here yet . She has got to get there first ! MRS . BREAD . She expects to get there about midnight , to make it more cheerful ! NEWMAN . ( Coming down right centre to table , aghast . ) Do you mean she leaves to-night ? MRS . BREAD . In less than an hour . ( Goes to left centre . ) She has plotted it all , she 's going to drive . NEWMAN . ( Dryly . ) She 'll have to drive over me ! MRS . BREAD . Oh , you 'll feel the wheels  --  you 'll feel the hoofs ! NEWMAN . I 'll stop the horses  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family know ? MRS . BREAD . They have n't an idea . She has arranged it , in secret , successfully , and now that the moment of her flight is near she 's in a fever lest they should find her out . ( As the door on right opens . ) Here she comes ! ( Comes down side of stage , left . Re-enter MME . DE CINTR , left . Exit MRS . BREAD , left . CLAIRE stands looking at NEWMAN , he having given a shocked start at the sight of her rigid black dress , as if taking it at first for the Carmelite garb . ) CLAIRE . Do n't suffer  --  you 're too good to suffer . NEWMAN . I think it 's only those who are too good who do suffer ! CLAIRE . ( Coming to him . ) There are some whose suffering is expiation . I know I 've deceived and injured you  --  I know I 've been cowardly and cruel . I see it as vividly as you , and anything you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what I 've said of myself . NEWMAN . My angriest passion has spared you  --  it has clung to you as closely as my tenderest . But there are others whom it has n't spared  --  and whom it does n't mean to spare now ! CLAIRE . Ah , let others go  --  I 'm beyond all others ! NEWMAN . ( Bitterly . ) You seem far away indeed  --  but you 're not in heaven quite yet ! Even if you were , however , I should ask you to come down to earth , a moment , to give me a reason , a decent reason , the faintest blush of a reason ! CLAIRE . My reason is all the past  --  the inseparable , irreparable past . It calls for me ( raising her hands to her head )  --  it closes round me ! Footnote : 1Kb NEWMAN . It calls for me , too  --  and do you know what it says to me ? That you 're the victim of some unimaginable rigour , some coercion so unnatural that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  you 're mere plate-glass ! It 's not by the dead you 're haunted ; you 're haunted by the living ! CLAIRE . ( Looking at him a moment and crossing him round to right . ) Have it then that I 'm haunted  --  if that will do for a reason ! They wo n't haunt me there ! ( Pointing to the window . ) NEWMAN . In your living tomb ?  --  you stick to that ? You can speak of it with your own mild lips ? CLAIRE . I go to-night  --  I go in an hour . Farewell ! NEWMAN . ( Passing quickly between her and the lower door on left . ) Answer me a question first , and answer it in common pity . I 've read somewhere that in the old times there was a thing called the Papal interdict  --  the strongest argument of the old domineering Church . ( CLAIRE , arrested by his words , moves right . ) The old Popes used to screw it down , like a big iron roof , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky was darkened . The thistles grew in their courts , the terror grew in their hearts , and it was not till the interdict was raised that they were restored to light and reason . That 's your case to-day : ( CLAIRE drops into chair , right ) the interdict hangs over you ! The iron roof is on your head , the thistles are in your court , the dread is in your heart ! If I sweep these things utterly away , will you listen to me then ? Will you come back to me ? CLAIRE . ( Moved , her head bowed . ) What are you going to do ? NEWMAN . I 'm going to raise the interdict ! CLAIRE . ( Rising . ) You ca n't  --  you wo n't ! Do n't touch sacred things ! NEWMAN . Have they made you believe they 're sacred ? They do n't play fair ! It seems to me you practically acknowledge everything I want ! CLAIRE . I acknowledge nothing  --  for I know nothing . ( Her eyes down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandage your eyes , you stuff your ears , for fear of knowing ! ( Moves a little left . ) That makes me sure ! CLAIRE . Let me pass  --  let me pass ! NEWMAN . And this makes me strong ! ( Catching her in his arms as she tries to pass to left , he holds her for an instant in a close embrace . She breaks away  --  exit rapidly , left . Enter the MARQUIS from right . ) The Marquis ? Here 's a nuisance ! MARQUIS . ( Stopping short on seeing NEWMAN . ) You here , sir ? I had n't the pleasure of knowing it . NEWMAN . As my visit is exclusively to Madame de Cintr , I judged it superfluous to ask for you , or for Madame de Bellegarde , considering the terms on which we last parted . MARQUIS . Permit me to express a doubt as to whether my sister will see you . NEWMAN . Your sister has seen me , and I 'm not without the hope that she will graciously see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovering himself . ) Ah ! ( Then , swinging his eyeglass . ) You 've gained an advantage of us  --  prostrate as you find us with our dreadful bereavement ; but I 'm afraid you 're in precarious possession , Footnote : 1Kb I emerged from the appropriate seclusion of my mother 's apartments only because I thought I should find M. de Marignac , who seems to have vanished . NEWMAN . He 's on the premises  --  in case I want him , Footnote : 1Kb ( Taking his hat from table up at fireplace . ) I 'll bring him right in . MARQUIS . ( Aside , coming down while NEWMAN goes up again . ) What 's there between them  --  between Marignac and him ? ( Moving to left . Footnote : 1Kb Turns round at table , left , and aloud , in a tone he has not yet used . ) Do n't put yourself out  --  allow me the pleasure of sending a servant for M. de Marignac . NEWMAN . ( Struck by his tone and staring a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word to say to him myself . ( Aside . ) I want to tell him our prospect brightens ! ( Exit NEWMAN , rapidly , by the window , which he opens . ) MARQUIS . ( Alone . ) Why should they hang about together ? They 're as thick as thieves ! ( Enter MME . DE BELLEGARDE , right . ) MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( Going up a little , then coming right centre . ) Ah , if he 's not here , I might have spared myself the effort to meet him . MARQUIS . He is here  --  very much here ! ( Confidentially . ) I may mention to you that he strikes me as a trifle less objectionable than last week . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . When did we ever find Gaston de Marignac objectionable ? MARQUIS . Pardon my confusion  --  I thought you meant Christopher Newman ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Is Christopher Newman here ? ( Grandly , seating herself at head of table , right . ) He presumes on our desolation ! MARQUIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps ( hesitating , stammering a little and swinging his eyeglass , while he seats himself on sofa )  --  might n't we , perhaps , presume upon it a little even ourselves ? ( Watching the effect of these words on his mother . ) Remember the modifications ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . The modifications ? MARQUIS . Everything has been modified but Christopher Newman 's millions . ( Suggestively . ) They have n't , you know ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . And the fact that we loathe him and despise him  --  has that been modified ? ( The MARQUIS rises and comes down left centre ; makes a prompt movement of deprecation and retraction . ) The fact that he 's a base-born vulgar shopkeeper and that we were on the point of stooping to him , and to his abysses , and have picked ourselves up in time  --  has that been modified ? ( Rises , while the MARQUIS repeats the gestures expressing that he humbly backs down . With culminating passion . ) Let us at least hold our heads higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ! ( Goes up . ) MARQUIS . ( Aside . ) I see  --  that 's settled ! Well , it 's a comfort to settle it  --  it 's the shifting that tells on me ! ( Re-enter MARIGNAC and NEWMAN by the window , a portion of which has remained open . ) MARIGNAC . ( Right centre . ) Good evening , Madame . I arrived an hour ago , to give two persons two mementoes which your lamented son put into my hand for them in the last hour of his life . One of these touching remembrances was for your daughter , to whom I 've delivered it ; the other was for Mrs. Bread  --  NEWMAN . ( Right , interrupting . ) To whom I 've delivered it ! MARQUIS . ( To NEWMAN . ) You 've made good use of your time ! NEWMAN . I hope to make still better ! ( Goes up . ) MARQUIS . ( Left , to MARIGNAC . ) And my brother handed you ( hesitating ) no touching remembrance for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And none for his mother ? MARIGNAC . ( Putting his hat on table , right . ) Nothing . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( Aside to MARQUIS . ) Idiot ! MARQUIS . ( Uncertain , aside , to MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ) Do you mean Valentin ? MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( Aside . ) I mean you ! ( MARQUIS goes up and round to centre . Aloud , to MARIGNAC . ) If your extraordinary association with Mr. Newman permits you to give her a moment , a deeply afflicted mother would be glad to ask you a few questions . NEWMAN . ( Aside , to MARIGNAC , coming right of MARQUIS . ) Look out , she wants to square you ! ( Aloud . ) I would offer to retire , Madame , and leave you free to see Monsieur de Marignac on this spot , were it not that just on this spot I presently have a very particular appointment . ( Goes up . ) MARQUIS . ( To MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ) He indulges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round to door , right . ) MME . DE BELLEGARDE . Another ? Monsiur de Marignac , will you please to pass into my boudoir ? ( NEWMAN comes down centre . MARIGNAC bows somewhat inexpressively , takes up hat and exit right , the MARQUIS holding open the door . MME . DE BELLEGARDE crosses to right , then continues , to NEWMAN . ) You 've seen her then ? NEWMAN . Yes , and I 'm waiting to see her again . MME . DE BELLEGARDE . ( After an instant ) I think you 'll wait long ! ( Exit MME . DE BELLEGARDE , right . ) MARQUIS . ( To NEWMAN , looking at his watch . ) We ca n't allow you all night , you know ! NEWMAN . ( Looking at his own . ) Allow me a quarter of an hour ! ( Exit MARQUIS , right . Alone . ) I told Marignac to work them up , and ( as the door of MME .

I shall giveFootnote : 1Kb you strange things , sir , and after I 've spoken , this house will be no place for me . I shall have to leave it on the instant . NEWMAN .

( Interrupting . ) Praise be to the Highest  --  she 'll marry me ! MRS . BREAD . It will take longer than that ! One sees you 're an American . NEWMAN . One sees you ai n't ! It wo n't take longer than you take , I guess ! MRS . BREAD . Well , then ! ( On the point of speaking she stops again and looks round her . She rises , then goes right , and stands listening a moment at the door . ) NEWMAN . ( Impatient . ) Oh , they 're all right  --  Marignac 's looking after them ! MRS .

I have the precious proof  --  his own declaration , on his deathbed , when , the hour before he passed away in misery , he accused and denounced them . Footnote : 1Kb He wrote it down  --  he signed it ! NEWMAN . ( Incredulous . ) When he was dying ? MRS . BREAD . I held him up on the pillow , and the God of justice gave him strength .

She had had money from him , and to the best of her ability she had made it up to him in money 's worth ! But he taught her that her debt would hang over her head till she had given him her helpless child . NEWMAN . ( Attentive , horrified . ) Ah , the infamous scoundrels ! No wonder Madame de Cintr takes life hard ! MRS . BREAD . Her father tried to save her , but he was beaten  --  he was ill . My lady spent half a night in his room  --  a bitter winter 's night .

( Snapping his fingers . ) MRS . BREAD . The eye that would look through my lady , in the light of that grim paper , would be a very different one . The eye of a certain society ! NEWMAN . What society ? MRS . BREAD . The grand particular world that surrounds her  --  for which she keeps up appearances . NEWMAN . The grand particular world to which , last week , she made such a grand particular fool of me ? MRS . BREAD . The only world she recognises or considers or fears ! NEWMAN .

DE BELLEGARDE staggers back , catching at chair . ) Your face tells me it is n't waste paper ! MME . DE BELLEGARDE . It 's the stupidest of forgeries . NEWMAN . Oh , not the stupidest !

She never gave you happier advice ! CLAIRE . Why then has she gone ? NEWMAN . Because she 's a woman of tact .

Used by permission of Oxford University Press , Inc.  --   --   --   - -  @@2625 EDITOR 'S FOREWORD DISENGAGED " The idea on which Disengaged mainly reposes was supplied the author by a little story of his own , " Henry James wrote in his prefatory note to the first series of Theatricals . The story was The Solution , published by him in three issues of the New Review ( December 1889 , January and February 1890 ) and republished in The Lesson of the Master and Other Tales , 1892 . The tale had been inspired by an anecdote told James some years earlier by Fanny Kemble concerning a young and wealthy member of the diplomatic corps in Rome who was talked by some mischievous companions into believing that he had compromised a young girl and thereupon proposed to her and in due course was married to her . James developed this into a situation in which one of the companions , conscious-stricken , solicits the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple . She not only performs the disengagement but falls in love with the young man and marries him herself . In the play , which he described as his first attempt at a " comedy , pure and simple , " James moved the setting to England , and altered the names of the characters from those of the story , seeking to evoke the spirit and humor  --  if not the morality  --  of a Restoration comedy . He wrote it either late in 1891 or early in 1892 . According to his own account , he met Ada Rehan , the American actress and star of Augustin Daly 's company , at the home of some friends during the autumn of 1891 ; she gave him a message from Daly asking him to do a play for the company in which Miss Rehan would have a leading role . In August of 1892 he read to the actress the first draft of a comedy tentatively entitled Mrs. Jasper , and she took the manuscript to Daly . The American manager wrote James that the play pleased him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was far from satisfied with it himself . " Its fault is probably fundamental and consists in the slenderness of the main motive  --  which I have tried to prop up with details that do n't really support it . " James conceded there was a lack of action " vainly dissimulated by a superabundance ( especially in the last act ) of movement . " After an interview with Daly he revised Mrs. Jasper and sent the text late in October of 1892 to him in New York . Daly accepted the play and it was agreed that James would be paid a flat fee of $25 a night . Daly was to have exclusive performance rights for five years . Settlement of these details led James to believe the play would be promptly produced in New York . Late in November 1892 , however , Daly requested further revisions . He wanted the part of Mrs. Jasper built up for Miss Rehan ; he objected to having the first act curtain fall with the actress not on the stage . He wondered whether Henry James could supply rhymed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Restoration style . James replied this was " an idea that fills me with confusion and dismay . " The novelist , however , made most of the revisions . He brought Mrs. Jasper on-stage at the end of Act I. He cut a scene in Act II between Mrs. Jasper and Coverley . He kept Coverley out of the climax of Act II in order to render Act III more dramatic . He rewrote a scene between Mrs. Jasper and Trafford . And he wrote a final speech for Mrs. Jasper which , however , does not seem to have been retained in the printed version since James described it to Daly as " a pretty , genial , graceful final speech  --  neither too short nor too long . It has  --  in intention at least  --  a kind of slight doubleness of meaning . ... Though it 's pure prose , too , I have endeavored to make it in a manner rhythmic . ... " Daly came to England in the spring , opened up his new theatre in Leicester Square , and publicly announced James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first season there . In August 1893 James went over the models of the sets with the stage designer , Joseph Harker . The account books for the season show that Daly paid Harker 11 during the week of October 23-28 " for models "  --  presumably those intended for Mrs. Jasper . The summer passed and James came up a number of times from Ramsgate to confer with Daly about the production . Meanwhile Daly 's season ran into serious difficulties . The manager discovered that the London public was attached to specific playhouses ; that when his productions had been given in established theatres they attracted the audiences of those theatres , so that now he had to win an audience for his new playhouse by slow stages . " Daly has been having a very bad season , " James wrote to his brother , " owing to the losses of his company and the blunders of his repertory  --  so that I see myself en perspective converted from a creature propped ( by his prestige  --  which I supposed I was , ) into a creature propping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only ' novelty ' with which he seems to have armed himself for his campaign in his new and beautiful theatre . ... If I ' save ' him it will be so much wind in my sails  --  and if I do n't , the explanation will be , largely , not dishonorable to me . But I long for the reality , the ingenuity and the combined amusement and disgust of rehearsals . ... " The time for rehearsal drew near . Late in October Daly re-read the play apparently with misgivings ( especially in the light of his continued waning fortunes ) and asked for some cuts and revisions . " I will go over the copy ... carefully , " James replied , " and be as heroic as I can . " Six days later James reported " utter failure . " The play seemed to him so tightly written that little could come out of it . Parallel to this came demands from Daly for a more telling title . James had first proposed Disengaged , as a substitute for Mrs. Jasper . Daly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what must have been either a burst of carefully-dissimulated anger or annoyance , or of elaborate irony , no less than sixty-four alternate titles . Daly rejected them all . Not one had the Ada Rehan role in it and Daly had sought to shape the play for her . James then responded with a dozen more titles , and Mrs. Jasper 's Way was selected by Daly , although James did not care for it . Figure : 159KB Daly had his own methods of work and his own traditions , and James , who had followed the production of The American step by step , felt himself now held at an arm 's length from his play . This may have been intentional , but we have no way of knowing what state of feeling now existed between the overeager playwright and the harassed manager . One or two readings of the play took place privately at Daly 's and the first James heard of these was a letter from Daly on December 3 , 1893 informing him that the play seemed to lack " story . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the day to be bringing it up again . " I am very sorry , not a little alarmed , " James replied , and it was settled he would attend a reading on December 6 . To Elizabeth Robins he confided " they have begun , or are just beginning , I believe , some intensely private preliminaries at Daly 's  --  which make me very uneasy . " What happened at the rehearsal we shall never completely know . We have only James 's account of it and it is charged with anger and emotion . Certain facts are clear : the actors and Daly had no confidence in the play . They read it in a manner that could only fill an author with rage . " To Ada Rehan ( white , haggard , ill-looking almost in anguish ) I could n't bring myself to speak . ... I was not given a simple second 's opportunity of having the least contact or word with any other member of the company : who began and stammeringly read their parts the instant I came in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning James wrote to Daly , " I can not for a moment profess that the scene I witnessed on your stage yesterday threw any light on the character of the play . ... " He told Daly he should have appreciated being notified sooner that the play was unsuitable and added , " Your few words of Saturday so definitely express , in spite of their brevity , or perhaps indeed by reason of the same , the sudden collapse of your own interest in it , that I withdraw it from your theatre without delay . ... " In a letter to William James , Henry bitterly suggested that Daly had stage-managed the rehearsal so as to induce him to back out . " He is an utter cad , " he wrote , " and Ada Rehan is the same . They simply kicked me between them ( and all in one ' rehearsal ' ) out of the theatre . How can one rehearse with people who are dying to get rid of you ... ? " A close reading of the correspondence between James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately staged the rehearsal as a device to get rid of his playwright . Daly replied to James that the readings of the play " however crude they may have seemed to you "  --  convinced him that the lack of a " situation " and dramatic climax could not be overcome by the actor 's art . As instance of his own good faith he reminded James of scenery under construction and of costumes ordered in Paris by Miss Rehan . James 's reply was a long , bitter recapitulation of the entire history of the negotiations . He complained that he had never had an opportunity to discuss the role of Mrs. Jasper with Miss Rehan and that Daly had not demonstrated to him the inadequacies of the play . He took a parting shot at both Daly 's unsuccessful season and Miss Rehan by expressing " the regret that the actress who has been willing to act the parts I have , for the most part , seen her act this winter , should not have been moved even to study that of the heroine of my comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of production loomed much larger in Henry James 's life than in that of Daly and there is little doubt that the " rehearsal " or reading would have more meaning for an experienced producer such as Daly than for the relatively inexperienced and , at this juncture , highly nervous James . The keenness of James 's disappointment undoubtedly contributed to the network of motivation he wove around what amounted to a typical and frequent situation in the theatre  --  that of a producer losing interest in a play . It was not likely that in the circumstances the actors would have been inspired to provide a brilliant reading . James was justified in placing high hopes in Ada Rehan 's capacity to make the most of the part he had written for her . W. Graham Robertson felt that " Miss Rehan 's brilliant artificial comedy would have lent itself marvellously to James 's dialogue , " and Bernard Shaw believed her to possess an " unrivalled charm of poetic speech . " The play was given an amateur production in New York in 1902 by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School , and in 1909 it had one professional performance , at the Hudson Theatre , in aid of a hospital . William Dean Howells attended both productions and reported on them enthusiastically to James . " The dear young ingenuous benighted things , " James replied on the occasion of the amateur production , " I could kiss them all with tears . " The critics on both occasions referred to what they termed the unemotional , heartless , unsympathetic qualities of the play : " nerveless , heartless , soulless , " said the Sun . And the Times called it " fantastic nonsense . " color=redPage 819 A NOTE ON THE TEXTS In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication , over a period of two decades , the editor was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . The corrections and emendations were such as occur in the progress of a modern play from the dramatist 's desk , through the production office into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays , nor the textual problems arising from collation , warranted such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  that is of truth , fidelity to text and to the writer 's intentions  --  while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would serve : that of demonstrating their role in Henry James 's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some producer might be caught in the process  --  provide the means for the appearance of at least some of them on the American stage . I therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of the London production , two of them from James 's own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors . It was thus possible to give the mutations of James 's first important effort in the theatre , including a variant fourth act . As regards the other plays , a simple principle was applied . Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the cuts restored ; in a few minor instances there were cuts followed by alterations and where these were in James 's hand they were accepted as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable , the alternate readings have been given . There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons ' typescripts of the play , I decided that it would be of interest to publish the text as actually performed on the stage in 1909 , which James had approved , despite a number of alterations and cuts . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed ; as the short story Covering End and in the final form it took when it reached the stage . While James went over most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's alternately referring to " Valentin " and " Valentine " are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization . In some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech ; these have been spelled out as an aid to readability . Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips 's Bibliography of the Writings of Henry James ( New York , 1930 ) , pp. 26-27 , 46-47 and 115-16 .

Main text ACT FIRST An old-fashioned lawn or small pleasance , in a slightly neglected or deserted condition , on a height or a slope , commanding , in the distance , across a valley , a little winding , shining river , with a rustic bridge which leads over to an extensive park , a part of the same property . A bright , warm day , early in the autumn , with bright October tints , the gleam of the river in the valley , the spire of a country church on the opposite uplands ; the whole making a particularly beautiful , peaceful English view . At the back , obliquely , to the right , the old grey front of a small but highly picturesque manorhouse , once of some distinction , but now more humbly tenanted , with a porch or approach of three broad semicircular stone steps .

On the hither side of the wall , on the left , a good way down and facing the wooden gate , an old stone garden bench with a highish back , mossy and picturesque , at the base of a weather-stained statue or image which is set in a high clump of shrubbery and which , with its screen of verdure , forms one side , the side nearest the audience , of a passage or exit , the short cut to the neighbouring ruins of an old abbey . SIR MONTAGU BRISKET seated on the stone bench with a newspaper in his hand , to which he gives a vague , bored , yawning attention , and several other newspapers beside him . There are three or four garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , carrying or propelling before her with difficulty a light wicker bench or settee , with a back , capable of holding two persons , and proceeds with a business-like air to get it into place , well up at the right , near the garden  --  wall , between the house and the centre . SIR MONTAGU . ( Looking up . ) Bless my soul , Flora , is there no one to help you ? MRS . WIGMORE . ( Going back for a cushion and a bright-coloured travelling rug which have been deposited on the steps of the house . ) No one but your keeper 's wife  --  she 's busy preparing tea . SIR MONTAGU . ( Going on with his paper . ) Do you mean to say we 're going to have tea ? MRS . WIGMORE . After our lunch on that precipitous slope ? ( Arranging the cushion , with little pats , on the settee , and the rug , tentatively , in combination with it . ) I mean to say that I am ! SIR MONTAGU . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing . ) And what has that to do with it ? MRS . WIGMORE . ( Trying the settee and then getting up . ) It 's a place to sit . SIR MONTAGU . There are plenty of places to sit ! MRS . WIGMORE . ( Disposing the rug in another manner . ) You 've got the best ! SIR MONTAGU . It 's a bad best , my dear . MRS . WIGMORE . That 's your own fault  --  letting this dear old place tumble to pieces . SIR MONTAGU . ( Goodhumouredly , once more going to his paper . ) Well , the pieces serve our purpose ! MRS . WIGMORE . Your wife 's purpose , yes ! SIR MONTAGU . That of coming over , with a few friends , to spend a happy day . MRS . WIGMORE . Do you find such days so happy ? SIR MONTAGU .

SIR MONTAGU . Is all that for Blandina ? MRS . WIGMORE . Is n't everything I do for Blandina ? SIR MONTAGU . You do too much , you work her too hard . MRS . WIGMORE . My dear brother , if you were a parent you 'd perhaps have parental instincts , and if you had any instincts at all you 'd perhaps open your eyes . I 'm not ashamed to keep mine fixed on certain manifestations , and it 's a pity you on your side are so blind to certain others . SIR MONTAGU . ( Trying to follow . ) Do you allude to the manifestations of my political opponents ? MRS . WIGMORE . Bother your political opponents ! SIR MONTAGU . That 's exactly what I try to do ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Breaking in . ) What I want you to see is something you wo n't see in the Times ! You have opponents who are not political  --  though they 're profound enough , no doubt .

Take me somewhere  --  to the ruins . SIR MONTAGU . The formidable persons you describe ? Let me face them at least ! MRS . WIGMORE . I mean Blandina and her worshipper . SIR MONTAGU . Have you succeeded in making her the object of a cult ? MRS . WIGMORE . Captain Prime 's devotion has assumed a character not for a moment to be mistaken . SIR MONTAGU . Since when ? I have n't seen him at Brisket . MRS . WIGMORE . You 'll see him there to-morrow ! SIR MONTAGU . Having provided him with an idol , you expect him to go to the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blameless life , though he is in the Guards ; and he has a decent income , though he is a younger son .

( Disappointed , seeing LADY BRISKET accompanied by PERCY TRAFFORD . ) But it 's not my pair , it 's your pair ! SIR MONTAGU . Well , then , come to the ruins . MRS . WIGMORE . You need n't take me  --  the ruins are here . SIR MONTAGU . ( Blank . ) Here ? MRS . WIGMORE . The ruins of your domestic security !

( To her husband . ) I 'm having immense fun with Mr. Trafford  --  I 'm giving him lessons ! SIR MONTAGU . ( Watching TRAFFORD , who is rather awkwardly setting up the camera on its tall supports . ) Is photography a branch now required in the diplomatic service ? TRAFFORD . ( Gay . ) Dear Sir Montagu , there 's a standing rule in the diplomatic service : learn everything you can from the ladies ! LADY BRISKET . I must have an assistant , and I 'm bound to say Mr. Trafford 's a very good one . TRAFFORD . ( Coming down . ) It seems , on Lady Brisket 's part , a veritable mania . SIR MONTAGU . The infatuation of an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A new infatuation perhaps , but ( smiling devotedly at LADY BRISKET ) not , I hope , a new assistant ! LADY BRISKET .

WIGMORE ) , side by side . MRS . WIGMORE . ( To herself , struck ; seeing at the right CAPTAIN PRIME and BLANDINA . ) " Side by side " ? That 'll do for them ! ( Enter from the right by the wooden gate CAPTAIN PRIME and BLANDINA , while MRS . WIGMORE continues eagerly to LADY BRISKET . ) I do n't think I 'm in your style of art .

( Sharp . ) Then why are you dangling after married women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly complimentary . ) Dear madam , are you unconscious of their attraction ? LADY BRISKET . ( With her prepared plate , to TRAFFORD . ) Here 's the plate ; make everything ready . SIR MONTAGU . ( To his wife , while TRAFFORD , who has taken the plate , goes and gets under the voluminous cloth which covers the camera . ) And then the results are called yours ? LADY BRISKET . We 'll call these ours ! SIR MONTAGU . ( Looking at her a moment , then turning his back ; dry . ) Thank you ; I 'm out of it ! ( He meets CAPTAIN PRIME , with whom he stands talking . ) MRS . WIGMORE . ( Down on the left . ) Blandina , come here ! BLANDINA . ( Instantly coming . ) Yes , mamma . MRS . WIGMORE . Try not to look dreadful . BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . MRS . WIGMORE . Stick in that hairpin ; you 're going to be taken . BLANDINA . ( With her hands at her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep down your hands . BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . MRS . WIGMORE .

You must make him . Where were you going with him ? BLANDINA . ( Dropping her eyes . ) To the ruins . MRS . WIGMORE . You 'll go to the ruins afterwards . BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . MRS . WIGMORE . Visit them thoroughly . Do you remember their history ? BLANDINA . No , mamma . MRS . WIGMORE . One of the most celebrated sanctuaries of the Middle Ages ; begun in the eleventh century , terminated in the fourteenth . BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . MRS . WIGMORE .

WIGMORE . Oh no , not now : we 'll go to the dairy . SIR MONTAGU . What did you mean about Amy ? MRS . WIGMORE . ( Down on the right . ) And her " assistant " ? ( Very sarcastic . ) It 's a new name ! SIR MONTAGU . ( After an instant . ) A new name for what ? MRS . WIGMORE . ( Passing out of the wooden gate . ) I 'll tell you at the dairy . SIR MONTAGU .

( Exeunt SIR MONTAGU and MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to BLANDINA , who has disposed herself as attractively as possible on the settee . ) I think we can do something with you , Miss Wigmore , if you 'll assume a cheerful expression of face . BLANDINA . ( Smiling seductively . ) Captain Prime ! PRIME . ( His face to the stone bench , with his newspaper , without turning round . ) Miss Wigmore ? BLANDINA . Have you ever been taken ? PRIME . Taken ? I 've been pursued , but I 've never been captured . TRAFFORD . ( Busy with the apparatus . ) Oh , we 'll capture you now  --  I warn you we never miss ! Miss Wigmore , keep extraordinarily still . BLANDINA . ( Agitating herself . ) Then Captain Prime must keep still too  --  he fidgets me so ! TRAFFORD . ( Reproachful . ) My dear Captain , do n't fidget Miss Wigmore . PRIME . ( In the same position . ) I 'm not dreaming of Miss Wigmore ; I 'm half a mile away . LADY BRISKET .

LADY BRISKET . ( Encouraging . ) And where did Miss Wigmore take you ? PRIME . ( Casual , vague . ) Oh , I do n't know  --  all over the place . LADY BRISKET . And did you come across Mrs. Jasper ? PRIME . No , I wish we had . ( Expressively , invidiously . ) Mrs. Jasper 's attractive ! LADY BRISKET . ( After an instant . ) So all you gentlemen seem to think . PRIME . She 's so enviable , in her freedom . LADY BRISKET . Her freedom is the freedom of a woman who has lost her husband early . PRIME . ( Laughing . ) Better late than never ! LADY BRISKET . There are always the husbands of others . Mine is particularly devoted to her , and has a convenient theory that she 's my best and oldest friend . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PRIME . Sir Montagu has a rival . We met Charles Coverley . LADY BRISKET . Of course Charles Coverley was looking for her . PRIME . He asked eagerly if we 'd seen her . LADY BRISKET .

JASPER by the great gate from the right . To MRS . JASPER . ) I must see about tea . Please to control Captain Prime ! ( Exit LADY BRISKET to the house . ) MRS . JASPER . ( To PRIME , smiling and coming down with her finger in a sketch-book that she carries . ) You belong to a species that is usually beyond my control ! PRIME .

But now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps only the redeeming ones . PRIME . It 's very kind of you to look at me more attentively ! MRS . JASPER . You see that if I 'm to do what Lady Brisket asks , I must exert the power of my eye . PRIME . You 're happy to have so many powers to exert ! MRS . JASPER . Do n't begin on that principle , or I shall think you do belong to the species ! ( After an instant , explaining . ) I mean the species of Mr. Coverley . ( Looking round her . ) And of Mr. Trafford . ( Then after another moment . ) And even of poor dear Sir Montagu . PRIME . ( Smiling . ) I know what you mean now ! Sir Montagu is n't here . MRS . JASPER .

( Who during this and the foregoing dialogue has been trying with BLANDINA different attitudes , different distances and focuses . ) Captain Prime , come and keep Miss Wigmore quiet . Her head goes up and down like a dinner-bell . PRIME . ( Plaintive . ) To call me to dinner ! ( With a gesture of desperation he goes up while TRAFFORD comes down ; but , to keep away from BLANDINA , he gets under the cloth of the camera and remains during the next dialogue focussing other objects . ) TRAFFORD .

JASPER and notes her husband 's marked attitude of appeal ; to counteract which MRS . JASPER gaily calls across to her . ) Amy dear , I 'm coming in for tea ! LADY BRISKET . ( Ironical . ) Pray do n't hurry , darling ! ( Exit LADY BRISKET to the house . ) SIR MONTAGU . ( Drawing MRS . JASPER down again . ) That 's just what I want  --  that you should speak to her . MRS . JASPER . What do you wish me to say ? SIR MONTAGU . That I justly resent her behaviour . MRS . JASPER . ( Vague . ) Her behaviour ? SIR MONTAGU . Do n't pretend , in your good-nature , not to have observed it ! MRS . JASPER . ( After a moment . ) Amy justly resents yours , Sir Montagu . SIR MONTAGU . ( Blank . ) Mine ? MRS . JASPER . Your propensity to draw me into corners , and ( as he still detains her ) to contend with me there ! SIR MONTAGU . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created . MRS . JASPER . Is your view of this situation the result of your interview with Mrs. Wigmore ? SIR MONTAGU . Flora deemed it her duty to speak to me  --  she 's jealous of the family honour . MRS . JASPER . ( After a pause , during which SIR MONTAGU continues the importunate pressure of the arm by which he has forced her to seat herself again . ) Does the family honour demand ( looking down at her arm ) that you should appropriate so much of my arm ?

As much as you 're compromising Lady Brisket ? TRAFFORD . ( Arrested , blank . ) Who put such stuff into your head ? COVERLEY . I see what I see . TRAFFORD . I do n't then !

I shall take you to the station to-morrow , but I should like to know first what you mean about the Captain . TRAFFORD . I simply mean that the Captain must offer marriage to Miss Wigmore . If you want to know why , go and look at that plate . COVERLEY . What 's the matter with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out beautifully ! When a gentleman presents himself to the recording angel , as I may call it , with a young lady 's head on his bosom , he creates expectations that must be definitely met ! He gives a pledge . The Captain evidently recognises that : he 's following the pledge up ! COVERLEY . ( Rather impressed , but reflecting . ) Following it up ? TRAFFORD . At the ruins . ( Looking at his watch . ) They 're not staying there for nothing . COVERLEY . Oh , they 'll soon come back ! TRAFFORD . Unless they 're ashamed of the comment they 've excited ! COVERLEY . You ought to destroy the plate . TRAFFORD . Not for the world ! I shall obtain a fine clear impression of it , on the exhibition of which the Captain will face the music . COVERLEY . Do you mean he 'll propose ? TRAFFORD . Certainly  --  he 'll redeem his pledge . COVERLEY . He must believe in his pledge first . TRAFFORD . He can be made to believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ? TRAFFORD . ( After an instant . ) You , my dear fellow . COVERLEY . Thank you ! Why should I play him such a trick ? TRAFFORD . Because he knows you  --  he looks up to you  --  he 'll mind what you say . COVERLEY . All the more reason I should n't say what I ought n't ! You mind what I say  --  that 'll do ! ( Going up . ) TRAFFORD . ( Ironical . ) Have you seen Mrs. Jasper ? COVERLEY . ( Stopping short . ) Is that your way of insinuating that she asked me to speak to you ? TRAFFORD . I 'm much obliged to her for her interest ! COVERLEY . Mrs. Jasper 's interest is in Lady Brisket . TRAFFORD . I see ! And yours is in Mrs. Jasper . That 's the vicious circle ! COVERLEY . Exactly ; and it 's why I should be delighted if I could get you to leave Lady Brisket alone . TRAFFORD . ( After an instant . ) I 'll accommodate you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way I spoke of just now . ( Then as COVERLEY appears not to follow . ) If you 'll give Miss Wigmore a lift ! COVERLEY . What profit will you derive from Miss Wigmore 's elevation ? TRAFFORD . It will make Lady Brisket happy ! COVERLEY . ( Laughing . ) Ah , your particular conception of Lady Brisket 's happiness is just what we do n't want ! TRAFFORD . What conception , particular or general , could be more innocent ? If Mrs. Jasper takes an interest in Lady Brisket , Lady Brisket takes an interest in her niece . The girl 's a martyr , with her terrible mother , and Lady Brisket would give everything to see her relieved . Prime 's the man to relieve her , if it can only be made to come home to him . I say , Coverley , make it , and I 'll let you lecture me by the hour ! COVERLEY . " Make " it is easily said ! You talk as if I were one of the fellows who make rabbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got such a light hand ! Try a few hynotic passes  --  an appeal to his higher feelings . COVERLEY . Questionable practices ! What shall I gain by them ? TRAFFORD . Calculate and see ! You 'll gain by them that Blandina will gain , that Lady Brisket will gain by Blandina 's gain , and that Mrs. Jasper , whom you want to gratify , will gain by Lady Brisket 's . You 'll be able immediately to say to Mrs. Jasper  --  COVERLEY . ( Interrupting . ) " That archhumbug says he 'll listen to me " ? But what if you do n't listen ? TRAFFORD . I give you my honour I will ! ( Coaxingly . ) My dear boy , I am listening  --  I have listened ! If you 'll put it into my power to demonstrate to Lady Brisket that I persuaded you to throw your weight into the scale , I 'll ( thinking a moment ) take myself off on the spot . The words I mention will constitute on my part a disinterested , an exemplary farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jasper does me the honour to think so , Mrs. Jasper will rejoice in my departure , and it will all be a good note for yourself . COVERLEY . ( As if half persuaded . ) When will you go ? TRAFFORD . ( Scratching his head an instant . ) When will the Captain do his part ? COVERLEY . Well  --  say it comes off to-night . TRAFFORD . Then I 'll go to-morrow . COVERLEY . ( Still sceptical . ) Why should I believe you ? TRAFFORD . Because I 've never deceived you . COVERLEY . Diplomatist ! But it wo n't come off to-night . TRAFFORD . ( With resolution . ) Then I wo n't go to-morrow ! ( As LADY BRISKET reappears ; with intention and calculation . ) So much the better ; she 's too good to lose ! ( Re-enter LADY BRISKET from the house . ) LADY BRISKET .

Your result ? ( Having gone up to the house ; from the steps . ) I can at least pronounce on your process ! LADY BRISKET . ( Preoccupied , resentful . ) Montagu hates me  --  my life 's a burden ! TRAFFORD . ( With ardent sympathy . ) Let me help you to carry the load ! ( Re-enter MRS . JASPER by the great gate from the right . ) MRS . JASPER . ( To herself , as she hears him . ) They 're a Mutual Aid Society ! ( To the others . ) I 've spoiled my picture  --  I 'm sick of life ! LADY BRISKET . So am I ! TRAFFORD . ( To MRS . JASPER . ) It 's not because she has spoiled her picture ! Do go and see how it has come out . MRS . JASPER . Ca n't you bring it to me ? TRAFFORD . It wo n't bear daylight . MRS . JASPER . ( Looking round her at the fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How shall I find it in the dark ?

I suppose he walked home . LADY BRISKET . And what became of Flora ? TRAFFORD . Let us hope she did the same . LADY BRISKET . ( As SIR MONTAGU and MRS . WIGMORE reappear . ) No such luck !

WIGMORE . ( Imperious . ) Have it out on the spot ! BLANDINA . ( Vague . ) On what spot ? MRS . WIGMORE . ( Looking about ; then indicating the house . ) Find one in there ! BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . MRS . WIGMORE . Confront him with the picture . BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . ( Exit BLANDINA to the house . ) LADY BRISKET . ( To MRS . WIGMORE , while COVERLEY and TRAFFORD remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . WIGMORE . ( Mistrustful . ) And leave you to frisk ? LADY BRISKET . Dear Flora , I 'll go with you . MRS . WIGMORE . ( Indicating PRIME . ) And what will become of that person ? LADY BRISKET . They 'll send him into the house . ( To the others . ) Excuse us , gentlemen ; we 're going to the old garden . MRS . WIGMORE . To gather some lavender . ( Exeunt MRS . WIGMORE and LADY BRISKET by the wooden gate , which TRAFFORD opens for them . ) TRAFFORD . ( Coming back to PRIME , who is at the right while COVERLEY is at the left . ) My dear fellow , you have roused the tigress ! PRIME . ( Startled . ) The tigress ? COVERLEY . Did n't you see how she packed her charming cub into the cage ? She dissimulates for the moment , so as not to make the matter worse by a public scene . TRAFFORD . That 's why Lady Brisket has dragged her off . COVERLEY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montagu and Mrs. Jasper fled before the storm . COVERLEY . Poor Miss Wigmore bowed her head . PRIME . ( More and more blank , looking from one of his companions to the other . ) Bowed it ? TRAFFORD . To the maternal thunder . COVERLEY . You 'll hear from her to-morrow . PRIME . From Miss Wigmore ? COVERLEY . From Miss Wigmore 's mamma . Jupiter tonans ! TRAFFORD . It was a bad quarter of an hour . COVERLEY . The minutes were little blushing ages ! PRIME . ( Bewildered . ) The minutes ? What minutes ? TRAFFORD . Those of your abandonment . PRIME . Abandonment to what ? COVERLEY . ( Laughing . ) Would it be discreet of us to specify ? PRIME . ( With growing distress . ) Tell me at least what you mean ! TRAFFORD . Do you pretend it does n't come home to you ? PRIME . Home ? I do n't understand ! COVERLEY . Is n't the situation plain ? PRIME . ( Stupefied . ) Plain ? COVERLEY . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a scandal ! PRIME . ( Aghast . ) A scandal ? Such as they talk about at the clubs ? TRAFFORD . Or publish in the papers . From the moment you were so carried away by your feelings  --  PRIME . ( Distracted , indignant . ) Feelings ? I have no feelings ! COVERLEY . ( Reproachful , edifying . ) Does n't it occur to you that that poor girl may have ? TRAFFORD . She 'll have a few when she finds she 's compromised ! PRIME . ( To COVERLEY , appalled , appealing . ) You do n't mean to say she 's that ? COVERLEY . ( For TRAFFORD ; after looking at him a moment and then turning away and tossing down nervously a cigarette . ) Hang it  --  it 's beyond me ! TRAFFORD . ( To PRIME , more soothing . ) Fortunately there 's an easy way out . PRIME . An " easy " way ? TRAFFORD . Easy for your honour . When you 've excited expectations  --  PRIME . ( Breathless , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , you must meet them . PRIME . ( Blank . ) And how in the world shall I meet them ? TRAFFORD . By marrying your victim . PRIME . ( With a despairing wail . ) Mercy of heaven ! ( Grasping the arm of COVERLEY , who , recalled by this exclamation , comes down from the detachment in which , during the previous moments , he has stood . ) Must I , on my honour ; must I ? COVERLEY . ( Faltering , hanging fire . ) Must you what ? PRIME . ( Desperately , while TRAFFORD passes round to COVERLEY 'S right and BLANDINA reappears . ) Must I make her my wife ?

You ca n't very well make her anything else ! BLANDINA . ( Still on the steps . ) Llewellyn ! PRIME . Blandina ! ( Exit BLANDINA to the house . PRIME , smiting his forehead , makes a wild dash for it and follows her in . ) TRAFFORD . ( While COVERLEY , who has gone up uneasily , stands listening near the house . ) Now of course I 'll go ! COVERLEY . ( With a reaction , already remorseful . ) Go or stay  --  I wash my hands of it ! TRAFFORD . Too late , my boy  --  they 're imbrued ! COVERLEY . ( Uneasily laughing . ) With human gore ? He wo n't come to the point . TRAFFORD . He 's coming now ! COVERLEY . ( Irritated . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear fellow , she 's a charming girl . COVERLEY . Then marry her yourself ! TRAFFORD .

( Surprised . ) Where are Lady Brisket and Mr. Trafford ? COVERLEY . ( Startled , looking round , going up as she comes down . ) Bless me  --  they 've escaped ! MRS . JASPER . ( Down at the left , disappointed , vexed . ) You do n't keep faith ! ( Re-enter , as she speaks , MRS . WIGMORE from the house . Agitated , calling across to her . ) They 've escaped ! MRS . WIGMORE . ( Radiant , jubilant , descending the steps . ) No , they have n't ! ( With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they reappear . ) Behold them ! ( Re-enter CAPTAIN PRIME and BLANDINA from the house ; PRIME , pale and breathless , coming instantly down to the left of MRS . JASPER , and BLANDINA , as he does so , arriving at the right of COVERLEY . MRS . WIGMORE , between the two couples , looks with significant satisfaction from PRIME to BLANDINA and from COVERLEY to MRS . JASPER ; then with a kind of official grandeur she goes on . ) I have the honour to announce to you a piece of news in which you 'll both rejoice  --  my daughter 's engagement to Captain Prime ! COVERLEY . ( Overwhelmed . ) Immortal gods ! ( Then agitatedly seizing MRS . WIGMORE 'S wrist . ) Is it true , Mrs. Wigmore ? MRS . WIGMORE . ( Staring at him a moment in resentful surprise ; then sarcastically to BLANDINA . ) Is it " true , " love ? BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . COVERLEY .

( Dashes confusedly , to conceal his discomposure , into the house . ) PRIME . ( Dazed , bewildered , with smothered anguish , at the extreme left , to MRS . JASPER while MRS . WIGMORE presses BLANDINA to her bosom . ) Is it true , Mrs. Jasper ? MRS . JASPER . ( Who on MRS . WIGMORE 'S announcement has given the same shocked start as COVERLEY and an ejaculation inarticulate and , while she carries her hand a moment to her heart , instantly checked , looks at him smiling intensely and with recovered self-control . Then with the lightest , gayest sarcasm . ) You ca n't believe in your happiness ? ( Looks at him another instant ; after which , laughing and with a mocking , ironical , extravagantly ceremonious curtsey . ) Let it receive from me , the first , a hearty congratulation ! ACT SECOND The hall at Brisket Place , soon after breakfast ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , in the style of the last century . Last-century portraits and other features . At the back , facing the audience , a wide window , with the small panes of the period , looking into the court . On a line with it , to the left , a double door leading through a vestibule to the court . High up to the right a double door leading to the staircase and other parts of the house . Lower down , on the left , a door leading into the so-called Red Room . Down on the right , corresponding with this , the door to the library . Down toward the left , with its back presented to the audience , a writing-table completely appointed . BLANDINA comes out of the library , meeting CHARLES COVERLEY , who bursts in from the Red Room . COVERLEY . ( Eager , feverish . ) Have you seen Mrs. Jasper ? BLANDINA . ( Surprised . ) Why , where have you come from ? COVERLEY . I 've been rushing about  --  I came in by the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not since breakfast . COVERLEY . ( Disappointed . ) You should keep her in sight ! ( Seeing TRAFFORD  --  enter PERCY TRAFFORD from the court . ) Have you seen Mrs. Jasper ? TRAFFORD . By the river , sketching . ( Complacently . ) She put me into it ! COVERLEY . ( Irritated . ) Into the river , I hope ! TRAFFORD . Into the sketch . BLANDINA . That 's a great compliment . TRAFFORD . ( Smiling . ) Oh , yes , to the sketch ! COVERLEY . ( With rueful confidence . ) Art 's her only love ! ( Hurries off to the court . ) TRAFFORD . He must want to see her  --  he left our little inn while I was still in bed . BLANDINA . ( Dropping her eyes . ) When people are in love they get up early . TRAFFORD . ( Laughing . ) Is that why Miss Wigmore 's afoot ? BLANDINA . ( Demure . ) I rose at six . TRAFFORD . I rose at seven ! But there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't here . BLANDINA . Is Captain Prime in love ? TRAFFORD . I supposed he was , or I should n't have come over at this hour to congratulate both of you on your engagement . BLANDINA . ( Raising her eyes to him . ) That 's not what you came over for  --  at this hour ! TRAFFORD . ( Surprised . ) There 's more in you , Miss Wigmore , than meets the eye . Why then did I come ? BLANDINA . To see my aunt . TRAFFORD . ( Smiling . ) Your acuteness , I confess , surprises me . But it 's a matter of course to ask Lady Brisket how she finds herself after her walk . ( Enter , as he speaks , MRS . WIGMORE from the stairs . ) MRS . WIGMORE . Spare at least the innocence of a young woman scarce affianced ! ( To BLANDINA . ) Captain Prime has n't come ? BLANDINA . No , mamma . MRS . WIGMORE . Is the Red Room empty ? BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BLANDINA . Yes , mamma . ( Exit BLANDINA to the Red Room . ) TRAFFORD . ( All urbanity . ) As I was eager to congratulate Miss Wigmore , so I 'm eager to congratulate you ! MRS . WIGMORE . ( After an instant ; incorruptible . ) Stuff and nonsense ! TRAFFORD . ( Disconcerted but conciliatory . ) I should think your impressions would reach you through the medium of your happiness . MRS . WIGMORE . Great as it is , it does n't deprive me of my senses . TRAFFORD . The more senses , Mrs. Wigmore , the more sympathies . MRS . WIGMORE . And the more sympathies , I suppose , the more scandals . You must have been sympathetic last night ! TRAFFORD . ( Blank . ) Last night ? MRS . WIGMORE . While we were waiting for you  --  blushing for you . TRAFFORD . Blushing ? MRS . WIGMORE . Keeping the dinner till ten o'clock , with the Stoners and the Spicers looking at each other . TRAFFORD . ( With hopeless gaiety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at you ! We were indeed a little late : we found our walk so beguiling . MRS . WIGMORE . That was Amy 's remarkable expression . TRAFFORD . Dear Mrs. Wigmore , you 're not grateful . MRS . WIGMORE . Grateful for what ? TRAFFORD . For your extraordinary windfall . I mean you 're not indulgent . MRS . WIGMORE . To criminal frivolity , to public indecorum ? Why should I be ? TRAFFORD . You exaggerate awfully . MRS . WIGMORE . As the fireman exaggerates when he plays the hose ! TRAFFORD . ( With futile mirth . ) Oh , I shall not resist a stream of water ! I shall go next month . MRS . WIGMORE . Why not next year ? Every hour that you stay she 'll pay for . TRAFFORD . ( Pleading . ) Ah , do n't say that ! MRS . WIGMORE . She 'll pay for this . TRAFFORD . ( Vague . ) This ? MRS . WIGMORE . Your being here now . TRAFFORD . ( With a change of tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; here she comes to do it ! ( Enter LADY BRISKET from the Red Room . ) LADY BRISKET . ( While she nods to TRAFFORD . ) Flora , darling , you 'll be pleased to know that Captain Prime has turned up . TRAFFORD . ( Warningly . ) Oh , Mrs. Wigmore takes her pleasure sadly ! MRS . WIGMORE . I take it as some others would be the better for taking theirs  --  modestly ! ( Then to LADY BRISKET , indicating the Red Room with her thumb . ) Is he in there ? LADY BRISKET . I met him at the door and showed him in myself . MRS . WIGMORE . Then I wo n't intrude . LADY BRISKET . Do n't miss him  --  he may show himself out . MRS . WIGMORE . ( At the door of the Red Room , listening ; then quickly opening it . ) Captain ! ( Exit rapidly MRS . WIGMORE . ) TRAFFORD . That 's no use  --  she 's awful . LADY BRISKET . Awful enough to him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a diversion till you get off . TRAFFORD . Dear friend , do you banish me ? LADY BRISKET . Montagu insists on it . We had a fearful battle . TRAFFORD . Last night , when you came back ? LADY BRISKET . On this spot , after every one had gone . He says the Stoners and the Spicers will do for me . TRAFFORD . ( Blank . ) Do what for you ? LADY BRISKET . Bruit it abroad  --  our belated , our beautiful walk . TRAFFORD . What matters , since it was beautiful ? We must have another . LADY BRISKET . Not at present . You must leave the place . TRAFFORD . ( Insisting . ) If I go up to London we 'll have one there . LADY BRISKET . ( Vague . ) In Oxford Street ? TRAFFORD . In Kensington Gardens , in Battersea Park . ( Suggestive . ) You 'll join me for a day . LADY BRISKET . Not for a minute . TRAFFORD . ( Pleading . ) It will be our good-bye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So inadequate , so brief ? LADY BRISKET . Make it briefer : catch the train ! TRAFFORD . I 'll go back to the inn to see to my things . But I 'll return for another word . LADY BRISKET . You wo n't get it . TRAFFORD . For another look , then  --  an hour hence . LADY BRISKET . Montagu 's coming  --  go , go ! ( She hurries him to the door to the court , urging him off . He snatches one of her hands , to kiss it ; then exit quickly to the court . LADY BRISKET comes down as her husband appears at the door of the library . ) ( Enter SIR MONTAGU from the library , dressed for a ride ; with his hat on and pulling on his gloves . ) SIR MONTAGU . Before I go out , there 's another point I should like to make clear . LADY BRISKET . Another ? That will make about the fiftieth ! SIR MONTAGU . To match the number of your indiscretions ! What I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely general assurance that Mr. Trafford will absent himself from our neighbourhood . LADY BRISKET . Should you like a witnessed paper ? SIR MONTAGU . I should like a distinct pledge that during the next few days he will have placed the breadth of Europe between us . LADY BRISKET . Between you and me ? SIR MONTAGU . Between himself and our distracted home ! As many miles as it may be to Copenhagen . LADY BRISKET . ( After a silence . ) If I 'm to go into these refinements , it will be necessary for me to meet Mr. Trafford . SIR MONTAGU . You can acquit yourself perfectly by a note  --  you have plenty of servants to carry one . LADY BRISKET . If I may not transact the business with decent courtesy I decline to transact it at all . SIR MONTAGU . ( Buttoning his glove . ) There are many things more decent than your courtesy ! LADY BRISKET . Your language , for instance ? SIR MONTAGU . Amy  --  I do n't trust you . LADY BRISKET . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting CHARLES COVERLEY , who re-enters on the rush from the court . ) COVERLEY . ( Panting . ) Have you seen Mrs. Jasper ? LADY BRISKET . Ask my husband ! COVERLEY . ( To SIR MONTAGU . ) Have you seen Mrs. Jasper ? SIR MONTAGU . Unfortunately not . COVERLEY . ( Indicating suggestively the Red Room . ) Would she be in there ? LADY BRISKET . By no means . COVERLEY . ( Indicating suggestively the library . ) Would she be in there ? SIR MONTAGU . She was n't just now . COVERLEY . ( Embarrassed . ) She has such a talent for hiding ! LADY BRISKET . You have n't Sir Montagu 's talent for finding her ! SIR MONTAGU . ( Indicating the library . ) She may have passed in since . COVERLEY . ( At the door of the library . ) I 'll just look . SIR MONTAGU . There 's a suite of rooms beyond  --  look further . COVERLEY . Thank you , Sir Montagu . ( Exit COVERLEY to the library . ) SIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were a railway station . LADY BRISKET . He 's always missing the train ! SIR MONTAGU . ( In thought a moment longer , with his eyes on his wife , while he finishes button his glove . ) Write to that fellow austerely . Do you understand ? ( Exit SIR MONTAGU to the court . ) LADY BRISKET . ( Alone . ) I understand ! I 'll write to him , but I 'll deliver the letter ! ( Enter from the Red Room MRS . JASPER , with several letters in her hand . ) MRS . JASPER . I came in that way , but I 'm not wanted ! LADY BRISKET . Is Flora there ? MRS . JASPER . Marching up and down outside . LADY BRISKET . So as to leave Blandina free ? MRS . JASPER . To make eyes at Captain Prime ! LADY BRISKET . And whom are you going to make eyes at ? MRS . JASPER . ( Smiling , goodhumoured , holding up her letters . ) My correspondents ! But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've dragged myself home to catch the midday post . LADY BRISKET . I 'll leave it to your correspondents to praise you . You seem to have enough ! MRS . JASPER . ( Counting her letters . ) One , two , three , four , nine ! But they wo n't all " praise " me , I can assure you . LADY BRISKET . Are you going to be very severe ? MRS . JASPER . Inordinately ! LADY BRISKET . You keep your severity for your letters . MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant , smiling . ) Try to do the same , my dear , with yours ! LADY BRISKET . I have something odious to write . I 'll do it in the library . MRS . JASPER . Then may I write here ? LADY BRISKET . Certainly . ( After an instant . ) It 's a good place for your other friends to find you . MRS . JASPER . ( With a little comical wail . ) Ah , do n't tell me they 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the library . ) There 's one of them here that I 'll send you . ( Exit LADY BRISKET . ) MRS . JASPER . ( Alone . ) " One of them " ? Sir Montagu ?  --  I 'll send him straight back to her ! ( At the writing-table , seeing COVERLEY : re-enter CHARLES COVERLEY from the library . ) I 'm sorry to see you , but you might be worse ! COVERLEY . ( Breathless . ) Do you fully realise what has happened to the Captain ? MRS . JASPER . ( Vague . ) The Captain ? COVERLEY . The unfortunate , the miserable Prime ! MRS . JASPER . Oh , his engagement ! ( After an instant . ) " Fully realise " it ? Mrs. Wigmore would box my ears if I did n't ! COVERLEY . Box hers ! It 's too awful ! MRS . JASPER . ( Occupying herself at the writing-table . ) Awful for whom ? COVERLEY . Why for me ! MRS . JASPER . Do you want Blandina for yourself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . JASPER . ( Getting settled at her letters . ) Ah , do n't make love to me ! COVERLEY . You 're clever , you 're ingenious , you 're sympathetic , you 're benevolent . MRS . JASPER . Do n't  --  I beseech you ! COVERLEY . Therefore you must interfere . MRS . JASPER . Do you call that benevolent ? COVERLEY . It would be to me . MRS . JASPER . What have you to do with it ? COVERLEY . Everything ! MRS . JASPER . ( Blank , writing . ) Everything ? COVERLEY . More than enough for remorse . I drove him to it , I made him believe it was his duty . MRS . JASPER . ( Gay . ) Well , perhaps it was ! COVERLEY . I 'll be hanged if it was ! MRS . JASPER . Then why did you tell him so ? COVERLEY . To please you  --  to make you like me . MRS . JASPER . It does nothing of the sort ! COVERLEY . Of course it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore you must just undo my work . MRS . JASPER . Thank you  --  I must do my own ! COVERLEY . You must invent something ; you must help me . MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) I must simply understand you  --  first ! COVERLEY . It happened last evening , after you and Sir Montagu went home . Trafford and I were there with the deluded being , and we convinced him that by their long dawdle at the ruins , after dark , you know , he had fatally compromised that girl . MRS . JASPER . ( Astonished , amused . ) Compromised Blandina ? What a funny idea ! COVERLEY . So it seemed to me then ; but in this morning 's light  --  the cold , hard light of reality  --  it 's simply dreadful . You told me to talk to Trafford , to get him to go away . I obeyed your commands , and he promised me he 'd go if I would help him to pacify Mrs. Wigmore , who , as you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way to pacify her was to bribe her , and the way to bribe her was to make the poor Captain propose to her daughter . Trafford gave me his word he would go if I would bring on this event . I had only your wishes in mind ; so , in spite of the difficulty , which was immense , I did bring it on . MRS . JASPER . But Mr. Trafford has n't gone . COVERLEY . That 's his look-out ! I exerted myself . MRS . JASPER . To what purpose , pray , since , within the hour , he was to expose poor Amy to such comments ? COVERLEY . The comments are your affair , if you helped to make them . I only went too far for you . MRS . JASPER . Yes ( impatiently , looking over her papers ) how could you be such a noodle ? COVERLEY . An opprobrious name is all my thanks ? MRS . JASPER . You must look for your thanks to Blandina . COVERLEY . Blandina be dashed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent friend . MRS . JASPER . How could he be such a noodle ? COVERLEY . He is n't a noodle , he 's a snow-white lamb . You should have seen him when he fixed his blue eyes on me and bleated : " For my honour , for hers , must I ? " MRS . JASPER . The honour of a lamb  --  it 's too lovely ! COVERLEY . I feel as if I 'd sent him to the butcher . MRS . JASPER . Your comparison is rude to Blandina , She 's an estimable girl . COVERLEY . She is n't a girl , she 's a parrot . The Captain loathes her . MRS . JASPER . Then how could he attach her for life ? COVERLEY . Because he 's a hero . MRS . JASPER . To be eaten with mint-sauce ? He should be kept at least for mutton ! COVERLEY . We must save him , we must get him off . And you must find a way . MRS . JASPER . ( Taking up her pen again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters to write . COVERLEY . Yesterday you asked me a favour ; to-day I ask you one . MRS . JASPER . Ah , they 're not equal ! COVERLEY . This one 's the easiest . You wanted me to interfere for Lady Brisket , who 's a silly woman . I want you to interfere for Llewellyn Prime , who 's a brave man . MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) If he 's so awfully brave why do n't you leave him to his fate ? COVERLEY . Because his fate 's horrid and his character noble . MRS . JASPER . ( Rising after an instant ; then by degrees quitting the table . ) Is he so extraordinarily nice ? COVERLEY . You 've seen him yourself . MRS . JASPER . Only a few times . COVERLEY . Then do n't you like him ? MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) Yes , he lets me alone ! ( After another moment . ) He must be quite original . COVERLEY . To let you alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I mean with his fastidious sense of honour . Most men have none at all . COVERLEY . He 's different from most men ; he 's a preux chevalier , a knight of romance . MRS . JASPER . I see , he 's a type . I 'm rather interested in types . ( After an instant . ) Why do n't you go to him and tell him frankly you made a fool of him ? COVERLEY . That would only commit me the more to save him . MRS . JASPER . Let alone that he might knock you down ! Then go to Blandina . COVERLEY . Who in that case would save me ? MRS . JASPER . Go to Mrs. Wigmore . COVERLEY . ( Seeing MRS . WIGMORE . ) I need n't . ( Re-enter MRS . WIGMORE for the Red Room . ) MRS . WIGMORE . ( Who has paused a moment , sternly and suspiciously , at the sight of the others , and then advanced majestically , passing in front of them and looking at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JASPER . ( Gay , going back to her table . ) Do n't mention it ! MRS . WIGMORE . I left Lady Brisket here , and I left Mr. Trafford . COVERLEY . ( Irritated at the interruption ; as MRS . WIGMORE looks round . ) They 're not under the sofa ! MRS . WIGMORE . May I presume to inquire what has become of them ? MRS . JASPER . I happen to know that Amy 's in the library . MRS . WIGMORE . Alone ? MRS . JASPER . Alone . ( Then , as MRS . WIGMORE stands looking at her searchingly , as if to challenge this statement . ) If you do n't believe me , you can go and see . MRS . WIGMORE . ( Back at the door of the Red Room . ) I never impose an unappreciated presence . ( Exit MRS . WIGMORE . ) MRS . JASPER . ( Laughing . ) Delicacy !

( Abrupt ; after a moment 's thought . ) Where 's Mr. Trafford ? COVERLEY . ( Disconcerted , impatient . ) What has he got to do with it ? MRS . JASPER . You promised you 'd take him away . COVERLEY . Oh yes , I 'll take him ! Give me time . MRS . JASPER . That policeman in petticoats will pull down the house . COVERLEY . I 'll take him to-morrow . MRS . JASPER . You must take him to-day . COVERLEY . To-day I must save the Captain . MRS . JASPER . ( Abrupt again ; after another moment 's quick , intense meditation . ) Mr. Coverley , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . If you 'll save Amy , I 'll save the Captain ! COVERLEY . ( Vague . ) How can I save Amy ? MRS . JASPER . Take Mr. Trafford back to his post . COVERLEY . " Take " him  --  all the way ? MRS . JASPER . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Copenhagen on a ship . MRS . JASPER . Well , whatever you do go on ! And book his luggage through . COVERLEY . Very good  --  to-night . MRS . JASPER . Do n't wait till to-night ; do it to-day . Do it this morning ; do it this minute . Lay hands on him ; push him off ! COVERLEY . ( Encouraged but bargaining . ) And if I do , you 'll rescue my victim ? MRS . JASPER . I 'm not a shepherdess , but I 'll do what I can for the blue-eyed lamb . COVERLEY . Ah , do n't laugh at him ! MRS . JASPER . I mean for the knight of romance . COVERLEY . I shall love you still better . MRS . JASPER . That 's a circumstance that rather takes it out of me . COVERLEY . Oh , I shall be quiet ! But how will you operate ? MRS . JASPER . I must think it over ; I shall find a way . COVERLEY . ( Participating . ) Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be my right to worship you , as it will be my occupation to reward .  --  I 'll go to the inn ; I 'll catch hold of Trafford . MRS . JASPER . Go quickly ! COVERLEY . I 'll pack him off , and I 'll come back and tell you . MRS . JASPER . You need n't come back . COVERLEY . ( Going up . ) How else shall I see how you 're getting on ? MRS . JASPER . Before you go , at any rate , tell me this . Is he absolutely ( after a pause ) all you say ? COVERLEY . He 's only too much of a gentleman . That 's why he put himself out . MRS . JASPER . But he must be strangely simple . COVERLEY . He 's not too simple to suffer . MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) He must n't suffer ! COVERLEY . ( At the door to the court . ) He must n't , exactly ! If he was n't such a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court . ) MRS . JASPER . ( Alone . ) Neither should I ! ( Going to the table , shuffling her letters together and putting them into her pocket . ) My correspondence is nipped in the bud . ( Coming down , uncertain , and continuing to turn over COVERLEY 'S appeal in her mind . ) He must indeed be a knight of romance ; he must indeed be a gentleman . And if he 's simple , I like simple people . Well , if I 'm to find a way , where shall I find it ? Ought n't I to converse with him first , to sound him , to observe him ? Yes , that 's the right beginning . But how can I converse with him under Mrs. Wigmore 's guns ? ( Re-enter LADY BRISKET from the library , with a sealed and directed letter . ) LADY BRISKET . I 've written my letter , and it may relieve your solicitude to know that it 's to Mr. Trafford . MRS . JASPER . Has he already gone away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . JASPER . You 're taking time by the forelock . LADY BRISKET . Montagu ordered me to write . MRS . JASPER . You 've just missed an opportunity to send your letter ; Mr. Coverley would have taken it . LADY BRISKET . It does n't matter ; I mean to give it myself . MRS . JASPER . You 'll surely not see Mr. Trafford again ? LADY BRISKET . He 's coming to bid me good-bye . MRS . JASPER . I beseech you not to permit it ! LADY BRISKET . Not when he 's going so far ? MRS . JASPER . How far ? LADY BRISKET . ( After an hesitation . ) To Copenhagen . MRS . JASPER . Direct ? LADY BRISKET . You must get the details from Mr. Trafford . MRS . JASPER . Let me have your letter then ; I 'll give it to him . LADY BRISKET . After you 've shown it to Montagu for approval ? MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) My poor dear , you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll tell him of our meeting ? ( As MRS . JASPER hesitates a moment . ) You 'll have plenty of opportunities . MRS . JASPER . I do n't think you know what you say . LADY BRISKET . I know , for the most part , what you say ; and that will do as well . MRS . JASPER . It will do best of all , I think , that I should bring my visit to a close . LADY BRISKET . So that I shall appear to have been rude to you ? MRS . JASPER . You would n't be if you understood me a little better . LADY BRISKET . You make me feel then that in losing your company  --  MRS . JASPER . You lose that opportunity ? We 'll wait for a better one and I 'll go as soon as possible . LADY BRISKET . Are you sure Montagu will consent ? MRS . JASPER . ( Up at the window . ) Here he comes . ( Smiling , coming down . ) I can ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . ) Remind him that he can follow you ! ( Exit LADY BRISKET to the stairs . ) MRS . JASPER . ( Alone , struck . ) He may follow me ; it 's an awful thought . ( Thinking . ) But it 's the smaller risk ; I 'll fly . ( Then suddenly checked , thinking again . ) Dear me , if I fly , what will become of the snow-white lamb ? Shall I forsake him ? ( After another pause . ) No , I wo n't forsake him ; I 'll first see him . ( Re-enter SIR MONTAGU from the court . ) Have you been to ride ? SIR MONTAGU . Only a mile . I did n't enjoy it ; I came back to see you . MRS . JASPER . If you had been good enough to go another mile I might have got away . SIR MONTAGU . ( Vague . ) Away where ? MRS . JASPER . I 'm bringing my visit to a close . SIR MONTAGU . ( Indignant . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I 've made my preparations . SIR MONTAGU . Your principal preparation will be to reconcile your host to the idea , and that will take at least a week . MRS . JASPER . I 've stayed a week too long . You know my reason . SIR MONTAGU . Your reason for having stayed , of course ! MRS . JASPER . My reason for going now . SIR MONTAGU . ( Horrified . ) This morning ? MRS . JASPER . In an hour or two . You 've your own behaviour to thank . SIR MONTAGU . ( Pleading . ) Remain to abuse it  --  if you 'll only remain ! MRS . JASPER . I 've much more interesting work in hand , and the foolish advantage you try to find in my presence only gives Amy an excuse more foolish still . SIR MONTAGU . ( Suspicious , scandalised . ) Has Amy been capable of a failure of courtesy ? MRS . JASPER . Amy 's failures do n't signify , but there might be much to say about some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SIR MONTAGU . Stay to show me the right one ! MRS . JASPER . You should be the first to be faultless . SIR MONTAGU . Let me study you as a model for that ! MRS . JASPER . Study me at a distance . It 's forty miles , thank heaven , to London ! SIR MONTAGU . Are you going home ? ( After an instant , with decision . ) I 'll come up for your advice ! MRS . JASPER . ( Weary , sad . ) I 've no more to give you . You 've worn out your pretext ! SIR MONTAGU . It has not been a pretext , Mrs. Jasper . ( After an instant . ) I swear that I love my wife ! MRS . JASPER . Do you think I would have staid here three days if I did n't know it ? She loves you too , and that 's why you so ingeniously torment each other .

Into the garden  --  for a little talk . SIR MONTAGU . ( Blank . ) Can Blandina talk ? MRS . JASPER . No , but you know you can ! SIR MONTAGU . What about ? MRS . JASPER . Your favourite subject , the duties of a wife . You might change it to-day for the duties of a husband ! SIR MONTAGU . ( At the door of the Red Room . ) I shall not at least neglect the duties of a host ! ( Exit SIR MONTAGU . ) MRS . JASPER . ( Alone . ) You exaggerate them !

Since yesterday ? You must get it back ! PRIME . I do n't miss it  --  I feel heavy enough . MRS . JASPER . I promised Mr. Coverley I would speak to you . PRIME . Your voice will be a blessed change . MRS . JASPER . ( Smiling . ) Are you already tired of matrimony ? PRIME . I feel as if I had been married ten years ! MRS . JASPER . Then I 'm a little late to congratulate you . It was for that I asked to see you . PRIME . Do n't you remember that you congratulated me yesterday ? MRS . JASPER . ( Remembering . ) So I did ! You see I keep at it . PRIME . Do keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . ( Then as if uneasily hearing a sound from the Red Room . ) There is some one . MRS . JASPER . ( Listening . ) Blandina ? PRIME . ( Comforted . ) No  --  she 's gone out . MRS . JASPER . She 'll be back in time . PRIME . For the day ? It is n't fixed . ( Then with another start of anxiety . ) Wo n't Mrs. Wigmore come ? MRS . JASPER . To fix it ? If she does I 'll protect you ! PRIME . ( Rueful . ) You should have protected me yesterday . MRS . JASPER . Alas , I was taken up ! PRIME . Of course you 're in high demand . MRS . JASPER . Yes  --  people seem to want me . PRIME . I hope no one will want you now . MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) I sha n't care if they do !

JASPER . All the year round ! PRIME . But you told me about your refuge . MRS . JASPER . My sketching ? Oh , I 've a better refuge than that ! PRIME . ( With intense curiosity . ) What is it ? MRS . JASPER . My indifference ! PRIME . Ah , I 've tried indifference ; but it is n't enough ! MRS . JASPER . ( Thinking , conceding . ) No , it is n't exactly a regular occupation . It is n't , after all , absorbing . PRIME . I want to be absorbed  --  I want something to take hold of ! MRS . JASPER . Take hold ( vaguely ) take hold  --  ! ( Suddenly checking herself . ) PRIME .

( Reflecting . ) Well , we must find something . Something very safe . PRIME . There can be nothing so safe as a quiet corner and a box of water-colours . MRS . JASPER .

( Earnest . ) Is there room in it for two ? MRS . JASPER . ( Smiling . ) With mutual accommodation ! I 'll give you lessons . PRIME . ( Delighted , eager . ) Will you give me one now ? MRS . JASPER .

( Alone . ) Never from you ! ( Then as MRS . WIGMORE reappears . ) Caught ! ( Re-enter MRS . WIGMORE from the Red Room . ) MRS . WIGMORE . ( Struck , staring . ) Pray , where 's Blandina ? PRIME . Sir Montagu took her out . MRS . WIGMORE . Out where ? PRIME . I have n't the least idea . MRS . WIGMORE . It 's a point on which , . MRS . WIGMORE . I have n't any confidence in anybody !

Trafford 's packing  --  he 'll catch the 1.20 . MRS . JASPER . Hurry him then  --  precipitate him ! COVERLEY . I will . But if I could only precipitate you ! MRS . JASPER . You can do so by leaving me alone . COVERLEY . I 'll come back . The 1.20 ! ( Exit COVERLEY with all speed , saluting the other two , to the court . ) MRS . WIGMORE . ( To MRS .

Giving him a lesson in sketching . MRS . WIGMORE . And what is your pretext for so extraordinary a proceeding ? MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) To keep him from running away ! ( Exit MRS . JASPER to the library , while PRIME hurries after her , running the gauntlet of MRS . WIGMORE 'S continued reprobation . ) ( Re-enter LADY BRISKET from the stairs . ) MRS . WIGMORE . What is she doing with him ? LADY BRISKET . ( Who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to him ! MRS . WIGMORE . ( Aghast . ) And who 's making love to Blandina ? LADY BRISKET .

They may subside  --  Mrs. Jasper goes . TRAFFORD . ( Struck . ) Goes ! ( With irrepressible curiosity . ) By my train ? LADY BRISKET . Which is your train ? TRAFFORD . The next  --  the 1.20 . LADY BRISKET . She has just set her maid to pack ; she may catch it . TRAFFORD .

Why should she go , if she 's making up to Prime ? LADY BRISKET . I sha n't care , if she stays for that . TRAFFORD . Wo n't your husband care ?

You really must n't speak as if I were turning you out of the house ! I came back here to tell you that I 'm sorry I forgot myself . MRS . JASPER .

I should like to learn all you can teach me . MRS . JASPER . You exaggerate my acquirements . PRIME . It 's not only your acquirements ; it 's your natural gifts ! MRS . JASPER .

Mrs. Jasper , I do n't want Miss Wigmore . ( Intensely confidential . ) I do n't love Miss Wigmore . MRS . JASPER . ( Demurring . ) Not just a little ? PRIME .

Grant me a day , at least ! MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) Well  --  a day ! ( Then with a smile , giving him her hand . ) But only for your lesson ! PRIME .

( At the end of her patience , driving him up to the left . ) Not if you 'll go ! PRIME . ( Resisting . ) Do you like me ? MRS . JASPER . ( To get him off . ) I like you ! PRIME . ( Holding his ground . ) Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push him off . ) I 'll tell you to-morrow ! PRIME . Early ? MRS . JASPER . About this time ! PRIME . Noon ? ( At the door to the vestibule , with exultation , possessing himself of her hand . ) Angel ! MRS . JASPER . ( Laughing in spite of her dread of COVERLEY 'S return , snatching back her hand , which he has managed to carry to his lips , and finally getting rid of him . ) Lamb ! ACT THIRD MRS . JASPER 'S drawing-room ; modest and elegant . Entrance at the centre from the hall and staircase ; entrance at the right from another room . MRS . JASPER seated , lost in thought , on a small Louis Quinze sofa ; which , with a table beside it of the same period , are down at the left . A book is in her lap , which she has begun to cut , but is not reading . Enter the PARLOUR-MAID from the hall . PARLOUR-MAID . A telegram , ma'am . MRS . JASPER . ( Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; with a gesture of impatience and disappointment . ) Sir Montagu ! No answer . ( Exit the PARLOUR-MAID . MRS . JASPER rises , reads aloud . ) " In town to-day ; will come to lunch . " ( Thinking ; then with decision . ) I 'll lunch out ! ( Re-enter the PARLOUR-MAID . ) PARLOUR-MAID . Captain Prime ! MRS . JASPER . ( Struck . ) No , I wo n't : I 'll lunch at home ! ( Enter CAPTAIN PRIME from the hall . Exit the PARLOUR-MAID . ) PRIME . ( As MRS . JASPER lets him , with extreme devotion , take and keep her hand . ) You told me at Brisket you were coming home for courage . ( Anxiously . ) I hope you 've found it . MRS . JASPER . I 've hunted it up and down London . I 'm resting a moment . PRIME . I 'm not ; they 're too close behind me ! MRS . JASPER . ( Startled . ) They 're coming here ? PRIME . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all I want  --  time ! PRIME . We 've only an hour ; they 'll arrive . They 've fixed the day . MRS . JASPER . ( Alarmed . ) To-morrow ? PRIME . The twenty-fifth . There I am ! MRS . JASPER . I see ; you had to consent . PRIME . I had to consent , but I also had to fly . MRS . JASPER . When did you come away ? PRIME . This morning , at the peep of dawn . ( Then nervous , pleading ; with a sudden fear . ) You wo n't give me back to them  --  you wo n't ? MRS . JASPER . ( Smiling . ) Not without a struggle . But mercy on us , how far we 've come ! PRIME . For the time it has taken , yes . But we surely ca n't stop where we are . MRS . JASPER . Dear Captain Prime , where are we , you know ? That 's what I ask myself . PRIME . Well , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . JASPER . If we advance together it must be step by step , and armed to the teeth . Remember that we 're in the enemy 's country . PRIME . That was the case at Brisket ; it 's not the case here . MRS . JASPER . Here we shall have the enemy in ours ; it comes to the same thing . ( After an instant . ) There 's a difference , however ; for now I 've a better conscience . PRIME . Mine was perfect from the first ! MRS . JASPER . Oh , mine required clearing up : I 've been busy setting it in order ! Our pace on that wonderful occasion was so rapid ; it made the situation so false . It was as if I had dreamed a dream or drunk a potion . I had to recover my reason ; I had to return to reality . ( Giving him her hand again . ) I think this is reality . PRIME . ( Rueful . ) I think so too , Mrs. Jasper , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah no , not worse . Essentially better ! PRIME . How in the world is it better , dearest , since we 've been able to do nothing ? MRS . JASPER . We 've been able to do everything . We 've learned to know each other , to be sure of ourselves . It was that second day at Brisket , before my own flight , that made us sure . It signed and sealed the treaty . PRIME . Well then , if the treaty 's signed and sealed we can act on it . MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant , dubious . ) Act on it  --  yes . PRIME . I mean we can take the shortest cut . MRS . JASPER . What do you call the shortest cut ? PRIME . Why , simply announce that we 're engaged ! MRS . JASPER . Dear Captain Prime , would n't that make you guilty of a sort of sketchy bigamy ? Before we simply announce that we 're engaged ( after a pause ) we must simply become so ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant . MRS . JASPER . This very instant is premature . PRIME . Why so , if we 're sure of ourselves ? MRS . JASPER . We must be sure of some other people ! PRIME . You told me at Brisket that you wanted to " save " me . The only way to save me is to lead me to a different altar . MRS . JASPER . I must find a different one for Blandina ! ( After another short , intense reverie . ) Perhaps it might be possible to make Mr. Coverley take her . ( Then catching herself up , discouraged . ) Oh , I forgot  --  he 's in love with me ! PRIME . Yes , fancy the wretch ! MRS . JASPER . You ought to be able to fancy him ! PRIME . ( Good-humouredly , after an instant during which , in rejoinder to her last speech , he has playfully kissed her hand . ) Oh , I 'll forgive him everything ; for without him where should we be ? MRS . JASPER . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so was that brute of a Trafford . MRS . JASPER . ( With an idea , suddenly seizing his arm . ) Make him take her ! ( Then relapsing in the same way as before . ) Oh , I forgot , he 's in love with me too ! PRIME . ( Blank . ) Is every one in love with you ? MRS . JASPER . Yes , it makes every one , now that you are . I ought to let you know it . PRIME . Thank you . ( After an instant . ) Well , it ca n't be helped ! I thought Mr. Trafford was in love with Lady Brisket . MRS . JASPER . He 's differently affected ; he 's in love with every one . PRIME . With every one , alas ! but Blandina . MRS . JASPER . He 's capable even of that . PRIME . ( Eager . ) Is he ? Then there 's an issue ! MRS . JASPER . ( Struck . ) It might be , if Amy did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then gravely , as if with apprehension . ) She does n't reciprocate his passion ? MRS . JASPER . You 're shocked , you dear ; very properly . But it is n't shocking . Poor Amy 's in love with no one but her husband , and only made foolish by his own folly . ( Giving a specimen . ) He 's coming to lunch with me ! PRIME . ( Surprised . ) Is he in town ? MRS . JASPER . Just arrived ; he has wired . He 's made foolish by his wife 's folly . PRIME . ( Quick , with an inspiration . ) So that if each could be got straight  --  ? MRS . JASPER . ( Catching his idea . ) Mr. Trafford would be sent about his business ! ( Plausible , convincing . ) His business is to marry Blandina . ( Then with immense decision . ) We 'll get them straight ! PRIME . Then the thing is to catch Trafford . MRS . JASPER . ( Arrested , disconcerted . ) Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must bring him back . MRS . JASPER . ( With a happy thought . ) I 'll send Mr. Coverley after him ! PRIME . Without delay , then : every minute counts . Remember that I 'm sinking into the sand . MRS . JASPER . ( With elation . ) I do n't care for the sand  --  I 'm the Sphinx ! PRIME . Ah , but I 'm not one of the Pyramids ! MRS . JASPER . No , indeed , you 're a pilgrim in the desert ; you 're a breathing , struggling man . Therefore Sir Montagu must n't find you here . PRIME . Why not ? He knows you like me . MRS . JASPER . Then we 've no occasion to remind him ! PRIME . Appeal to him , on the contrary ; tell him the simple facts . MRS . JASPER . The less I tell him the better ! ( Going for PRIME 'S hat and stick , which he has put down on coming in . ) I can manage him only if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his things . ) Where in the world shall I go ? MRS . JASPER . Ca n't you run round to your club ? PRIME . Dear lady , think of the Wigmores ! MRS . JASPER . ( Thinking of them . ) Would they enter the building ? PRIME . Enter it ? They 'd occupy it ? ( Supplicating . ) Let me remain at least on the premises . MRS . JASPER . While you 're still Blandina 's ? PRIME . All the more reason ! ( Nodding toward the other room . ) I 'll stay in there . MRS . JASPER . It 's my dear old " den "  --  it 's full of my things . PRIME . They 're just what I want to see ! MRS . JASPER . ( Struck by a sound . ) Hush , he 's coming ! ( Waving him into the other room . ) Then hide ! ( Exit PRIME rapidly into the other room . Re-enter the PARLOUR-MAID . ) PARLOUR-MAID . Mr. Trafford . ( Enter PERCY TRAFFORD from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Surprised , struck , relieved , recognising with a joy she can scarcely conceal , though she endeavours to hide it with an air of disapproval , the opportunity indicated in the preceding scene . ) Oh , you ? TRAFFORD . No , I 've not got off ; I anticipate your displeasure . ( Then puzzled , mystified , as MRS . JASPER , with her eyes fixed on him , slowly and mysteriously circles round him as it were , in silence , while , not unwilling to bewilder him , she asks herself how she had best proceed with him . ) Are you too displeased to speak to me ? ( She still remains silent , retracing her steps and revolving in the opposite sense , so that at last quite bewildered he goes on with a droll suppliant uneasiness . ) Are you trying to hypnotise me ? MRS . JASPER . ( Stopping , but still with her eyes on him . ) Pray , what has prevented your getting off ? TRAFFORD . ( Breaking out , to conciliate her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JASPER . How did you know I was in town ? TRAFFORD . I just came on the chance  --  to ask . MRS . JASPER . At this extraordinary hour ? TRAFFORD . It 's the eve of my departure and the fault of my impatience . I feel already an exile . MRS . JASPER . ( Visibly debating within herself an instant ; then , as if in consequence of the definite determination to assume with him a certain attitude and take a certain line , after she has seated herself again on her sofa with her book and her paper-cutter . ) So that you 've come to me for consolation ? TRAFFORD . ( Reassured , led on by her tone . ) You 've said it , Mrs. Jasper . Be kind to me this once . MRS . JASPER . ( Considering , while she cuts her book , then raising her eyes to him with strange expressiveness . ) Well , this once . ( Still looking at him in the same way , while she points to a seat . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . ) My motive for a step of this boldness has been the wish not to start without bidding you good-bye . MRS . JASPER . ( Smiling . ) Good-bye is soon said , Mr. Trafford , when it has to be ! I tried to say it with all possible distinctness at Brisket . TRAFFORD . ( Smiling as she smiles , and drawing his seat a little nearer . ) So did I , Mrs. Jasper , but I could n't utter the sound ! I felt therefore to-day the yearning to address you a last word . MRS . JASPER . ( Very busy with the leaves of her book . ) You prolong the agony , do n't you see , Mr. Trafford ? TRAFFORD . ( Insinuating . ) I prolong the agony , as you justly remark , Mrs. Jasper ; but I also shorten a little  --  do n't you see ?  --  the separation ! MRS . JASPER . Our separation is surely too fundamental to be affected by a visit , on your part , the more or the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you at Brisket there never would be anything in the nature of a chance for you ? TRAFFORD . ( Arguing with increased confidence . ) Yes , but your manner just now seemed to promise  --  it seems to promise , Mrs. Jasper , even while I speak !  --  a certain relaxation of your rigour ; and since you refer to what passed between us at Brisket , I may remind you , on my side , that I expressed to you there how deeply I long for sympathy . MRS . JASPER . You seemed to me not to long for it in vain ! TRAFFORD . So I ventured to believe at moments , and yet I have asked myself , these last days , what has happened to deprive me , in the connection to which you so indulgently allude , of any further symbol of it . MRS . JASPER . ( To herself . ) He takes us in rotation ! ( Then looking at him a moment . ) Do I correctly infer that you have come to me for news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I 've said enough to show you that that was not all my errand ! But if you have any news of Lady Brisket to communicate , I wo n't deny that I shall be properly grateful for it . MRS . JASPER . I left her at Brisket , from which she gave no indication at all of an intention to stir . TRAFFORD . ( Betraying inadvertently a slight surprise . ) No symptom at all ? MRS . JASPER . ( Struck ; then ironical . ) Have you been expecting her to travel up and pay you a visit ? TRAFFORD . I 've been simply hoping that I might , before I go , have a last word from her . MRS . JASPER . You 're very fond of last words ! This miracle of her silence , then , you 've come to me to explain ? TRAFFORD . ( Alarmed by her tone and extenuating . ) I was restless , I was disappointed  --  MRS . JASPER . ( Interrupting him , insisting on her advantage and following it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the absence of anything better ? ( Closing her book and rising sharply . ) I seemed a woman you might come to  --  to talk of another woman ? TRAFFORD . ( Springing up , startled , mystified ; then , after staring a moment , falling into the trap and almost plaintively explaining . ) Dear Mrs. Jasper , there are so few subjects that your great severity allows ! Only let me feel that I 'm at liberty , and there 's one on which I shall be eloquent enough ! MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant , more gently . ) Do n't be eloquent , Mr. Trafford . Leave the country in silence . TRAFFORD . ( Ardent . ) I ca n't leave it till I 've explained my position . MRS . JASPER . If you explain it you 'll spoil it . It 's so fine as it is ! TRAFFORD . ( Infatuated , beguiled . ) You mean my conscientious retreat  --  to spare Lady Brisket any shadow of annoyance ? Let me prove to you its reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave England ( after an hesitation ; bringing it out ) to-day . MRS . JASPER . ( As if suppressing a shock . ) To-day ? TRAFFORD . I take the club-train . But , Mrs. Jasper  --  MRS . JASPER . ( As if waiting in averted suspense , while he nervously hangs fire . ) Yes , Mr. Trafford ? TRAFFORD . I take the club-train because I gave my word , at Brisket , not to linger too long . But my leave of absence is n't really at an end , and though prompt departure has been prescribed to me in an amiable quarter , I should be delighted to make a later start if it should be even so much as hinted at in another ! MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant , facing round to him with a kindled countenance and a complete change of manner . ) Your assurance , Mr. Trafford , ought to carry you very far in your profession ! ( As , taken aback by her unexpectedness , he makes a vague gesture of protest . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddle as one could wish to see , and then , at the very moment you 've a chance to retrieve it by an act of common decorum , you throw yourself with all your levity into a declaration which is neither more nor less than an impertinence to two women at once ! TRAFFORD . ( Staggered a little , but recovering himself . ) Can I help it if the charm you exercise  --  ? MRS . JASPER . ( Breaking in . ) Is it too much to hope that the charm I exercise may make you ashamed of yourself ? TRAFFORD . ( After a bewildered silence . ) I 'll take the dub-train . MRS . JASPER . ( Abrupt , imperative . ) You 'll do nothing of the sort ! TRAFFORD . ( Blank . ) What then am I to wait for ? MRS . JASPER . Your punishment ! TRAFFORD . ( Rueful . ) Dear lady , I feel as if I had had it ! MRS . JASPER . You 'll feel so still more before I 've done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me what it 's to consist of ? MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) I should like first to know the hour . TRAFFORD . ( Looking at his watch . ) It 's getting on to one . MRS . JASPER . ( Arranging the bosom of her dress . ) Then I have n't time  --  I 'm expecting Sir Montagu . TRAFFORD . ( Startled . ) Is he in town ? MRS . JASPER . He has just come up  --  to see if you 've gone . TRAFFORD . ( Putting on his gloves and still more uneasy . ) If I have n't then , it will be your fault ! MRS . JASPER . I 'll take the responsibility , for I have the satisfaction ! But he must n't find you yet . TRAFFORD . ( Alert , but not exactly in a panic , inasmuch as he must , so far as possible , indicate that if he wishes to avoid SIR MONTAGU it is not so much for the sake of his own skin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . MRS . JASPER . ( Listening , catching his arm . ) Wait  --  a ring at the door ! TRAFFORD . ( Listening . ) Is it he ? MRS . JASPER . I daresay ! TRAFFORD . ( Anxious . ) Which way shall I go ? MRS . JASPER . ( With vivacity , as , to take a different door from the one he has come in by , he goes up to the centre . ) Not there ! ( Re-enter the PARLOUR-MAID . ) PARLOUR-MAID . Mr. Coverley ! ( Enter CHARLES COVERLEY from the hall . Exit the PARLOUR-MAID . ) MRS . JASPER . You arrive in the nick of time  --  I commit Mr. Trafford to your keeping . COVERLEY . ( Astonished at finding TRAFFORD . ) Again ? MRS . JASPER . Please shut him up till he 's wanted . TRAFFORD . ( Seizing his chance to get off . ) Coverley will know where to find me ! ( Exit TRAFFORD briskly to the hall . ) MRS . JASPER . ( Anxious . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has always the same hotel . But I thought he had gone . MRS . JASPER . So did I ! ( Then pressing COVERLEY . ) Do n't lose him  --  follow him ! COVERLEY . ( Evading her and coming round , vague , on the other side . ) To see him off ? MRS . JASPER . To keep him on ! ( With extreme urgency . ) Do look out , or he 'll go . COVERLEY . ( Bewildered . ) I thought that was what you clamoured for . MRS . JASPER . I did , but I 've changed . At present you must help . COVERLEY . That 's exactly what I 've come for . I returned to town as soon as I knew you had left Brisket . MRS . JASPER . Make yourself useful then ; secure Mr. Trafford . COVERLEY . ( Uneasy , refusing to be hustled off . ) I want to secure you ! I want , moreover , an account of your proceedings . MRS . JASPER . ( With affected blankness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chains . An hour after I first appealed to you , you told me you had found a way to get him off . I was delighted with your promptitude , and that evening I asked you what the way might be . You requested me to wait to see . MRS . JASPER . Well , wait a little longer . COVERLEY . I 've already waited an eternity . MRS . JASPER . Wait till to-morrow . COVERLEY . That 's what you said at Brisket . MRS . JASPER . Wait till to-night . COVERLEY . Why the deuce is it such a mystery ? MRS . JASPER . It 's difficult ; it 's delicate ; it 's complicated . COVERLEY . Upon my honour , it must be ! Incantations and mystic spells ! MRS . JASPER . I know what I 'm about . When I consented to oblige you , I made it clear to you that you must give me a free hand ; you must trust me . If you do n't trust me it 's all over . COVERLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I help trusting you when I adore you ? MRS . JASPER . Adore me a little less , and trust me a little more . COVERLEY . Ah , but it is n't only me . It 's the victim of my wretched rashness . Can the Captain trust you ? MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) I think he does . ( Then after another instant . ) I 'll tell you my idea . ( Laying her hand on his arm and , while he waits , hopeful , looking at him . ) It 's to give her to your accomplice . Make Trafford take her . COVERLEY . ( Astonished . ) Blandina ? Will Trafford take her ? MRS . JASPER . He 'll simply have to ! COVERLEY . Why will he have to ? MRS . JASPER . That 's my secret . COVERLEY . How can I " help " if I do n't know it ? MRS . JASPER . By not letting him escape . COVERLEY . ( Alert , seizing his hat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( With her hand on his arm . ) Wait a moment ! ( Then after an instant during which , in her mind , she visibly and anxiously tries to harmonise her difficulties . ) What time is it now ? COVERLEY . ( Looking at his watch . ) It 's one . MRS . JASPER . Then bring him at two . COVERLEY . ( With eager assent , going inadvertently , in his headlong haste , up to centre . ) At two ! MRS . JASPER . Not there ! ( Explaining . ) My den . COVERLEY . ( At the door to the hall . ) I wish I were Daniel ! ( Exit COVERLEY . ) ( Re-enter PRIME from the other room . ) PRIME . Has he gone ? MRS . JASPER . It was n't Sir Montagu . But take care ! PRIME . That room there is like a fortress . My gratitude overflows . MRS . JASPER . It can overflow later . PRIME . I must live in the moment . To be there among your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  gives me a sense of strength . MRS . JASPER . ( Fortified also an instant and rejoicing without reserve . ) In a word you feel at home ! PRIME . As I 've never felt anywhere . Yet at the same time , do you know ? I 've a wild desire to go off with you . MRS . JASPER . Why should we go off ? PRIME . To break with everything ; to insist on our freedom . MRS . JASPER . ( After an instant . ) Dear Captain Prime , you showed , on a momentous occasion , a delicacy the vision of which won my heart . We must keep at that beautiful height ; we must n't fall below it . PRIME . There would be nothing so delicate or so beautiful as to forget all these people with you . And we should come back in the fulness of time only the more united . MRS . JASPER . You must wait for the fulness of time . Otherwise you 'll be terribly judged . PRIME . Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without their perceiving it , the PARLOUR-MAID . ) MRS . JASPER . Do you care how I am ? ( Enter SIR MONTAGU BRISKET from the hall . ) PRIME . ( Passionate . ) You ? You 're an angel ! PARLOUR-MAID . Sir Montagu Brisket . ( Exit the PARLOUR-MAID . ) SIR MONTAGU . ( As MRS . JASPER and PRIME precipitately separate . ) I appear to have interrupted a scene of considerable intimacy ! MRS . JASPER . ( At the right to PRIME at the left . ) We must accept the interruption , Captain Prime . PRIME . Does that mean that I must leave you ? MRS . JASPER . If you 'll be so very good . ( PRIME , who is without his hat and stick , which he has taken out with him on his former exit , passes up to the centre . SIR MONTAGU comes down to the left . PRIME pauses , looks at him an instant , without defiance but with visible deliberation , and then goes into the other room . ) SIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MRS . JASPER . To my boudoir . SIR MONTAGU . Do you give him the run of your house ? MRS . JASPER . He comes to call . SIR MONTAGU . What does Blandina say to that ? MRS . JASPER . It 's a question you must put to Blandina . SIR MONTAGU . ( After an instant . ) Shall I tell her he thinks you an angel ? MRS . JASPER . She 'll not be surprised , for she knows you do . SIR MONTAGU . ( Nettled . ) An angel , dear lady , with somewhat drooping wings ! Did you get my telegram ? MRS . JASPER . It made me deplore your precipitation . SIR MONTAGU . My reception is even more frigid than I feared . MRS . JASPER . Your wife will take an unfortunate view of a visit to London which so quickly follows my return . SIR MONTAGU . My conscience is clear about my visit to London . I came up to make sure that fellow has gone . MRS . JASPER . Mr. Trafford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I can inform you ? SIR MONTAGU . I take you by the way ; I ask you to feed my hunger . MRS . JASPER . Will that be fair to Amy ? SIR MONTAGU . Does she want even to starve me ? MRS . JASPER . You know my attitude ; I 've made it plain . I wish to be without reproach . SIR MONTAGU . ( After an instant , with attention . ) And without observers ? MRS . JASPER . I do n't understand . SIR MONTAGU . Let me be sure then that I do . You wo n't give me luncheon ? MRS . JASPER . No , Sir Montagu , it 's impossible . SIR MONTAGU . ( After looking into his hat a moment . ) You say you wish to be without reproach . Excuse me if I reply that you take a singular way to become so . ( As she makes a movement of impatience and indifference . ) Has anything occurred to free Captain Prime from his pledge to my niece ? MRS . JASPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to observe that his proper place is not in your boudoir . MRS . JASPER . He must judge for himself of his proper place . SIR MONTAGU . May I inquire if he 's to remain to luncheon ? MRS . JASPER . I daresay he will if I invite him . SIR MONTAGU . If you wish to be fair to Amy , why be grossly the opposite to Blandina ? MRS . JASPER . You 'll see that I shall not be . SIR MONTAGU . ( After an instant . ) You mean you 'll let her have her lover on condition that you do n't lose your own ? MRS . JASPER . ( Starting , wounded , indignant , her hand on her heart . ) Ah , Sir Montagu  --  ! SIR MONTAGU . ( Supremely satiric , at the door to the hall . ) I 'll acquaint her with your extraordinary terms !

JASPER , who at his entrance has very quickly sprung up and moved away from him ; his suspicions aroused by his first glance at her . ) But what on earth did he say to you ? MRS . JASPER . ( Who has quickly brushed away her agitation , disguising it with her bravery . ) It does n't signify what he said . PRIME . It signifies to me when people insult you ! MRS . JASPER . You 're not in a position to defend me . PRIME . Not in a position , when I worship you ? MRS . JASPER . To worship me now is to dishonour me . PRIME . ( Discouraged . ) Heavens  --  you too ? MRS . JASPER . I think perhaps it 's I who dishonour you . I expose you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) You do turn me away then ? MRS . JASPER . I must  --  till we 're free . PRIME . For people to come and outrage you ? MRS . JASPER . They wo n't if we 're separate . PRIME . ( Struck . ) Ah , how I make you suffer ! MRS . JASPER . I 'm willing to suffer  --  for you . If I wish you to go , it 's for yourself . PRIME . To feel that I desert you , and leave you all the burden ? I 'll only go if you come with me ! MRS . JASPER . ( Discouraged , faltering an instant . ) Give me up rather ; I 'm not worth your trouble . Go off and escape : a man can ! Take wings and forget us all . PRIME . No , I have my answer to your visitors . This is the very place for me to give it . MRS . JASPER . You shall never give your answer before I 've given mine ! PRIME . Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) PARLOUR-MAID . Lady Brisket . MRS . JASPER . ( Startled ; then , with confidence . ) I shall be quick ! ( Enter LADY BRISKET from the hall . Exit the PARLOUR-MAID . To LADY BRISKET . ) I 'm the more surprised to see you as Sir Montagu did n't mention that you had come up with him . LADY BRISKET . ( Who has stopped short , astonished , between them , looking from PRIME to MRS . JASPER . ) Has he been here then ? MRS . JASPER . He has just left me . ( Gay . ) Perhaps you did n't come up with him ? LADY BRISKET . He took the ten . MRS . JASPER . And you took the eleven ? LADY BRISKET . ( Looking at PRIME . ) The Wigmores were to take the twelve . MRS . JASPER . ( To PRIME . ) Be in the other room to receive them . ( PRIME inclines himself gravely to both ladies and goes out again . ) LADY BRISKET . You 're right in supposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JASPER . Every one suspects me , dear Amy . You yourself most of all . LADY BRISKET . Well , you 've just admitted that Montagu has been here . MRS . JASPER . That was so little my fault that I allowed him to stay but five minutes . LADY BRISKET . ( After an instant . ) You sacrificed him to Captain Prime ? MRS . JASPER . The sacrifice cost me nothing , for I saw that my own attractions had had little to do with his adventure . ( After a moment . ) His visit was for Mr. Trafford . LADY BRISKET . ( Sceptical , mocking . ) Did he expect to find him here ? MRS . JASPER . He missed him by only ten minutes . LADY BRISKET . Mr. Trafford 's still in London ? MRS . JASPER . Did n't you know it ? ( As LADY BRISKET turns away in silence . ) Let me express my regret that you 've come up . LADY BRISKET . I came up to watch my husband . MRS . JASPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LADY BRISKET . How , since he left her at Brisket ? MRS . JASPER . Believing that Mr. Trafford was still on the scene , he had his reasons for suspecting that she would presently arrive . You see that , finding a fortunate colour in Sir Montagu 's own movements , she has arrived . LADY BRISKET . Mr. Trafford has had nothing to do with it . MRS . JASPER .

He did this despite the fact that he had once criticized Howells for publishing a play before it was acted . " This , " he wrote , " from a Parisian point of view , seems quite monstrous . " Nevertheless , there was the precedent of his publication of Daisy Miller , and he yielded to the temptation to enshrine his plays in book form , as he explained to Elizabeth Robins , to keep them from " ' dying with all their music in them .

They are also experiments in the line of comedy pure and simple . If it be very naturally and somewhat sternly inquired , accordingly , why , failing of their sole application , they appear in a form which is an humiliating confession of defeat , I am afraid the only answer is that the unacted dramatist has still the consolation  --  poor enough , alas !  --  of the performance imaginary .

The covers of the book may , in a seat that costs nothing , figure the friendly curtain , and the legible " lines " the various voices of the stage ; so that if these things manage at all to disclose a picture or to drop a tone into the reader 's ear the ghostly ordeal will in a manner have been passed and the dim foot-lights faced . The publication of these simple attempts  --  so calculated for a " fit " or for a " bid " that they doubtless missed their way through an anxious excess of simplicity  --  is in a word a faint make-believe .

The action of the play , which is a free translation of the subject of the story , greatly deviates , it must be admitted , from this original , though remaining distinctly indebted to it again for an incident in the third act . The idea on which Disengaged mainly reposes was supplied to the author by a little story of his own . H. J. EDITOR 'S FOREWORD TENANTS In his prefatory note to Theatricals : Two Comedies Henry James , with that vagueness with which he liked to shroud literary origins , tells us that Tenants was inspired " by a short tale of the late Commandant Henri Rivire , a tale published some five-and-twenty years ago , if not more , in a single number of La Revue des Deux Mondes . " An examination of Rivire 's stories , frequently published in the Revue earlier in the century , points to Flavien : Scnes de la vie contemporaine , of November 1 , 1874 , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a General d'Herbel who retires and devotes himself to his ward , the daughter of his brother . Lonie d'Herbel , like Mildred in Tenants , is heir to a substantial fortune and falls in love with the General 's son , Emmanuel , a captain of the French forces in Algeria . A former mistress of the General , the Countess Sampara , arrives on the scene with her son Flavien , and his tutor , the Chevalier Griotti . After considerable intrigue the tutor is killed in a duel and the lovers are united . This was the situation James transposed into an English setting , matching the French story , character for character , and weaving out of it a play with the strong moral tone of Dumas fils and Augier . He wrote it in November 1890 during rehearsals for the Southport opening of his play The American . On December 9 he wrote to William James : " I have just finished ( written in a month , but working tooth and nail ) another drama , of which I am tomorrow to read the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the two leading ones ) who have taken it in hand . " This was Play Number 2 , tentatively named Mrs. Vibert and later renamed Tenants . The two leading interpreters were the formidable Genevive Ward , a native of New York , who had had a long career first on the operatic stage and later in the theatre , and W. H. Vernon , who had been her leading man in a number of productions . The reading James spoke of was announced by him in a letter , written two days before he wrote William , to Mrs. Hugh Bell , herself the author of a number of closet dramas . In his characteristically extravagant manner , James told her that the third act of his play was " a pure movement , intensely interesting and suspense-producing , lasting forty minutes , and subtly calculated to captivate the Genevan and Vernonese mind . ... I have likewise ' cut ' my second act as effectually and bloodily as the most barbarous dramatic butcher could desire ; and have retouched and amended the first . My III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learn so fast ! " The day after the reading he wrote to Mrs. Bell that it had been a " high success ... my auditors ' rose at ' me , gave themselves away and were flushed and effusive . " Miss Ward agreed to take the play to John Hare , the actor-manager , who as far back as 1879 had asked James for a play . She kept her word for on January 27 , 1891 , James told Mrs. Bell he had received a letter from Hare " placing Mrs. Vibert , I think , on a very favorable basis for discussion " as soon as the actor-manager should be free of the rehearsals of his new play , Pinero 's Lady Bountiful , produced at the Garrick March 7 , 1891 . We get some inkling of the contents of Hare 's letter in James 's account of it to his brother on February 6 , 1891 : " No. 2 is in the hands of a high London manager , in conditions as to which I prefer at present to maintain absolute silence  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter ) that it is ' a masterpiece of dramatic construction ' a good phrase for a ' high London manager ' to apply to the first production he has read of a beginner . " On April 13 , James announced to Mrs. Bell that " Hare has definitely accepted both the venerable heroine and her interpreter . " A note in Alice James 's journal of April 23 carries the history of Mrs. Vibert forward a step , and indicates also that Hare was in no hurry to produce James : " H. came in a few days ago , all heated with a most sympathetic interview with John Hare , who not only accepts play number two , Mrs. Vibert , which H. wrote before Christmas for Miss Genevive Ward , but accepts it with enthusiasm and calls it a ' masterpiece of dramatic construction . ' His Hare 's talk was most intelligent and his view of the English public all that can be desired . He talked a great deal about the cast and repeated , ' It is meant for the Franais . ' Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunately fallen , and he apparently would bring out H 's play now , but that he wants , for a rest , to revive an old play , and he has promised to bring out another new play next . So H. wo n't come until autumn or winter , I am afraid . " In the autumn , when rehearsals for the London production of The American began , Henry told William that Hare was having difficulty casting Tenants . Hare and Miss Ward had their roles , and Vernon presumably was intended for Captain Lurcher . The problem was to find an actor for Claude . Henry wrote to his brother : " The only thing I do care to speak of now ( and only to you ) is the drama in three acts , Mrs. Vibert , which John Hare is to produce at the Garrick some time this season . But here there are irrepressible delays , produced largely  --  indeed almost wholly  --  by the intense difficulties of casting . One tries to write as simple and feasible a thing as possible and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people capable of beginning to attempt to do it are not findable . There 's a career for talent  --  to act my plays . Mrs. Vibert is blocked largely by the difficulty of putting one 's hand on a young man who can touch an important little part of a boy of 20  --  who must be a character , a touching one . " Throughout that autumn the theatrical press spoke freely of Mrs. Vibert , a comedy " of society , " as a play Hare would soon produce . The months passed ; then the years . In 1893 the announcement that Oscar Wilde had written A Woman of No Importance worried James . He was in Paris and the title suggested a theme similar to his play . He wrote to Elizabeth Robins , " ... tell me three words about Oscar W 's piece  --  when it is produced ; and if in particular the subject seems to discount my poor three-year-older ( or almost ) that Hare will neither produce nor part with . " To Mrs. Bell , a few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Robins , " I am consumed with curiosity ... " To Mrs. Bell , again , " ... may I have an echo of it ? " Apparently the ladies did not assuage his curiosity ; but in due course he found out for himself . The question was of academic importance . Long before James finally wrenched the comedy free from Hare to publish it , he sought to engage the interest of Helena Modjeska in a probable American production of the play . She had been interested in the possibility of doing Madame de Cintr in The American . James , on November 17 , 1891 , wrote an eighteen page letter to the Polish-American actress to tell her that Mrs. Vibert was much more the sort of play she should do and offering to send her a script . After reading it she sent it back saying she had studied the first act but saw the play as essentially a vehicle for Miss Ward rather than for herself . In his letter to Modjeska James expressed the view that Tenants " would  --  largely  --  stand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the scene  --  between the mother and son , in the third act , should be acted ; to which degree of perfection it would be indispensable that the actor representing the young man should contribute . " Readers of James 's tales will recognize the familiar figures of earlier Jamesian stories in this play  --  the young ward , the guardian , the continental youth , his loyal tutor . That he should have been partial to the situation in the Rivire story of a young man and his preceptor at this time is not surprising , for he had a few months earlier written The Pupil with a somewhat younger protagonist than Claude and a sympathetic rather than a villainous tutor . A NOTE ON THE TEXTS In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication , over a period of two decades , the editor was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays ( the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant ) . The corrections and emendations were such as occur in the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production office into the theatre . James was called upon to revise his plays many times ; typed copies were multiplied , each with different cuts and alterations . The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency  --  as well as the persistency  --  of his struggle within the dramatic form . How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed " definitive " ? One could always produce a variorum edition , but neither the dramatist , nor the plays , nor the textual problems arising from collation , warranted such a procedure . Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship  --  that is of truth , fidelity to text and to the writer 's intentions  --  while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would serve : that of demonstrating their role in Henry James 's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps  --  if the fancy of some producer might be caught in the process  --  provide the means for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American stage . I therefore directed my editing to this end . It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified , so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play . The American was ideally suited to this purpose , since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James 's alterations in his own hand , and the printed prompt books of the London production , two of them from James 's own library , as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors . It was thus possible to give the mutations of James 's first important effort in the theatre , including a variant fourth act . As regards the other plays , a simple principle was applied . Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts . Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest , fullest form , with all the cuts restored ; in a few minor instances there were cuts followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were accepted as his final reading ; where there were simply cuts , these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text . Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible , it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes . No generalizations , however , can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised ; where deemed advisable , the alternate readings have been given . There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text . This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons ' typescripts of the play , I decided that it would be of interest to publish the text as actually performed on the stage in 1909 , which James had approved , despite a number of alterations and cuts . This play can thus be studied in its three versions : as a one-act play never performed ; as the short story Covering End and in the final form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over most of the manuscripts of his plays , making corrections and verbal changes , or inserting new portions , he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation . There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well . Where no changes in meaning were involved , punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play . Such inconsistencies as Newman 's alternately referring to " Valentin " and " Valentine " are retained as in the text as well as James 's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization . In some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech ; these have been spelled out as an aid to readability . Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips 's Bibliography of the Writings of Henry James ( New York , 1930 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREDERICK BYNG NORMAN BYNG CAPTAIN LURCHER CLAUDE VIBERT FROST MRS . VIBERT MILDRED MISS DYER The action takes place at Beechingham Manor , a sequestered old house in Devonshire . Main text ACT FIRST The spacious , sociable , old-fashioned hall at Beechingham , panelled in clear colours and used as a place of reunion . It opens , largely , into an ante-room , through the wide window of which the avenue of a small park and a charming horizon are shown , and which conducts on the left to the entrance of the house as well as to various apartments , and on the right to the staircase , to other apartments and to the billard-room . On the right of the hall the door to the drawing-room ; on the left the door to the library . The place shows signs of constant and familiar habitation and of studied comfort , but not of conspicuous luxury . MISS DYER comes down impatiently from the window of the ante-room . MISS DYER . What a bore to have to wait half the day for your letters ! The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post a condition . ( Enter MILDRED through the ante-room from the left , with several letters in her hand . ) MILDRED . Here they are : I looked out for the groom in the park . MISS DYER . I 'm not quite sure you ought ! MILDRED . Dear Miss Dyer , you 're never quite sure I ought ! Here 's a letter for you . MISS DYER . ( With the letter . ) Only one ? MILDRED . Only one . MISS DYER . How stupid  --  from mamma ! And are all the others for you ? MILDRED . For me ? who ever writes to me ? Some of them are for Sir Frederick ; the others are for Mr. Byng . MISS DYER . I suppose those are the ones you looked out for in the park ! MILDRED . ( Holding up a letter . ) This is the one . It has a big official seal , which I 've taken the liberty to examine . MISS DYER . I 'm not quite sure you ought ! MILDRED . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in London , to put an end to his leave . MISS DYER . I think it high time ! MILDRED . After a month  --  only a little month ? MISS DYER . A month is n't so little , when one makes such a big use of it . MILDRED . ( Vague . ) What use , pray  --  ? MISS DYER . To make love to you ! MILDRED . Why should n't he , if he likes me ? MISS DYER . I 'm not quite sure he ought ! MILDRED . Neither am I. But perhaps he ca n't help it ! MISS DYER . I think Sir Frederick will come to his aid . And since we 're discussing the subject  --  MILDRED . Dear Miss Dyer , we 're not discussing the subject . MISS DYER . Yes  --  I 'm not quite sure we ought ! ( Enter NORMAN BYNG through the ante-room from the right . ) NORMAN . ( Hearing the last words . ) You certainly ought n't  --  if you mean reading my letters . MILDRED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Then as NORMAN takes the letters . ) There 's one with a dreadful seal . NORMAN . ( Looking . ) Governmental ? My death-knell ! MISS DYER . Oh , you wo n't die , Mr. Byng  --  you 'll get better . MILDRED . Certainly , my dear  --  if you nurse him ! I must take Sir Frederick his letters . NORMAN . You 'll come back , wo n't you ? MILDRED . ( At the door of the library . ) To hear if you must go ? NORMAN . Oh , I can read that without breaking the envelope ! MILDRED . I 'll come back . ( Exit MILDRED to the library . ) MISS DYER . In that case I shall be in the way ! NORMAN . ( Preoccupied , looking over his letters . ) Oh , Miss Dyer  --  do n't say that ! MISS DYER . You know that 's what I am here for  --  to be in the way . NORMAN . ( Still absent . ) I see  --  we must do our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DYER . ( With much expression . ) Be brave , then , Mr. Byng , and face it at whatever cost ! NORMAN . ( Surprised at her manner . ) It 's all in the day 's work . MISS DYER . You wo n't go without bidding me good-bye ? NORMAN . Oh , dear no ! Good-bye now , if you like . MISS DYER . ( Gazing at him a moment ; then with unspeakable reproach . ) Farewell ! ( Exit MISS DYER to the drawing-room . ) NORMAN . ( Alone . ) She is a " companion " with a vengeance ! She was engaged to be Mildred 's , but she seems to want to be mine . ( Re-enter MILDRED from the library . ) My dear child , the bolt has fallen  --  the end of these golden days . MILDRED . ( With a soft sigh of wonder and regret . ) So suddenly  --  so soon ? NORMAN . Does n't it seem only yesterday that I came ? MILDRED . ( Musing . ) I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a difference . NORMAN . Ah , they come quickly , such differences as that ! MILDRED . Is n't it wonderful ?  --  when everything is changed ! NORMAN . Yes , a great new life is born , somehow , in a little instant of time . We 've got to take care of it , Mildred  --  we 've got to bring it up ! MILDRED . ( Smiling sadly . ) I hope you do n't think it 's delicate . NORMAN . I daresay it will thrive ! ( Grave , tender . ) It 's " promising "  --  it will be the support of our old age . MILDRED . Our old age ? Shall we have to wait for that ? NORMAN . I mean it will be the security , the foundation of our future . That 's what you 've done for me , darling  --  you 've made me a future . MILDRED . You 've made me a past  --  that began a month ago ; blessed memories after you 're gone ! NORMAN . Ah , think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MILDRED . I sha n't have to " think " of you  --  I shall see you , I shall hear you , I shall touch you . NORMAN . We shall be doing just the same thing , in that case , at just the same moment . MILDRED . We shall be together then , sha n't we , after all ? NORMAN . People are together when they hate sufficiently the things that keep them apart . MILDRED . You can trust me to hate them sufficiently ! NORMAN . ( Who has looked off through the wide window . ) This picture of peace and summer , of fragrant , fruitful confidence , of a kind of sacred safety , is the image of what has passed between us . I shall carry it with me , and it will be the world I shall really live in . MILDRED . But do n't take it down yet ! Surely they give you time . NORMAN . Five days . They 'll do to break our hearts in ! MILDRED . They 'll do to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ; so I judge he 's coming to you . I must go . NORMAN . Do n't be nervous  --  wait for him . If our minutes are numbered , let us at least not be cheated . MILDRED . When you talk of sacredness and safety , what do you do with the wolf in the fold ? NORMAN . My father ? He 's the sheep-dog biting the lambs ! Yes , he 's sacred , dear man , but he 's not particularly safe . MILDRED . I 'm sure he 's going to be dreadful  --  he has his ideas . NORMAN . He 'd be so wise without them ! MILDRED . ( As the door of the library opens . ) Here he comes . NORMAN . We are cheated ! MILDRED . ( From the ante-room . ) We shall make it up ! ( Exit MILDRED to the right . ) ( Enter SIR FREDERICK BYNG from the library . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( Who has seen MILDRED . ) You 're not behaving well , Norman  --  neither is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse . ( Handing one of his letters . ) See what I 've just received . SIR FREDERICK . ( With the open letter ; glancing over it and handing it back . ) It 's a great relief to me . If this summons had n't arrived I should have been under the painful necessity of asking you to bring your visit to Beechingham to a close . NORMAN . You 'd have turned me out of the house ? SIR FREDERICK . Would n't that have been better than turning Mildred ? NORMAN . I may be utterly wanting in acuteness , but I ca n't for the life of me understand why you should turn either of us . SIR FREDERICK . You 're not in the least wanting in acuteness , but you 're remarkably wanting in delicacy . NORMAN . Do you mean because I 'm such a coarse brute as to be in love ? SIR FREDERICK . Be in love as much as you please ; but hold your tongue about it ! NORMAN . What good will that do me ? SIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as Mildred 's my charge . She came into this house , as you know , by no inclination or invitation of mine , two years ago ; when , the day after my return from India , my oldest friend , the friend of my earliest years , took it into his head to impose on me unexpectedly , on his death-bed as it were , the guardianship of his only daughter  --  of her unprotected youth , her unspotted honour , and her very considerable fortune . NORMAN . It was a favour to ask of a quiet widower  --  with so little experience of women ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Dry . ) Stanmore judged of my experience , and I appreciated his . His marriage had been deeply unhappy ; it had led him to make some gloomy generalisations , and to wish , perversely if you like , but intensely , to consign Mildred to hands other than those he had fallen into . In a word , he held that the best influence for her would be an honest gentleman as nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it sacred . But it has been a great complication . NORMAN . He overlooked your other incumbrance . SIR FREDERICK . You were in training for your career  --  taking your first far-away steps in it . He had scarcely seen you  --  he did n't focus you . NORMAN . Why should you assume that if he had done me that honour  --  SIR FREDERICK . He would have checked your aspirations ? I assume nothing , and that 's precisely why I do n't assume that he would have wished his daughter  --  simply because you 're my son  --  to bind herself to you before she has had a glimpse of another fate . NORMAN . The Rhadamanthus your early friend has made of you , sir , is a thing to make one beware of early friendships ! SIR FREDERICK . ( After a moment . ) Do that indeed  --  in every sense of the term : make the largest application of the moral ! Remember that when you reach my age , if you 've had time to have a past you also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on your back , and at fifty-seven you may have a good way farther to carry it . NORMAN . I should have thought your age delightful  --  it certainly makes you so ! But your description of it sounds indeed alarming . SIR FREDERICK . The more reason for keeping an eye on it in advance . Reflect on that , and beware of entanglements . I did n't  --  but that 's none of your business . NORMAN . None whatever , father . SIR FREDERICK . Do n't be impertinent . You are , horribly , when you affect to criticize me for not thinking it consistent with the dignity of my office to throw my helpless ward , who has seven thousand a year , into the arms of my ambitious son , who has nothing . NORMAN . I 'm not a beggar , you know . SIR FREDERICK . You 're the next thing to it ! You have no prospects to speak of from me . I left India with my pension , but with very little else  --  save the ruins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this moment , that I 've made up my mind to a tiresome sacrifice . NORMAN . The sacrifice of what ? SIR FREDERICK . The old lodge at Clere  --  the dowerhouse of the estate . I 've determined to let it . NORMAN . That will rather be a gain , if you let it to pleasant people . SIR FREDERICK . Pleasant people are what I hope for . They may make a little company for Mildred . NORMAN . Especially , I suppose , if there 's a sweet young man among them who has n't the misfortune to be your son . SIR FREDERICK . He may be as sweet as he likes  --  he 'll have to wait till she 's of age . NORMAN . Which , by the terms of her father 's cold-blooded will , is not to be till she 's twenty-two . SIR FREDERICK . That gives you the measure of his circumspection , which I rigidly emulate . NORMAN . So that as she 's only eighteen now  --  SIR FREDERICK . The sweet young men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first on the charming list , you 'll be so good as to wait in silence , and to go about your business meanwhile . In a word , you 'll postpone all further overtures to Miss Stanmore till she is in a position to reflect , to compare , to choose  --  to dispose intelligently of her hand and her money . NORMAN . Your conditions are hard , sir . SIR FREDERICK . If you rebel against them you give me a pretext for making them harder . NORMAN . How can they be ? SIR FREDERICK . My dear boy , do n't force me to request you to go about your business on the instant . NORMAN . ( After a moment . ) Will you give me the very few days they allow me at headquarters ? SIR FREDERICK . It 's lucky for you they 're numbered ! ( Crosses to the door of the drawing-room . ) But I count on your absolute discretion . NORMAN . You may count . SIR FREDERICK . Meanwhile kindly tell me if you 've seen Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she went to the drawing-room . SIR FRANCIS . ( Ceremoniously . ) Thank you . ( Exit SIR FREDERICK to the drawing-room . ) NORMAN . ( Alone . ) He wants to tell her to keep an eye on Mildred . Ah , Miss Dyer 's eye ! ( Re-enter MILDRED through the ante-room from the right . ) MILDRED . May I come back ? NORMAN . Yes , but I may n't speak to you . MILDRED . ( Coming down . ) And may n't I speak to you ? NORMAN . What good will it do if I ca n't answer ? MILDRED . We understand each other without words . Was your father very dreadful ? NORMAN . Quite ghastly ! But I 've accepted his conditions . MILDRED . And what are they ? NORMAN . To wait the four years . MILDRED . ( Dolorous . ) Ah ! ( After a moment . ) Well , I accept them . NORMAN . I ca n't tell you what I feel when I hear you say that  --  because I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , may n't I ? ( Re-enter MISS DYER from the drawing-room . ) MILDRED . ( Pointed . ) I 'm not quite sure you ought ! MISS DYER . My dear Mildred , I 've opened the new piano for you . I think you 'd better go and try it . NORMAN . ( Privately to MILDRED . ) Miss Dyer 's eye ! MILDRED . ( In the same way . ) It 's better than Miss Dyer 's ear ! ( Then aloud . ) What shall I play ? NORMAN . " When we two parted  --  in silence and tears ! " MILDRED . I know the air . ( Exit MILDRED to the drawing-room . ) MISS DYER . ( Looking at NORMAN sentimentally , and warbling the rest of the Byronic quotation . ) " Half broken-hearted  --  to sever for years ! " NORMAN . ( At the door of the library . ) Only for four ! ( Exit NORMAN to the library . ) MISS DYER . ( Alone , plaintive . ) He hates me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be obliged to make him hate me ! ( Then seeing MRS . VIBERT , who has appeared in the ante-room from the left , and stands there looking at her . ) A lady  --  a stranger ? ( Enter MRS . VIBERT , who slowly comes down . ) MRS . VIBERT . If I venture to come in unannounced , I 'll tell you presently why . MISS DYER . In these soft September days , in the depths of Devonshire , we leave everything open . MRS . VIBERT . I like open houses  --  and open hearts ! And I 'm not dangerous , though you look at me as if I were a gipsy . MISS DYER . ( Mystified , fluttered , but responsive ; having surveyed her charming appearance and French dress , and taken in her cosmopolitan air . ) Not the kind that tell one 's fortune ! MRS . VIBERT . I 've walked across your park  --  your park is lovely . MISS DYER . It 's not mine  --  I wish it were ! MRS . VIBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am  --  I know your facts ! ( Then as MISS DYER slightly starts . ) Do n't be frightened : I 'm sure you 've no secrets . MISS DYER . ( With superiority . ) A woman who has no secrets must be rather a frump ! MRS . VIBERT . Not so great a frump as the woman who does n't find them out ! What I meant is that I know about Beechingham Manor  --  I 've come to see it . MISS DYER . Are you under the impression that it 's shown ? MRS . VIBERT . Not in general ; but ( with a flattering , insinuating smile ) you could be my cicerone . MISS DYER . I 'm not quite sure I ought ! I have n't the honour of knowing  --  MRS . VIBERT . In the least who I am ? Je vous tombe des nues , precisely . MISS DYER . ( Pleased . ) I do know French ! MRS . VIBERT . Let me tell you in plain English that I 'm a possible tenant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIBERT . At the other end of the park . I heard it was to let , I 'm in search of a quiet refuge in the country , I came over this morning from a little watering-place on the Cornish border , I looked at the whole thing and fell in love with it . MISS DYER . It 's a sweet little nest . MRS . VIBERT . ( Who has looked about her . ) And in the shadow of such pleasant things ! MISS DYER . I do what I can here , but I fear I ca n't boast of my material . MRS . VIBERT . Whatever your material , it appeals to me , since I 'm to be a neighbour : it may make a great difference to me . So I sent the agent away and just wandered across  --  to explore and to propose . MISS DYER . ( With a slight movement . ) To propose ? MRS . VIBERT . ( Laughing . ) Oh not in the sense you naturally attach  --  ! But I 'm a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my landlord . MISS DYER . It 's a pity Sir Frederick 's so shy ! MRS . VIBERT . That 's perhaps only with you ! May I inquire if he 's at home ? MISS DYER . He was in the drawing-room a moment ago  --  he went into the garden . MRS . VIBERT . Could you kindly cause him to be informed that his tenant would like to see him ? MISS DYER . What name shall I have the honour to give ? MRS . VIBERT . Please simply say a lady  --  to treat ! ( Exit MISS DYER through the ante-room , to the right . MRS . VIBERT , alone , looks round her . ) It is charming , and if I wanted to reconnoitre I 've succeeded beyond my hope . ( Re-enter MILDRED , without perceiving her , from the drawing-room . ) MILDRED . ( Weary , impatient , while MRS . VIBERT goes up to look further . ) The new piano 's deadly flat  --  everything , to-day , is deadly flat . ( Seeing MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's not ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Seeing MILDRED and coming down again . ) Excuse me , mademoiselle  --  while I wait for your father . MILDRED . ( Blank . ) My father ? I have no father . MRS . VIBERT . ( Looking at her with compassion and admiration . ) Forgive my mistake ! It 's a pity : he would have adored you ! MILDRED . ( Simply , wonderingly , yet with a certain suggestion of mistrust . ) And I have no mother . MRS . VIBERT . Then you must let me be kind to you . MILDRED . I do n't know who you are , madam ! MRS . VIBERT . I 'm nobody yet , but tomorrow ( curtseying to her with indulgent jocularity ) I shall be your neighbour ! ( MILDRED formally returns her curtsey and passes back to the door of the drawing-room , where she stands looking at her . ) So we shall meet again . ( To herself . ) That will be up-hill ! ( Re-enter MISS DYER through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To MRS . VIBERT . ) Sir Frederick tells me he 'll come to you . ( To MILDRED , passing her arm round her . ) And you , my child , you 'll come to me . We 'll go out ! ( Exeunt MILDRED and MISS DYER to the drawing-room . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Alone . ) Now then , my dear , toe the mark ! ( Re-enter SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room , from the right , approaching MRS . VIBERT with businesslike civility . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( Inquiring . ) Madam ? MRS . VIBERT . ( After a moment . ) That 's not what you called me of old ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Startled by her voice , staring an instant , then utterly surprised . ) Good God  --  Eleanor ! MRS . VIBERT . Frederick ! SIR FREDERICK . You rise before me  --  after all these years  --  like the ghost of my youth ! MRS . VIBERT . And you stand before me , my friend , like the hope of my future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so young ; and yet you 're somehow  --  so new ! MRS . VIBERT . I 've been revised and improved : I 'm the latest edition ! Let me reassure you  --  I 'm better reading than I was . SIR FREDERICK . Ah , do n't speak of what you were ! MRS . VIBERT . Why should n't I ? When I see you again , I 'm not ashamed of it ! SIR FREDERICK . ( After a moment . ) What has led you to take steps to see me again ? MRS . VIBERT . Everything else that I have seen ! SIR FREDERICK . Eleanor , have you come to put your hand on me ? MRS . VIBERT . To lean on you , do you mean ? As your ivy there leans on your wall ! The wall can bear it . SIR FREDERICK . Oh , I 'm not stone ; and everything is different now . MRS . VIBERT . Different indeed  --  that 's exactly why I 've come . ( After an instant . ) My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , for you 're not in weeds . MRS . VIBERT . It does n't matter when . We had wholly ceased to meet . SIR FREDERICK . That was the case even before I knew you . MRS . VIBERT . Have I forgotten my circumstances then ? They were almost my exoneration . He was living abroad , but after you and I parted , after you went to India , he came home . Then I went abroad  --  to escape him . But I never really escaped him  --  till the day he died . SIR FREDERICK . What a history ! What has become of your son ? MRS . VIBERT . My son 's alive . Him we ca n't escape . SIR FREDERICK . ( Takes her hand and , bending over it , raises it to his lips . ) We do n't desire to ! ( He walks away a few steps and comes back . ) Did your husband ever learn ? MRS . VIBERT . He learnt everything . SIR FREDERICK . And what did he do ? MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Vague , helpless , compassionate . ) Dearest friend  --  ! MRS . VIBERT . I 'm paying still . SIR FREDERICK . Yet Claude 's now of an age to be something of a compensation : he 's  --  MRS . VIBERT . ( As he hesitates ; with a sad smile . ) I remember ! He 's twenty . SIR FREDERICK . And where is he ? MRS . VIBERT . Half an hour ago he was at that charming old house of yours that I want to take . SIR FREDERICK . Does he know ? MRS . VIBERT . He knows nothing . SIR FREDERICK . ( After an instant . ) My charming old house , I surmise , has only been your pretext . MRS . VIBERT . It may have been my pretext , but I want it to be my home ! SIR FREDERICK . Close to mine , Eleanor , at this time of day ? MRS . VIBERT . The closer the better ; and just because it is this time . It would n't have done of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for appearances then . MRS . VIBERT . So I am still . Only now I want them to correspond with the facts ! SIR FREDERICK . What do you call the facts ? MRS . VIBERT . Is n't the principal one that at last we 've found each other ? SIR FREDERICK . I 've taken for granted you 'd avoid me . MRS . VIBERT . I should have avoided you twenty years ago ! You drew me back to England . SIR FREDERICK . You had kept away ? MRS . VIBERT . For nineteen years . When I went abroad after you went to India , it was to live expatriated . But when I heard you had come back  --  SIR FREDERICK . You came back yourself ? I 've been at home two years . MRS . VIBERT . Yes , but you 've been buried . SIR FREDERICK . And you 're digging me up ! MRS . VIBERT . By the oddest chance ! I came down to Trecothick , which is pretty and quiet  --  and cheap , and happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of your delightful lodge , which took my fancy so that I made inquiries about it . I learned it belonged to you  --  a fact that , after my first astonishment , made me like it still better . I came over to see it , and then I came over to see its master . ( Pleadingly . ) He wo n't close its door to me ? SIR FREDERICK . How your early tone  --  the one that used to stir me  --  falls upon my ear ! MRS . VIBERT . Not surely then the tone of supplication . I never asked you for anything . SIR FREDERICK . ( After a silence . ) Never . MRS . VIBERT . Give me the benefit of that to-day . I 'm weary of the dusty roads , of effort and exile and motion ; weary of going from pillar to post and of all the beaten tracks and haunted corners of the Continent . For pity 's sake , let me sink down to rest in that sheltered nook . Let me take my stand there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall find a new interest in life . SIR FREDERICK . Why should you want a " new " interest , if you 've a son of twenty ?  --  assuming , that is , that he 's what he ought to be . MRS . VIBERT . ( After a moment . ) He is what he ought to be ! But it 's exactly for him that I want it ! I ask of you nothing for him ; I only ask you to know him . SIR FREDERICK . Since he ca n't know me ? Be it so ! But how strange it seems for you and him to have been so absent all these years only to be so intensely present now ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Smiling . ) You ca n't say we 've worried you ! SIR FREDERICK . You 've spoiled me ! MRS . VIBERT . By letting you suppose us in our graves ? Thank you . SIR FREDERICK . Eleanor , I feel as if I had been in my grave ! It 's I who have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant , how can I have a relation of business with you ? MRS . VIBERT . Les bons comptes font les bons amis ! Your house is n't dear , with your society thrown in . SIR FREDERICK . I should have to throw in more than my own . MRS . VIBERT . Ah ? ( After a moment . ) Have you married again ? SIR FREDERICK . For what do you take me ? I 've accepted a more thankless charge . MRS . VIBERT . You , my dear friend ? I do n't believe it ! SIR FREDERICK . You do n't do me justice ! I had a friend who did , when , two years ago , in dying , he placed his only daughter in my hands . MRS . VIBERT . The young lady I saw just now ? SIR FREDERICK . You saw her ? MRS . VIBERT . She was here a moment . She 's lovely . SIR FREDERICK . She 's good , clever , considerate ; but she makes me less independent . MRS . VIBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person as me ? SIR FREDERICK . Dear Eleanor  --  you 're terrible ! ( Embarrassed . ) Your grace , your charming forms , are on the contrary just the sort of thing she ought to have near her . MRS . VIBERT . I see : if they could only be found in some other person ! Perhaps they are found in the lady who received me . SIR FREDERICK . Miss Dyer , Mildred 's companion ? Oh , that woman 's an idiot ! MRS . VIBERT . So are most women ! I can understand that your little inmate should be a great responsibility . SIR FREDERICK . So great that it 's a comfort to gossip to you about it . MRS . VIBERT . ( Smiling . ) I ought to have come sooner ! SIR FREDERICK . You might have prevented my son from falling in love with her . MRS . VIBERT . Your children are naturally susceptible ! I was waiting for you to speak first of this one . SIR FREDERICK . Thanks for your delicacy . MRS . VIBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIR FREDERICK . ( After an instant . ) He can meet , I take it , any one I expect him to meet , and I look to him to consider that he has caused me embarrassment enough without causing me any more . MRS . VIBERT . ( Irrepressible , sincere . ) Frederick  --  you 're a pearl ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Blank , guarded an instant . ) Eh ? MRS . VIBERT . I 'll explain later : I 've much to explain ! ( Then after a moment . ) Mr. Byng wants to marry  --  SIR FREDERICK . His father 's ward . So he pretends to have discovered . MRS . VIBERT . Has the young lady a fortune ? SIR FREDERICK . A very solid fortune  --  and that 's exactly why . MRS . VIBERT . ( Vague . ) Why he wants to marry her ? SIR FREDERICK . Why I wo n't hear of it . Luckily he 's off to India . MRS . VIBERT . He 's in the service ? SIR FREDERICK . The Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's career , and I expect him to improve on it . MRS . VIBERT . ( Smiling , deprecating . ) Dear friend , to improve on his father  --  ! SIR FREDERICK . Oh , Norman 's very sharp ! MRS . VIBERT . ( After an instant . ) So I infer . When does he start ? SIR FREDERICK . I wanted to pack him off this evening , but I 've given him a respite . MRS . VIBERT . ( Arch . ) Procrastinator ! ( After another instant . ) The young lady 's very rich ? SIR FREDERICK . Seven thousand a year . MRS . VIBERT . ( With a suppressed movement . ) My dear man , it 's grave . ( Then after a further pause . ) If your son were to go this evening he would n't meet me . SIR FREDERICK . When you put it that way you humiliate me . MRS . VIBERT . Does it humiliate you to be helped ? I only want to help you . SIR FREDERICK . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever woman about ! MRS . VIBERT . It has been known to make a difference ! If Mr. Byng goes to-night there 's another person he wo n't meet . SIR FREDERICK . Another person ? MRS . VIBERT . ( After an instant . ) His brother . SIR FREDERICK . ( Considering . ) That perhaps would be better . MRS . VIBERT . Does it " humiliate " you ? SIR FREDERICK . You do what you like with me . Where is he , the other person ? MRS . VIBERT . I left him in the park ; he walked most of the way with me . SIR FREDERICK . If I were to go out there should I see him ? MRS . VIBERT . Perfectly  --  unless they 've turned back . But they were fascinated with this house ; it 's better than Clere . SIR FREDERICK . " They " ? Who 's with him ? MRS . VIBERT . ( After an hesitation . ) My dear Frederick , his tutor . SIR FREDERICK . Has he a " tutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they call abroad a preceptor  --  with young princes a governor . SIR FREDERICK . But Claude is n't a young prince . MRS . VIBERT . Far enough from it ! He has none the less inspired a loyalty , a devotion , on the part of a friend who has stood by us , in strange lands , all these years , who has helped to make a man of him , as a poor mother alone ca n't do , and to whom he 's inevitably much attached . SIR FREDERICK . I should like to see his devoted friend . MRS . VIBERT . For God 's sake do n't be jealous of him ! ( Then in another tone . ) You may see Captain Lurcher in the park . SIR FREDERICK . Captain Lurcher ? Is he English ? MRS . VIBERT . He has come back to find out . ( Laughing . ) So have Claude and I. You must pronounce ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Making a short movement toward the ante-room , as if to look ; then checking himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ! MRS . VIBERT . My old power is simply my old affection . SIR FREDERICK . ( Passing his hand over his eyes and head . ) Eleanor , you 're wonderful ! You bewilder me  --  you 've set all my life vibrating ! I want to pull myself together  --  I want to think . MRS . VIBERT . Think , think : the more you do so the better perhaps for me ! Leave me a little if you find me so agitating . I too shall be glad to recover myself , for our encounter has ploughed me up . SIR FREDERICK . I 've offered you no hospitality  --  I 'll send you some tea . And Miss Dyer to make it . MRS . VIBERT . I shall be grateful for tea , but I wo n't monopolise Miss Dyer . Leave me alone a moment  --  leave me with my shaken nerves . SIR FREDERICK . I 'm rather afraid to be alone with mine ! MRS . VIBERT . Go and find my companions then . Speak to them , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREDERICK . My answer ? MRS . VIBERT . About the lodge . SIR FREDERICK . ( From the ante-room . ) In five minutes . ( Exit SIR FREDERICK to the left . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Alone . ) The lodge is mine  --  and he 's mine ! ( Looking embracingly round her . ) I think it 's all mine  --  the dream come true : peace and security , credit and rest , quiet waters and flowery pastures . Dear old rural , respectable England , take me again to your bosom ! ( Enter FROST through the ante-room , from the left , with the tea-tray , which he places on a small table , afterwards going out . MRS . VIBERT approaches the table and , seated by it , pours herself out a cup . ) The tea 's sure to be good . ( Having raised the cup to her lips . ) Excellent ! ( Re-enter from the library NORMAN BYNG , whom she immediately sees as he stands arrested on perceiving her . To herself . ) Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Have you come for your tea ? Perhaps you 'll let me give it to you . NORMAN . I wo n't incommode you ; and , to my loss , I do n't drink tea . MRS . VIBERT . You do n't incommode me if you happen to be Mr. Byng . NORMAN . I plead guilty to that misfortune . MRS . VIBERT . I hope I sha n't make the case worse by mentioning that I 'm your father 's tenant . NORMAN . ( Who has crossed to the door of the drawing-room ; with his hand on the knob . ) Not worse for him . ( Gives her a still more searching look , which she returns ; then goes into the drawing-room . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Alone . ) So that 's the son , and that 's the suitor ? He 's not a trifle . But neither are seven thousand a year ! ( Finishes her tea standing . ) He must go to-night ! ( Re-enter SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room from the left . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . VIBERT . It does n't matter ; I 'll present them to-morrow . They 've returned to the lodge ; let them stay there . SIR FREDERICK . ( Demurring . ) Ah , my dear friend , there are difficulties ! MRS . VIBERT . I know there are . ( After a moment . ) Mr. Byng does n't like me . SIR FREDERICK . ( Blank . ) My son ? What does he know about you ? MRS . VIBERT . He was here  --  he saw me . I ca n't say I please him . SIR FREDERICK . ( Dry . ) I neither choose my friends nor drop them to please my son . MRS . VIBERT . ( Philosophic . ) You ca n't please every one ! But trust me to bring him round . SIR FREDERICK . I do n't think you 'll have the chance . MRS . VIBERT . ( Struck . ) In the time ? SIR FREDERICK . ( Hesitating , considering . ) Eleanor  --  ! MRS . VIBERT . ( As she watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do n't turn me away ! ( Goes back to the tea-table and pours him out a cup , handing it to him deftly , gently , without looking at him , as a matter of course ; almost as if in her own house . He takes the cup from her in silence , in a kind of charmed mechanical submission , drinks it while she waits and returns it to her , on which she places it back on the tray . ) SIR FREDERICK . The lodge is yours ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Taking his hand and raising it , holding it to her lips in silent satisfaction ; then as she releases it . ) It 's better , after all , that they should n't meet to-night . SIR FREDERICK . ( Vague . ) That they should n't meet  --  ? MRS . VIBERT . Your son  --  and mine ! SIR FREDERICK . What is there gained  --  if they 're to meet to-morrow . MRS . VIBERT . It 's better that they should n't meet even to-morrow . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From what ? MRS . VIBERT . From Mr. Byng 's stony stare ! SIR FREDERICK . His stony stare ? ( Looking at his watch . ) Mr. Byng 's going ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Smiling . ) You can act ! Well , it is better , if you really wish to nip in the bud any projects he may have formed  --  ! SIR FREDERICK . In regard to Mildred ? I hope you do n't question the reality of my disapproval . MRS . VIBERT . Heaven forbid I should question ! But the world may  --  the world 's so charitable ! The way to be right with the world is to separate the young people on the spot . SIR FREDERICK . Well , I had only given him five days . MRS . VIBERT . Do you remember what five days  --  when we got them  --  could be for us ? SIR FREDERICK . The more I see you the more I remember ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Sententious . ) If we had had more resolution our case to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) We must make the best of our case to-day ! I 'll see Norman immediately . MRS . VIBERT . I 'll leave you to see him . May I take possession ? SIR FREDERICK . ( After kissing her hand exactly as she has kissed his . ) You have taken possession ! Let me start you on your way . MRS . VIBERT . I must n't devour your time  --  you 'll need it for your son . SIR FREDERICK . I hate to let you go alone . MRS . VIBERT . Then let me wait till you 've parted with Mr. Byng . Do n't stand on ceremony  --  I mean , of course , with me ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Laughing . ) Coquette ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Laughing . ) Ah , not now ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Opening the door of the library . ) Please pass in here . MRS . VIBERT . ( At the door . ) Be mild ! ( Exit MRS . VIBERT . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( Alone . ) Mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) She clears things up  --  but I daresay I shall have a battle . ( Re-enter FROST through the ante-room from the left . ) Please ask Mr. Byng to speak to me . FROST . He 's in the drawing-room , sir . ( Exit FROST to the drawing-room . ) SIR FREDERICK . If it 's to be a battle , there 's all the more reason ! ( Re-enter FROST , and holds the door of the drawing-room open for NORMAN . Re-enter NORMAN . ) Frost , wait a moment . NORMAN . I 'm at your service , father . SIR FREDERICK . I must test that statement . ( To FROST . ) Pack a few things for Mr. Byng  --  for immediate use . ( FROST bows and goes out through the ante-room to the left . SIR FREDERICK looks again at his watch . ) There 's a fast train to town at 5.45 . Can you catch it ? NORMAN . Catch it ! Then you do turn me out ? SIR FREDERICK . I 've considered more fully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . NORMAN . It 's liberal of you , sir , to give me " half an hour " to start for the other side of the globe  --  for arduous work , for a detestable climate , for an absence of many years ! SIR FREDERICK . If you 'll give me your word of honour that you wish to linger for me , I 'll withdraw my pressure on the instant ! NORMAN . ( After a moment . ) It 's not altogether for you . SIR FREDERICK . Thank you . Frost is putting up what 's most necessary , and the day after to-morrow I 'll join you in London with the rest of your luggage and remain with you till you leave England . NORMAN . ( In the same tone his father has just used . ) Thank you . May I at least take leave of Miss Stanmore ? SIR FREDERICK . Is it extravagant to appeal to you not to ? NORMAN . I do n't ask it for myself , however much I may wish it . I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of irritated acceptance . ) I 'll send her to you , and I 'll make your arrangements . ( Exit SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room to the right . ) NORMAN . ( Alone . ) Damn my arrangements ! What has happened , what has made him wheel round ? ( Reflecting ; much struck . ) Who was that lady , installed there ( glancing round , as if for a trace of her , at the tea-table ) and with what do I dimly connect her ? He was warning me a while ago against early ties . Is she an early tie ? ( As MILDRED reappears . ) Oh , early ties are blest ! ( Re-enter MILDRED through the ante-room from the right . ) MILDRED . Coming in from the garden I meet your father , and he tells me to come and speak to you . What strange thing has happened ? NORMAN . Exactly what I 'm wondering ! He orders me off the premises , and I 'm only waiting for the dogcart . MILDRED . Then we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only our five minutes . Dearest , be strong ! MILDRED . Why has he changed ? ( Thinking . ) Norman , who was that lady ? NORMAN . Did you see her ? She told me she was his tenant . MILDRED . His tenant ? NORMAN . For the lodge . He 's letting it . MILDRED . And who were those men ? NORMAN . What men ? MILDRED . Two gentlemen I met by the lake : a strange young man , younger than you , with another  --  still stranger !  --  a good deal older . NORMAN . " Tenants " too , no doubt ! If there are so many , I must go off to make room for them ! MILDRED . I felt it hanging over us . We must have courage . NORMAN . I have it for myself ; but how can I have it for you ? MILDRED . Oh , I 'm not a coward ! You can trust me . NORMAN . I do trust you : that 's a blessing ! MILDRED . I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I  --  and that makes it doubly cruel for me to go . MILDRED . Never mind  --  if we 've perfect faith ! NORMAN . Do you know how you can show me the perfection of yours ? Call for me , cable to me , if there 's danger . MILDRED . Danger ? NORMAN . I do n't know what it is  --  I only seem to scent it in the air . At the first hint of it I 'll come back to you , at no matter what sacrifice . Do you understand ? It 's a solemn vow . MILDRED . I 've so much ambition for you that I shall have to be in a very tight place before I put you to such a disadvantage . NORMAN . Well , you may be in a very tight place ! MILDRED . ( After an instant . ) Then I 'll cable ! ( They separate as FROST reappears . ) ( Re-enter FROST through the ante-room from the left . ) FROST . The dogcart is at the door , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holds her for an instant in a silent , close embrace ; then he goes quickly up . Exit NORMAN through the ante-room , to the left . ) MILDRED . ( Alone , looking round her . ) The day has darkened ! ( Re-enter MISS DYER from the drawing-room . ) MISS DYER . Where is Mr. Byng ? MILDRED . Gone to India . MISS DYER . Without bidding me good-bye ? MILDRED . So it would seem ! MISS DYER . ( Disconcerted , wounded . ) I 'm not quite sure he ought ! MILDRED . Dear Miss Dyer , there are many things we shall not be quite sure of now ! ( Re-enter from the library MRS . VIBERT , who stands a moment , looking from MILDRED to MISS DYER . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Graciously , to MISS DYER . ) Would you kindly let Sir Frederick know I 'm ready ? ( MISS DYER bows and goes out through the ante-room to the left , and MILDRED is left confronted with MRS . VIBERT . ) MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as if you 'd lost something . MILDRED . ( After an instant . ) I 've lost a friend . MRS . VIBERT . Then we must give you another . ( Re-enter SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room from the left . ) SIR FREDERICK . I 'm quite at your service . MRS . VIBERT . Then inaugurate me ! ( She takes SIR FREDERICK 'S arm ; they pass up together , and MILDRED also goes up a few steps and looks after them . Exeunt SIR FREDERICK and MRS . VIBERT through the ante-room to the left , while MILDRED comes down . ) MILDRED . ( With confirmed alarm , staring before her and dropping upon a sofa . ) She is the danger ! ACT SECOND The hall at Beechingham on Christmas Eve , with decorations of evergreen and holly . Through the wide window which looks out from the ante-room the wintry landscape glooms through the gathering dusk . Lamplight and firelight within ; the Christmas blaze from a tall fireplace on the right , beyond the door of the drawing-room . CLAUDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little toy in his hands , a wooden figure that jerks up its legs and arms when pulled by a string . On the other side of the stage sits MISS DYER , beside a table heaped with Christmas packages and trifles , occupied in attaching to small objects the bits or ribbon by which they may be tied to a Christmas tree . Up at the window , with her back presented , stands MILDRED , looking out into the cold twilight , but turning away and coming down with a restless , preoccupied air as CLAUDE speaks . ) CLAUDE . If I were in the least like Bluebeard , I should venture to think Miss Stanmore like Sister Anne ! She 's always looking out of windows . MISS DYER . I 'm not quite sure she ought ! Perhaps she 's watching for the Captain : it 's time indeed he should turn up . MILDRED . I did n't even know Captain Lurcher has been away . MISS DYER . For a whole week in London  --  on very important business . MILDRED . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Well , I have ! But I 've been in correspondence with him . CLAUDE . ( With mock reproachfulness . ) I 'm not quite sure you ought ! MISS DYER . It 's a great secret , but you 'll see when he comes . CLAUDE . ( To MILDRED . ) Does n't that make you want him to come ? MILDRED . ( Completely detached . ) Not a bit ! MISS DYER . He must be in time for our great occasion  --  our Christmas tree , after dinner , for the village children ; and the old-fashioned dance , after that , for the dear simple people . We 've cleared the billiard-room  --  it has the best floor . CLAUDE . So that poor Sir Frederick has had to go without his game . MISS DYER . It has n't mattered , without Captain Lurcher to play with him . CLAUDE . Yes , Sir Frederick , at least , has missed the Captain . The Captain always lets himself be beaten . MISS DYER . He has such tact  --  I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be beaten once too often to like it . CLAUDE . Surely not by Sir Frederick ! MILDRED . ( After an instant , turning away . ) No , not by Sir Frederick . MISS DYER . ( To CLAUDE ; mysterious , important . ) I do n't mind telling you my secret . I wrote to him to buy some more toys for our tree ! CLAUDE . ( Laughing . ) What dark machinations ! But you were quite right . Too many Christmas cards with quotations from the poets ; and , for the dear simple people , as you say , not enough charming objects like this . ( Playing with his toy . ) MISS DYER . What good are the charming objects if you worry them to death ? Go and finish dressing the tree . CLAUDE . I 'll go like a shot if Miss Stanmore will come with me . Miss Stanmore , will you come and help me ? MILDRED . Excuse me , Mr. Vibert  --  I 'm quite out of it . CLAUDE . ( Flings down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleading , persuasive . ) Wo n't you do it for the poor little children ? MILDRED . ( After an instant . ) Well ! for the poor little children ! MISS DYER . ( To CLAUDE , rising and giving him a number of her packets of sweets . ) Then please take these . ( To MILDRED . ) And you take these . CLAUDE . ( With eager courtesy , intercepting the objects offered to MILDRED . ) I 'll carry them for Miss Stanmore . ( He bows for MILDRED to pass first , and they go up together . Exeunt MILDRED and CLAUDE through the ante-room to the right . ) MISS DYER . ( Alone . ) How nice he is , with his little Frenchified jokes and his little foreign ceremonies ! But what has got into her at this sociable time ? She , alas , is not sociable ! However , if she has n't confidence in me how can she have it in any one ? ( Then as CAPTAIN LURCHER appears . ) Ah , the Captain at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left . ) Welcome back , you brilliant fraud ! LURCHER . ( In travelling dress , an Inverness cape and gloves ; placing on MISS DYER 'S table a considerable parcel . ) Good day , sweet child of nature . Had you given me up ? MISS DYER . I shall never give you up ! LURCHER . I 've brought you a museum of curiosities  --  enough to stock a bazaar . And also ( taking a small paper of bonbons from the pocket of his cape ) a little private parcel for your own consumption . MISS DYER . ( With the bonbons . ) Chocolate creams ? You know the way to a woman 's heart ! LURCHER . Not down her throat , surely ! MISS DYER . ( With the larger parcel . ) Mildred and Mr. Claude shall suspend these to the branches . LURCHER . And where are those interesting young people ? MISS DYER . In the billiard-room , dressing the tree . LURCHER . With no one else ? MISS DYER . With no one else . LURCHER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MISS DYER . It 's not appreciated as much as one could wish by Mrs. Vibert . She has not been here to lend a hand . LURCHER . She does n't lend  --  she borrows . Sir Frederick 's at Clere ; I stopped there on my way from the station . MISS DYER . Precisely ; he lunched there : he went over at eleven o'clock . LURCHER . ( Laughing . ) Is that the hour he lunches ? MISS DYER . It 's the hour he has started  --  every day of your absence . LURCHER . ( After an instant . ) And when has he come back ? MISS DYER . Very late for dinner . LURCHER . ( After another instant . ) Most irregular . But if Claude has made up for it  --  MISS DYER . He has regularly lunched here . LURCHER . Coming also at eleven ? MISS DYER . Coming at ten . LURCHER . That 's quite as it should be . But there 's something else that is n't . MISS DYER . Pray , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! MISS DYER . I always disappoint wickedness ! ( Then as if to change the subject . ) Is London as shocking as ever ? LURCHER . London bored me . ( Gallant . ) My personal joys are here . MISS DYER . You 're a mass of corruption ! Is n't Mrs. Vibert coming over now ? LURCHER . Very soon , I gather ; she 's to drive across with Sir Frederick . But why do you worry about her ? Mrs. Vibert 's not our model . MISS DYER . She 's mine  --  for clothes ! LURCHER . ( Flattering . ) You 've not the need of them that she has ! ( Then as she flirts away a little . ) Will you listen to me ? MISS DYER . I 'm not quite sure I ought ! LURCHER . That will make it all the nicer . We might do so much together ! Union is strength . MISS DYER . Strength for what ? LURCHER . For success ! The making of the most charming young couple in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be the making of us . MISS DYER . Your theories are complicated ! LURCHER . I address them to a fine intelligence . You 'll win my eternal gratitude by persuading Miss Stanmore  --  as you have so rare an opportunity of doing  --  that the best guarantee of her happiness would be a union with that engaging , brilliant boy  --  one of the most finished , the most accomplished , the most amiable young men in Europe ; a flower of my own assiduous raising , a nature in which art and culture , the highest training and the purest atmosphere , have only added to the bloom of the rarest gifts . MISS DYER . Mr. Claude is certainly a perfect gentleman ; he does the greatest honour to your care . But must I remind you that Mildred already sees what you call the best guarantee of her happiness in a union with somebody else ? LURCHER . Mr. Byng ? Dear Miss Dyer , Mr. Byng 's out of it . MISS DYER . Out of what ? He 's never out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LURCHER . Then we must turn him out ! Everything 's against him . MISS DYER . That 's why she loves him . LURCHER . Yes , you women are so tortuous ! I maintain it , Miss Dyer , you 're tortuous yourself ! MISS DYER . It 's only because I wriggle in your grasp ! LURCHER . You 've been quiet enough in other hands . ( After an instant . ) Are n't you secretly pledged to Mr. Byng ? Are n't you in his interest and , if I may use the expression , in his service ? Has n't he bribed , suborned , corrupted you ? MISS DYER . ( Almost shrieking . ) " Corrupted " me ? LURCHER . It would be a deep regret to me to have to recognise it , for my fondest hope has been that you are free . MISS DYER . ( With intensity . ) Captain Lurcher , I 'm as free as air ! LURCHER . Then , in the name of all that 's bracing , do n't let us muddle away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high stake , a strong side . Mr. Byng 's in the torrid zone . MISS DYER . Yes ; and he went there with a frigidity ! LURCHER . Butter packed in ice ? Is that the sort of nature you 're enslaved to ? MISS DYER . ( As if breaking her chains . ) I 'm not enslaved ! LURCHER . Then do justice to our opportunity . We should be such common triflers to let it slip that , as a man of the world  --  for I am a man of the world  --  I should really blush for our form . Why ca n't we turn Mr. Byng out when we have a first-rate subject to turn in ? Our young lady has the plasticity of youth , and we have lots of time  --  we can work at our leisure . MISS DYER . ( Participating more and more . ) Yes , we 've months  --  we 've years . LURCHER . Claude 's taking , he 's brilliant , he 's near . Juxtaposition is much . MISS DYER . ( Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last not least , he 's in love . MISS DYER . That smooths the way . LURCHER . And I can do something , ca n't I ? MISS DYER . Certainly ! You 're taking too ; you 're brilliant too  --  and you 're " near . " LURCHER . ( Coming closer . ) Very near , Miss Dyer ! And I 'm also in love ! ( Passes his arm round her waist . ) MISS DYER . ( Disengaging herself with a nervous laugh . ) Ah , but you 're not twenty ! LURCHER . Not yet , but I shall be ! ( Pleading . ) You wo n't help me ? MISS DYER . Yes , if you 'll help me . ( Placing in his hands the parcel that he has deposited on the table . ) Take all this , to be hung on the tree . ( As he takes the parcel from her he gets hold of one of her hands , hastily kissing it , and goes up . Exit CAPTAIN LURCHER through the ante-room to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a man of the world ; and Mr. Byng did n't behave like one ! ( Re-enter MILDRED through the ante-room from the right . ) The Captain just went to you . MILDRED . That 's precisely why I came out . ( Then abruptly . ) Miss Dyer  --  he 's on his way ! MISS DYER . ( Blank ; then startled . ) Mr. Byng  --  coming back ? ( Quite aghast . ) When  --  why ? MILDRED . I ca n't tell you when  --  probably from one day to the other . But I can tell you why . Because I cabled to him . MISS DYER . " Cabled " ? MILDRED . Six weeks ago . MISS DYER . And why did you do that ? MILDRED . ( As SIR FREDERICK and MRS . VIBERT appear together . ) See for yourself ! ( Enter SIR FREDERICK and MRS . VIBERT through the ante-room from the left ; MRS . VIBERT dressed for the evening . MILDRED passes up as they come down . ) SIR FREDERICK . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MILDRED . To my room . SIR FREDERICK . And may I take the further liberty of asking for a few words of conversation with you ? MILDRED . In my room ? SIR FREDERICK . No  --  here . ( Looking at his watch . ) Say in a quarter of an hour . MILDRED . ( Curtseying . ) In a quarter of an hour . ( Exit MILDRED through the ante-room to the left . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( To MISS DYER . ) Our charming young friend is n't very easy to get hold of . One has to make appointments with her . MISS DYER . ( Agitated and obsequious . ) I 'll speak to her about it , Sir Frederick . ( Exit MISS DYER through the ante-room to the left . ) MRS . VIBERT . Your charming young friend hates your charming old friend  --  that 's the explanation ! SIR FREDERICK . That 's just why I want to see her . MRS . VIBERT . Make allowances for her . I can understand it . SIR FREDERICK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's more than I can ! ( Re-enter CAPTAIN LURCHER through the ante-room from the right . ) LURCHER . I 'm not much use with toys and little candles ; my strength is in other directions . SIR FREDERICK . Oh , Captain , I know your strength ! LURCHER . You know my weakness , Sir Frederick . But , fortunately , it wo n't be exposed so long as the billiard-room is given up to these revels . SIR FREDERICK . ( Surprised . ) Given up ? LURCHER . Go and see ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Going half-way ; then to MRS . VIBERT . ) Wo n't you come too ? MRS . VIBERT . Captain Lurcher will say we 're inseparable . LURCHER . ( Laughing . ) Oh , I must separate you ! ( To SIR FREDERICK . ) May I ask leave to detain Mrs. Vibert a moment ? MRS . VIBERT . ( Who has crossed to the fire , smiling at SIR FREDERICK . ) I 've to report on Claude . LURCHER . ( To SIR FREDERICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREDERICK . ( Nodding to the left ; alert . ) He 's there ? Be fair to him ! ( Exit SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room to the right . ) LURCHER . ( While MRS .

( looking down at the fire . ) Sir Frederick likes him . LURCHER . ( Imperious , abrupt . ) Then where 's that girl ? ( As MRS . VIBERT makes no answer . ) Where 's Miss Stanmore ? MRS . VIBERT . I 'm not Miss Stanmore 's keeper . LURCHER . She went out of the billiard-room as soon as I came in . MRS . VIBERT . Yes , and she went out of this room as soon as I came in . LURCHER . She 's an invidious little wretch ! MRS . VIBERT . She makes comparisons . She 's not an easy conquest . LURCHER .

MRS . VIBERT . ( Turning round slowly , with visible weariness . ) I 'll permit you to remark anything you like , if in return you 'll permit me to remark nothing at all ! LURCHER . On the principle that silence is golden ? Common honesty , madam , is more so . You were voluble enough last summer  --  then you had plenty of ideas . Our ship was in port and our cargo disposed of .  --  If our ship 's in port we 're forbidden even to land ! MRS . VIBERT . On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest for yourself . Remember that I never was in command . LURCHER . Which means that you 're as much as ever under my orders . MRS . VIBERT . So you periodically remind me . LURCHER . Your habit of presuming on my indulgence makes it necessary . I place before you the articles of our association . MRS . VIBERT . One would think they had been drawn up by a lawyer ! LURCHER . You know who they were drawn up by ! I 've always allowed you a latitude ; but now I fall back on our agreement . I take my stand on our Act of partnership . MRS . VIBERT . ( With sudden , passionate expression . ) I despise our Act of partnership ! LURCHER . ( After an instant . ) You never did till you came into this house . MRS . VIBERT . You mean I never said I did . There are a great many things I never said ! LURCHER . I see  --  and at present you can say them ! ( Then as MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme oppression , as of a checked longing to escape , passes slowly across or round the room , while he stands watching her . ) You 've been deucedly different since you came into this house ! MRS . VIBERT . You 've remained the same , and that will do as well ! LURCHER . I accept the imputation , as a tribute to my fidelity and consistency . But now I want to see so much virtue a little rewarded ! MRS . VIBERT . Four months ago your virtue took its chances and reckoned with its risks . LURCHER . The lovely day you swam ashore and dropped at Sir Frederick 's feet ? That was because that night , when we were back at the inn at Trecothick  --  and , as you perfectly remember , we sat up long and late !  --  you pledged yourself to do your best , to act your part . MRS . VIBERT . ( With rising impatience . ) And have n't I done my best ? Am I not acting my part from morning till night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's refreshing to find you do n't forget the conference which gave so much more intimate a form to our union . I consider that on that occasion the bond of our joint speculation was immeasurably tightened . MRS . VIBERT . ( Who has moved away and still away from LURCHER during his last two speeches , but whom he has followed round a part of the room ; with unspeakable fatigue . ) Merciful powers ! LURCHER . ( Authoritative . ) Come , madam ; our comedy is for others , but our arithmetic is for ourselves ! It was on speculation we came here  --  the frankest and the shrewdest ; and the brilliant idea was your own . I adopted it , I embraced it , and now I seem really fonder of it than you are ! Thanks to your disenchantment , we 're wasting our time . MRS . VIBERT . I 'm not in the least disenchanted . LURCHER . You 're pacified , I fully recognise , because you 're getting your personal returns . But what returns am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Leave the rest to Claude . LURCHER . I 've left it  --  for four months . How much longer do you expect ? MRS . VIBERT . As much longer as he expects . Time is an element in the question . All things considered , we 're remarkably secure ; we have a liberal margin , and a single act of precipitation may dash this advantage away . LURCHER . Perfect  --  I see . A game of chess on a rainy day , with a nice long nap between the moves ! Meanwhile what am I to live on ? MRS . VIBERT . You 've too fine a conception of life ! LURCHER . Observe that I 've had an example to set : which has signally failed , however , to impress my creditors . Pray , what have you done with yours ? MRS . VIBERT . ( After an instant . ) I have none . LURCHER . ( Surprised , resentful . ) You 've had money , and kept it ? MRS . VIBERT . I have n't kept a penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where 's your delicacy ? MRS . VIBERT . In my infinite patience ! LURCHER . ( Derisive . ) The refinement of your egotism . If you 're out of the draught yourself , you do n't care who sneezes ! MRS . VIBERT . I suffer when you sneeze in my face . But you need n't talk of draughts  --  you 've never been less exposed . LURCHER . I 've never been less guaranteed . You suggest that I live in clover ; but the clover 's over the fence , and I 'm confined to the thinnest grass . Miss Stanmore 's fortune 's the tender herbage , and I have n't had a sniff of that . You trifle with grave realities in affecting to sink , from one day to the other , the memory of the fact that for the last five years I 've laboured without a wage . MRS . VIBERT . But never without an alternative . LURCHER . ( Vague . ) An alternative ? MRS . VIBERT . That of simply leaving us . LURCHER . Leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sacrifice my investment before I 've taken a dividend ? Claude 's my capital , and I continue to nurse it ! MRS . VIBERT . You were paid with the utmost punctuality the first years you were with us . LURCHER . Yes , till your funds ran low . But the habit of devotion was formed . MRS . VIBERT . Without prejudice to the habit of calculation . LURCHER . Call them together the habit of obedience ! I promised your husband on his death-bed that I would cleave to you . MRS . VIBERT . Do n't speak to me to-day of my husband ! LURCHER . Why not , when he was the first to speak to me of you ? He made us acquainted . MRS . VIBERT . He made me acquainted  --  with most of the ill I know . LURCHER . You had to take what came ; you were so little in a position to choose . So when , in the last year of his life , I encountered a reverse of fortune ; when my old comrade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was looking for a position and you were looking for a preceptor to a certain interesting infant ( a first-rate , all-round man ) , he simply , in his perfect command of the situation , nominated to the post his most tried and trusted friend . MRS . VIBERT . Trusted , exactly  --  to poison even my freedom ! LURCHER . Your freedom was only relative , and the " poison " agreed , wonderful to say , with the delicate constitution of the infant . MRS . VIBERT . It was not for that it was prescribed . Your commission had another stamp . LURCHER . Sealed orders , to sink the vessel ? I spoiled Mr. Vibert 's revenge , and spared the precious child . Bettering my instructions , I had the perversity to take a positive fancy to my victim . Your know how Claude adores me . MRS . VIBERT . I know it from you , but not from him . LURCHER . ( After an instant . ) Then I advise you to repair that deficiency ! MRS . VIBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LURCHER . Let me have then , before I lose it , the supreme pleasure of repeating it ! On the day our young companion ceases to appreciate the man who has formed his youth , who has fortified his mind and set him , personally and socially , on his feet  --  MRS . VIBERT . ( As he pauses . ) Well ? LURCHER . I shall hold you responsible for the accident . MRS . VIBERT . You take a great deal for granted . LURCHER . I take all there is ! MRS . VIBERT . ( After a moment . ) What do you require of me  --  that is n't too base ? LURCHER . To make a better use of Sir Frederick . I need n't teach you what I mean by that , nor how to meet my views . Bring him up short  --  show him , so he wo n't forget it , what we rigidly expect of him . MRS . VIBERT . What " we " expect ? I never speak to him of you ! LURCHER . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . VIBERT . ( After an instant . ) Sir Frederick is to speak to Miss Stanmore this evening . LURCHER . ( Dubious . ) When will it come off ? MRS . VIBERT . Immediately  --  on this spot . LURCHER . Then I shall expect immediate results . ( Picking up his cape and hat . ) I 'm going over to dress . ( Then from the ante-room . ) I 'll come back to see them ! ( Exit CAPTAIN LURCHER to the left . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Alone . ) Ah , yes you 'll come back  --  and back , and back , and back : as one 's evil genius comes , as one 's evil passions come , and one 's errors , and one 's burdens , and one 's shames ! ( Then as she sees SIR FREDERICK : re-enter SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room , from the right . ) Have you been with Claude ? SIR FREDERICK . Helping him , upon my honour , to deck the tree . But as I set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIBERT . ( Smiling and shaking her head slowly and tenderly . ) He should n't turn you out ! SIR FREDERICK . Oh , I let him play ; the poor boy 's good for that . ( After an instant . ) Eleanor , I really take to him . He has lots of pluck , even though he has n't been at a rough English school . MRS . VIBERT . He has been at the roughest school of all , the school of adversity . SIR FREDERICK . Adversity ? with you to curl his hair ! MRS . VIBERT . Curling the hair does n't do much for a young dishonoured head . SIR FREDERICK . " Dishonoured , " my dear , is extravagant . And you 've assured me he does n't dream  --  ! MRS . VIBERT . Claude 's deep , he 's delicate : who knows what a clever boy dreams ? But ( after an instant , as if throwing off her fears ) we must never let him dream of that ! We 've done him a great wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it up to him . I 've shown you the way . SIR FREDERICK . Yes , I 've been trying to learn it . But , somehow , it 's hard to my feet ! MRS . VIBERT . With your position , your authority , your extraordinary advantages ? Be a little politic ! SIR FREDERICK . I see . You want me to strain a point . MRS . VIBERT . The virtue of the effort is the virtue of the cause . When one has strained a point to commit a wrong , one can surely do no less to make a reparation . ( Coming down after passing up . ) Mildred 's here  --  I 'll wait . SIR FREDERICK . Wait in the drawing-room . MRS . VIBERT . ( Smiling , at the drawing-room . ) Be very clever ! ( Exit MRS . VIBERT . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( Alone . ) I shall never be as clever as you ! ( Enter MILDRED through the ante-room from the left . ) MILDRED . You told me you wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 've wished to see you for some time past . MILDRED . There would have been no difficulty about it if you had n't been surrounded with other people . SIR FREDERICK . I 'm quite aware that you 've avoided me in consequence of my interest  --  so perfectly legitimate  --  in our charming neighbours ; and avoided them , more markedly , for the same reason . MILDRED . I do n't avoid anything or any one , Sir Frederick . I quietly go my way and bide my time . SIR FREDERICK . When Mrs. Vibert proposed herself as a tenant for Clere , my first thought was of the pleasant effect such a delightful person would produce at Beechingham . MILDRED . I 've fully perceived the pleasant effect . SIR FREDERICK . Then you might have done more to thank her for it . MILDRED . That would have given a false impression . SIR FREDERICK . A pleasanter impression than you 've succeeded in giving ! MILDRED . I 'm sorry I do n't satisfy you , Sir Frederick , because in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 've gone as far as I can . SIR FREDERICK . ( Smiling . ) On Christmas eve , my dear , one should go a little further ! That 's why I 've taken it as an occasion to speak to you . ( A little embarrassed . ) It 's an occasion , you know , for charitable sentiments , for give and take , and peace on earth , and that sort of thing . You know what I mean  --  it 's a solemn hour ! MILDRED . I assure you I feel its solemnity . SIR FREDERICK . Just so , but you must also feel its cheer ! Therefore I 'll mention to you that there 's a person in the house whom it would give me joy to see you treat a little more in the spirit of the day . MILDRED . ( Imperturbable . ) What person , Sir Frederick ? SIR FREDERICK . A young man  --  generous , ambitious , accomplished  --  in whom I take a particular interest . MILDRED . ( After an instant . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREDERICK . I " insist " on nothing  --  not even on your listening to Claude . I only beg you to let him speak for himself . MILDRED . He deserves a better fortune . SIR FREDERICK . What fortune , Mildred , could be better  --  ? MILDRED . ( Interrupting . ) Than making love to me ? He 'll tell you when he has had his answer . SIR FREDERICK . ( With a nervous laugh . ) You reduce things , my dear , to a simplicity  --  ! But that 's , in point of fact , what I want . May he have his answer to-night ? MILDRED . ( After an instant . ) Yes , to-night will be a good time . SIR FREDERICK . Then I 'll send him to you now . ( Seeing MISS DYER reappear : re-enter MISS DYER through the ante-room from the left , dressed for dinner . ) Miss Dyer , do me the favour to bestow your company on , Mrs. Vibert , who 's alone in the drawing-room . MISS DYER . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( From the ante-room , genial . ) Everything to-night is worth double ! ( Exit SIR FREDERICK to the right . ) MILDRED . ( Who has taken a telegram from her pocket ; with decision . ) Then this is ! ( Handing it to MISS DYER . ) Read it ! MISS DYER . ( With the telegram ; agitated . ) Mr. Byng  --  to-night ? How romantic ! MILDRED . ( Her emotion breaking out . ) To-night  --  to-night ( then suddenly , as she drops upon a seat , bursting into the hysterical tears that she has with difficulty repressed during the scene with SIR FREDERICK )  --  at last ! MISS DYER . ( At the door of the drawing-room . ) I wo n't betray you ! ( Exit MISS DYER . ) MILDRED . ( Springing up and brushing away her tears . ) I must n't betray myself ! ( Re-enter CLAUDE VIBERT through the ante-room from the right . He comes down quickly and stands for a moment confronted in silence with MILDRED , who has as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may speak to you , and he knows what I want to say . ( MILDRED has turned away from him ; he follows her a few steps . ) Therefore , perhaps , you 've also an idea of it . MILDRED . I did give him leave to send you to me . CLAUDE . I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart . MILDRED . You wo n't thank me , perhaps , when you know what 's at the bottom of mine ! CLAUDE . Let me know it , Miss Stanmore . MILDRED . A very real compassion for you ! You 're better than the part you play . CLAUDE . I play no part , Miss Stanmore , unless it be one to be under the charm  --  MILDRED . ( Breaking in . ) Of my unmistakable indifference ? If my studied bad manners have had a charm for you , you must have been easy to please ! I do n't apologise for them , because they 've been my only , and my necessary , defence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAUDE . You 're a strange girl , and what I do admire is strangeness  --  it amuses me , it appeals to me . I delight in originality and in everything that 's not  --  how do you say it in English ?  --  not banal . MILDRED . What I have to say I shall not say in French , Mr. Vibert , even at the risk of your not understanding it . You were brought here to make love to me , and you 've made it very well , considering how little you had to make it of . But you must stop to-night . CLAUDE . ( Smiling . ) Why to-night ? MILDRED . Because it 's your necessary limit . CLAUDE . Do n't say that at the very hour when you 're more charming , more lovely than I 've ever seen you before ! MILDRED . I say it because you 're in danger . CLAUDE . Danger only inspires  --  danger only intoxicates me ! I do n't pretend not to know I 've made no great way with you : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me serve my time , let me plead my cause ; let me submissively , appealingly ( with an insinuating , conciliatory gesture ) come a little nearer to you ! MILDRED . You 've a very well-stored mind , and a very well-trained manner , and I do perfect justice to your attitude . But I 'm still more struck with that of the people who are behind you  --  the people who push you on . CLAUDE . ( Surprised . ) The people ? what people ? ( Then smiling . ) It 's the passion I feel that pushes me on ! MILDRED . Ah , but who pushes on the passion you feel ? You 're too nice , you know , and too clever , to be a puppet in vulgar hands . CLAUDE . ( Blank . ) Pray , of what hands do you speak ? MILDRED . Of the hands that meddle  --  of the hands I 've never touched ! ( After an instant . ) Your mother can assure you I have n't . CLAUDE . ( Greatly moved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ! She 's the gentlest and noblest of women . MILDRED . I 'll believe as much when she proves it . CLAUDE . ( Vague . ) " Proves " it ? MILDRED . By taking you away from here . ( Then after she has gone up ; from the ante-room . ) Until she does that , Mr. Vibert , you must excuse me if I differ with you , and leave you . ( She makes him a formal curtsey . Exit MILDRED to the left . ) CLAUDE . ( Alone , wonderstruck . ) She makes my face burn  --  as if she had lashed it ! ( Passionately , as MRS . VIBERT reappears . ) Mother ! ( Re-enter MRS . VIBERT from the drawing-room . She goes to him , holding out her hands ; he takes them , she draws him to her , and he stands for a moment in her embrace , burying his head on her neck . Then he turns from her , brushing away a tear with his pocket-handerchief . ) MRS . VIBERT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , mother  --  something has happened to me ! MRS . VIBERT . You 're flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone . I guessed it , there , on the instant  --  it brought me here . You 've spoken ! CLAUDE . Yes , I 've spoken ; and she has spoken . MRS . VIBERT . And what did she say ? CLAUDE . ( Sombre , resentful , reflective . ) She said that I 'm not a man ! ( Breaking out suddenly . ) Mother , who am I ? what am I ? why am I not independent ? MRS . VIBERT . ( Smiling sadly . ) You would be independent , Claude , if you were to marry Miss Stanmore . CLAUDE . I should be something ( intently thinking ) that I 'm determined she shall know I am  --  shall confess I am ! I ca n't rest under her scorn . MRS . VIBERT . The scorn of pretty girls is the spice of courtship ! You 'll get over that . CLAUDE . She shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . She says I 'm put up to such ideas . MRS . VIBERT . By me , of course she means . CLAUDE . By you and by the Captain . MRS . VIBERT . If we desire what you desire , is that such a crime ? CLAUDE . Mother , I shall force her to think of you more justly . MRS . VIBERT . I do n't care how she thinks of me ! CLAUDE . Any wife of mine shall first understand this mother of mine ! MRS . VIBERT . If once she is your wife , I shall care less than ever . CLAUDE . ( After an instant . ) You do want it then , intensely ? MRS . VIBERT . I want it if your own pride , if your own heart is committed to it . But you evidently feel afresh that Miss Stanmore has ( hesitating an instant ) prejudices that will not be easy to surmount . CLAUDE . That 's exactly why I sha n't give her up . The way she treats me puts me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other way would do . She 's not as other girls are , and , before heaven ! I would do anything to make her like me . MRS . VIBERT . You give me your word of honour on that ? CLAUDE . My word of honour . MRS . VIBERT . Then let me kiss you . ( Re-enter SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room from the right . ) SIR FREDERICK . I do n't know what your mother 's kissing you for , but I congratulate you at a venture . MRS . VIBERT . ( To CLAUDE . ) Go and dress for dinner , and I 'll explain to Sir Frederick . ( Exit CLAUDE through the ante-room to the left . ) SIR FREDERICK . I told him he must dress here ; I 've sent for his things . MRS . VIBERT . It 's charming what you do for him . He needs all your kindness now that he has spoken to Miss Stanmore . He 's as much in love as you please ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Looking at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIBERT . ( Smiling . ) The genuine article ! SIR FREDERICK . ( After another instant . ) Then it 's a horrid bore ! MRS . VIBERT . Why , it 's all we require to be right . SIR FREDERICK . When it 's a case of squeezing I 'd rather be wrong ! I ca n't put Mildred on bread and water . MRS . VIBERT . You might put her on her good behaviour . She might sweeten your responsibility , instead of making it bitter . You 've twisted your life out of shape to make it fit into hers ; you 've given up your habits , your traditions , your privacies , your comforts , to carry out a duty you might perfectly have declined . Is she to do nothing in return ? to render no homage , to learn no lesson , to make no sacrifice ? SIR FREDERICK . ( Embarrassed . ) You forget , Eleanor , that after all  --  ( pausing while he looks at his finger-nails . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Waiting . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away I did n't disown him , and that if I challenged him  --  MRS . VIBERT . ( As he pauses again . ) Well ? SIR FREDERICK . I 'm extremely fond of him ! MRS . VIBERT . Yes , I must remember ! He 's your happy , lawful , acknowledged son , your fortunate pride and joy ! ( Suddenly , with a change of tone . ) Forgive me , Frederick , if I 'm jealous , forgive me if I taste to the full the irony of certain differences and contrasts . When I feel what my poor boy is , I 'm conscious at once of the elevation of his character and of the infirmity of every pretension he may ever make . SIR FREDERICK . Believe me when I tell you that I too , in much searching of my conscience , have thought these things over ; over and over , in particular , since the words that fell from your lips a while ago , the words about wrong and reparation . It 's late in the day to repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest wish . It 's not too late for me to have felt the advantage , the magic , of your presence here . ( MRS . VIBERT looks at him with quickened attention , the dawn of an expectation , while he goes on . ) Eleanor , if I may call you my wife we shall do something to help our son to call me his father . MRS . VIBERT . ( Strongly , exquisitely moved , but checking herself . ) Ah , my only friend ! SIR FREDERICK . We 're not too young , but we 're not too old ! Life will spread quietly round us , and affection , and rest , and reason ; and something we dreamed of in youth will seem at last to have come to us . It wo n't change everything now , for too much has gone ; but it will improve what remains , it will consecrate , it will harmonise . MRS . VIBERT . ( Shaking her head with mournful dignity and as if with a sense of hindrances and complications . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why not , if it makes us one ? Then , perhaps , on a basis more convenient , we can do something better for Claude than trying to marry him to girls who love somebody else ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Thoughtful . ) Something better might be something bad ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Blank . ) I do n't understand you . MRS . VIBERT . I mean it might be something strange ! ( Then in a different tone . ) You make me deeply happy ; yet you make me feel that I need to consider . SIR FREDERICK . Ah , do n't consider too much ! MRS . VIBERT . As you said to me four months ago , there are particular difficulties . SIR FREDERICK . Why , the beauty of this is that it meets and settles them all ! MRS . VIBERT . ( After an instant . ) Do you mean that , as your stepson , frankly adopted and patronised , Claude may have a better prospect with Miss Stanmore ? SIR FREDERICK . No , honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of Miss Stanmore again . MRS . VIBERT . How can Claude help thinking of her if he happens to adore her ? SIR FREDERICK . He 'll happen to get over it ! MRS . VIBERT . I see , I see . ( Considering . ) By marrying Claude 's mother you will have rendered him a service that will absolve you from further exertion . SIR FREDERICK . ( After an hesitation , with slight surprise and just visible irritation . ) You put it crudely , dear lady . I 'm disappointed that I should have to struggle with you . MRS . VIBERT . Do n't think me ungrateful ; all my heart goes out to you ! But , as you said just now , we 're not juvenile : let us therefore not be superficial . You attach to your generous offer a kind of condition , of stipulation . The price of my position here will be that I shall do my best to keep Miss Stanmore for Mr. Byng . SIR FREDERICK . Mr. Byng can do his own keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . It 's not his fault , after all , if he 's my absent and my elder son ! MRS . VIBERT . I thank you immensely for " elder " ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Still colder . ) I can account for your apparently very qualified interest in my proposal only by the supposition that you have hindrances that I am ignorant of . ( Studying her face a moment ; then breaking down , more tenderly . ) Eleanor , you 've some trouble you do n't tell me ! MRS . VIBERT . I 'll tell you some other time . Meanwhile , if I seem odious , I throw myself on your mercy . SIR FREDERICK . I 'll show you every mercy if you 'll accept me ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Oppressed , nervous , with increasing emotion . ) Give me time ; I must indeed think ! Go and pray for me , and go and dress . SIR FREDERICK . ( Laughing . ) We 're agreed that we 're not juvenile , but I shall show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exit SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room to the right . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Alone , dropping again in despair upon a sofa . ) Ah , when at last it comes , to be only afraid of it ! ( Re-enter LURCHER , in evening dress , through the ante-room from the left . ) LURCHER . Has Sir Frederick spoken ? MRS . VIBERT . ( Rising quickly . ) Sir Frederick has spoken . LURCHER . And what assurance can he give us ? MRS . VIBERT . He can give us no assurance ! LURCHER . In spite of your eloquent pressure ? MRS . VIBERT . You had better try your own ! LURCHER . ( Startled , indignant . ) You 've given up the case ? MRS . VIBERT . ( After a silence and with an effort . ) I 've given up the case . LURCHER . Well then , you 've had my warning . MRS . VIBERT . ( After another silence . ) I do n't care for your warning now ! LURCHER . ( Staring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead yet ! ( Then as if divining . ) Santo Dio , you 've been squared ? ( Seeming surer and coming closer . ) You 've got your price ? ( Eagerly . ) How much ? MRS . VIBERT . ( Turning for an instant , in vague distress , this way and that ; then facing him in desperation . ) How much , Captain Lurcher , is yours ? LURCHER . I 've told you before . Seven thousand a year ! ( As MRS . VIBERT turns away with the same blind oppression . ) If you 've really sold me , we 've an account indeed ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Seeing MISS DYER . ) We 'll settle our account in private . LURCHER . Excuse me : it 's the publicity that makes the settlement ! ( Re-enter MISS DYER from the drawing-room . ) MISS DYER . Is n't our little party gathered ? MRS . VIBERT . ( At the door of the library . ) I shall be here when I 'm wanted . ( Exit MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of face and manner . ) Well , Miss Dyer , I hope you 've been able to give me a lift ! MISS DYER . ( Very vague . ) A lift , Captain Lurcher ? LURCHER . As you promised an hour ago . MISS DYER . ( Now completely detached . ) I 'm afraid it 's out of the question . LURCHER . You do n't care then for my approval ? MISS DYER . I 'm not quite sure I ought ! LURCHER . You might have found that out before ! MISS DYER . Ah , then I did n't know ! LURCHER . ( Blank . ) Did n't know what ? MISS DYER . ( Seeing MILDRED . ) Ask Miss Stanmore ! ( Re-enter MILDRED through the ante-room from the left , brilliantly dressed for the evening . ) LURCHER . ( To MISS DYER . ) Why , her very dress is a promise ! ( Passes up with a salutation not acknowledged by MILDRED , who comes down to the fire . ) MISS DYER .

( Preoccupied , coming down . ) There 's no time now . LURCHER . ( Following him . ) There 'll be time to-morrow , then ! We 'll keep Christmas ! ( Re-enter through the ante-room from the right SIR FREDERICK , in evening dress . ) SIR FREDERICK . Where 's Mrs. Vibert ? MISS DYER . I 'll call her . ( Exit MISS DYER to the library . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( To LURCHER . ) What a pity , Captain , that our game ca n't come off ! LURCHER . Ah , Sir Frederick , our game will come off !

( To MILDRED . ) May I say three words to you ? MILDRED . I do n't recommend it ! CLAUDE . I love . I hope . I wait . MILDRED . You 'll not have to wait long ! ( She turns away as MISS DYER and MRS . VIBERT reappear ; and CLAUDE goes up to the left . LURCHER catches his hand as he passes him , and gives it a surreptitious shake of approbation . Re-enter from the library MISS DYER and MRS . VIBERT . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( Looking round him . ) Well then , are we all here ? ( Re-enter , as he speaks , NORMAN BYNG through the ante-room from the left , in travelling dress . ) NORMAN .

( To NORMAN , as he rapidly comes to her . ) That 's why I called you ! ACT THIRD The hall at Beechingham as in Act Second ; early on the next afternoon . CLAUDE VIBERT on a sofa , leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands . Enter through the ante-room from the left CAPTAIN LURCHER , from church . LURCHER . So you 're here , my boy ? and in spite of your regimentals you did n't turn up at church ? CLAUDE . I went to the door with my mother , but I did n't go in . LURCHER . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was worried , restless , nervous . LURCHER . I noticed as much this morning , being early on the scene ! CLAUDE . ( Getting up . ) You 're always early on the scene ! LURCHER . That habit 's precisely what has brought me here now , before they come back from their devotions . At the end of half an hour I saw you would n't turn up , and I slipped out  --  I was near the door  --  on the chance of this particular treat . I went home , but you were n't at home : so I said to myself , " When he 's not at home  --  " CLAUDE . ( Breaking in . ) " He 's mooning at the big house ! " He is , Captain ; he 's waiting till church is out . But he 's almost as ill at ease here as he would have been under a sermon . LURCHER . You have n't escaped a sermon from your chaplain in ordinary ! I 've come to do you good . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to ourselves . CLAUDE . ( Thoughtful . ) The big house and the little house will come to the same thing in the light of my mother 's marriage . LURCHER . ( Disgusted . ) Oh , your mother 's marriage  --  ! CLAUDE . ( Struck . ) Do n't you do her the honour to approve of it ? LURCHER . ( As if struck , on his side , with something in CLAUDE 'S tone ; then very deliberate . ) It 's not your mother we want for the nuptial altar . My dear Claude , it 's your mother 's son . CLAUDE . ( Going up ; detached , irresponsive . ) Your interest in the family discriminates ! LURCHER . ( Seated on the sofa and watching him . ) Is it your stepbrother who makes you nervous ? CLAUDE . My stepbrother ? LURCHER . Is n't that what your mother 's transformation makes of Mr. Byng ? CLAUDE . ( After an instant 's thought ; coming down again . ) He 's no relation to me ! LURCHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure it out . His sudden return adds a nasty number to the sum ! CLAUDE . His sudden return 's his own affair . I 've nothing to do with it ! LURCHER . It 's a delicate attention to his father , whose marriage , at this time of day , requires , no doubt , his supervision . CLAUDE . Is his father afraid of him ? LURCHER . It 's a compliment also to your mother , unless , peradventure , it 's a criticism . CLAUDE . Is my mother afraid of him ? LURCHER . I ca n't answer for her courage ! But I see that I can for yours , which , as we used to say , is what was to be demonstrated . I should be ashamed of my creation if my creation broke down ! CLAUDE . There can be but one consequence , for me , of Mr. Byng 's return : to do before his face exactly as I would have done behind his back . That 's rudimentary . LURCHER . ( Laughing . ) And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something due to one 's mere dignity . LURCHER . For mere dignity you 're a very prince ! Continue to sustain the character . CLAUDE . If I have n't backed out for her attitude  --  LURCHER . ( Breaking in . ) You wo n't back out for his , eh ? I should like to see you ! CLAUDE . The sight of them together , last night in our dance , was a torment that only made me take a vow . LURCHER . To get in ahead ? I back you heavily . ( Then after an instant , suggestive . ) He was a danger only by his absence . On the spot he 's a common fellow ! CLAUDE . ( After an instant . ) Candidly , where 's his distinction ? LURCHER . ( Laughing . ) Some day the young lady will ask you ! CLAUDE . ( Thinking . ) If I can make him think me a danger  --  ! LURCHER . All you 've got to do is to be one ! ( Going up and coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLAUDE . Please go out then . LURCHER . I 'll smoke my cigar on the terrace . ( Enter NORMAN BYNG and MILDRED through the ante-room from the left , from church , and come down together with CLAUDE on the right of the stage , before the fire , and LURCHER on the left . ) NORMAN . Good morning , Mr. Vibert . ( To LURCHER . ) Good morning . CLAUDE . ( To MILDRED . ) I 'm rather early , but Sir Frederick was so good as to ask me to luncheon . MILDRED . You 're always punctual . LURCHER . ( To MILDRED . ) I shall be punctual too , Miss Stanmore . Sir Frederick has done me the same honour . ( Exit LURCHER through the ante-room to the left . ) MILDRED . Sir Frederick showers his honours ! NORMAN . Of every kind ! But if Captain Lurcher has brought Mr. Vibert over , he must of course be here to take Mr. Vibert back ! CLAUDE . Do you think I 'm so easily removed ? NORMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ! MILDRED . ( Privately pleading . ) Norman ! ( Turns away and goes up . ) NORMAN . Where are you going ? MILDRED . To take off my bonnet . NORMAN . When you 've done so , please go to the library : I want to show you some wonderful things I 've brought home . MILDRED . Delighted ! ( Exit MILDRED , through the ante-room to the left . ) CLAUDE . You must n't mind what you 've heard of me , Mr. Byng ; you must judge for yourself . NORMAN . That will indeed be wise , as it 's exactly what I came back from India for . CLAUDE . Your return , last night , added greatly to the brilliancy of our little fte . NORMAN . Your little fte had a lustre unexpectedly dazzling to me ! CLAUDE . Yet your expectations must have been high , if you returned on purpose to see us . NORMAN . They were , I confess ; but they 've been surpassed . I 've been admitted to a view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAUDE . In time ? Why , we 're not going away ! NORMAN . You 've made your plans to remain , I know . But I seem to see that they 're not yet wholly settled , and when plans are going on I 'm so pushing  --  it 's very meddlesome  --  as to like to have a finger in the pie ! CLAUDE . Your taste can easily be gratified . Since your father 's to be married , you 're on the spot to give him away . NORMAN . Just as you 're there to perform a similar office for your mother . CLAUDE . There 's none that may conduce to her comfort or her credit that I 'm not eager to render . NORMAN . ( After an instant . ) She 'll require every service you 're capable of . CLAUDE . ( Smiling . ) Perhaps you exaggerate the dangers to which she 's exposed ! NORMAN . Do n't say that , Mr. Vibert , till you know what they are . CLAUDE . When I listen to your threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what they are ! ( Enter MISS DYER through the ante-room from the left , from church . ) MISS DYER . ( Coming down as CLAUDE speaks . ) Threatening accents , on Christmas day ? ( Then after looking from one of the young men to the other . ) Do you know what 's going to happen ? NORMAN . Mr. Vibert has evidently a notion ! MISS DYER . As sure as the world , it 's going to snow ! NORMAN . ( To CLAUDE . ) Of course if you 're snowed up you 'll have to stay . CLAUDE . It will be very snug ! MISS DYER . What a change , Mr. Byng , from the torrid zone , and how you must feel it ! NORMAN . Oh yes , I feel it ! MISS DYER . We 're all so delighted to have you back . NORMAN . So Mr. Vibert was just telling me ! MISS DYER . ( With suspicion and anxiety in her manner . ) Gentlemen should n't gossip in corners ; they should keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I take my things off here ? CLAUDE . Dear Miss Dyer , we 'll even help you ! MISS DYER . ( Engaging . ) Mr. Byng shall help me ! ( Presenting the back of her bonnet to NORMAN . ) There 's a long pin there : do you think you can get at it ? CLAUDE . ( At the door of the library , to NORMAN . ) While you 're divesting Miss Dyer , I 'll join Miss Stanmore . MISS DYER . ( Alert , dissuasive . ) I 'm afraid she 's writing a letter . CLAUDE . Perhaps I can suggest to her something to say ! ( Exit CLAUDE to the library . ) MISS DYER . ( Taking off her mantle with NORMAN 'S help . ) When I said we all rejoice , Mr. Byng , of course I spoke mainly for myself ! NORMAN . I believe in speaking for one 's self ; that 's what I mean to do ! MISS DYER . I could see that last evening , when you suddenly burst in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come back for romance , Miss Dyer ; I came back for reality . MISS DYER . Ah yes , Sir Frederick 's marriage . That is reality ! NORMAN . We had better wait a little before we say so , especially ( seeing SIR FREDERICK ) as here he comes . ( Enter SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room from the left , from church . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( To MISS DYER . ) I 've left Mrs. Vibert in the greenhouse , selecting the flowers for to-night 's dinner , which , under all the circumstances ( looking at NORMAN ) must be exquisite , eh ? I wish you 'd go and help her . ( MISS DYER inclines herself and goes up , placing her bonnet and mantle on a chair on the right . Exit through the ante-room to the left . ) I 've a luxurious confidence in her taste . NORMAN . Are you speaking of Miss Dyer ? SIR FREDERICK . I 'm speaking of Mrs. Vibert . NORMAN . I 'm glad of that , because Mrs. Vibert is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should like to have three words with you . SIR FREDERICK . Permit me first a subject of my own . If I 've waited till this morning to ask you the reason of your unceremonious reappearance  --  NORMAN . ( Taking up his words . ) It 's not that you do n't want to know it ? Well , sir , the two subjects are one and the same . SIR FREDERICK . Do you mean that Mrs. Vibert is the reason ? ( Then on a movement of admission from NORMAN . ) What did you know about her ? NORMAN . What I could read between the lines of your letters . SIR FREDERICK . I see you 're as sharp as ever ! Why did n't you pay me the compliment of telling me you were coming ? NORMAN . Because I thought you might pay me that of ordering me not to . SIR FREDERICK . You deemed your presence , then , so urgent ? NORMAN . Extremely urgent , father ; and now that I 'm on the ground I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ! I would certainly rather be married with your participation than without it ; and I shall now have the advantage of hearing you express it . NORMAN . I must decline to express anything of the sort . ( The two men face each other a moment . ) Where was your " participation " four months ago ? SIR FREDERICK . ( Slightly embarrassed . ) I 'm keeping it for four years hence . You shall see it as soon as I can properly let you . NORMAN . Let it be a bargain then ! You shall see mine on the same occasion . SIR FREDERICK . Do I understand that you prescribe me the terms on which you consent to my doing as I like ? NORMAN . Have n't I a right to make conditions when I 've been wronged by trusting you ? SIR FREDERICK . ( Indignant . ) What language , sir ! What trust have I violated ? NORMAN . My just confidence that as soon as you had got me out of the way you would n't eagerly promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make to Miss Stanmore . SIR FREDERICK . You do me the grossest injustice . I 've taken particular measures that no overtures whatever shall be made to Miss Stanmore . NORMAN . I can scarcely regard them effective when she is , at the present moment , in the library , a prey to the odious familiarity of your young foreign friend . SIR FREDERICK . Can I help it if Claude is over head and ears in love with her ? NORMAN . You could help it well enough when I was ! But of course I labour under the singular disqualification of happening to be your son ! ( Movement of SIR FREDERICK . ) If you make so much of your good faith , will you give me a signal proof of it ? Will you order that little humbug out of the house . SIR FREDERICK . ( Greatly moved . ) Your manner of dealing with the question , sir , makes it unworthy of me to meet you . Mr. Vibert  --  Mr. Vibert  --  ( Faltering . ) NORMAN . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person in the world whom I most cherish and respect . NORMAN . That 's very well for you ; but I 'm not so heavily handicapped ! Since you wash your hands so completely of my interests , I shall simply look after them myself . ( Strides towards the library . ) SIR FREDERICK . ( Alarmed . ) Where are you going ? NORMAN . To show him the way to the door ! SIR FREDERICK . ( Passing quickly before him to the entrance of the library and defending it . ) Do n't touch him , at your cost ! ( As MRS . VIBERT appears in the ante-room ; in a different tone . ) I appeal to you in God 's name ! ( Enter through the ante-room from the left MRS . VIBERT , from church and from the greenhouse , accompanied by MISS DYER . With her hands full of the finest flowers and foliage , as she pauses , as if struck by the mutual attitude of the two men , looking from one of them to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MISS DYER , who also has flowers , does the same . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( To MISS DYER . ) Would you kindly keep my mantle for me ? ( MISS DYER helps her to take the mantle off , and goes out with it through the ante-room to the left . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Who has selected a white rose from the flowers on the table ; to NORMAN , coming down . ) Will you accept from me , on Christmas day , this modest peace-offering ? ( NORMAN takes the flower from her in silence , looks at her a moment ; then turning to go up , flings it on a table . MRS . VIBERT looks at SIR FREDERICK , who extends his clasped hands to her appealingly , deprecatingly , as if to confess that there is grave trouble ; on which she says to him . ) May I speak to him alone ? SIR FREDERICK . Do what you can , and come and tell me ! ( Exit SIR FREDERICK through the ante-room to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is at the drawing-room door . ) Mr. Byng , will you listen to me a moment ? ( Then as NORMAN assents slightly , in silence , and comes down . ) Your father and I are very old friends . NORMAN . That , madam , is your own affair . MRS . VIBERT . ( As if without hearing his remark . ) So that the understanding we have come to in the afternoon of life , which strikes you as abrupt and unexplained , is really only the fulfilment of an early dream . NORMAN . I 've nothing to do with your early dreams ; I 've nothing to do with my father 's ; and I ask you for no explanations . MRS . VIBERT . I shall do my utmost to make him happy . NORMAN . And what will you do to make me so ? MRS . VIBERT . ( After an instant . ) Whatever you demand of me . NORMAN . Then take your son out of the house ! MRS . VIBERT . ( With a moan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN LURCHER . ) Do n't speak of that now ! ( Re-enter CAPTAIN LURCHER through the ante-room from the left , looking hard as he comes down from MRS . VIBERT to NORMAN . ) LURCHER . ( To MRS . VIBERT . ) I saw you come in just now , and as I happen to desire particularly to speak to you , I 've taken the liberty to follow you for the purpose . MRS . VIBERT . It 's very good of you to be so eager ! LURCHER . I only waited to finish my cigar . MRS . VIBERT . ( To NORMAN . ) We 're interrupted , Mr. Byng ; but I 've more to say to you . Will you grant me the precious favour of another moment ? NORMAN . To what purpose ? MRS . VIBERT . ( After an instant ; abrupt . ) Mr. Byng , I beseech you ! NORMAN . I 'll come back ; with Captain Lurcher 's gracious leave . ( Exit NORMAN through the ante-room to the right . ) LURCHER . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go too far , it 's beginning to snow ! ( Then to MRS . VIBERT . ) We shall be buried here for the day . MRS . VIBERT . Charming news , in your company ! Is n't the nightmare of your perpetual presence enough at home , without the confusion and the shame of it here ? LURCHER . Dear lady , it was precisely to make you taste that bitterness that I asked for this audience . I could n't administer the draught last night ; that 's why my present minutes are precious . What do you wish to say to our rude young friend ? MRS . VIBERT . What do you wish to say to me ? LURCHER . That you 'll please answer that question . ( Then as she remains silent . ) By which of the most irresistible of your arts are you winning him over ? MRS . VIBERT . By the exercise of one you never practise  --  speaking the simple truth . LURCHER . I never speak it to the wrong person ; but Mrs. Vibert should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right one ! MRS . VIBERT . You explain this aggression by your wish to gain time . Do n't you perceive you 're already too late ? LURCHER . It 's never too late to mend ! You favoured me yesterday with an intimation which I confess I did n't wholly understand . But I grasp it better now , for Sir Frederick 's brilliant announcement has lighted up the prospect . Your marriage is an exchange of commodities , a neat little commercial transaction . He gives you a home , an income , a future , a position ; and you give him  --  MRS . VIBERT . ( As he pauses . ) You 've not the least idea what ! LURCHER . I beg your pardon  --  the assurance that you wo n't worry him any more . You hand him over the contract by which you 're indissolubly tied to me , and you flatter yourself that he can burn it up . Dear lady , I 've looked after that : it 's more adapted to quench a flame than to feed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've stupid moments . Do n't you see the difference Mr. Byng 's return has made ? LURCHER . What did you know of Mr. Byng 's return , when , last evening , before it took place , you basely sacrificed me ?  --  said to yourself , " I 'm all right ; dear Lurcher may go to the devil ! " MRS . VIBERT . You reproduce my soliloquies with a vividness ! LURCHER . Mr. Byng 's return has made a difference ; but it 's luckily all to my profit . MRS . VIBERT . You talk of your profit as a cannibal might talk of his diet ! There 's no provision for it in polite society . LURCHER . That fellow suspects you , he sees through you , he despises you . MRS . VIBERT . Did n't you just declare that I 'm winning him over ? LURCHER . I just declared that you 're trying to  --  which is a very different thing . He 'll prevent your marriage . MRS . VIBERT . Let me use your distinction  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn you out of the house . MRS . VIBERT . My dear man , I 've a lease . LURCHER . Not of this one . Therefore you 'll turn him out first . MRS . VIBERT . Again ? LURCHER . Practice makes perfect : this time you 'll do it better . You 've a grievance  --  you 'll work it . MRS . VIBERT . My grievances are taking a rest  --  I should have to work yours ! LURCHER . Mr. Byng 's attitude  --  his hostility , his defiance , his irresistible itch to insult you , are a precious resource to us . ( Looks at his watch . ) You 'll immediately make these things the basis of a declaration to Sir Frederick that your dignity is concerned in your not being exposed to outrage . MRS . VIBERT . So that Sir Frederick may request Mr. Byng to depart ? LURCHER . To minimise the danger of your own departure . MRS . VIBERT . You 're as clear as a bell ! LURCHER . I know what I want . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want it ? LURCHER . When you 've made your protest and Sir Frederick has made his concession , when you 've protected your position and got rid , between you , of the enemy within the gates , you 'll do the generous , you 'll do the graceful , you 'll reward Sir Frederick 's sacrifice by a sacrifice of your own : you 'll let him off his engagement . MRS . VIBERT . Do n't put it as if he had met another woman ! LURCHER . You 'll decline to hold the poor dear to a profession of preposterous chivalry . MRS . VIBERT . Do n't I perceive that the age of chivalry has come back ? LURCHER . You 'll return to the old footing . MRS . VIBERT . And you 'll do the same ! LURCHER . We 'll remain at the little house  --  we 'll cancel our surrender  --  we 'll have our hands free again  --  we 'll get Miss Stanmore ! Claude shall be sublime . MRS . VIBERT . ( After a silence . ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat his passion , eh ? MRS . VIBERT . What if , between Mr. Byng and me , Sir Frederick prefers to let me retire ? LURCHER . You 'll make that quite too hard for him . MRS . VIBERT . ( After another silence . ) And the penalty of my not adopting your admirable programme  --  ? LURCHER . Is that the instant I encounter practical proof that you 've departed from it , I will , on this very spot if necessary , make known to Claude the unspeakable truth you 've succeeded in keeping from him ; announce to him , in the heyday of his spirits and the morning of his pride , that he 's a creature of shame , an indubitable , a proveable  --  bastard ! MRS . VIBERT . ( Sinking upon a seat , and seated a moment with her eyes closed . ) God have mercy on me ! ( Re-enter through the ante-room from the right , MISS DYER , who takes up her bonnet and mantle from the chair on which she has placed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of her entrance , as if , as she comes down on the right , to avoid her , goes up on the left and reaches the window of the ante-room , where during the next short scene she stands absorbed and looking out at the thick-falling snow . ) LURCHER . ( With instant urbanity . ) Dear Miss Dyer , I 've an attack of nerves . I should like to work it off at billiards . MISS DYER . On such a day as this ? I 'm not quite sure you ought ! LURCHER . I 've been so good : I 've been to church ! MISS DYER . For ten minutes  --  I saw you go out ! LURCHER . It was my nerves , and I hoped you 'd follow me . We might have had a quiet walk ! MISS DYER . You 're a very wicked man , and I would n't have come near you again if I had n't to get my things . LURCHER . Must you leave me already ? MISS DYER . I 've my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope  --  our affairs ! MISS DYER . ( Hesitating . ) Is n't that castle in the air blown down ? LURCHER . By Mr. Byng 's return ? I assure you it 's not so shaky ! MISS DYER . ( Thinking . ) I wish I could have your confidence ! LURCHER . You should , if I did n't believe you had already been undermined . MISS DYER . Undermined ? LURCHER . Has n't that fellow made up to you again ? MISS DYER . To me ? He has other occupation ! LURCHER . Then he 's the greater fool ! ( After an instant . ) You have my confidence . MISS DYER . I meant your impudence . LURCHER . ( As MRS . VIBERT comes down again . ) Have hers ! MRS . VIBERT . ( To MISS DYER . ) Will you kindly tell me what you did with my mantle ? MISS DYER . ( Surprised . ) Are you going out ? It 's snowing hard ! MRS . VIBERT . I do n't care what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll find your mantle in the morning-room . ( Exit MISS DYER through the ante-room to the left . ) LURCHER . ( Who has gone up to look . ) It is snowing  --  I sha n't budge . You forget that you 've an appointment with Mr. Byng . MRS . VIBERT . I shall not keep it . LURCHER . ( As NORMAN reappears . ) Not when he does ? ( Coming down . ) Stir him up  --  put him through ! ( Re-enter NORMAN BYNG through the ante-room from the left . Exit LURCHER through the ante-room to the right . MRS . VIBERT drops again on the sofa and sits gazing before her . ) NORMAN . ( Who has watched LURCHER 'S exit . ) Where has he gone ? MRS . VIBERT . I suppose to the billiard-room . NORMAN . I 've come back at your request . MRS . VIBERT . ( Rising . ) You 've a sense of justice  --  you 're willing to give me a chance . NORMAN . I may have a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore it 's useless to flatter me . MRS . VIBERT . I 'm ready to do something that will cost me more than that . ( After an instant . ) I 'm ready to send away my son . NORMAN . For how long ? MRS . VIBERT . Ah , you 're not gracious ! Ca n't you trust me ? NORMAN . ( After an instant . ) I ca n't trust my father . MRS . VIBERT . I 'll advise him loyally . NORMAN . Excuse me if I remember how you have advised him ! MRS . VIBERT . What do you know about it ? NORMAN . Was it not by your loyal advice that , four months ago , I was turned out of the house at five minutes ' notice ? MRS . VIBERT . What made you imagine that ? NORMAN . Everything ! MRS . VIBERT . I 'll confess to you that I cast my weight into the scale ; I deprived you of the few more days at home that you might have enjoyed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural reason . The single moment I had had the honour of spending in your society sufficed to convince me that you disliked and mistrusted me . NORMAN . ( Simply . ) How could I ? I did n't know you . MRS . VIBERT . ( Smiling . ) Perhaps that was exactly why ! You had a poor opinion of me . NORMAN . I certainly had not the opinion that you had come into the house to injure me . MRS . VIBERT . I did n't ! I did n't come for trouble , Mr. Byng  --  I came for peace ! NORMAN . Do you call this peace ? MRS . VIBERT . ( After an instant ; abrupt , passionate . ) It shall be  --  if you 'll help me ! NORMAN . I do n't understand you . MRS . VIBERT . Listen to me and you will . I 'm not a bad woman  --  I 'm only a very unhappy one . NORMAN . On the eve of your brilliant marriage ? MRS . VIBERT . Ah , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My son shall go to-morrow . NORMAN .

( Re-enter MILDRED from the library . ) Can you inform Mrs. Vibert of the whereabouts of her son ? MILDRED . ( Indicating the library . ) I left him there . NORMAN . I 'll join you . MILDRED . ( Who has crossed to the drawing-room door . ) Join me here . ( Exit MILDRED . ) NORMAN . ( At the drawing-room door ; standing an instant with his eyes on MRS . VIBERT . ) You know where to find him . ( Exit NORMAN . ) MRS . VIBERT . ( Alone ; after a silence . ) Poor little Claude ! ( Re-enter MISS DYER through the ante-room from the left . ) MISS DYER .

Mrs. Vibert and her son . LURCHER . ( Struck . ) Her son ? Why in the world ? MISS DYER . I have n't the least idea . ( Engaging . ) Should you like me to sit next you at luncheon ? LURCHER .

One troupe , the Hyers Sisters Combination , toured with a different kind of show : a full-length musical . The sisters , managed by their father , presented , with some success , several full-length shows during the 1870s and 1880s , including Out of Bondage , The Underground Railroad , and Urlina , The African Princess . In 1890 , a white Chicago theatre owner , Sam Jack , and the Black minstrel and vaudevillian , Sam Lucas , developed a minstrel show that included women performers in its song and dance . Their show , The Creole Burlesque Show , was so successful that it played in Chicago for nine weeks during the 1893 Columbian Exposition , and in 1896 was still on the road playing to mixed audiences . By 1896 , several more musical shows were crisscrossing the country . The most important of these were South Before the War ( produced by Whalen and Martell ) and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Many of the young Black performers of the period polished their routines in these touring shows , as well as in the vaudeville and minstrel shows in which they appeared during the off-season . One successful team of singing and dancing comedians , Egbert ( Bert ) Williams ( 1876-1921 ) and George Walker ( 1872-1911 ) , appeared at Koster and Bial 's Music Hall in New York City  --  one of the first Black acts to do so  --  where they received accolades from many critics . From 1898 to 1901 , they starred in several full-length touring shows : A Lucky Coon ( 1898 ) , The Policy Players ( 1899 ) , and Sons of Ham ( 1900-01 ) . All of these shows revolved around low comedy plot situations , and included opportunities for the entire cast to perform their specialities . In Sons of Ham , for example , Williams and Walker , in an attempt to fleece a rich Black man , impersonate two college students , Annie and Jennie , whom they assume , on the basis of the names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , they are revealed to be sons whose names are really Aniesta Babdola and Jenarusha Hassambad . Furthermore , they are jugglers , since the parts were originally played by a team of jugglers , the Reese brothers . In 1902 , Williams and Walker teamed up with writer Jesse A. Shipp , composer Will Marion Cook , and lyricist Paul Laurence Dunbar to produce a new show , In Dahomey . As was the theatre practice in those days , the creators reused lyrics from their earlier songs , brought in other composers to assemble a script that combined low comedy , ethnic jokes , and references to current social and political events . The names of the characters are drawn from minstrelsy . Reading through the program , one meets Shylock Homestead , a detective of sorts , whose name is certainly derived from Sherlock Holmes , the most famous fictional detective of the day . " Dr. Straight ( in name only ) , street fakir , " who is a faker , that is , a con man who runs a fraudulent lotion and cream scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who is literate ( a reader ) and can sift through official documents ; " Leather , a bootblack , " and so on . During the opening scene , Dr. Straight is attempting to persuade the crowd that his products , " Straightaline " and " Oblicutucus , " are the best hair straighteners and skin lighteners , respectively , on earth . To African Americans in the audience , this scene was a satire of the many advertisements that appeared in Black newspapers of the day . Similarly , in act 2 , scene 2 , Shylock 's friend , Rareback , tells of the exploits of Nick Carter and Old Sleuth . The satirical references here refer to the dime-novel detective , Nick Carter , whose Indiana Jones-like adventures were read by large segments of the audience that attended those shows , and to the pseudonymous author of mystery novels , " Old Sleuth . " Rareback 's story is so incredible that Shylock has difficulty in accepting it , and forgoes hearing the conclusion . In act 2 , scene 3 , in a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties faced by ex-slaves in their dealings with whites , when Mr. and Mrs. Lightfoot voice their feelings over whether their benefactor should be called " Master ( or Mars ' ) John " or " Mr. Goodman . " During its four-year run , In Dahomey was altered significantly . Several of the songs mentioned in this script were dropped in favor of new songs , and the final act , a pantomimed transformation scene ( the version printed here ) that left audiences somewhat confused was moved to the beginning of the show to serve as a prologue . Although Paul Laurence Dunbar and Will Marion Cook are named as lyricist and composer , respectively , they were not the only writers of the songs that were performed during the run of the show . Some songs , such as Harry Von Tilzer 's " I Wants to be a Actor Lady , " were interpolated , and others were written by the musicians who replaced Cook as conductor when he moved on to new projects . At the turn of the century , the most popular songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composers , including Victor Herbert , were lucky enough to have all the music to some of their shows published in piano-vocal score . From all the Black musicals produced before 1920 , In Dahomey is the only one that had a relatively complete score published . Surprisingly , it was not published in the United States , but in Great Britain , where the show , with Williams and Walker starring , played for eight months and gave a command performance before the royal family . Although this score represents only one early version of In Dahomey , it is still an important artifact since it is the most complete extant version . Footnote : 1Kb The songs in In Dahomey are characteristic of the many popular tunes around 1900 . Some of Cook 's songs reflect his training as a classical composer and violinist ; for the close of the first scene of act 2 , for example , he wrote " Society " in Viennese high operetta style . Others came from more popular genres . The finale , " The Czar of Dixie , " was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lyrics display a variety of styles . But Cook and Dunbar also use dialect as a device to represent class distinctions . Thus , in the opening of act 1 , the chorus sings in dialect to reflect on the status of the " new Negro " : Swing along chillun , swing along de lane , Lif ' yo ' head an ' yo ' heels mighty high . Swing along chillun , ' tai n't a goin ' to rain , Sun 's as red as de rose , in de sky , Come along Mandy , come along Sue , White fo'ks awatchin ' an ' seein ' what yo ' do , White fo'ks jealous when you'se walkin ' two by two . For the educated daughter of Cicero Lightfoot , however , the lyric is high art : Love looks not at estate , oh No ! ' T were folly one should think it so .

An old gentleman living in Gatorville , Florida , being a little superstitious ( business for RARE and SHY ) has lost an insignificant article to which he sets great store .

Now , I 've come to the conclusion that the old man in question has not lost the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article from himself , as it were .

Then we 'll go down to Gatorville , Florida , for a bluff , live a week in clover , then give the old man the box and get the five hundred , eh ? ( slaps SHY on the shoulder ) SHY Get the money first . The way you tell that sounds so natural . I could feel myself separatin ' that old man from that five hundred ... if it was n't for that cat .

Nick Carter is the only man living that 's been shot through the heart forty-one times , and Old Sleuth 's been knocked in the head with his arms tied behind him and a gag in his mouth and throwed in every sewer in the country . SHY With that kind of treatment as a regular diet , how long is a man supposed to last ? RARE Why say , Shy , that ai n't nothin ' . Old Sleuth and Nick Carter were both sent out to a western town to trace up some bankrobbers . The robbers got word of it somehow and way-laid the train about thirty miles from town . Imagine a mountain pass about fifty thousand feet above the level of the sea , a bridge suspended in mid-air over a chasm one thousand feet deep . A stormy night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship to be seen . The robbers , after removing the middle span of the bridge , fled like specters down the track to a curve a hundred yards away , and there behind a huge boulder lay in wait for the train . On rushed the fast mail . Every passenger was asleep excepting Nick Carter and Old Sleuth , and they were playing pinochle in the smoking apartment of the car . Crack , crack , crack and the whiplike report of a gatling gun rang out on the midnight air . Nick Carter was seen to rise suddenly to his feet and take from the hat rack a bottle of rye whiskey , take a drink and light a cigar and coolly raise the window to prevent the broken glass from entering the wounds made by the bullets of the bandits . Old Sleuth , always on the alert , threw a keg of beer out of window , and the robbers ceased firing long enough to secure the beer , by which time the train was well on its way to the deadly bridge , little dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim his corns , when Old Sleuth whose hearing was wonderfully acute said : " Nick , the middle span is out of that bridge ahead . I can hear the air sucking the broken rails . Something must be done and at once . Quick as a flash , Nick cut the bell cord with his corn knife , plunged through the window , caught the telegraph wire , which broke with his weight and swung him over the chasm . Letting go the wire , he dropped to the bottom , attached the bell cord to the span that had been removed , which fortunately had landed on a bed of marsh and remained intact , passed the other end to Old Sleuth , who had by this time reached the cow catcher of the engine and with superhuman effort , the span was snatched in place , the lives of the sleeping passengers saved . SHY How deep did you say that chasm was ? RARE One thousand feet . SHY Then I suppose this Nick Carter having rubber soles on his shoes , hit himself on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de car and played pinochle till he got to town . RARE Nothing so unreasonable as that occurred . An artificial lake at the head of the gap used as a reservoir became flooded and burst its banks , the torrent of water swept through the chasm and carried Nick Carter to the town thirty miles away and landed him on the platform of the depot just as the train pulled in with Old Sleuth standing on the cab of the engine smoking a Child 's cigar . SHY I know it 's taking advantage of good nature to ask any more questions , but would you kindly let me know if the robbers was apprehended . RARE ( laughing ) Now I can see that you are improving . Only a first-class detective would use that word " apprehended . " Yes , they were caught after a number of even more bloodcurdling incidents that I 've related to you . SHY Jist the finishing incidentals 'll do . RARE The robbers , after securing the beer that Old Sleuth threw out the windows , descended to a valley twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual measurement ?

RARE Nick Carter opened his satchel on the platform of the depot and took out an airship while Old Sleuth , unscrewing the top of his walking cane , removed a large electric light plant .

BY WILLIAM WINTER . IT seems probable that Shakspere based his comedy of " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " upon an earlier play . The " History of Felix and Philomena " is mentioned in the records of the " Revels " as having been acted in 1584 . That play , in turn , was doubtless based upon the Spanish story of the Shepherdess Felismena , which occurs in the second book of " Diana , " a pastoral romance by the Castilian poet , George of Montemayor 1520-1562 . The first published English translation of that romance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript translations of it existed in England at an earlier time . In that story , the lover , whose name is Felix , persuades an attendant upon Felismena to deliver a letter to her mistress ; but Felismena rejects the letter , and pretends to be angry because it was offered ; whereupon the servant drops it in her presence , and subsequently Felismena picks it up , and presently Felix and Felismena become plighted to each other . The father of Felix , however , compels him to travel , in order that he may repair to court and see the world . Felismena , disguised as a page , follows him to his new haunts , finds him devoted to a new idol ,  --  whose name is Celia ,  --  overhears his serenade to her rival , and , entering into his service , is made the bearer of his messages to that lady  --  with whom , like Viola speaking for Orsino , she pleads his cause . Celia falls in love with the page , and dies heartbroken , because her love is not reciprocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the scene ; but Felismena follows and finds him , reveals herself to him , and saves and consoles him , and so at last those lovers are united . Shakspere seems to have known several stories that were of Italian , French and Spanish origin ,  --  possibly having made acquaintance with them in plays that he saw , or read , or adapted , in his early years in London . In " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " the chief incidents of the story of Felix and Felismena are re-worked , but with a difference : the characters are made over , and new ones are introduced . Launce , a rare humorist , is , especially , one of Shakspere 's happy creations . The incident of Valentine 's assumption of the command of the bandits is supposed to have been suggested by a similar occurrence , in Sir Philip Sidney 's " Arcadia "  --  Pyrocles becoming commander of the revolted Helots ; but such freaks of fortune , in Shakspere 's day , seem not to have been uncommon , and it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a book . It was human nature that he studied , and human experience , much more than books . The comedy of " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " is assigned to 1592 , when Shakspere was in his twenty-eighth year . It appears to have followed " Love 's Labour 's Lost " 1590 , and " The Comedy of Errors " 1591 , and to have immediately preceded " A Midsummer Night 's Dream . " It was first published in the " Folio " of 1623 . The closing scene , with its exact adjustment of everything , shows some discrepancies . Valentine forgives with precipitate celerity , and Proteus is reformed with startling expedition , while Valentine 's magnanimous , though superfluous , proffer to relinquish Sylvia to the dishonorable , disgraced and undeserving Proteus , is both unseemly and unnatural . Some of the commentators believe that passages of the original have been lost . The text of the comedy is often remarkable for imagery , eloquence and music ; but the methodical balance of the characters and the reiterated use of colloquy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent feeling and swift and sure expression . Charles Knight 's theory , that Shakspere began to write for the stage as early as 1585 , and that the dates of several of the plays ought to be moved back , commends itself to favor , when considering the early comedies  --  particularly " Love 's Labour 's Lost " and " The Two Gentlemen of Verona . " It surely is strange that so much of Shakspere 's youthful manner should have survived , when he was brooding on his two great and favorite subjects , Hamlet and Romeo , and when he was just upon the point of writing " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " and " Richard III . " To the close student of Shakspere the comedy of " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " is particularly attractive and significant , because it contains the germs of several of the more substantial and complete of the poet 's creations . Julia and Lucetta prefigure Portia and Nerissa . Julia , disguised as the page Sebastian , and following her adored Proteus , foreshadows Viola , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Valentine and his outlaws , in the wood of Mantua , seem to prelude the Banished Duke and his benchmen , in the forest of Arden . Launce is the ancestor of Touchstone . Banishment , as endured by Valentine , glances remotely at banishment as suffered by Romeo . The portrayal of Julia 's character and experience seems a study for the larger and riper exposition of woman 's heart , in Portia , Viola , Rosalind and Imogen . But the piece is delightful for its own sake also , because it tells so sweetly  --  with so much refinement and melody of language , and with such keen though sometimes careless knowledge of human nature  --  a representative story of young hearts . On the stage , alike in England and America , " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " has had but a fitful and brief display . An arrangement of it made by Victor ,  --  marred with obscurities and impossible incidents ,  --  was brought forth in London , at Drury Lane , on December 22 , 1762 , with a fine cast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yates as Launce , King as Speed , Havard as the Duke , Vernon as Thurio , Burton as Antonio , Packer as Eglamour , Moody as Host , Mrs. Yates as Julia , Miss Bride as Sylvia , and Miss Pope as Lucetta . Victor made many changes of the original , wrote in some lines to arrange for an expeditious agreement of flight between Valentine and Sylvia , and introduced Launce and Speed at the close . A more correct version was acted on April 13 , 1784 , at Covent Garden , for the benefit of Quick , who embodied Launce . The cast then included Wroughton as Proteus , Whitfield as Valentine , Hull as the Duke , Chalmers as Thurio , the famous John Edwin as Speed , Mrs. S. Kemble as Sylvia , Mrs. Mattocks as Julia , and Mrs. Wilson as Lucetta . On January 15 , 1790 , the comedy was performed at Drury Lane Theatre , for the first time in twenty-eight years at that house . It was acted three times . The cast included Wroughton as Proteus , Barrymore as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thurio , Dodd as Launce , Bannister the younger as Speed , Mrs. Gordon as Julia , Mrs. Kemble as Sylvia , and Mrs. Wilson as Lucetta . John Philip Kemble , using Victor 's clumsy version , but making alterations and additions , revived it at Covent Garden , on April 21 , 1808 , acting the part of Valentine . Proteus was played by Pope , the Duke by Murray , Thurio by Liston , Launce by Munden , Speed by Blanchard , Sylvia by Miss Norton , Julia by Miss Smith , and Lucetta by Miss Waddy . An excellent cast ,  --  but the piece was acted only three times . At Bath , on March 23 , 1822 , the comedy was presented for the first time there ,  --  seemingly for Liston , who acted in it as Launce , and who played Bombastes Furioso on the same night . The cast comprised Vining as Proteus , Hamblin as Valentine , Bennett as Thurio , Woulds as Speed , Mrs. L. Kelly as Sylvia , Miss Jarman as Julia , and Miss Boyce as Lucetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author . Genest records that Liston acted very well as Launce , but that " he was obliged to pull the dog hard by the chain , which spoiled the effect . " That remarkable actor and manager Samuel Phelps produced " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " at his London theatre , Sadler 's Wells , on February 18 , 1857 ; but he did not act in it . In New York the comedy was acted a few times at the Park Theatre in 1846 , by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean and the stock company of that famous house . In adapting it for the contemporary stage , Mr. Daly has discarded about one act of the original , making a play which contains every essential point , and moves smoothly and swiftly to a happy close . The preparations for actions which intrinsically are slight , should not be more elaborate and important than the actions themselves , and , therefore , at several points , the progress of the movement has been assumed rather than shown  --  an arrangement whereby , in this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two scenes , the second of four , the third of two and the fourth of four  --  twelve scenes in all . A few apt lines , chosen from the chorus in " Henry VIII , " were added , as an epilogue , to be spoken by Julia , and ample provision was made for lovely scenery and for incidental use of the soft enchantment of delicious music . The sets for Julia 's garden and the exterior of the Duke 's palace will long be remembered as exceptional for mellowness of color , poetic grace of composition , and an opulence of architecture which , though magnificent , was softly beautiful and in exquisite taste . The thing that is perfectly well done always seems easy to do . The finer the quality of art the more spontaneous appears to be its method . Miss Rehan 's impersonation of Julia , even at the first , was definite in design , distinct in form , flexible in movement , and sustained with such exquisite repose and grace that it had the ease of " second nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That completeness of identification , however , was the close denotement of her genius , her intuition , her conscientious study , her facility of constructive art , and her versatile executive power . The " fine issue , " as Shakespeare himself observed , is the sign of the spirit that is " finely touched . " As a fact , aside from all seeming , a performance of Shakspere 's Julia which imparts to her a clear and lovely distinction among his heroines can be no easy matter . The character , like every other character in " The Two Gentlemen of Verona , " is only a sketch . The performer of it must fill it out , must sharpen its lines , deepen its tints , make it substantial , and invest it with allurement ; and all this with no aid of action and with only limited resources of situation and picture . Julia has , literally , nothing to do  --  and yet Miss Rehan , without being in the least intrusive , filled the play with her presence . Not a single detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominence . If anything , the pitch was sounded low  --  the spirit of the action being that which not advances but retires . Yet the effect was that of a spacious and splendid nature  --  of opulent womanhood , beauty and truth  --  of a delicious , enchanting personality , pervading the piece . No stronger proof of Miss Rehan 's superiority as an actress could be afforded than her performance of Shakspere 's Julia . She has acted in greater characters , and acted supremely well ; but in those greater characters there are wider opportunities . It is easier to succeed with Rosalind than with Julia . The success of Miss Rehan in Julia might well prompt reflection upon her brilliant achievement in other heroines of Shakspere , and intimate how truly she is a Shaksperean actress . Miss Rehan has acted Katharine , in " The Taming of the Shrew , " and has acted it with such fire and brilliancy , such indomitable power and such enchanting grace of womanhood , that the part is now exclusively her own ,  --  so that in theatrical history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Adelaide Neilson is with Juliet , or that of Ellen Terry with Beatrice . Prior to her time , " The Taming of the Shrew , " when played at all , was played as a noisy farce , for the sake of Petruchio . Miss Rehan restored it to the stage as a comedy . Her impersonation of Rosalind in " As You Like It , "  --  a striking contrast to Katharine ,  --  interpreted that character as essentially and deliciously human , and separated it , at once and finally , so far as the present generation of playgoers is concerned , from the old scholastic theories of a vague and cloudy abstraction . As Viola , in " The Twelfth Night , "  --  a character as essentially delicate and elusive as Rosalind is strong and brilliant ,  --  she revealed yet another side of her nature , weaving with spontaneous grace the gentle spell of wistful melancholy , ingenuous glee , and soft allurement . Seldom in stage experience has it been reserved for one and the same actress to be victorious in presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shakspere . It will be remembered , also , that she has impersonated the frolicsome Mrs. Ford , in " The Merry Wives of Windsor , " the sparkling Princess , of " Love 's Labour 's Lost , " and the passionate , gentle , forlorn Helena , of " A Midsummer Night 's Dream , "  --  the latter being one of the most exacting of all Shakspere 's heroines , because she must be made , as Miss Rehan made her , sympathetic and winning , while at the same time she is depicted as the victim of bitter self-conflict , under the stress of amatory infatuation . To have shown distinctly each of those figures , to have interpreted each character , making it no less charming than clear , and to have spoken the lovely language of Shakspere in tones that were soothing to hear and that are precious to remember , is to have gained a laurel that can not fade , and to have been a blessing that will always be cherished . Everybody who cares for dramatic art in our time honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poetry , beauty , and a high standard of taste upon the American stage . There were many merits in Mr. Daly 's sumptuous revival of Shakspere 's neglected comedy , but the chief glory of it was Miss Rehan 's purely poetic personality , which animated the comedy and fused all its scattered charms into one ideal of womanlike loveliness and grace .

Were't not affection chains thy tender days To the sweet glances of thy honoured love , I rather would entreat thy company To see the wonders of the world abroad , Than , living dully sluggardized at home , Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness . But since thou lov'st , love still , and thrive therein . Even as I would , when I to love begin . Pro . Proteus Wilt thou be gone ? Sweet Valentine , adieu ! Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel : Wish me partaker in thy happiness When thou dost meet good hap ; and in thy danger , If ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy prayers , For I will be thy beadsman , Valentine . Val . Valentine And on a love-book pray for my success ? Pro . Proteus Upon some book I love , I 'll pray for thee . Val . Valentine That 's on some shallow story of deep love ; How young Leander crossed the Hellespont . Pro . Proteus That 's a deep story of a deeper love , For he was more than over shoes in love . Val . Valentine ' T is true ; but you are over boots in love . Pro . Proteus Over the boots ! nay , give me not the boots . Val . Valentine No , I will not , for ' t boots not . Pro . Proteus What ? Val . Valentine To be In love : where scorn is bought with groans ; coy looks , With heart-sore sighs ; one fading moment 's mirth , With twenty watchful , weary , tedious nights : If haply won , perhaps , a hapless gain ; If lost , why then a grievous labour won ; However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wit by folly vanquishd . Pro . Proteus ' T is love you cavil at : I am not Love . Val . Valentine Love is your master , for he masters you ; And he that is so yokd by a fool , Methinks , should not be chronicld for wise , But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee That art a votary to fond desire ? Once more , adieu ! My father at the road Expects my coming , there to see me shipped . Pro . Proteus And thither will I bring thee , Valentine . Val . Valentine Sweet Proteus , no ; now let us take our leave . To Milan let me hear from thee by letters Of thy success in love , and what news else Betideth here in absence of thy friend ; And I likewise will visit thee with mine . Pro .

Enter SPEED . Speed . Sir Proteus , save you ! Saw you my master ? Pro . Proteus But now he parted hence to embark for Milan . Speed . Twenty to one then , he is shipped already , And I have played the sheep in losing him . Pro . Proteus Indeed , a sheep doth very often stray , An if the shepherd be awhile away . Speed . You conclude that my master is a shepherd , then , and I a sheep ? Pro . Proteus It shall go hard , but I 'll prove it . Speed . The shepherd seeks the sheep , and not the sheep the shepherd ; but I seek my master , and my master seeks not me : therefore , I am no sheep . Pro . Proteus The sheep for fodder follows the shepherd , the shepherd for food follows not the sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wages follows not thee : therefore , thou art a sheep . Speed .

Proteus Here 's too small a pasture for such store of muttons ; ' t were best pound you . Speed . Nay , sir , less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter . Pro . Proteus Beshrew me , but you have a quick wit . Speed . And yet it can not overtake your slow purse . Pro . Proteus Come , come ; open the matter in brief ; what said she ? Takes out his purse . Speed . Open your purse , that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered . Pro . Proteus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gives him money . What said she ? Speed .

Give her no token but stones , for she 's as hard as steel . Pro . Proteus What ! said she nothing ? Speed . No , not so much as  --  ' Take this for thy pains . ' To testify your bounty , I thank you , you have testerned me ; in requital whereof , henceforth carry your letters yourself . And so , sir , I 'll commend you to my master . Pro .

Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO . Ant . Antonio Tell me , Panthino , what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister ? Pant . Panthino ' T was of his nephew Proteus , your son . Ant . Antonio Why , what of him ? Pant . Panthino He wondered , that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home , While other men , of slender reputation , Put forth their sons to seek preferment out ; Some , to the wars , to try their fortune there ; Some , to discover islands far away ; Some , to the studious universities . For any or for all these exercises He said that Proteus your son was meet , And did request me to imprtune you To let him spend his time no more at home , Which would be great impeachment to his age , In having known no travel in his youth . Ant . Antonio Nor need'st thou much imprtune me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have considered well his loss of time , And how he can not be a perfect man , Not being tried and tutored in the world : Experience is by industry achieved , And perfected by the swift course of time . Then , tell me , whither were I best to send him ? Pant . Panthino I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion , youthful Valentine , Attends the emperor in his royal court . Ant . Antonio I know it well . Pant . Panthino ' T were good , I think , your lordship sent him thither . There shall he practise tilts and tournaments , Hear sweet discourse , converse with noblemen , And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth . Ant . Antonio I like thy counsel ; well hast thou advised ; And , that thou may'st perceive how well I like it , The execution of it shall make known . Even with the speediest expedition I will despatch him to the emperor 's court . Pant . Panthino To-morrow , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good esteem , Are journeying to salute the emperor , And to commend their service to his will . Ant . Antonio Good company ; with them shall Proteus go : And in good time :  --  now will we break with him . Exeunt together . SCENE 2.  --  Julia 's Garden . Musicians are playing an air , which they finish as Enter JULIA and LUCETTA . Jul . Julia But say , Lucetta , now we are alone , Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love ? Luc . Lucetta Ay , madam ; so you stumble not unheedfully . Jul . Julia Of all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with talk encounter me , In thy opinion which is worthiest love ? Luc . Lucetta Please you , repeat their names , I 'll show my mind According to my shallow simple skill . Jul . Julia What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour ? Luc . Lucetta As of a knight well-spoken , neat and fine ; But , were I you , he never should be mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Luc . Lucetta Well of his wealth ; but of himself , so , so . Jul . Julia What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus ? Luc . Lucetta Lord , Lord ! to see what folly reigns in us ! Jul . Julia How now ! what means this passion at his name ? Luc . Lucetta Pardon , dear madam : ' t is a passing shame That I , unworthy body , as I can , Should censure thus a loving gentleman . Jul . Julia Why not on Proteus , as of all the rest ? Luc . Lucetta Then thus ,  --  of many good I think him best . Jul . Julia Your reason ? Luc . Lucetta I have no other but a woman 's reason ; I think him so , because I think him so . Jul . Julia And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him ? Luc . Lucetta Ay , if you thought your love not cast away . Jul . Julia Why , he of all the rest hath never moved me . Luc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , best loves ye . Jul . Julia His little speaking shows his love but small . Luc . Lucetta Fire that 's closest kept burns most of all . Jul .

Lucetta That the contents will show . Jul . Julia Say , say , who gave it thee ? Luc . Lucetta Sir Valentine 's page ; and sent , I think , from Proteus . He would have given it to you , but I , being in the way , Did in your name receive it : pardon the fault , I pray . Jul . Julia Now , by my modesty , a goodly broker ! Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines ? To whisper and conspire against my youth ? There , take the paper : see it be returned ; Or else return no more into my sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hate . Jul . Julia Will you be gone ? Luc . Lucetta That you may ruminate . Exit . Jul . Julia And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter . It were a shame to call her back again , And pray her to a fault for which I chid her . Fie , fie , how wayward is this foolish love , That , like a testy babe , will scratch the nurse , And presently , all humbled , kiss the rod . How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence , When willingly I would have had her here ! How angrily I taught my brow to frown , When inward joy enforced my heart to smile ! My penance is , to call Lucetta back , And ask remission for my folly past .  --  What , ho ! Lucetta ! Re-enter LUCETTA . Luc . Lucetta What would your ladyship ? Jul . Julia Is it near dinner-time ? Luc . Lucetta Dropping a paper I would it were ; That you might kill your stomach on your meat And not upon your maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is't that you took up so gingerly ? Luc . Lucetta Nothing . Jul . Julia And is that paper nothing ? Luc . Lucetta Nothing concerning me . Jul . Julia Then let it lie for those that it concerns . Luc . Lucetta Madam , it will not lie where it concerns , Unless it have a false interpreter . Jul . Julia Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme . Luc . Lucetta That I might sing it , madam , to a tune . Jul . Julia Best sing it to the tune of ' Light o ' love . ' Luc . Lucetta It is too heavy for so light a tune . Jul . Julia Heavy ? belike , it hath some burden then . Luc . Lucetta Ay ; and melodious were it , would you sing it . Jul . Julia And why not you ? Luc . Lucetta I can not reach so high . Jul . Julia Let 's see your song  --  Takes the letter.  --  How now , minion ! Luc . Lucetta Aside Keep tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia This babble shall not henceforth trouble me :  --  Tears the letter ; LUCETTA stoops to pick it up . Go , get you gone , and let the papers lie : You would be fingering them , to anger me . Luc . Lucetta Going , and aside . She makes it strange , but she would be best pleased . To be so angered with another letter . Exit . Jul . Julia O hateful hands ! to tear such loving words : I 'll kiss each several paper for amends . Look here is writ  --  ' kind Julia . '  --  Unkind Julia ! As in revenge of thy ingratitude , I throw thy name against the bruising stones , Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain . And here is writ  --  ' love-wounded Proteus. '  --  Poor wounded name ! my bosom , as a bed , Shall lodge thee , till thy wound be thoroughly healed ; And thus I salve it with a sovereign kiss . But twice or thrice was Proteus written down : Be calm , good wind blow not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , Except mine own name : that some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged , fearful-hanging rock , And throw it thence into the raging sea ! Lo , here in one line is his name twice writ  --  ' Poor forlorn Proteus ; passionate Proteus To the sweet Julia : '  --  that I 'll tear away ;  --  And yet I will not ,  --  sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names . Thus will I fold them one upon another : Now kiss , embrace , contend , do what you will . CURTAIN . ACT II . SCENE 1 .  --  Julia 's Garden  --  Evening . Enter PROTEUS , reading a letter . Pro . Proteus Sweet love ! sweet lines ! sweet life ! Here is her hand , the agent of her heart ; Here is her oath for love , her honour 's pawn . O , that our fathers would applaud our loves , To seal our happiness with their consents ! O heavenly Julia ! ANTONIO , who has entered after him , now advances . Ant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Pro . Proteus May't please your lordship , ' t is a word or two Of commendation sent from Valentine , Delivered by a friend that came from him . Ant . Antonio Lend me the letter : let me see what news . Pro . Proteus There is no news , my lord , but that he writes How happily he lives , how well beloved , And daily gracd by the emperor ; Wishing me with him , partner of his fortune . Ant . Antonio And how stand you affected to his wish ? Pro . Proteus As one relying on your lordship 's will . Ant . Antonio My will is something sorted with his wish . Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed , For what I will , I will , and there an end . I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time With Valentinus in the emperor 's court : To-morrow be in readiness to go : Excuse it not ; for I am peremptory . Pro . Proteus My lord , I can not be so soon provided : Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio Look , what thou want'st shall be sent after thee : No more of stay ; to-morrow thou must go . Exit ANTONIO . Pro . Proteus Thus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning , And drenched me in the sea , where I am drowned . I feared to show my father Julia 's letter , Lest he should take exceptions to my love ; And , with the vantage of mine own excuse Hath he excepted most against my love . O , how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day , Which now shows all the beauty of the sun , And by-and-by a cloud takes all away . Enter PANTHINO . Pant . Panthino Sir Proteus , your father calls for you : He is in haste ; therefore , I pray you , go . Exit . Pro . Proteus Why , this it is ,  --  my heart accords thereto , And yet a thousand times it answers , No . Enter JULIA . Jul . Julia My Proteus . Pro .

Keep this remembrance for thy Julia 's sake . Gives him a ring . Pro . Proteus Why , then , we 'll make exchange : here , take you this . Gives her a ring . Jul . Julia And seal the bargain with a holy kiss . Pro . Proteus Here is my hand for my true constancy ; And when that hour o'erslips me in the day Wherein I sigh not , Julia , for thy sake , The next ensuing hour some foul mischance Torment me for my love 's forgetfulness . My father stays my coming ; answer not . The tide is now : nay , not thy tide of tears ; That tide will stay me longer than I should . Julia , farewell . Exit . Jul . Julia who has sunk upon a seat , after a pause . What ! gone ! no word from me ! Ay , so true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth hath better deeds than words to grace it . Enter LUCETTA . Luc . Lucetta Madam Julia , you are stayed for . Jul . Julia I come , I come .  --  Alas ! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb ! SCENE 2.  --  A Street in Verona . Enter LAUNCE , leading a dog . Launce . Nay , ' t will be this hour ere I have done weeping ; I have received my proportion , like the prodigious son , and am going with Sir Proteus to the imperial 's court . I think Crab , my dog , be the sourest-natured dog that lives : my mother weeping , my father wailing , my sister crying , our maid howling , our cat wringing her hands , and all our house in a great perplexity , yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear . He is stone , a very pebble stone , and has no more pity in him than a dog ; a Jew would have wept to have seen our parting ; why , my grandam , having no eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nay , I 'll show you the manner of it . This shoe is my father :  --  no , this left shoe is my father ;  --  no , no , this left shoe is my mother ;  --  nay , that can not be so , neither ;  --  yes , it is so , it is so ; it hath the worser sole . This shoe is my mother , and this my father . Now , sir , this staff is my sister ; for , look you , she is as white as a lily , and as small as a wand : this hat is Nan , our maid : I am the dog ,  --  no , the dog is himself , and I am the dog .  --  O , the dog is me , and I am myself : ay , so , so . Now come I to my father ; ' Father , your blessing !

Now come I to my sister ; mark the moan she makes . Now , the dog all this while sheds not a tear , nor speaks a word ; but see how I lay the dust with my tears . Enter PANTHINO . Pant . Panthino Launce , away , away , aboard : thy master is shipped , and thou art to post after with oars . What 's the matter ? why weep'st thou , man ? Away , ass ! you 'll lose the tide , if you tarry any longer . Launce . It is no matter if the tied were lost ; for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied . Pant .

She is not within hearing , sir . Val . Valentine Why , sir , who bade you call her ? Speed . Your worship , sir ; or else I mistook . Val . Valentine Well , you 'll still be too forward . Speed . Apart And yet I was last chidden for being too slow . Val . Valentine Go to , sir : tell me , do you know Madam Silvia ? Speed . She that your worship loves ? Val . Valentine Why , how know you that I am in love ? Speed . Marry , by these special marks : first , you have learned like Sir Proteus , to wreath your arms , like a malcontent ; to relish a love-song , like a robin-redbreast ; to walk alone , like one that had the pestilence ; to sigh , like a school-boy that had lost his A B C ; to weep , like a young wench that had buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbing ; to speak puling , like a beggar at Hallowmas . You were wont , when you laughed , to crow like a cock ; when you walked , to walk like one of the lions ; when you looked sadly , it was for want of money ; and now you are so metamorphosed with a mistress , that , when I look on you , I can hardly think you my master . Val . Valentine Are all these things perceived in me ? Speed . They are all perceived without ye . Val . Valentine Without me , they can not ! But , tell me , dost thou know my lady Silvia ? Speed . She that you gaze on so , as she sits at supper ? Val . Valentine Hast thou observed that ? even she I mean . Speed . Why , sir , you never saw her since she was deformed . Val . Valentine How long hath she been deformed ? Speed . Ever since you loved her . Val . Valentine I have loved her ever since I saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you love her , you can not see her . Val . Valentine Why ? Speed . Because love is blind . O , that you had mine eyes ; or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have , when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered ! Val . Valentine What should I see then ? Speed . Your own present folly , and her passing deformity . Val . Valentine Belike , boy , then you are in love ; for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes . Speed . True , sir ; I was in love with my bed , I thank you , you swinged me for my love , which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours . Val . Valentine Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves . Speed . And have you ? Val . Valentine I have . Peace ! here she comes . Enter SILVIA , attended . Val . Valent ine Madam and mistress , a thousand good-morrows . Speed . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silvia Sir Valentine and servant , to you two thousand . Speed . He should give her interest , and she gives it him . Val . Valentine As you enjoined me , I have writ your letter Unto the secret nameless friend of yours ; Which I was much unwilling to proceed in , But for my duty to your ladyship . Gives a letter . Sil . Silvia I thank you , gentle servant : ' t is very clerkly done . Val . Valentine Now trust me , madam , it came hardly off ; For , being ignorant to whom it goes , I writ at random , very doubtfully . Sil . Silvia Perchance you think too much of so much pains ? Val . Valentine No , madam : so it stead you , I will write , Please you command , a thousand times as much . And yet ,  --  Sil . Silvia A pretty period . Well , I guess the sequel ; And yet I will not name ' t ;  --  and yet I care not ;  --  And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more . Speed . And yet you will ; and yet another yet . Val . Valentine What means your ladyship ; do you not like it ? Sil . Silvia Yes , yes ; the lines are very quaintly writ , But since unwillingly , take them again ; Nay , take them . Gives back the letter . Val . Valentine Madam , they are for you . Sil . Silvia Ay , ay , you writ them , sir , at my request ; But I will none of them . They are for you : I would have had them writ more movingly . Val . Valentine Please you , I 'll write your ladyship another . Sil . Silvia And when it 's writ , for my sake read it over : And , if it please you . Val . Valentine If it please me , madam ; what then ? Sil . Silvia Why , if it please you , take it for your labour . And so good-morrow , servant . Exit . Speed . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose on a man 's face , or a weathercock on a , steeple ! My master sues to her , and she hath taught her suitor , He being her pupil , to become her tutor . O excellent device ! was there ever heard a better , That my master , being scribe , to himself should write the letter ? Val . Valentine How now , sir ! what , are you reasoning with yourself ? Speed . Nay , I was rhyming : ' t is you that have the reason . Val . Valentine To do what ? Speed . To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia . Val . Valentine To whom ? Speed . To yourself . Why , she wooes you by a figure . Val . Valentine What figure ? Speed . By a letter , I should say . Val . Valentine Why , she hath not writ to me ? Speed . What need she , when she hath made you write to yourself ? Why , do you not perceive the jest ? Val . Valentine No , believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ; but did you perceive her earnest ? Val . Valentine She gave me none , except an angry word . Speed . Why , she hath given you a letter . Val . Valentine That 's the letter I writ to her friend . Speed . And that letter hath she delivered , and there an end . Val . Valentine I would it were no worse ! Speed . Why muse you , sir ? ' t is dinner-time . Val . Valentine I have dined . Speed . Ay , but hearken , sir : though the chameleon Love can feed on the air , I am one that am nourished by my victuals , and would fain have meat . O , be not like your mistress ; be moved , be moved . See ! she comes . Exit as others enter . Enter SILVIA , attended by THURIO and other gallants . Sil . Silvia Sir Valentine , you are sad . Val . Valentine Indeed , madam , I seem so . Thu . Thurio Seem you that you are not ? Val @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem I that I am not ? Val . Valentine Wise . Thu . Thurio What instance of the contrary ? Val . Valentine Your folly . Thu . Thurio How ? Sil . Silvia What , angry , Sir Thurio ! do you change colour ? Val . Valentine Give him leave , madam ; he is a kind of chameleon . Thu . Thurio That hath more mind to feed on your blood , than live in your air . Sil . Silvia A fine volley of words , gentlemen , and quickly shot off . Val . Valentine ' T is indeed , madam , we thank the giver . Sil . Silvia Who is that , servant ? Val . Valentine Yourself , sweet lady ; for you gave the fire . Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship 's looks , and spends what he borrows kindly in your company . Sil . Silvia No more , gentlemen , no more :  --  Here comes my father . Enter the DUKE . Duke . Now , daughter Silvia , you are hard beset . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you to a letter from your friends Of much good news ? Val . Valentine My lord , I will be thankful To any happy messenger from thence . Duke . Know you Don Antonio , your countryman ? Val . Valentine Ay , my good lord ; I know the gentleman To be of worth , and worthy estimation , And not without desert so well reputed . Duke . Hath he not a son ? Val . Valentine Ay , my good lord ; a son , that well deserves The honour and regard of such a father . Duke . You know him well ? Val . Valentine I know him as myself ; for from our infancy We have conversed , and spent our hours together : And though myself have been an idle truant , Yet hath Sir Proteus , for that 's his name , Made use and fair advantage of his days ; His years but young , but his experience old ; He is complete in feature and in mind With all good grace to grace a gentleman . Duke . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commendation from great potentates , And here he means to spend his time awhile : I think , ' t is no unwelcome news to you . Val . Valentine Should I have wished a thing , it had been he . Duke . Welcome him then according to his worth . Silvia , I speak to you ; and you , Sir Thurio :  --  For Valentine , I need not cite him to it . I 'll send him hither to you presently . Exit . Val . Valentine This is the gentleman , I told your ladyship Had come along with me , but that his mistress Did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks . Sil . Silvia Belike , that now she hath enfranchised them , Upon some other pawn for fealty . Val . Valentine Nay , sure , I think she holds them prisoners still . Sil . Silvia Nay , then , he should be blind ; and , being blind , How could he see his way to seek out you ? Val . Valentine Why , lady , Love hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Love hath not an eye at all . Val . Valentine To see such lovers , Thurio , as yourself : Upon a homely object Love can wink . Enter PROTEUS . Sil . Silvia Have done , have done ; here comes the gentleman . Exit THURIO . Val . Valentine Welcome , dear Proteus !  --  Mistress , I beseech you , Confirm his welcome with some special favour . Sil . Silvia His worth is warrant for his welcome hither , If this be he you oft have wished to hear from . Val . Valentine Mistress , it is ; sweet lady , entertain him To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship . Sil . Silvia Servant , you 're welcome . Re-enter THURIO . Thu . Thurio Madam , my lord , your father , would speak with you . Sil . Silvia I wait upon his pleasure . Come , Sir Thurio , Go you with me.  --  Once more , new servant , welcome : I 'll leave you to confer of home-affairs ; When you have done , we look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend upon your ladyship . Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO . Val . Valentine Now , tell me , how do all from whence you came ? How does your lady , and how thrives your love ? Pro . Proteus My tales of love were wont to weary you ; I know you joy not in a love discourse . Val . Valentine Ay , Proteus , but that life is altered now . For , in revenge of my contempt of Love , Love hath chased sleep from my enthralld eyes , And made them watchers of mine own heart 's sorrow . Now can I break my fast , dine , sup , and sleep , Upon the very naked name of love . Pro . Proteus Enough ; I read your fortune in your eye . Was this the idol that you worship so ? Val . Valentine Even she ; and is she not a heavenly saint ? Pro . Proteus No ; but she is an earthly paragon . Val . Valentine Call her divine . I were as rich in having such a jewel As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water nectar , and the rocks pure gold . My foolish rival , that her father likes Only for his possessions are so huge , Is gone with her along ; and I must after , For love , thou know'st , is full of jealousy . Pro . Proteus But she loves you ? Val . Valentine Ay , Good Proteus , go with me to my chamber , In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel . Pro . Proteus Go on before ; I shall enquire you forth . I must unto the road , to disembark Some necessaries that I needs must use , And then I 'll presently attend you . Val . Valentine Will you make haste ? Pro . Proteus I will .  --  Exit VALENTINE . Even as one heat another heat expels , Or as one nail by strength drives out another , So the remembrance of my former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten . Methinks , my zeal to Valentine is cold , And that I love him not as I was wont : O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the reason I love him so little . ' T is but her picture I have yet beheld , And that hath dazzld my reason 's light ; But when I look on her perfections , There is no reason but I shall be blind . If I can check my erring love , I will ; If not , to compass her I 'll use my skill . Exit . SCENE 4.  --  Julia 's Garden .  --  Sunset View : Musicians in groups , playing and singing . They depart as JULIA appears . Enter JULIA . Jul . Julia Counsel , Lucetta ; gentle girl , assist me ; And , e'en in kind love , I do cnjure thee ,  --  To lesson me ; and tell me some good mean , How , with my honour , I may undertake A journey to my loving Proteus . Luc . Lucetta Alas , the way is wearisome and long . Jul . Julia A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps ; Much less shall she that hath Love 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one so dear . Luc . Lucetta Better forbear till Proteus make return . Jul . Julia O , know'st thou not his looks are my soul 's food ? Didst thou but know the inly touch of love , Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow As seek to quench the fire of love with words . Luc . Lucetta I do not seek to quench your love 's hot fire , But qualify the fire 's extremest rage , Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason . Jul . Julia The more thou damm'st it up , the more it burns . The current that with gentle murmur glides , Thou know'st , being stopped , impatiently doth rage ; Then let me go , and hinder not my course . Luc . Lucetta But in what habit will you go along ? Jul . Julia Not like a woman ,  --  but in some disguise . Gentle Lucetta , fit me with such weeds As may beseem some well-reputed page . Luc . Lucetta Why , then your ladyship must cut your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knit it up in silken strings With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots : To be fantastic may become a youth Of greater time than I shall show to be . Luc . Lucetta What fashion , madam , shall I make your breeches ? Jul . Julia Lucetta , as thou lov'st me , let me have What thou think'st meet , and is most mannerly . But tell me , wench , how will the world repute me For undertaking so unstaid a journey ? I fear me , it will make me scandalized . Luc . Lucetta If you think so , then wisely stay at home . Jul . Julia Nay , that I will not . Luc . Lucetta Then never dream on infamy , but go . If Proteus like your journey when you come , No matter who 's displeased when you are gone . I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal . Jul . Julia That is the least , Lucetta , of my fear . A thousand oaths , an ocean of his tears , And instances as infinite of love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these are servants to deceitful men . Jul . Julia Base men , that use them to so base effect ! But truer stars did govern Proteus ' birth : His words are bonds , his oaths are oracles ; His love sincere , his thoughts immaculate ; His tears pure messengers sent from his heart ; His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth . Luc . Lucetta Pray Heaven , he prove so , when you come to him ! Jul . Julia Now as thou lov'st me , do him not that wrong To bear a hard opinion of his truth : Only deserve my love by loving him , And presently go with me to my chamber , To take a note of what I stand in need of To furnish me upon my loving journey . All that is mine I leave at thy dispose , My goods , my lands , my reputation ; Only , in lieu thereof , dispatch me hence . I am impatient of my tarriance . LUCETTA exit . My Proteus : I 'll be as patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each weary step , Till the last steps have brought me to my love : And there I 'll rest , as , after much turmoil , A blessd soul cloth in Elysium . CURTAIN . ACT III . SCENE 1 .  --  A Street in Milan . Enter SPEED and LAUNCE . Speed . Launce ! by mine honesty , welcome to Milan ! Launce . Forswear not thyself , sweet youth , for I am not welcome . I reckon this always , that a man is never undone till he be hanged ; nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid , and the hostess say , ' Welcome ! ' Speed . Come on , you madcap , I 'll to the ale-house with you presently ; where for one shot of five-pence thou shalt have five thousand welcomes . But , sirrah , how did thy master part with Madam Julia ? Launce . Marry , after they closed in earnest , they parted very fairly in jest . Speed . But shall she marry him ? Launce . No . Speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , neither . Speed . What , are they broken ? Launce . No , they are both as whole as a fish . Speed . But tell me true , will ' t be a match . Launce . Ask my dog : if he say ay , it will ; if he say no , it will ; if he shake his tail and say nothing , it will . Speed . The conclusion is then , that it will . Launce . Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable . Speed . ' T is well that I get it so . But , Launce , how say'st thou , that my master is become a notable lover ? Launce . I never knew him otherwise . Speed . Than how ? Launce . A notable lubber , as thou reportest him to be . Speed . I tell thee , my master is become a hot lover . Launce . Why , I tell thee , I care not though he burn himself in love . If thou wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , thou art an Hebrew , a Jew , and not worth the name of a Christian . Speed . Why ? Launce . Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian . Wilt thou go ? Speed . At thy service . Exeunt . SCENE 2.  --  An open Court in the Duke 's Palace  --  A Gallery at back , with the Waters of a Lake beyond  --  Silvia 's Casement at the R. C. opening upon a Balcony  --  Large Archway at R. , midway up  --  A smaller Arch at L. , down Stage  --  Stone Seats R. and L.  --  A Dance at the opening of the Scene  --  As Dancers go out Enter PROTEUS . Pro . Proteus To leave my Julia , shall I be forsworn ; To love fair Silvia , shall I be forsworn ; To wrong my friend , I shall be much forsworn ; And even that power which gave me first my oath Provokes me to this threefold perjury : Love bade me swear , and Love bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinned , Teach me , thy tempted subject , to excuse it ! Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken ; And he wants wit that wants resolvd will To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better .  --  Fie , fie , unreverend tongue ! to call her bad Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths . I will forget that Julia is alive , Remembering that my love to her is dead ; And Valentine I 'll hold an enemy , Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend . Now presently I 'll give her father notice Of their disguising and intended flight ; Who , all enraged , will banish Valentine , For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter ; But , Valentine being gone , I 'll quickly cross , By some sly trick , blunt Thurio 's dull proceeding . Love , lend me wings to make my purpose swift , As thou has lent me wit to plot this drift ! The DUKE enters with THURIO . Duke . Sir Thurio , give us leave , I pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Exit THURIO . Now , tell me , Proteus , what 's your will with me ? Pro . Proteus My gracious lord , that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal ; But when I call to mind your gracious favours My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me . Know , worthy prince , Sir Valentine , my friend , This night intends to steal away your daughter ; And should she thus be stolen away from you , It would be much vexation to your age . Thus , for my duty 's sake , I rather choose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than , by concealing it , heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down , Being unprevented , to your timeless grave . Duke . Proteus , I thank thee for thine honest care ; Which to requite , command me while I live . This love of theirs myself have often seen , And oftentimes have purposed to forbid Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest my jealous aim might err , And so unworthily disgrace the man , I gave him gentle looks ; thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclosed to me . And , that thou may'st perceive my fear of this , I nightly lodge her in an upper tower The key whereof myself have ever kept ; And thence she can not be conveyed away . Pro . Proteus Know , noble lord , they have devised a mean How he her chamber-window will ascend , And with a corded ladder fetch her down ; And this way comes he with it presently , Where , if it please you , you may intercept him . But , good my lord , do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimd at ; For love of you , not hate unto my friend , Hath made me publisher of this pretence . Duke . Upon mine honour , he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this . Pro . Proteus Adieu , my lord ; Sir Valentine is coming . Exit . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast ? Val . Valentine Please it your grace , there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends , And I am going to deliver them . Duke . Be they of much import ? Val . Valentine The tenor of them doth but signify My health , and happy being at your court . Duke . Nay , then , no matter ; stay with me awhile . I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near , wherein thou must be secret . ' T is not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter . Val . Valentine I know it well , my lord ; and , sure , the match Were rich and honourable ; Can not your grace win her to fancy him ? Duke . No , trust me : she is peevish , sullen , froward , Proud , disobedient , stubborn , lacking duty ; Neither regarding that she is my child , Nor fearing me as if I were her father : And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Upon advice , hath drawn my love from her ; And , where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherished by her child-like duty I now am full resolved to take a wife , And turn her out to who will take her in : Then , let her beauty be her wedding-dower . Val . Valentine What would your grace have me to do in this ? Duke . There is a lady in Milano here , Whom I affect ; but she is nice , and coy , And nought esteems my agd eloquence : Now , therefore , would I have thee as my tutor  --  For long agone I have forgot to court ; Besides , the fashion of the time is changed  --  How , and which way , I may bestow myself , To be regarded in her sun-bright eye . Val . Valentine Win her with gifts , if she respect not words . Dumb jewels often , in their silent kind , More than quick words do move a woman 's mind . Duke . But she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentine A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her . Send her another ; never give her o'er , If she do frown , ' t is not in hate of you , But rather to beget more love in you ; Take no repulse , whatever she doth say ; For , ' get you gone , ' she doth not mean , ' away . ' Flatter , and praise , commend , extol their graces ; Though ne'er so black , say they have angels ' faces . Duke . But she I mean is promised by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth , And kept severely from resort of men , That no man hath access by day to her . Val . Valentine Why , then I would resort to her by night . Duke . Ay , but the doors be locked , and keys kept safe , That no man hath recourse to her by night . Val . Valentine What lets but one may enter at her window ? Duke . Her chamber is aloft , far from the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Without apparent hazard of his life . Val . Valentine Why , then , a ladder quaintly made of cords , To cast up , with a pair of anchoring hooks , Would serve to scale another Hero 's tower , So bold Leander would adventure it . Duke . Now , as thou art a gentleman of blood , Advise me where I may find such a ladder . Val . Valentine When would you use it ? pray , sir , tell me that . Duke . This very night ; for Love is like a child , That longs for everything that he can come by . Val . Valentine By seven o'clock I 'll get you such a ladder . Duke . But hark thee ; I will go to her alone . How shall I best convey the ladder thither ? Val . Valentine It will be light , my lord , that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any length . Duke . A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn ? Val . Valentine Ay , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy cloak I 'll get me one of such another length . Val . Valentine Why , any cloak will serve the turn , my lord . Duke . How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak ?  --  I pray thee , let me feel thy cloak upon me , What letter is this same ? What 's here ?  --  ' To Silvia ! ' And here an engine fit for my proceeding ! I 'll be so bold to break the seal for once . Reads . " My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly ; And slaves they are to me , that send them flying : My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them ; While I , their king , that thither them importune , Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blessed them , Because they harbour where their lord should be . " What 's here ? " Silvia , this night I will enfranchise thee . " ' T is so ; and here 's the ladder for the purpose . Wilt thou reach stars , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweening slave ! Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates , And think my patience , more than thy desert , Is privilege for thy departure hence . But if thou linger in my territories Longer than swiftest expedition Will give thee time to leave our royal court , By Heaven , my wrath shall far exceed the love I ever bore my daughter or thyself . Be gone : I will not hear thy vain excuse ; But , as thou lov'st thy life , make speed from hence . Exit DUKE . Val . Valentine And why not death , rather than living torment ? To die is to be banished from myself ; And Silvia is myself : What light is light , if Silvia be not seen ? What joy is joy , if Silvia be not by ? Except I be by Silvia in the night , There is no music in the nightingale ; Unless I look on Silvia in the day , There is no day for me to look upon . Tarry I here , I but attend on death , But fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE . Pro . Proteus Run , boy , run , run , and seek him out . Launce . So-ho ! so-ho ! Pro . Proteus What seest thou ? Launce . Him we go to find : there 's not a hair on 's head but ' t is a Valentine . Re-enter VALENTINE . Pro . Proteus Valentine ! Val . Valentine No . Pro . Proteus Who then ? his spirit ? Val . Valentine Neither . Pro . Proteus What then ? Val . Valentine Nothing . Launce . Can nothing speak ? master , shall I strike ? Pro . Proteus Who wouldst thou strike ? Launce . Nothing . Pro . Proteus Villain , forbear . Launce . Why , sir , I 'll strike nothing : I pray you ,  --  Pro . Proteus Sirrah , I say , forbear.  --  Friend Valentine , a word . Val . Valentine My ears are stopped , and can not hear good news , So much of bad already hath possessed them . Pro . Proteus Dear Valentine , There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silvia , and from me , thy friend . Val . Valentine Doth Silvia know that I am banishd ? Pro . Proteus Ay , ay ; and she hath offered to the doom  --  Which , unreversed , stands in effectual force  --  A sea of melting pearl , which some call tears : Those at her father 's churlish feet she tendered , With them , upon her knees , her humble self : But neither bended knees , pure hands held up , Sad sighs , deep groans , nor silver-shedding tears , Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire ; Besides , her intercession chafed him so , That to close prison he commanded her , With many bitter threats of biding there . Val . Valentine No more ; unless the next word that thou speak'st Have some malignant power upon my life ! Pro . Proteus Cease to lament for that thou canst not help , And study help for that which thou lament'st . Time is the nurse and breeder of all good . Hope is a lover 's staff ; walk hence with that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here , though thou art hence ; Which , being writ to me , shall be delivered Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love . Come , I 'll convey thee through the city gate , And , ere I part with thee , confer at large Of all that may concern thy love-affairs . As thou lov'st Silvia , though not for thyself , Regard thy danger , and along with me ! Val . Valentine I pray thee , Launce , and if thou seest my boy , Bid him make haste , and meet me at the north gate . Pro . Proteus Go , sirrah , find him out . Come , Valentine . Val . Valentine O my dear Silvia !  --  hapless Valentine ! Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS . Launce . I am but a fool , look you , and yet I have the wit to think my master Proteus is a kind of a knave ; but that 's all one , if he be but one knave . He lives not now that knows me to be in love : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse shall not pluck that from me , nor who ' t is I love ; and yet ' t is a woman ; but what woman , I will not tell myself . Here is the cate-log pulling out a paper of her conditions . Imprimis , ' She can fetch and carry . ' Why , a horse can do no more : nay , a horse can not fetch , but only carry ; therefore is she better than a jade . Item , ' She can milk ; ' look you , a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands . Enter SPEED . Speed . How now , Signior Launce , what news ? What news in your paper ? Launce . The blackest news that ever thou heardest . Speed . Why , man , how black ? Launce . Why , as black as ink . Speed . Let me read them . Launce . There , and Saint Nicholas be thy speed ! Speed . Reads . ' Imprimis , She can milk . ' Launce . Ay , that she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Launce . And thereof comes the proverb ,  --  Blessing of your heart , you brew good ale . Speed . ' Item , She can knit . ' Launce . What need a man care for a stock with a wench , when she can knit him a stock ? Speed . ' Item , She can wash and scour . ' Launce . A special virtue ; for then she need not be washed and scoured . Speed . Here follow her vices . Launce . Close at the heels of her virtues . Speed . ' Item , She is not to be kissed fasting , in respect of her breath . ' Launce . Well , that fault may be mended with a breakfast . Read on . Speed . ' Item , She hath a sweet mouth . ' Launce . That makes amends for her sour breath . Speed . ' Item , She doth talk in her sleep . ' Launce . It 's no matter for that , so she sleep not in her talk . Speed . ' Item , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain , that set this down among her vices ! To be slow in words is a woman 's only virtue . I pray thee , out with ' t , and place it for her chief virtue . Well , proceed . Speed . ' Item , She hath more hair than wit , and more faults than hairs , and more wealth than faults . ' Launce . Stop there ; I 'll have her ; she was mine , and not mine , twice or thrice in that last article . Rehearse that once more . Speed . ' Item , She hath more hair than wit , '  --  Launce . More hair than wit ,  --  it may be ; I 'll prove it ; the cover of the salt hides the salt , and therefore it is more than the salt : the hair , that covers the wit , is more than the wit , for the greater hides the less . What 's next ? Speed . ' And more faults than hairs ,  --  Launce . That 's monstrous : O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth than faults . ' Launce . Why , that word makes the faults gracious . Well , I 'll have her ; and if it be a match , as nothing is impossible ,  --  Speed . What then ? Launce . Why , then will I tell thee ,  --  that thy master stays for thee at the north gate . Speed . For me ? Launce . For thee ! ay ; who art thou ? he hath stayed for a better man than thee . Speed . And must I go to him ? Launce . Thou must run to him , for thou hast stayed so long , that going will scarce serve the turn . Speed . Why didst not tell me sooner ? hang your love letters ! Exit . Launce . Now will he be swinged for reading my letter . An unmannerly slave , that will thrust himself into secrets .  --  I 'll after , to rejoice in his correction . Exit . Enter EGLAMOUR . Egl . Eglamour This is the hour that Madam Silvia Entreated me to call and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd employ me in.  --  Madam , madam ! ( claps his hands twice ) . Enter SILVIA above , at her window . Sil . Silvia Who calls ? Egl . Eglamour Your servant and your friend ; One that attends your ladyship 's command . Sil . Silvia Sir Eglamour , a thousand times good morrow . Egl . Eglamour As many , worthy lady , to yourself . Sil . Silvia O Eglamour , Thou art not ignorant what dear good will I bear unto the banished Valentine , Nor how my father would enforce me marry Vain Thurio , whom my very soul abhors . Thyself hast loved ; and I have heard thee say , No grief did ever come so near thy heart As when thy lady and thy true love died , Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity . Sir Eglamour , I would to Valentine , To Mantua , where I hear he makes abode ; And , for the ways are dangerous to pass , I do desire thy worthy company , Upon whose faith and honour I repose . Urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my grief ,  --  a lady 's grief ,  --  And on the justice of my flying hence , To keep me from a most unholy match . I do desire thee , even from a heart As full of sorrows as the sea of sands , To bear me company , and go with me : If not , to hide what I have said to thee , That I may venture to depart alone . Egl . Eglamour Madam , I pity much your grievances , And the most true affections that you bear , Which since I know they virtuously are placed , I give consent to go along with you ; Recking as little what betideth me , As much I wish all good befortune thee . When will you go ? Sil . Silvia This evening coming . Egl . Eglamour Where shall I meet you ? Sil . Silvia At Friar Patrick 's cell . Egl . Eglamour I will not fail your ladyship . Good morrow , gentle lady . Sil . Silvia Good morrow , kind Sir Eglamour . Exeunt , EGLAMOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro . Proteus Already am I false to Valentine , And now must I be false to Thurio . Under the colour of commending him , I have access my own love to prefer : But Silvia is too fair , too true , too holy , To be corrupted with my worthless gifts . When I protest true loyalty to her , She twits me with my falsehood to my friend ; When to her beauty I commend my vows , She bids me think how I have been forsworn In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved : Yet , spaniel-like , the more she spurns my love , The more it grows , and fawneth on her still . Distant music of lutes is heard . But here comes Thurio . For I have told him To haunt by night his lady 's chamber-window With some sweet concert : and the night 's dead silence Will well become such sweet complaining strains . Enter THURIO . Thu . Thurio How now , Sir Proteus ? are you crept before us ? Pro . Proteus Ay , gentle Thurio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it can not go . Thu . Thurio Ay , but I hope , sir , that you love not here . Pro . Proteus Sir , but I do ; or else I would be hence . Thu . Thurio Who ? Silvia ? Pro . Proteus Ay , Silvia ,  --  for your sake . Thu . Thurio I thank you  --  for your own . The musicians enter in a boat . Now , gentlemen , Let 's tune , and to it lustily awhile . Goes towards the boat with PROTEUS . Enter HOST , and JULIA in boy 's clothes , from the arch at R. Host . Now , my young guest ; I 'll bring you where you shall hear music , and see the gentleman that you asked for . Jul . Julia But shall I hear him speak ? Host . Ay , that you shall . Jul . Julia That will be music . Musicians begin to play upon their lutes . Host . Hark ! hark ! Jul . Julia Is he among these ? Host . Ay ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who is Silvia ? what is she , That all our swains commend her ? Holy , fair , and wise as free , The heaven such grace did lend her , That she might admired be . Is she kind as she is fair  --  For beauty lives with kindness ? Love doth to her eyes repair , To help him of his blindness ; And , being help 'd , inhabits there . Then to Silvia let us sing , That Silvia is excelling ; She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling : To her let us garlands bring . The boat and its singers move off ; at the end of the song JULIA sinks on a seat . Host . How now ! are you sadder than you were before ? How do you , man ? the music likes you not . Jul . Julia You mistake : the musician likes me not . Rising . Host . Why , my pretty youth ? Jul . Julia He plays false , father . So false , that he grieves my very heart-strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julia Ay , I would I were deaf ! it makes me have a slow heart . But , host , doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on , Often resort unto this gentlewoman ? Host . I tell you what Launce , his man , told me ,  --  he loved her out of all nick . Jul . Julia Where is Launce ? Host . Gone to seek his dog ; which , to-morrow , by his master 's command , he must carry for a present to his lady . Jul . Julia Peace ! stand aside : the company parts . Pro . Proteus Sir Thurio , fear not you : I will so plead That you shall say my cunning drift excels . Thu . Thurio Where meet we ? Pro . Proteus At Saint Gregory 's well . Thu . Thurio Farewell . THURIO enters a boat with Musicians and they go off singing . Enter SILVIA above , at her window , on the balcony . Pro . Proteus Madam , good even to your ladyship . Sil . Silvia Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you knew his pure heart 's truth , You ' d quickly learn to know him by his voice . Sil . Silvia Sir Proteus , as I take it . Pro . Proteus Sir Proteus , gentle lady , and your servant . Sil . Silvia What is your will ? Pro . Proteus That I may compass yours . Sil . Silvia You have your wish : my will is even this , That presently you his you home to bed . Thou subtle , perjured , false , disloyal man ! Think'st thou I am so shallow , so conceitless , To be seducd by thy flattery , That hast deceived so many with thy vows ? Return , return , and make thy love amends . For me , by this pale queen of night I swear , I am so far from granting thy request That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit , And by-and-by intend to chide myself Even for this time I spend in talking to thee .

Proteus I likewise hear that Valentine is dead . Sil . Silvia Then so , suppose , am I ; for in his grave , Assure thyself my love is burid . Pro . Proteus Sweet lady , let me rake it from the earth . Sil . Silvia Go to thy lady 's grave , and call hers thence ; Or , at the least , in hers seplchre thine . Jul . Julia Aside . He heard not that . Pro . Proteus Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love , To that I 'll speak , to that I 'll sigh and weep ; For , since the substance of your perfect self Is else devoted , I am but a shadow , And to your shadow will I make true love . Sil . Silvia I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , since your falsehood shall become you well To worship shadows and adore false shapes , Send to me in the morning , and I 'll send it : And so , good rest . Exit . Pro . Proteus As wretches have o'ernight , That wait for execution in the morn . Enters boat with musicians  --  and they move off singing . Jul . Julia Host , will you go ? Host . By my halidom , I was fast asleep . Trust me , I think , ' t is almost day . Jul . Julia Not so ; but it hath been the longest night That e'er I watched , and most the heaviest . END OF ACT III . ACT IV . SCENE 1 .  --  A Forest path near Milan . The Outlaws are discovered , singing a glee .

Val . Valentine Then know that I have little wealth to lose . A man I am crossed with adversity ; My riches are these poor habiliments , Of which if you should here disfurnish me , You take the sum and substance that I have . 2 Out . 2nd Outlaw Whither travel you ? Val . Valentine To Mantua. 1 Out . 1st Outlaw Whence came you ? Val . Valentine From Milan . 3 Out . 3rd Outlaw Have you long sojourned there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have stayed , If crookd fortune had not thwarted me. 1 Out . 1st Outlaw What , were you banished thence ? Val . Valentine I was . 2 Out . 2nd Outlaw For what offence ? Val . Valentine For that which now torments me to rehearse : I killed a man , whose death I much repent : But yet I slew him manfully in fight , Without false vantage or base treachery . 3 Out . 3rd Outlaw By the bare scalp of Robin Hood 's fat friar , This fellow were a king for our wild faction . 1 Out . 1st Outlaw We 'll have him . Sirs , a word . Speed . Master , be one of them : It is an honourable kind of thievery . Val . Valentine Peace , villain ! 2 Out . 2nd Outlaw Tell us this : have you anything to take to ? Val .

But to the purpose ,  --  for we cite our faults , That they may hold excused our lawless lives ; Are you content to be our general ? To make a virtue of necessity , And live , as we do , in this wilderness ? 3 Out . 3rd Outlaw What say'st thou ? Say , ay , and be the captain of us all . We 'll do thee homage , and be ruled by thee , Love thee as our commander and our king . 1 Out . 1st Outlaw But if thou scorn our courtesy , thou diest. 2 Out . 2nd Outlaw Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered .

SCENE 2.  --  Street in Milan . Enter LAUNCE with his dog . Launce . When a man 's servant shall play the cur with him , look you , it goes hard : one that I brought up of a puppy ; one that I saved from drowning , when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it . I have taught him , even as one would say precisely , ' Thus I would teach a dog , ' I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master , and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber , but he steps me to her trencher , and steals her capon 's leg . O ' t is a foul thing , when a cur can not keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should say , one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed : to be , as it were , a dog at all things . If I had not had more wit than he , to take a fault upon me that he did , I think verily , he had been hanged for ' t . Nay , I 'll be sworn , I have sat in the stocks for puddings he had stolen , otherwise he had been executed ; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed , otherwise he had suffered for ' t : thou think'st not of this now ,  --  Nay , I remember the trick you served me , when I took my leave of Madam Silvia . Didst thou ever see me do such a trick ? Exit . SCENE 3.  --  The Duke 's Palace . Enter PROTEUS , and JULIA in boy 's clothes . Pro . Proteus Sebastian is thy name ? I like thee well , And will employ thee in some service presently . Jul . Julia In what you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his dog . Pro . Proteus I hope thou wilt .  --  How now , you rascal peasant ! Where have you been these two days loitering ? Launce . Marry , sir , I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me . Pro . Proteus And what says she to my little jewel ? Launce . Marry , she says , your dog was a cur ; and tells you , currish thanks is good enough for such a present . Pro . Proteus But she received my dog ? Launce . No , indeed , did she not . Here have I brought him back again . Pro . Proteus What ! didst thou offer her this from me ? Launce . Ay , sir : the other squirrel was stolen from me by a hangman boy in the market-place ; and then I offered her mine own , who is a dog as big as ten of yours , and therefore the gift the greater . Pro . Proteus Go get thee hence , and find my dog again , Or ne'er return again into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vex me here ? Exit LAUNCE . Sebastian , I have entertaind thee , Partly that I have need of such a youth , For ' t is no trusting to yon foolish lout ; Go presently , and take this ring with thee : Deliver it to Madam Silvia . She loved me well who gave the ring to me . Jul . Julia It seems you loved not her , to leave her token . She 's dead , belike ? Pro . Proteus Not so : I think , she lives . Jul . Julia Alas ! Pro . Proteus Why dost thou cry , Alas ? Jul . Julia I can not choose but pity her . Pro . Proteus Wherefore shouldst thou pity her ? Jul . Julia Because , methinks , that she loved you as well As you do love your lady Silvia . She dreams on him that has forgot her love : You dote on her that cares not for your love . T is pity love should be so contrary ; And thinking on it makes me cry , Alas ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring , and therewithal This letter :  --  tell my lady , I claim the promise of her heavenly picture . Your message done , his home unto my lodging Where thou shalt find me , sad and solitary . Exit . Jul . Julia How many women would do such a message ? Alas , poor Proteus ! thou hast entertained A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs . Alas , poor fool ! why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me ? Because he loves her , he despiseth me ; Because I love him , I must pity him . This ring I gave him , when he parted from me , To bind him to remember my good will ; And now am I  --  unhappy messenger  --  To plead for that which I would not obtain ; To carry that which I would have refused ; To praise his faith , which I would have dispraised . I am my master 's true-confirmd love , But can not be true servant to my master Unless I prove false traitor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gentlewoman , good day .

Julia If you be she , I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on . Sil . Silvia From whom ? Jul . Julia From my master , Sir Proteus , madam . Sil . Silvia O , he sends you for a picture ? Jul . Julia Ay , madam . Sil . Silvia Ursula , bring my picture there ,  --  A miniature is brought . Go , give your master this : tell him from me , One Julia , that his changing thoughts forget , Would better fit his chamber than this shadow . Jul . Julia Madam , so please you to peruse this letter . Gives a letter . Sil . Silvia I will not look upon your master 's lines : I know they are stuffed with protestations , And full of new-found oaths , which he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tears the letter . Jul . Julia Madam , he sends your ladyship this ring . Sil . Silvia The more shame for him that he sends it me ; Though his false finger have profaned the ring ; Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong . Jul . Julia She thanks you , madam ! Sil . Silvia Dost thou know her ? Jul . Julia Almost as well as I do know myself : Sil . Silvia Is she not passing fair ? Jul . Julia She hath been fairer , madam , than she is ,  --  When she did think my master loved her well ; But since she did neglect her looking-glass And threw her sun-expelling mask away , The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks , And pinched the lily-tincture of her face , That now she is become as black as I. Sil . Silvia She is beholden to thee , gentle youth . Alas , poor lady , desolate and left ! I weep myself , to think upon thy words  --  For thy sweet mistress ' sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attended . Jul . Julia Alas , how love can trifle with itself ! Here is her picture : let me see ; I think , If I had such a tire , this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers And yet the painter flattered her a little , Unless I flatter with myself too much . Her hair is auburn , mine is perfect yellow ; If that be all the difference in his love , I 'll get me such a coloured periwig . Her eyes are grey as glass , and so are mine : Ay , but her forehead 's low , and mine 's as high . What should it be , that he respects in her , But I can make respective in myself , If this fond Love were not a blinded god ? Come , shadow , come , and take this shadow up , For ' t is thy rival . O thou senseless form ! Throws picture down . Thou shalt be kissed , adored , loved , worshippd ! And , were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thy stead . Picks picture up . I 'll use thee kindly for thy mistress ' sake , That used me so ; or else , by Jove , I vow , I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes , To make my master out of love with thee . JULIA retires . Enter PROTEUS and THURIO . Thu . Thurio Sir Proteus , what says Silvia to my suit ? Pro . Proteus Peace . Here comes the Duke . Enter DUKE attended with pages , gentlemen , servants with torches , etc . Duke . How now , Sir Proteus ! how now , Thurio ! Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late ? Thu . Thurio Not I. Pro . Proteus Nor I. Duke . Saw you my daughter ? Pro . Proteus Neither . Duke . Why then , she 's fled unto that peasant Valentine , And Eglamour is in her company . Therefore , I pray you , stand not to discourse , But mount you presently ; and meet with me , Upon the rising of the mountain foot That leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet gentlemen , and follow me . Exit . Thu . Thurio I 'll after , more to be revenged on Eglamour , Than for the love of reckless Silvia . Exit . Pro . Proteus And I will follow , more for Silvia 's love , Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her . Exit . Jul . Julia And I will follow , more to cross that love , Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love . Exit . SCENE 4.  --  The Forest  --  A Storm in progress  --  PROTEUS is seen plunging through the trees , and JULIA follows at a distance . After a little while a woman 's scream heard  --  A clash of swords ensues  --  Thunder and lightning . Then Enter Outlaws with SILVIA. 1 Out . 1st Outlaw Come , come ; Be patient ; we must bring you to our captain . Sil . Silvia A thousand more mischances than this one Have learned me how to brook this patiently . 2 Out . 2nd Outlaw Come , bring her away . 1 Out . 1st Outlaw Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3rd Outlaw Being nimble-footed , he hath out-run us ; Go thou with her to the west end of the wood ; There is our captain . We 'll follow him that 's fled ; The thicket is beset , he can not scape. 1 Out . 1st Outlaw Come , I must bring you to our captain 's cave . Fear not ; he bears an honourable mind , And will not use a woman lawlessly . Sil . Silvia O Valentine , this I endure for thee . Exeunt . The storm passes away . Enter VALENTINE . Val . Valentine How use doth breed a habit in a man ! These shadowy , desert , unfrequented woods I better brook than flourishing peopled towns . Here can I sit alone , unseen of any , And to the nightingale 's complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes . O thou that dost inhabit in my breast , Leave not the mansion so long tenantless , Lest , growing ruinous , the building fall , And leave no memory of what it was ! Repair me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherish thy forlorn swain !  --  Noise within  --  of swords and cries . What halloing and what stir is this to-day ? These my rude mates , that make their wills their law , Have some unhappy passenger in chase . They love me well : yet I have much to do To keep them from uncivil outrages . Withdraw thee , Valentine : who 's this comes here ? Steps aside . Enter PROTEUS , SILVIA , and JULIA in boy 's clothes . Pro . Proteus Madam , this service I have done for you  --  Though you respect not aught your servant doth  --  To hazard life , and rescue you from him That would have forced your honour and your love . Vouchsafe me , for my meed , but one fair look ; A smaller boon than this I can not beg , And less than this , I am sure , you can not give . Val . Valentine How like a dream is this I see and hear ! Love , lend me patience to forbear awhile . Sil . Silvia O miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you , madam , ere I came ; But by my coming I have made you happy . Sil . Silvia By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy . Jul . Julia Aside . And me , when he approacheth to your presence . Sil . Silvia Had I been seizd by a hungry lion , I would have been a breakfast to the beast Rather than have false Proteus rescue me . O Heaven be judge , how I love Valentine , Whose life 's as tender to me as my soul ; Therefore be gone ; solicit me no more . Pro . Proteus O , ' t is the curse in love , and still approved , When women can not love where they 're beloved . Sil . Silvia When Proteus can not love where he 's beloved . For her dear sake thou once didst rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths ; and all those oaths Descended into perjury to love me . Thou hast no faith left now : better have none Than plural faith , which is too much by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proteus In love Who respects friend ? Sil . Silvia All men but Proteus . Pro . Proteus Nay , if the gentle spirit of moving words Can no way change you to a milder form , I 'll woo you like a soldier , at arms ' end , And love you ' gainst the sanctity of love ,  --  Seizes her . Sil . Silvia O Heaven ! Val . Valentine Coming forward Ruffian , let go that rude uncivil touch ,  --  Thou friend of an ill fashion ! Pro . Proteus Valentine ! Val . Valentine Thou treacherous man ! Nought but mine eye could have persuaded me . Who should be trusted , when one 's own right hand Is perjured to the bosom ? Proteus , I am sorry I must never trust thee more , But count the world a stranger for thy sake . The private wound is deep'st : time most accurst , ' Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst ! Pro . Proteus My shame and guilt confound me.  --  Forgive me , Valentine , If hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ; I do as truly suffer As e'er I did commit . Val . Valentine Then I am paid ; And once again I do receive thee honest . Who by repentance is not satisfied Is nor of heaven , nor earth ; for these are pleased ; By penitence the Eternal 's wrath 's appeased . And , that my love may appear plain and free , All that was mine in Silvia I give thee . Jul . Julia O me unhappy ! Faints . Pro . Proteus Look to the boy . Val . Valentine Why , boy ! why , wag ! how now ? what is the matter ? Look up ; speak . Jul . Julia O good sir ! my master charged me To deliver a ring to Madam Silvia , Which , out of my neglect , was never done . Pro . Proteus Where is that ring , boy ? Jul . Julia Here ' t is : this is it . Gives a ring . Pro . Proteus How ! let me see . Why , this is the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry you mercy , sir ; I have mistook : This is the ring you sent to Silvia . Shows another ring . Pro . Proteus But , how cam'st thou by this ring ? At my depart I gave this unto Julia . Jul . Julia And Julia herself did give it to me ; And Julia herself hath brought it hither . Pro . Proteus How ? Julia ! Jul . Julia Behold her who gave aim to all thy oaths , And entertained them deeply in her heart : O Proteus , let this habit make thee blush : Be thou ashamed , that I have took upon me Such raiment :  --  if shame live In a disguise of love . It is the lesser blot , Women to change their shapes than men their minds . Pro . Proteus Than men their minds ! ' t is true . O Heaven , were man But constant , he were perfect : that one error Fills him with faults ; makes him run through all sins : Inconstancy falls off , ere it begins . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Julia 's , with a constant eye ? Val . Valentine Come , come , a hand from either . Let me be blest to make this happy close ; ' T were pity two such friends should be long foes . Pro . Proteus Bear witness , Heaven , I have my wish for ever . Jul . Julia And I mine . Enter Outlaws , with DUKE and THURIO . Outlaws . A prize ! a prize ! a prize ! Val . Valentine Forbear ,  --  Forbear , I say ; it is my lord the duke .  --  Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced , Banishd Valentine . Duke . Sir Valentine ! Thu . Thurio Yonder is Silvia ; and Silvia 's mine . Val . Valentine Thurio , give back , or else embrace thy death , Come not within the measure of my wrath : Do not name Silvia thine ; if once again , Milano shall not hold thee .

Thou art a gentleman , and well derived ; Take thou thy Silvia , for thou hast deserv 'd her . Val . Valentine I thank your grace ; the gift hath made me happy . I now beseech you , for your daughter 's sake , To grant one boon that I shall ask of you . Duke . I grant it for thine own , whate'er it be . Val .
