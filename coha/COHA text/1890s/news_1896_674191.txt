txt Among the sanitary movements of great practical value which have been caused or forcibly stimulated by the recent tievelopment of bacteriological science that which relates to the purification of municipal water supplies is by no means the least important and beneficial . During the last few months we have directed attention to official reports concerning the deplorable condition of the water supplies In Philadelphia , Washington , Albany , Cleveland , and a dozen other cities and to efforts being made by sanitary officers and citizen associations to obtain relief . We are confident that in nearly all of these cities a continued demand for purification  --  supported as IL is by unimpeachable vital statistics , the reports of experts , and the clear teachings of sanitary science  --  will in the near future be satisfied by the application of approved remedies . Cincinnati has suffered for years by reason of the pollution of its water , which Is taken from the Ohio River . For the five years ending with 1tifil the city 's typhoid mot tality averaged 52.1 per 100,000 of population , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same years . " If the municipal corporation were to be held liable , " said Mr. JOAN a wellknown civil engineer , a. few months ago , " for the fatal cases of typhoid fever only , the damages for the year 1891 alone would aggregate $1,690,000 , an amount considerably greater than would bo required to construct purification works . " A committee of the Cincinnati Academy of Medicine recently submitted an instructive report concerning the city 's water . Having remarked that no practical effort to improve the supply had been made for a quarter of a century , the committee said : " Is there any reason why our annual death rate from typhoid fever should he from 50 to 135 per 100,000 of population , while that of Brooklyn is 15 , that of New York 17 , Cleveland 27 , Boston and New-Orleans 28 , and St. Louis 31 ? Seven European cake , aggregating 7,730,000 population , using filtered water , had in 1801 death rates from typhoid fever ranging from 4 stn Berlin to 15 In London , the average being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ty la the United States of over 300,000 population has so high a death rate from the water-borne diseases as Cincinnati , " It is shown that the supply is polluted by the city 's own sewage , discharged into the river " within a short distance of the intake . " Even if the intake should be placed at a point far above these sewer outlets , the supply would still be contaminated , for many towns discharge sewage into the Ohio . Four years ago the State Board of Health announced at the conclusion of an investigation made at the request of the Legislature that Cincinnati 's water supply was " dangerously polluted and should be abandoned as soon as possible , " and that while the river was the best available source of supply , water taken from it could " not be used safely without purification . " The academy/ committee holds that the river must continue to be the source of supply , because the smaller streams are in even a worse condition and good water can not be obtained in the vicinity by artesian wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand filtration . The construction of sand-filtration works costs something , it is true , but money so expended is well invested . We have heretofore pointed out that the purification of polluted supplies , even at great expense , is really economical when the cost of bad water is taken into account . The committee says : A pure water supply tor Cincinnati would mean the saving of more than 100 lives each year by the reduction of the number of cases of typhoid fever , and many others by the reduction of cases of rather water-borne diseases . If only 20 lives were saved in a year , their money value would he more than sufficient to meet the increased cosi , of construction and operation . But the loss to the community by the extinguishment of valuable . lives is not the only loss . Each death ft out typhoid fever indicates the existence of at least 30 or 10 cases of disease  --  so many persons rendered helpless for weeks or months , many of them between the ages of 20 and 70 , the ' effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread-winning efficiency the time on the part of nurses and attendants coincidently withdrawn from the producing , period , the cost of medicines and medical attendance , and other expenses inseparably connected with sickness , and it will be seen that the money loss to the community is large  --  how large we do not pretend to estimate . Nor can we place in definite form the misery which the sickness and deaths of so many persons bring upon their kin- ' dyed . " For , the same reasons it is economical for cities and villages to prevent by the sanitary inspection of dairies such epidemics of typhoid as were caused in Stamford , Montclair , Springfield , and other places by the distribution of infected milk . Such reports as this one are instructive and useful in other communities as well as in those for which they are prepared , and it should not be overlooked that the most effective work for the prevention of disease is now done by physicians .
