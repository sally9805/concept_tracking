txt The Spanish Peace Commissioners have not yet fixed the day to submit their final answer to the American propositions . It is deemed most likely , however , that Saturday will be the da , y appointed , and the opinion gains ground that the Spaniards will accept the proposals of the United States . A significant indication of this view of the situation was a remark dropped by Serior Abarzuza , of the Spanish Commission to-day that they expected to remain here auout a fortnight longer . The Secretary of the Spanish Commission , Senor Ojeda , said this morning that the instructions from Madrid were not sufficiently matured to enable them to appoint the next meeting . The correspondent of The Associated Press asked Seilor Abarzuza to-day if the Commissions would be able to leave Paris next week with the Treaty , and he replied , with a side-long glance , as though to observe whether his questioner noted the significance of the reply : " I suppose we shall be here for another fortnight ' - " Why . " the Spanish Commissioner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of the Paris press that you will decline the $20,000,000 , but will sign the Treaty with a protest that you did so only under the pressure of superior power . " " Well , it does seem that $20,000,000 is not very satisfactory . " This was the semi-evasive manner in Which the Spanish diplomat answered the question . His questioner continued : " Then it has been affirmed that Spain will refuse to sign the treaty , decline the money offered , and make a protest to the powers and that her Commissioners will go home . Is that the most likely result ? " " Ali ! But we should not anticipate . We should know day by day what happens day by day . " " And no you anticipate a fortnight more of daily developments here ? " " Ah ! yes . A fortnight . Perhaps some affairs may be attended to in that time . " Thanksgiving Day is cold , wet , and drear ..
