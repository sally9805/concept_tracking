txt MANY Americans were good enough to call upon me before I had the pleasure of visiting their country , and many Americans have called since , and no American ever does me this honor without charging the very atmosphere of my study with oxygen , and leaving an impression of activity which quickens my slow pulses and almose reduces me to despair . It is now several years ago that a tall , thin , alert man followed his card into my study with such rapidity that I had barely time to read it before my visitor was in the room . " My name is Elijah K. Higgins and I am a busy man . You are also busy and have no time to fool away . Four days is all I can give to the United Kingdom , and I wished to shake hands with you . Good-bye , I am off to Drumtochty . " I calculate that Mr. higgins spent thirty seconds in my study , and left the room so swiftly that I overtook him only at the front door . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Guess I do ! " he said . " Got the route in my pocket , northwest from Perth , N. B. , " and in two seconds more he was whirling away in a fast hansom . As I returned to my study and imagined my visitor compassing Great Britain ( I think he excluded Ireland , but I am not certain ) in four days , I was for a moment roused from the state of comparative lethargy which we , in England , call work , and added six more engagements to my afternoon 's programme . For days afterwards , and as often as I was tempted to rest in my chair , the remembrance of that whirlwind gave me a shock of new vigor . Sometimes a reaction would folliw , and I humbly thanked Providence , although that was to write // myself a weakling and a sluggard , that I was not born in the country where Mr. Higgins lived and moved and was at home . A year earlier , I had been dodging among the Greek Islands in an Italian cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whose bows had been staved in by a collision . We did not go out to the open when the sea was rough , but we called at any port where we could obtain cargo . We took our meals when we pleased , and had no idea when we should reach our destination . It was a calm voyage where there was no commotion either of mind or body , and then our little pool was lashed into a tempest by the arrival of a new passenger . He came when we were ashore , and ere we returned he had already changed the whole aspect of the ship . The crew had ceased to sleep in picturesque attitudes on the deck , and were explaining him to one another with the aid of gesticulations and many a " per Baccho . " The captain was listening to him with unaffected interest , and was evidently much impressed by the eloquence of his new passenger , although he did not understand a single word he said . Our stewaid , the most leisurely of men , who served a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smoke , and passed us at a swift walk with a couple of dishes . And I began to understand the situation when I heard what the latest arrival was saying to the captain : " Yes , Cap , you had better hustle and keep on schedule time , or else we will miss the connection at Brindisi . " As he found the Italians uninteresting , as well as unenterprising , he gave us the most of his company , and , as the Scotch woman said about the sermon , it was both " edifying and diverting . " He was just returning from a visit to the Holy Land , and it had not " filled the bill , " so far as I could make out ; hc had traversed the whole country in fourteen days and eight hours from ship to ship ; and I fancy that if any other person required forty days , he really had done it in fourteen , using no doubt a swift dromedary , and travelling both by night and day . lie frankly confessed , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been without gain . Palestine , to my American friend , showed an immense want of activity , and cried aloud for the application of American brains and capital . Jerusalem , in especial , had been a painful surprise , for he had expected great things ; and he assured me that its condition was beyond belief . // " They may say what they like about Jerusalem , but it is a back number . As I am a white man , there 's not a trolley-car nor a daily newspaper in the whole place . What Jerusalem wants is a few hustlers from the West . I guess they would show the old place a razzle-dazzle , " and my American friend looked far away , as if he saw already the new companies and industries , and speculations of his compatriots in the city of David . A year ago I was staying in a villa on the Riviera , and a new guest arrived . He had come from America as rapidly as the suiftest ship and through express could carry him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come for the voyage , or for the Riviera , or to pay a visit of friendship , or to see a picture ? Not at all . A workman in the huge mills of which he was manager had discovered the means of doubling the producing power of a piece of machinery . As soon as the invention had been verified , the manager started for Europe to see his partners , and to arrange to spend ? 100,000 in applying the invention to new machinery . It would save the labor of , say , 50 men , and yet 100 more men would be needed in the works , because such an invention would enable the firm to secure larger contracts . Never in my life have I met a man who impressed a stranger with such a sense of alert intellect and unwearied activity . He thought of rothing , and read about nothing , and spoke about nothing , and dreamed about nothing , and one might add , with one or two reservations , he cared about nothing , except his article of manufacture which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no question about these plates which he had not anticipated and could not answer . The sources of aluminium and its value , its constituents , and its combinations , its methods of treatment , arid its practical uses , all this he knew up and down , through and through , past and present , and altogether . He could reason with much acuteness on the burning questions of aluminium , he read extensively , and generally had a book in his hand on aluminium plates ; he had a highly trained and exuberant imagination on the future of aluminium . Times there were when he even drifted into sentiment , on the service which aluminium had rendered to the human race . It was a joy to meet a man who knew something thoroughly and believed in soiuething utterly , and one felt that , if one had aluminium works , one would like to have my friend Hartmann for manager . Occasionally , he was good enough // ts give me his idea of English manufacturers and machinery ( aluminium of course-it is doubtful whether he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our condition with great concern . He had himself been offered a managership of large English mills and laid down his conditions . The owners must be prepared to put in new machinery every ten years , at the cost of a quarter of a million , and they must clear all union men out of the works . With machinery always up to date and high class workmen , unfettered by any rule of restricted labor , he was of opinion that he could have shown some result that would astonish aluminium circles in England . " I would have given them , " he said , " a good show for their money ; but there was n't sand enough in them to stand the racket ; They weakened at the thought of the Unions and the risk of their money . " When I looked at Mr. Ilartmann , I was certain he would weaken at nothing , either terror of man or expenditure of money ; and I gathered inspiration and something approaching activity from his society . If you were willing to sit with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he invested with a fascinating interest by his wealth of information and brilliant speculations ; and if you had looked Gut at your window at six o'clock next morning you would bave seen Mr. llartmann pacing the grounds with a rapid nervous step . Sometimes , he would stop to write something in his note-book , or he might even sit down to make a calculation in a basket chair intended to shelter invalids from the wind . An idea had entered his mind about the treatment of aluminium , which in nine days he would test in a laboratory at Carthagena , Ill. ; or he had seen a way of reducing the terms of a contract . When you saw Mr. llartmann-who was as impervious to disease as one of his aluminium plates , and to whom every form of invalidism was quite incomprehensible-sitting in a basket chair , you had an agreeable sense of contrast , and a flavor of humor . Such lively experiences , which I often recall in jaded moments , prepare one for a visit or a re-visit to America , as a tonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is bare justice to say that one 's expectations of American energy in its own home have not been disappointed . If Americans , depressed by our heavy climate and our leisurely life , could yet maintain such a level of // thought and motion , what might not be possible to them in their own country , where the atmosphere is charged with electricity , and every second man is a " hustler from way-back . " The stir of the New World affects the visitor and quickens his pulses as he goes up the Hudson and gets his first glimpse of New York . Your steamer had waited four hours at Queenstown for the mails , hut the same mails were transferred to the United States tdndcr as the steamer went up the bay . It is said that some day one of the great railway companies whose connections are broken by the Mersey , will utilize the underground tunnel for goods trains ; but on the Hudson you see huge ferry-boats conveying across the river the freight trains of the Pennsylvania Railway Company . Little tugs dart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamers pass with their upper machinery indecently exposed , as if there had not been time , or it had not been worth while , to cover it . Buildings of incredible height line the shores , and suggest that the American nation , besides utilizing the ground , proposes also to employ the heavens for commercial purposes . It was , I think , a Texas paper which translated the austere saying , " Per aspera ad astra , " into " the hustler gets to heaven , " and certain New York builders seem now to be on the way . Whetted by this overture on the river , one is ready for the full music of the city ; and I wish to pay the compliment with all honesty , that New York , with the possible exception of Chicago , is the activest and noisiest place I have ever seen , or expect to see in this present world . While an English merchant saunters down to his office between nine and ten , a New York man rises at half past six in his suburb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes off an hour during the day for luncheon at his club , while the American eats his meal in fifteen minutes . The Englishman spends more than another hour at afternoon tea , and gossip with friends , and sauntering about between his club and his office , while the American packs every minute with work . The very walk of an English merchant , slow , dignified , self-satisfied , and that of the American , rapid , eager , anxious  --  the one looking as if time were of no importance nor circumstances , and the other as if the loss of a minute might mean ruin-are the visible indices to the character of the nations . It is only yesterday that elevators were introduced into English city buildings , and there are many London ' offices to which you still have to make an Alpine ascent of four // stairs ; but a New Yorker regards a stair as a survival of barbarism , and hardly knows how to use it . The higher buildings have several sets of elevators , like the four tracks which railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't go in there , " my friend said , with whom I was going to lunch at a club on the top floor of a many-storied New York building . " That 's an accommodation elevator ; stops , you know , at every station . This is the express for the top floor . " " Would it have made much difference ? " I said . " Very nearly a minute , " as if the loss of the minute would have thrown us back for the rest of the day . No man goes slow if he has the chance of going fast , no man stops to talk if he can talk walking , no man walks if he can ride in a trolley car , no one goes in a trolley car if he can get a convenient steam car , and by and by no one will go in a steam car if he can be shot through a pneumatic tube . No one writes with his own hand if he can dictate to a stenographer , no one dictates if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by and by when the spirit of American invention has brought wireless telegraphy into thorough condition , a man will simply sit with bis mouth at one hole and his ear at another , and do business with the ends of the earth in a few seconds , which the same machine will copy and preserve in letter books and ledgers . It is the American 's regret tbat at present he can do nothing with his feet while he is listening at the telephone , but , doubtless , some employment will be found for them in the coming age . If a slow-witted and slow-moving Englishman desires a liberal education , let him take a journey of a month on the steam cars in the United States . No train in Europe travels as fast as certain American expresses , and if other trains go slower it is a matter of thankfulness , because they are less likely to kill passengers on level crossings , or in the main streets of the city along which they take their way , and cattle have more time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick of jumping the rails , either through the rails spreading or the eccentricity of the engine , both being instances of exuberant national vitality , it is just as well that every express does not go at the rate of the Empire State Express on the New York Central . Nowhere in Europe can a traveller find stronger or handsomer cars , and they are marvels of adaptability and convenience . There is a dining car , in order // that you may not lose time at a station , and also , which is not unimportant , in order that you may be able to occupy your time with something practical on the train . Of course , there is a smokiI:g compartment , where men can compare notes upon politics and business , and be able to escape from idleness and themselves . The best expresses have a reading car , where the American can pick up such morsels of information from the magazines as he can contain between the interstices of business . There is a desk where he can read his letters , and a typewriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sleeping-place and dining-place , and his home and his office . One thing only he regrets ; the train , as it flies along , is not connected with the telegraph and the telephone , so that , as an idea occurs to him or he obtains a hint from a man in the smoking car , he might be able to do business with his correspondents in Chicago or San Francisco . While an Englishman on a railway journey is generally dressed in rough and loosely fitting tweeds , suggestive of a country life and of sport , the coat of his American cousin is of dark material and has not a superfluous inch of cloth . From his collar to his neat little boot the American is prim , spick-and-span , and looks as if he had come out of a band-box and were ready to appear in the principal room of any office . He is dressed in fact for business , and looks like business from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet , while an Englishman 's appearance suggests that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has retired to live upon a farm . My countryman arrives at the station with two and a half minutes to spare , and laden with small baggage . A porter carries his rug and an ulster , very likely also a hat-box and a bag with books , papers , and such like in it , to say nothing of an umbrel'a end a mackintosh , and he secures his seat at the last moment . He fastens his hat above his head , puts on a travelling cap , changes into an ulster , if it be winter time , and throws a rug over his knee ; he puts on travelling gloves , and gets out the Times , and lie will sit without budging and read his Times without intermission for fifty minutes . Besides these trifles with him in the carriage , he has a portmanteau in the van , which he hopes has been addressed , and which the porter promised to see put in , and he will scramble for it at his terminus along with a hundred other passengers , who are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap on the platform . // The American reaches the depot by a trolley car fifteen minutes at least before the hour of departure , having sent his heavy luggage , if he has any-which is not likely-by baggage express . His only personal equipment is a slim and compact valise , which , in regard to opening and shutting , is a marvel of convenience . This he carries in his hand , and places beneath or beside the seat which he has secured two days before . He does not carry a rug because the cars are heated , nor an umbrella because it is not the rainy season . His top coat he hangs up beside his seat , as if he were in his own house ; and his hat if he so please . He does not wear a travelling cap any more than in his own drawing-room , nor gloves in the train any more than in his own office . Should his hands be soiled , he goes to the lavatory where there are large basins and an ample supply of water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porter in every car to brush it . The immense repose of the English traveller is quite impossible for this mercurial man , v*hose blood and whose brain are ever on a stir . Very rarely will you see him reading a book , because he is not accustomed to read , aid the demands of a book wGuld lessen his time for business meditation . Boys with newspapers circulate through the cars , and he buys each new paper as it appears at the different towns . Whether it be Republican , or Democratic , or a family paper or a yellow journal , does not matter to him ; he glances at the startling headings , takes an accident or a political scandal at a mouthful , skims over the business news , sees whether anything has happened at the Philippines , notes that the canard of the morning has been contradicted in the afternoon , and flings paper after paper on the floor . Three minutes or , in cases of extreme interest , five minutes suffice for each paper , and by and by this omnivorous reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , is knee deep in printed information or sensation . For two minutes , he is almost quiet , and seems to be digesting some piece of commercial information . He then rises hurriedly , as if he had been called on the telephone , and makes for the smoking car , where he will discuss " Expansion " with vivid , picturesque speech , and get through a cigar with incredible celerity . Within fifteen minutes he is in the sleeper again ; and , a little afterwards , wearying of idleness , he is chewing the end of a cigar , which is a substitute for smoking and saves him from being wearied with his own company . Half an hour before the train is due at his station , he is being // brushed , and getting ready to alight . Before the train has reached the outskirts of the town , lie has secured his place in a procession which stands in single file in the narrow exit passage from the sleeper . Each man is ready dressed for business and has his valise in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alight , and is envying the man at the head of the procession , who will have a start of about two seconds . This will give him a great advantage in business , and he may never be overtaken by his competitors till evening . Suppose he lands at 6 a. in. , he will find breakfast ready in a hotel , and half a dozen men eating as if their lives depended upon finishing by 6.15 a. m . Before seven he will have disposed of a pile of letters , dictating answers to a typist attached to the hotel , he will have telegraphed in all directions , and made half a dozen appointments in the town by telephone . Within the forenoon he will finish his business and depart for some neighboring town , lunching on the cars . The second town he will dispose of in the afternoon , and that evening go on board the sleeper to travel 400 miles to a third town , where he is going to negotiate a contract at 8 o'clock next morning . If you sympathize with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he accepts your sympathy as a compliment , and assures you that he never sleeps so well as on the cars . He never seems to be out of sorts or out of temper : lie is always thoroughly alive and quite goodnatured . Sometimes he may seem for a moment annoyed , when he can not telegraph as often as he wants along the line , or when the train is not on time , that he may make a connection . Nothing would wound him so deeply as to " get left , " and he can only affect to be unconscious when someone declares that he is " no slouch , and that there are no flies on him . " If he is obliged to spend two hours doing nothing in a hotel , when business is over , then he rocks himself and smokes , and it is a wonderful spectacle for an indolent Englishman to look down from the gallery that commands the hall of the hotel , and to see fifty able-bodied fellow men who have worked already twelve hours , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all in motion . ( One wonders why this motion is not utilized to drive something . ) He discovers how unlike cousins may be , for he never moves unless he is obliged to or unless he wants to shoot something , and these remarkable men never rest unless when they are asleep . About that even , I // am not sure , and I was often tempted to draw aside the curtain from a berth in a sleeping car , and , had I done so , I should not have been at all surprised to find our friend wide awake with a cold cigar in his cheek , and rocking his knees for want of more extensive accommodation . He has always rebelled against the ancient custom of sleep , which he regards as a loss of time and an anachronism . All that he can do is to spend the night in a sleeping car , which , as he will tell you , annihilates time and space . Foreigners travelling in the States in their innocence are amazed that a delicate-minded nation , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion of the Pullman cars , and should not insist upon the Continental cabin-car . The reason br the Arcadian simplicity of the sections is not really economy , for no American would ever think twice of spending a dollar ; it is simply their abounding and dominant energy . If you sleep in cabins at night , you must sit in cabins by day ; and this would mean a seclusion and repose which are very distasteful to the highstrung American temperament . It would be like bottling up a volatile gas ; and one might almost think it might lead to an explosion , which some day would break down the partitions and break up the car from end to end . The American must see everything in his car and hear everything , for which he depends upon the peculiar quality of the local voice ; and he must be at liberty to prowl about his car , and to sit with his friends here and there . The car is his little world for the time , and he is not going to live in a backwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do from twenty-five to thirty-three per cent . more than an Englishman in the same time , and that the higher wages of the American have their compensation for the capitalist in a workman 's quickness of mind and sleight of hand . Everything goes at an accelerated speed , with wonderful inventions in labor saving machinery and devices to economize time . If the great end of a nation be to Qo as much as possible in as short a time as possible , then the American climate has been practically arranged for that end . An Englishwoman living in the States becomes effervescent , and the native American is the brightest woman on the face of the earth . While the English atmosphere is heavy and soothing , and lends itself to thought and quietness , the American climate is exciting // and exhi'iarating , and quickens both mind and body to the highest activity . It is an electric climate , and the electricity has passed into the people , who are simply vessels charged up to a certain number of volts . These vessels as sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices , or workshops or politics . Of course , a day xx ill come when the vessels will have been completely discharged , and that day arrives very frequently without warning . A little confnsion in the head , and a slight numbness in the limbs , and the man has to go away a year to Colorado Springs or to Los Angeles . If he is fortunate , he can be recharged and run for another five or ten years ; then nature does not give any warning , but simply stops the heart or darkens the brain , and you must get another man . No one , unless he leaves the country or becomes a crank , can escape from this despotism of activity ; he is part of the regiment and must march with his fellows . The idea of making a competency and then retiring , say , into the country , never crosses a man 's mind . When you urge economy upon a man for this end , you have injured your case , and are pleading on the other side . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever resolved to be a spendthrift . To seclude an active American in an oldfashioned country house , with ivy climbing round its Tudor windows , even although there should be a library of black oak inside and a rose garden outside , would be cruelty ; it would be to imprison a squirrel in a golden cage . What greatly impresses the traveller in the United States is that the rich men work as hard and as long as the poor , and that they can not even give attention to the affairs of their country , but are willing to leave them to the very doubtful management of the " Boss , " because it would not pny them to leave their business and go into politics . If the end of life be riches , then clever American is a successful man , for in no country does a respectable man become so very rich ) or rich so soon , and if not respectable he still may do fairly well . You can not have everything , however , and one notes that the average rich man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read very little - his wife reads for him ; he has travelled very little-his daughters travel for him . He has no voice in the State-professional politicians speak for him ; he has no amusements , unless you include speculation ; and he has no pleasant periods of rest , unless you accept as an equivalent comparatively early and sudden death , // which often arises from acute indigestion . He has not time to stop and realize himself , unless , but this is a large exception , when he has dyspepsia . One reason , perhaps , why Americans do not rest is that given to me by a bright woman : " We are all so tired , " and the American is the victim of his own qualities . One , of course , acknowledges the advantages of this amazing energy , and there are times when a stolid Englishman grows envious . A university in America is created in ten years and endowed to the extent of millions sterling , and equipped with chairs of which a European never dreamt , and laboratories which border upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , for which the treasuries of Europe have been ransacked ; and , were it not for the restriction of governments , the Old Masters would have to be sought , not in Italy and England , but in New York and Chicago . New towns are designed upon a scale of magnificence , as if each were to be the capital of an empire , and are at least outlined in building within a few years . Should it be necessary , an army can be created within a few months , and in a couple of years a new trade can be established which will kill its European rivals . An English farmer with fifteen hundred acres is a considerable man , but an American can have fifteen thousand acres and his different farm buildings will be connected by telephone . A self-made man in England marries his daughter to a baronet and is much lifted ; but the daughter of a self-made man in America will marry an English duke , and consider she has conferred a benefit . When you go to a Western town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , you are taken to a dry-goods store ; each , in its own way , is the largest of its kind . Certainly , there are stores in America which have no rival in the Old World , and which you are expected to visit with the same appreciation as the Duomo of Florence . There is almost nothing that the United States does not possess , except political purity , and nothing which an American can not do , except rest ; and in the conflict with foreign competition , he has almost discounted victory . Whether he be able , that is , patient and thorough in the discovery of principles , may be a question ; that he is clever , by which one means bright and ingenious in turning principles to account , is beyond all question . If America has not yet had time to produce a Lord Kelvin , it has given us telephones ; and if Professor Dewar has astonished the // world with his liquid air , an American trust is , it is said , being formed to handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull and slow , as we travel among the most stimulating and hospitable people on the face of the earth , let some excuse be made for us and let our hosts share the blame . An Englishman in the United States is half dazed , like one moving amid the ceaselcss din and whirling wheels of a huge manufactory , where the voice has to be raised to a shriek , and a sentence compressed into - a single word . He goes home greatly humbled in his estimation of himself , and in low spirits about the commercial future of his country . Tie has no bitterness , however , within his heart , for are not these pe9ple of his own blood , and are not their triumphs his , even if they threaten to outrun his own nation in the race of productive commerce ? And when he comes back to England , has he not his compensations , Stratford-on-Avon , and Westminster Abbey , and the greenery of the home Counties , and the lights and shadows of the Scots Lochs , and the musical voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cultured English homes ?
