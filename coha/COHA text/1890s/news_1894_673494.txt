txt The finding of three dynamite bombs and nine paper dynamite cartridges , all fully charged and primed and capable of doing terrible execution , created a big sensation in the Police Department and kept Police Inspectors , Captains . and detectives hunting about all day yesterday for information as to the purpose fur which they had been made . The bombs and cartridges were not the ordinary kind , such as are used for blasting purposes , but were , the police say , especially prepared to do mischief . Their discovery was purely accidental . and it was not until after they had been handled by a policeman and then laid out before Sergt Osborneon his desk , In the Thirtieth Precinct Station House . that it was discovered how deadly they were . Policeman Connors of the West One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street Station noticed two men moving stealthily close to the Peace at Amman 's greenhouse , near One Hundred and Twentieth Street and St .. Nicholas Avenue , about 3 o'clock yesterday morning . They were going toward St. , Nicholas Avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second mart seemed quite tired . He was carrying an oblong-shaped bundle wrapped In newspapers , and tied with pieces of a clothesline . The bundle was about eighteen inches long , eight inches wide , and three inches thick . The policeman had noticed two men acting suspiciously in the neighborhood some time previously . He stopped the man who was carrying the bundle . The other suspicious character , who was about fifty feet in advance , stopped when the policeman crossed the street , and the man with the bundle set it down un the ground and waited for Connors to approach him . When the policeman asked him what he had in the bundle , he answered indifferently . " Ole nothing. - Being questioned further , he said that there was nothing but some old clothing in the bundle . As he complained of having pains in the back front carrying it . and as Connors saw that , whatever the bundle contained , it was much heavier than clothing , he told the man that he would have to take him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that he had caught a pair of thieves in the act of carrying off their booty . This idea was steengthened when he saw the man 's comeanion take to his heels and run toward St. Nicholas Avenue . The policeman was about to run after the fugitive , and called to him to stop or he would shout . The runaway only went faster than ever , and the policeman took the man with the bundle to the station house . Sergt. Osborne , who was in charge , unwound the clothesline and newspaper wrappings and prepared to see what sort of plunder the supposed thief had stolen . As he opened the last wrapper he turned pale and started back in affright as he caught sight of the deadly-looking implements , from the ends of which protruded long fuses . Without asking any questions of the prisoner , who stood by and looked nonchalantly at the munI  --  rous things , Sergt. Osborne had them removed in coal scuttles to a vacant lot across the street from the station house . When the last cartridge had been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man was questioned . but would only say he was John Kelley. a laborer , fifty years old , and that he hied at ese Grand Street . He was shabbey attired . and wore an 111-kempt reddish beard and mustache . His clothing was soiled and tattered , and he looked like one of the d ? ? tilzciis of the address he gave . which is a lodging house of the cheapest East Side kepi . Sergeant Osborne sent Immediately for Inspector Conlin and team . MeakIrn , and when the latter arrived . K ? iley was brought upstairs and told the Captain ht. ; story . " I was coining out er a cigar store In Grand Street shortly atter lo o*cluctt last night . " he said , " when a ' s:raneer carrying a bundle , came up to me and asked me the way to the Sixth Avenue elevated station . I showed him the way . and he asked me If 1 wanted to make a dollar or two . He said he had been engaged by an unknown man to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired , and would pay me to help him carry the bundle there . I accepted his offer , and we rode up on the Sixth Avenue Hoed to the One Hundred and Sixteenth Street Station . We got off there by mistake , and when we reached the sidewalk we ** not know where we were . Thinking we would strike the right road after a while , we walked along until the policeman hailed us . I made no attempt to run , for I was sure I had done nothing wrong , and I would nut have risked my life as I did if I had known what was In the bundle . " It was suggested to Kelley that he wag taking a long road to get to the Harlem Bridge by going west from Eighth Avenue . but his excuse was that he dld not ask where he was going . but simply followed his companion . There were several ' Itscrepancles in his story which were puzzling . and on which account the police authorities think he knows more about the bombs and cartridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in Grand Street shortly after 10 o'clock Sunday night , but it was not until five hours later that he was seen by Policeman Connors . Then , too , the fact that he said his destination was Harlem Brid=e , while he was traveling In a directly opposite direction , indicated that he had not told the truth . The three bombs were pieces of galvanized pipe , about three inches in diameter , about eighteen Inches long , and were riveted with bolts at the ends . They were bound tightly together with wire , and a fuse twenty inches long was attached to each . The cartridges were bound together in packages of three , and then wrapped in paper and secured with twine . Contractor John Quinn of Harlem was called in when Inspector Conlin arrived , and gave it as his opinion that the cartridges and bombs were manufactured especially to do harm , and not for blasting purposes . Chief of the Bureau of Combustibles Peter Seery agreed with him , after he had examined them in the vacant lot . At 1 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the office of the Bureau of Combustibles , and immersed in water . Up to a late hour last night the police officials had no clue to work upon . Inspector Conlin said that It is possible that it was intended to bury the bombs and cartridges In the flower beds of Amman 's greenhouse . which would be a convenient place to keep them until wanted . The locality in which Kelley was captured is a fashionable quarter of the city , and if an explosion of either the bombs or cartridges was intended in this neighborhod. the amount of damage done would have been enormous . The houses in the neighborhood are either stylish apartment houses or private residences , and a couple of fashionable hotels are near by . Central Otfice detectives are after Kelley 's companion , but had obtained no trace of him up to a late hour last night .
