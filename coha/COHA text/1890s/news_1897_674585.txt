STEWART 'S DIPLOMATIC DENIAL Chronic Bear on All But Silver , but Just Now a Casual Bull 4 , Without Prejudice . " Senator Stewart of Nevada was much perturbed yesterday by inquiries concerning his remarks published in yesterday 's NEW YORK ' TIMES , and he spent the afternoon writing out responsive telegrams , along with some expressions of annoyance concerning THE NEW York : TIMES , which , in printing his remarks , had ignored the fact that free-silver Senators , in hobnobbing enthusiasm over Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by their political necessities . These necessities required Senator Stewart to give out yesterday the following , which , it is to be observed , is not a disclaimer of any remarks which THE NEW Yonie TIMES has attributed to him : " I have had no conversation with a. reporter or anybody else from which any inference can be drawn , much less any statement made , to the effect that I have changed my views with regard to the unlimited coinage of silver by the United States independently of any other nation , and at the ratio of 16 to 1 .

I do not believe that they will be in the abject condition that they were in 1891e which enabled the gold combination through fraud , intimidation , and bribery to achieve a victory . " It seems almost providential that relief should come while the battle is on , which will give the people a degree of independence to fight the enemies of civilization who are laboring to enslave the human race by contraction , falling prices , and poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold syndicate . They never ordered anything to make it easier for the people , but Providence has made it hard for other nations in order to give the American people an opportunity to free the people from toe bondage of gold contraction .
