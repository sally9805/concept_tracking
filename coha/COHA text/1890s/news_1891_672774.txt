txt San Francisco just now is in the throes of such a struggle as that DT Which New-York shook off the grip of the tweed fting . There is this ditierenco , however : the Tweed Ring represented a single political faction , while the thieves and bribe takers who ere being bunted to their holes in this city are the present or past leaders Of both parties . The readers of Tile TiaiES are familiar with the succession of scandals by which California has advertised herself during the past year , with the Stanioni election , the Buckley sell-ont , the electric road deal , the Brauer exposure , the Senatorial combine , the contractors ' moss , the scheme to blackmail the scalpers , the wastebasket revelation , the loot of the San Francisco Treasury , and the various other disclosures of corruption , culminating In the Taylor trial , ' Filth its proof of the existence of a syndicate of legislators formally organized to market votes in the bulk and divide the proceeds .

From saying , regrottally : " Why ca n't something be done 1 " people began to say : " Something must be done . " A quarter of a century ago William T. Wallace - was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of California . A man of great ability and restless ambition , he could not be contented to live in dignified retirement when the chances of politics deprived him oftbat office . He COEIscanUr strove to make his way back into puhlio life . In I552 he accepted an clean:in te the lower house Of the State Leidslature , where ho at once took the lead of the Democratic majority and distinguished himself by the vigor and acuteness of his attacks on the Southern Pacific F.:inroad monopoly .

Subsequently Judge Wallace became a member of the Superior Court of San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a candidate last year for the ' Democratic nomination for Chief Justice of tae Supreme Court . but was defeated by John A. Staple-. partly through certain distrust of his sincerity and partly because the bulk of the an Francisco delegation voted for Stedy . The latter fact , of course , did not tend to increase fudge Wallace 's retard for Buckley . There are twelve ' ) nages in the Superior Court of San Francisco . and they select one of their own number for Presiding Judge . In view of Judge Wallace 's distinction , and hi , admitted superiority tn his colleagues in point of legal knowledge and ability . It is natural that this honor should fall to him . It is the duty of thePresiding Judgeeaoh year to se pervise the drawing of the Grand Jury . The usual custom is to have each Judge submit a certain number of names to the full bench , and , after approval , to have these names written on slips of paper and shaken up in a box , after which the County Clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out enough to constitute a Grand Jury . This custom was followed this year at first , but Judge Wallace discovered that twelve of the Mina in the hoe were crumpled , torn , or otherwise capable of identification by touch . Re therefore ordered the twelve names to be rewritten on uniform slips , and had the drawing begin over again . This time the drawing was completed , but by the time the persons who could not be found , and those ' who had legal excuses were deducted , there were only ten left instead of there being nine More names drawn to complete the panel . as - weal ? have been the usual method of procedure . Judge Wallace appointed an olisor and ordered him to select the neoessary number from the body of the county . This course . although uncommon , Is expressly authorized by law . To the Grand Jury thus completed , Judge Wallace delived a charge calling attention to the scandals that had shocked the community , and urging vigorous action against the guilty parties The energy with which the court 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both parties . Boss Buckley , who had recently returned from a European trip , fled to Canada and engaged passage to England . His lieutenants  --  Rainey , Randolph . and Driscoll  --  also made their escape . The Republican bosses , being iu possession , resolved to stay and tight . When Richard Chute , the notorious Republican lobbyist , and btepben T. Gage , the general purchasing agent of the Southern Pacific Company , whose duties included the purchase of votes . ' were summoned to testify before the Grand Jury , they refused to obey on the ground that that body bad not been legally impaneled Judge Wallace sentenced Chute to pay a live-hundreddollar tine and spend five days in jail for contempt . Chute immediately procured a writ of habeas corpus from Judge 1 ) . J. Murphy , one of Judge ' Wallace 's associates in the Superior Court of an Francisco .

His opinion tilled fourteen columns of fine type , when it was published as an advertisement et the railroad 's expense , and the mechanical labor of Its oomposition.allowing nothing for any thought that might be contained in it , represented et least two weeks of the hardest kind of work for any one man . It was undoubtedly prepared by the Southern Pacific law department and turned over to Judge Murphy ready for use . Meanwhile a scheme was on foot to depose Judge Wallace from his position as presiding Judge and to put somebody in his place who would discharge the Grand Jury and impanel a new one satisfactory to the boodlers .

It was soon seen , too , that the possession of Judge Murphy did not make the ring secure . He could release witnesses imprisoned for contempt , but the writ of habeas corpus extended only to the question of personal liberty , and could not be employed to relieve a coutumaeloue witness from the payMeat of a tine . Consequently , Judge Wallace ; could tine Gage . Chute , and their oompanions $500 a day , and the judgment would be a lien against their property , When Gage 's case came up , therefore , his oottnsel . Creed Raymond , the head of the Southern Pacific law department , was touchingly submissive .
