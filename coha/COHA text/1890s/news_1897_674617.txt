txt Replying to a letter by Mr. Bryan , in which he said that free coinage at 10 to 1 would fix a mint price for silver , Secretary Gage said : " There is , properly speaking , no mint price for either gold or silver . All the mint could do for silver at whatever so-called ' ratio , ' would be to give the man bringing uncoined silver to the mint an equal amount in ounces and grains of coined silver , less the cost of the alloy used by the mint in coining it . " In the one case the man has his gold returned to him in gold dollars . In the other case he has silver returned to him in silver dollai.s . Up to this point , nothing in the shape of a demand such as Mr. Bryan talks about has appeared Why , then , does he sophisticate about ' the demand thus created by law , ' when there is no demand ' thus created by law ' ? " Take the legal-tender quality away from both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers would claim that silver in the form of dollars would bring in exchange for other things any substantially higher price than the bullion would bring before being coined . " Mr. Bryan adds to his statement : ' Thus the bullion value will be raised to the coinage value . ' There is no raise about it . Under free coinage the bullion value and the coinage value are and must be identical , but the determining factor is the bullion value . The matter here might be dismissed , but there is an influence at work which might and probably would operate to raise the value of silver , to what extent or how continuously nobody knows . As the silver dollars would serve to pay existing debts , many people would avail themselves thereof to discharge their obligations , provided they could make a profit to themselves by doing so . This they could do only in case the silver dollars were worth less than gold dollars . " We will grant there would be a demand , and if there were now no silver dollars in existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . But there are now about $500,000,000 , and one dollar can be made to serve by repeated use in the payment of unlimited dollars of debt . So that if there were such a demand for the new dollars as to materially enhance their price in the beginning , the increasing supply always coming through the mint would soon satisfy it and the price  --  that is , the market price  --  would soon decline again to a point where the value of the silver dollar would be relegated to its exchangeable power for things in the commercial exchanges of the world . " Then , when that time came , which it soon would , the market value of the coined dollar would be the same as the market value of the bullion in it . and unless a new demand should arise not now foreseen , or unless the silver supply should be much reduced , the value of silver , either as a metal or as money , would not be essentially different from the present value of silver bullion.
