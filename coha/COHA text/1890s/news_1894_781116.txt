txt A typical Anarchist has been discovered at New-Rochelle in the person of an Irishman named Riley . Having had a quarrel with an Italian , or some Italians , Riley desired to be revenged upon all Italians , and he accordingly planned to blow up with dynamite a building in which nearly a hundred Italians lodged . The attitude of Riley toward Italians is the attitude of Anarchists toward the human race . They resolve to avenge upon the species , or the well-dressed and thriving of the species , the wrongs they conceive themselves to have sullered from individuals , the particular wrong being that they are not as well-to-do as more industrious and frugal persons . Riley is likely to be put for some years out of the way of executing his projects of destruction upon Italians . If he has not undertaken quite so large an order , however , as the European Anarchists , he has shown himself to be animated by the same spirit . Although the people of France have declined to buy the shares that were offered to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is reported that 800 men will at once be employed on the Culebra division of the canal route . The resources of this company appear to be about $7,000,000 , subscribed or promised by Eiffel , Hertz , and other persons who assisted in breaking down the old company , and these subscriptions are reported to have been made in return for the discontinuance of the liquidator 's legal proceedings against these worthies . As we have said , the popular subscription was a fiat failure , so that nothing was added from that source . The employment of 800 men on the Culebra division , the most formidable part of the old canal route , is farcical . Just what the new company 's designs are we do not know , but it can not be that the making of a canal is one of them . That is not what a company so composed and controlled , with a capital of only $7,000,000 so procured , really has in mind .                @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sportsmen 's Club , an organization of prominent and wealthy New-York men , is having lots of fun defending its title to the land at Oakdale , four miles from here , on which is , situated its headquarters ; The club owns hundreds of acres of woodland and meadow land at and near Oakdale , and its game preserves extend as far as the main line of the Long Island . Railroad , miles to the north . The land the title for which is under dispute is situated near the clubhouse , and would scarcely constitute two city lots . It was purchased by the club years ago , together with other large tracts , and the club has a clear and apparently valid title . William P. Young , a farmer and landowner of Ronkonkoma , also came into possession of a title to the plot , to all appearances equally as clear and valid . Mr. Young some time ago endeavored to obtain possession . The club , armed with its own title , laughed at Mr. Young 's claim , and the latter threatened to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat , however , and lately he transferred his claim to Orville B. Ackerly , a real estate agent , at 115 Broadway , New-York City . When the real estate man took possession of the claim , he at once began aggressive measures . He notified the club that he intended to take possession of the land . Several of the club members , while on their way to the railroad station Saturday morning , were surprised to see a small , unsightly-looking ho.ase that had sprung up during the night upon the disputed Jana . The blinding had actually been built , and tenants secured in twenty-four hours . Mr.-Ackerly went yesterday to pay a visit to his house and tenants , and found them all missing . There was not a trace of the hastilyconstructed building left . Mr. Ackerly declares he will settle ' the matter in the courts . There was lots of fun at the clubhouse Saturday evening telling and listening to the brief history of the house . Another chapter in the story was added to-day , when Thomas Finner , a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the club while in the act of cutting timber from the disputed land . He said Ackerly had employed him . The club did not care to prefer a complaint against him , and he was discharged . The club is wondering what Ackerly will do next .
