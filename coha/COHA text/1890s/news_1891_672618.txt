Work is condemned to four years in the Eastern Penitentiary , James S. Dungan to three years , and Louis E. Pfeiffer to two years ' imprisonment . Only a few persons were in the court room , probably because no one expected that sentence would be passed eo soon . The - prisoners entered the court together and immediately began an earnest consultation with their counsel . Pfeiffer and his lawyer eat apart from the rest and for a short time whispered anxiously to each other . Then both settled back in their chairs , awaiting the end . The whispered conversation among the lawyers was participated in by the District Attorney and the presiding Judge and then Judge Arnold . resumed his seat on the bench . Mr. Moon , addressing the cour t , said that the motion for a new trial embraced . principally matters whiehhad been passed upon at the trial and that the court had ruled upon them alL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking on the matter from every side , that they would submit them without further argument . Mr. Terry , on behalf of Dungan , acquiesced in Mr. Moon 's statement . On behalf of Work , Mr. Moon withdrew the motion for a Aew trial . Again did Mr. Terry follow Mr. Moon 's lead and on behalf of Dungan withdrew the motion . Judge Arnold looked . surprised for a moment . ' Again Mr. Moon rose and stated that both Work and Dungan desired to change their pleas on the indictment for conspiracy from not guilty to nolo contendere . The pleas wore then formally entered , and District Attorney Graham explained that the plea was practically one of guilty , and consequently the defendants stood . as if oonvicted or the offense charged in the bill . The expert accountant , Taylor Faunae. for the enlightenment of the court , then explained how the books of the bank had been falsified by the prisoners . Before calling the culprits up for sentence , Judge Arnold directed the ladies of their families who were present to - withdraw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pfeiffer almost fainting as he turned toward his counsel , who stood close behind him . His face was ashen white and his lips moved . convulsively for a few momenta as he attempted to regain composure . Dungan is an aged man . His face is shrunken and his cheekbones protrude as if he had barely escaped death by starvation . Frequently during Judge Arnold 's brief address he nodded his head as if in acquiescence to the scathing denunciation of the Judge , and when the sentence was received he fell back in his seat and buried his face in his hands . Work has perceptibly changed . He is thinner and his eyes have lost the animation - which characterized him throughout the trial . When sentence was passed , his composure left him and the dark heavy line beneath his eyes seemed to deepen . Slowly lie lifted his hands to his head and pressed them against his forehead . His son Charles was sitting near him and , for a moment , the two looked into each others eyes and then clasped hands , ' while tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not speak a word . The prisoners were at once removed to the Eastern Penitentiary.
