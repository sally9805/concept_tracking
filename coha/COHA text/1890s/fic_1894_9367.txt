The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open out into the " front hall . " It is furnished in a " set " of rosewood furniture , upholstered in brown and red figured velvet . The walls are covered with dark maroon wall-paper , with framed photographs of Thorwaldsen 's " Four Seasons , " and over the mantel there is an engraving of " Washington Crossing the Delaware . " A rocking-chair and an armchair are in front of the grate fire . Lace curtains and heavy curtains are draped back from two French windows that look out on a covered piazza . There are a desk , a bookcase with glass doors , a " centre table " on which stands a double , green-shaded " Student 's lamp , " a few novels , and some magazines . Near the bookcase is a stand holding a " Rogers ' Group . " There are jars and bowls filled with flowers everywhere . Rand enters with the New York evening papers , The Post , The Sun ; he half yawns , half sighs with fatigue . He starts to make his armchair ready before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he finds a letter which he dislikes , recognizing the handwriting . Rand . George D. Rand Angry . Yes , still keeping it up , the young blackguard ! He tears the letter in two , and throws it into the fire without reading it . He watches it burn a second , lighting a cigar ; then takes his papers , makes himself comfortable in his chair before the fire , and starts to read . After a second , Mrs. Rand and Cicely , a very pretty girl of about seventeen , enter . Mrs. Rand carries a pitcher of water , scissors , and a newspaper . Cicely has her arms full of yellow tulips and a big bowl . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Why , father ! Are n't you home early ? Teresa 's train wo n't be in for an hour or so yet . Mrs. Rand , filling the bowl with water , spreads the newspaper on the table ; then cuts off the stems , and hands the flowers one by one to Cicely , who arranges them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly . My head bothers me ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Going to him with affection and solicitude . Why do n't you lie down ? She lays her hand on his head . You have n't any fever . She kisses his forehead . You 're just overtired ! He pats her hand affectionately , and holds it . When are you going to give up business entirely , darling , and leave it all to George ? Rand . George D. Rand Never , I 'm afraid , dear . Letting go her hand . I 've tried to face the idea , but the idleness appalls me . Cicely . Cicely Rand Mother , have you the scissors ? Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Yes , dear . Joins her , and continues with the flowers . Rand . George D. Rand Besides , George is too restless , too discontented yet , for me to trust him with my two banks ! He 's got the New York bee in his bonnet . Cicely . Cicely Rand Glances at her mother before she speaks . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Rand . George D. Rand And mother ! Cicely . Cicely Rand Humph ! Mother 's just as bad as the rest of us . Only she 's afraid to say so . Smiling . Go on , mother , own up you 've got villiageitis and cityphobia ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Smiling . I dare , only I do n't want to bother your father ! Rand . George D. Rand That 's the effect of George ,  --  and Teresa . I 've noticed all the innuendos in her letters home . Europe 's spoiled the girl ! The New York school started the idea , but I hoped travel would cure her , and instead  --  ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Wait till you see her . Remember , in spite of letters , what a year may have done for her . Oh , I 'm so eager to see her ! What a long hour this is ! The telephone bell rings out in the hall . Mrs. Rand goes out and is heard saying , " Hello ! Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine ? " Rand . George D. Rand Reading his paper . Who 's that talking to your mother ? Cicely . Cicely Rand One of Middleburg 's Social Queens , Mrs. Mulholland  --  known in our society as the lady who can wear a dcollet gown , cut in accordance with the Middleburg limit , and not look as if she 'd dressed in a hurry and forgotten her collar ! Rand laughs . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Off stage . Really ! I should think she was much too old to be so advanced in the styles as that ! Cicely . Cicely Rand The flowers are lovely all over the house . Father , you ought to see them ! They came from a New York florist . Mrs. Rand off stage : " Good-by . See you at five . " Our man here had n't anything but ferns and aniline-dyed pinks . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Reenters . Kate Mulholland called up to tell me Mary Carterson 's mother-in-law is visiting her from South Norwalk , and went down street this morning wearing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty , if she is n't over ! She was born in 1846 ,  --  at least she used to be ! Rand . George D. Rand Still reading . When do you expect your crowd to come this afternoon ? Cicely . Cicely Rand Crowd ? She laughs derisively . The only thing that can get a crowd in Middleburg is a fire or a funeral ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand As we expect Teresa at four , I asked everybody to come in at five . But you know , father , " everybody " in Middleburg is n't many ! Cicely . Cicely Rand Not many  --  nor much ! Rand . George D. Rand You have the best the town affords , and it 's good old stock ! Cicely . Cicely Rand I 'm afraid Tess 'll think it 's rather tame for a girl who has been presented at two European courts ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Yes , I 'm afraid she 'll find it awfully dull . Do n't you think , father , we could go to New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Rand Do n't tell me you 're ambitious , too ? Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Well , I 've done all , in a social way , a woman can in Middleburg , and I want to do more . Cicely . Cicely Rand You ca n't tell the difference in Middleburg between a smart afternoon tea and a Mother 's Meeting , or a Sunday-school teacher 's conclave , or a Lenten Sewing Circle , or a Fair for the Orphan Asylum , or any other like " Event " ! It 's always the same old people and the same old thing ! Oh , Lord , we live in a cemetery ! Rand . George D. Rand Molly , would n't you rather be it in Middleburg  --  than nit in the City ? Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand But with your influence and our friends ,  --  we 'd take letters ,  --  I would soon have the position your wife was entitled to in the City , too . Cicely . Cicely Rand I do n't care a darn about the position , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see ! Who wants to smell new-mown hay , if he can breathe in gasolene on Fifth Avenue instead ! Think of the theatres ! the crowds ! Think of being able to go out on the street and see some one you did n't know even by sight ! ! Rand . George D. Rand Laughs , amused . Molly ! How can you deceive yourself ? A banker from a small country town would give you about as much position as he could afford to pay for on the West Side , above Fifty-ninth Street . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand But , George said you 'd been asked to join a big corporation in New York , which would make the family 's everlasting fortune , and social position beside . Rand . George D. Rand Looks up , angry . George had no right telling you that . I told him only in confidence . What is this anyway ,  --  a family conspiracy ? Cicely . Cicely Rand No , it is the American legation shut up in Peking , longing for a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thoroughly irritated . Now listen ! This has got to stop , once and for all ! So long as I 'm the head of this family , it 's going to keep it 's head and not lose it ! And our home is here , and will be here , if to hold it I have to die in harness . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Going to him affectionately . Father , do n't be angry ! You know your will is law with all of us . And so long as you want it , we 'll stay right here . Cicely . Cicely Rand Giving teas to the wallflower brigade , and dinners to the Bible class ! And our cotillion favors will be articles appropriate for the missionaries ' boxes ! Oh , Lord ! Rand . George D. Rand Mother , Cicely has convinced me of one thing . Cicely . Cicely Rand Delighted . Not really ! Good ! What ? Rand . George D. Rand You go to no finishing school in New York ! You get finished all you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely turn your head ! Cicely . Cicely Rand Well , do n't worry ; Middleburg will " finish " me all right ! Good and strong ! Maybe New York would turn your head , but Middleburg turns my  --  She is going to say " stomach " but her mother interrupts . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Cicely ! Enter George . He is a handsome , clean-cut young American , of about twenty-seven . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Hello , everybody ! Rand . George D. Rand Surprised . Hello , George ! What 's the matter ? It 's only half past four ! Nothing happened in the office ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Nothing ! All day ! That 's why I am here . I thought I 'd be in good time for Tess ; and , so far as missing anything really doing in the office is concerned , I could have left at ten this morning  --  adds half aside or almost any morning , in this  --  our city ! Cicely . Cicely Rand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red rag to a bull with father , to-day ! And it 's for good in the graveyard ! I 'm going to dress . Thank the Lord , I 've actually got somebody new to look smart for , if it 's only my sister ! Yawns and starts to go . Rand . George D. Rand Who 's coming to your tea party ? Cicely . Cicely Rand As she goes out . All the names are on the tombstones in the two churchyards , plus Miss Carterson 's mother-in-law from South Norwalk ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand I must dress , too . Going over to Rand . Dear , are n't you going to change your coat , and help me ? Rand . George D. Rand Oh , Molly , do n't ask me to bore myself with your old frumps ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand I have to ! And I do n't know that I take any more interest than you do in what sort of a hat Mary Carterson 's mother is wearing ! But if it were in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant what I said  --  let 's drop that ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand All right ,  --  I did n't say anything ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Look here , father ,  --  mother 's right . Rand . George D. Rand Interrupting . No , you do the " looking , " George ,  --  and straight in my eyes ! He does so . Your mother 's wrong , but it is n't her fault ,  --  it 's you children . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Remonstrating . Now , father  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . But we 're not children , and that 's the mistake you make ! I 'm twenty-seven . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Yes , father , you forget ,  --  George is twenty-seven ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 'm no longer a boy ! Rand . George D. Rand Then why did you tell your mother about this offer I had from New York , when I told you it was absolutely confidential ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " means . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand It was my fault ; I wormed it out of George ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Nonsense , mother ! To his father . I told , because I thought you needed a good , big hump , and I believed , if all of us put our shoulders to it , we could move you . Rand . George D. Rand Out of Middleburg ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes ! Rand . George D. Rand Into New York ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes ! Rand . George D. Rand Listen , George ,  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Going on . What position is there for a fellow like me in a hole like this ? Rand tries to interrupt . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Stops him . No , father , let George have his say out ! Rand . George D. Rand All right ! Come on , George , we 'll have it out now ,  --  but this must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You grew up with this town . You and Middleburg reached your prime together ,  --  so she 's good enough for you . Besides , you are part of it , so you have n't any point of view ,  --  you 're too close ! Rand . George D. Rand What 's good enough for your father ought to be good enough for you . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand That 's true , George . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Grandfather Rand was a real estate dealer in East Middleburg , with an income of about two thousand a year . I notice your father 's limit was n't good enough for you ! Rand . George D. Rand No , but my father turned me loose , without a cent , to make my own way ! Your father will leave you the richest man in your town ,  --  with the best established name , with two banks as safe as Gibraltar behind you ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But , I tell you , Middleburg and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the City and a big career there , as East Middleburg and real estate were to you in 1860 ! Rand . George D. Rand Good God , how little you know of the struggle and fight I went through ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No , sir ! Good God  --  Rand . George D. Rand Interrupting . Do n't swear before your father . I do n't like it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well ,  --  what you do n't realize is that I am just starving after a big fight and a big struggle  --  for even bigger stakes than you fought for ! I 'm my father 's own son  --  Going up to him with a sudden impulse of pride and affection , and putting his arm about his shoulder . Accept this great city chance , father ! There 's millions in it , and no fight ! They 're offering the position to you on a gold plate . All I 'll ask of you afterward is to launch me . Give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I 'll ask you to do then is watch . Rand . George D. Rand No , I 'm too old now . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Now I must join in ! It 's ridiculous you calling yourself too old . Besides , it reflects on me ! Smiling . Men and women of our age in the City dress and act just as young as their children , more or less . Old age has gone out of fashion ! There 's no such thing , except in dull little country towns ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Exactly ! That 's just what stagnation in the small place does for you . Come to the City , father ! It 'll give you a new lease of life ! Rand . George D. Rand No , I do n't want to ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I would n't have the selfish courage to go on persuading you , if I did n't feel you 'd be glad of it in the end . And besides , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Teresa , Cicely  --  we 're all choking here , dying of exasperation , dry-rotting for not enough to do ! Rand . George D. Rand Not at all ! It 's only amusement and excitement you children are after , and you 've inoculated your mother with the germ . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand No ! If I 'm restless and dissatisfied here , it 's my own fault . I sympathize with Teresa having to come back to this , after New York and all Europe . I 'm tired , myself , of our humdrum , empty existence . I 'm tired of being the leading woman in a society where there 's nobody to lead ! I 'm tired of the narrow point of view here ! I 'm tired of living to-day on yesterday 's news , and wearing styles adapted to what Middleburg will stand for ! I sympathize with Cicely . I want her to have a chance with the real world  --  not our expurgated edition ! I know what she means when she says the quiet of the country gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! that she longs for the rest of a cable-car and the lullaby of a motor-bus ! Yes , I want the City for myself , but even more for my children , and most of all for George to make a name and career for himself ! Rand . George D. Rand You 've all got an exaggerated idea of the importance of the City . This country is n't made or run by New York or its half dozen sisters ! It 's in the smaller towns ,  --  and spread all over the country ,  --  that you find the bone and sinew of the United States ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But for a young man to make a career for himself  --  I do n't mean in business only ,  --  in politics , in  --  Rand . George D. Rand Interrupting . You do n't need the City ! What 's the matter with here ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Look at what Bert Vorhees has done , going to New York ! He 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has he been there ? Five or six years ! I had a long talk with Eleanor Vorhees when she was here last month ; it 's wonderful what Bert 's accomplished ! And look at Eleanor herself ! By George , she 's the finest girl I 've ever seen ! Rand . George D. Rand Still , did Lincoln need New York ? Did Grant ? Did a metropolis turn out McKinley , or have anything to do with forming the character and career of Grover Cleveland ? You 're cheating yourself , if you 're honest in your talk with me ! All you want of the City is what you can get out of it ,  --  not what you can do for it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No , you judge from your own point of view ! Middleburg makes you look through the wrong end of the opera-glass . You ca n't judge from my point of view . Rand . George D. Rand When you 're my age , if you 've kept as abreast of the times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in New York , you wo n't have had time . There , you 'll know one thing to perfection  --  but only one  --  where your interests are centred ! All city men specialize  --  they have to get success , and keep it ! Every walk in life , there , is a marathon ! But the worst of it is , the goal is n't stationary . It 's like the horizon ,  --  no man can reach it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But why blame the City ? Rand . George D. Rand Because the City turns ambition into selfish greed ! There , no matter what you get , you want more ! And when you 've got more , at God knows what price sometimes , it 's not enough ! There 's no such thing as being satisfied ! First , you want to catch up with your neighbor ; then you want to pass him ; and then you die disappointed if you have n't left him out of sight ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years with him has taught me two things ,  --  first , when he is determined , you might just as well realize it in the beginning ; and second , in the end you 're sure to be glad he was ! Rand . George D. Rand Thank you , Molly . And I was never more determined than I am this time . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand With a sigh of half-amused resignation . Then I 'll go and put on the dress I got in New York , which the dressmaker said I 'd made her spoil in order that my neighbors at home should n't say I 'd gone out of my senses . She exits . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well , father , if you wo n't leave , let me go away ! Let me go to the City on my own account . Bert Vorhees has been urging me to come for over a year . He says politics in the City are crying for just such new , clean men as me . He wants me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big opening . I wo n't ask for any help from you . Just let me go , as your father let you go , to work out , myself , my own salvation ! Rand . George D. Rand Your own damnation it would be ! No , sir , you stay here as long as I live and have any power over or influence with you . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Suppose I 'm stubborn as you are , and go , even if it has to be against your will . Rand . George D. Rand Look here , boy ! You 're trained in my methods , for my job . Those methods are all right for Middleburg , where I 'm known and respected . No one has been to this town more , in a civic way , than I have . The Park Street Congregational Church could n't have been built , nor halfway supported as it has been , without my help ; and I could go on for some length , if I liked , in much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town is right . But the public libraries of Middleburg would n't help me in the City , nor the Park Street Church be a sufficient guarantee for my banking methods , to let me risk myself in the hornet 's nest New York is at present . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Almost laughing at the idea . You do n't mean you would be afraid of any investigation  --  ? Rand . George D. Rand Here , no ! I 've always kept to the right side of the line , but I 've kept very close , and the line may be drawn differently here . My conscience is clear , George , but my common sense is a good watch-dog . The Maidservant enters . Maidservant . S usan Here 's a man says he has an appointment with you , sir . Rand . George D. Rand Startled and a little angry . No one has an appointment with me ! Maidservant . Susan Well , I did n't know ! Enter Hannock , during the speech . The Maidservant looks a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Very hard . I told you , in the letter I sent here to-day , I was going to call this afternoon . Rand . George D. Rand I destroyed that letter without reading it ,  --  as I have the last half dozen you 've sent me . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock That 's what made it necessary for me to call in person ! George looks from one to the other , dumfounded . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Father ? Rand . George D. Rand To Hannock , referring to George . This is my son . I 'm glad he is here , to be a witness . Go ahead ! I take it , as you seem to be in the business , you 've made yourself acquainted with the law of blackmail ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I know what you 've already told me  --  but I do n't give a damn ! I 've got nothing to lose , and nothing to get , except money , from you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trial here would ruin you , no matter what happened to me ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Here , you  --  ! Rand . George D. Rand Taking a step forward . No , George ! Keep your temper . This man says I ruined his mother  --  In great shame and emotion . George . George D. Rand , Jr . To Hannock . You liar ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Then why did he give her a regular allowance till she died ? and why did he keep on giving to me ?  --  for a while ! Rand . George D. Rand George , I feel badly . Get me some whiskey and water . George hurries out . Rand , in rising anger : I kept on giving to you , till I found out you were a sot and a degenerate blackguard  --  a drug fiend and a moral criminal . I kept on helping you after three houses of correction had handled you , and one prison ! Then I stopped ! What was the use ,  --  money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannock Still , for my mother 's sake , you ca n't let me starve ! You ought n't to have torn up those letters ; then you 'd have had the blackmail in writing . I told you , if you did n't give me what I want , I 'd print your letters to my mother right here in this town . The anti-saloon paper , that hates you for not joining its movement , would be glad to get them and show you up for a God damn whited sepulchre ! Rand . George D. Rand Quiet , controlling himself by a terrific effort . And suppose that did n't frighten me ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I 've just got on to something bigger yet , I can use by way of a lever ! The two years you had me working in the bank , I kept my eyes open . If it had n't been for the yellow streak in me , I guess I 'd have made a banker , all right . I liked it , and I seem to catch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , and I watched and studied your methods to make ' em mine ! Rand . George D. Rand Well ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Yes ! " Well , " by God ! I guess you realize just as plain as I do that those very methods in New York , that have been raising hell with the insurance companies and all sorts of corporations , are n't a patch on some of your deals I know of ! And I tell you , if there should be a State investigation in Middleburg , you 'd go under as sure as I stand here ; and if I had to go to prison , I 'd stand a sure chance of passing you in the yard some day  --  wearing the same old stripes yourself . Rand . George D. Rand In a paroxysm of rage . It 's a lie ! It 's a lie ! Just to get money out of me ! I told you , before you began , you 'd come to blackmail ! He chokes . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested ; charge me with it ; and let the whole thing be thrashed out ! A second 's pause . Aw  --  you do n't dare . You know you do n't ! Enter Cicely , looking girlishly lovely in a fresh white dress and corn-colored sash . Cicely . Cicely Rand Father , are n't you going to dress  --  and help us ? Hannock looks at Cicely , admiring her . Rand . George D. Rand Excuse me , Cicely , I 'm engaged just now . Cicely . Cicely Rand I beg your pardon . She goes out . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Following her with his eyes . She 's growing into a lovely girl , your daughter ! It would be a pity  --  He speaks in broken sentences . Rand . George D. Rand Giving in . How much do you want ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I want two thousand dollars . Rand . George D. Rand For how long ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock For as long as it lasts ! Rand . George D. Rand With a reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll gamble , or squander this in some low way , and be back before the week 's out ! What 's the use ! I ca n't keep this up for ever ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Bringing a pistol out of his pocket , quickly . Do you see that ? He puts it on the desk . Rand . George D. Rand Greatly frightened . Good God ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Do n't be frightened ! It 's not for you . I 'm no murderer ! It 's for myself . Rand . George D. Rand Suffering from shock . How do you mean ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Taking up the pistol , and handling it almost affectionately . I 'm never without it . And when I ca n't get anything more out of you , when I 'm clean empty ,  --  not a crust , or drink , or drug to be had ,  --  then I 'll take this friend to my heart , so  --  Placing pistol over his heart . Rand . George D. Rand Frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannock Oh , not yet ! Taking pistol from his chest . I 'm not ready yet . But remember , when you 've signed your last check for me , you will be responsible for this . He touches the pistol ; then hides it quickly in his pocket , as George enters with whiskey and water . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 'm sorry to take so long , but I had to persuade mother not to come with me , when she heard you were faint . And I thought you would n't want  --  Rand . George D. Rand Yes , quite right  --  He drinks , excitedly , tremblingly , feebly . George . George D. Rand , Jr . To Hannock . You can see my father is ill ; surely , ordinary human feeling will make you realize to-day is no time for you to  --  Rand . George D. Rand Interrupting . It 's all right , George . Hannock and I have had it out while you were gone . Writing a check . We understand each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my position quite clear to your father . Rand . George D. Rand Giving Hannock the check . Here  --  and for God 's sake try to behave yourself ! Looking at him intently , with a strange , almost yearning look , as if he really cared whether Hannock behaved himself or not . Try to do right ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Thanks for your advice and money ! To George . Good-by ! Rand . George D. Rand Good-by ! George only nods his head , looking at Hannock with unconcealed dislike . Hannock goes out . Rand sinks on his arms , his head falling on the table . George goes to him in alarm . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Father ! Rand . George D. Rand I 'm not well . I 've felt dizzy all day . It was more than I could stand ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I do n't approve of your giving him money ! Till you once take a firm stand , there 'll never be any let up . Rand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George ! I owe it to him . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Nonsense ! What sort of a woman was his mother ? Rand . George D. Rand She was a dressmaker in East Middleburg ; had n't a very good reputation . I doubt very much if what he says is true . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well then ? Rand . George D. Rand Yes , but more than he knows is true !  --  and worse ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . How do you mean ? Rand . George D. Rand Yes , the whole thing is more than I can carry any longer ! I 'm too old ! Your younger shoulders must help me bear it , George . It breaks my heart to tell you , and shames me , George , but I must unburden myself . Besides , I need help  --  I need advice ! And besides , you 'll see how you ca n't go away and leave me alone here ! He rises in fear and excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand by me and help me ! I ca n't stand alone any longer ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Father ! He goes to him . Rand . George D. Rand Promise me , George , promise me you wo n't leave me here ! You 'll stand by me ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , father , I promise you ! Rand . George D. Rand Sinks back exhausted into his chair . A second 's pause . That man who just left here do n't know it , but  --  He stops from dread and shame of finishing . George . George D. Rand , Jr . But what ? Rand . George D. Rand I 'm his father ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Astounded . That fellow 's ? Rand . George D. Rand That fellow 's ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Then of course he knows it ! Rand . George D. Rand No , it would be a stronger lever for money than any he has used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find  --  or invent ! In return for the financial arrangement I made with her , his mother swore he should never know . As a matter of fact , she was anxious , for her own sake , to keep it quiet . She moved to Massachusetts , passed herself off as a widow , and married a man named Hannock , there ; but he died , and so back she came , passing off this boy , here , as Hannock 's son ! He groans . What a story for a father to own up to , before a son like you . After a second 's pause . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Do n't think of that ! Do n't mind me ! After all , I 'm a twentieth century son , you know , and New York at heart ! Rand . George D. Rand Of course your mother 's never dreamed . That I could n't bear  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . That 's right . Mother 's not me ,  --  she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , you see I do owe this young man something . I ca n't shut my eyes to it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes . I 'm even wondering , father , if you do n't owe him  --  the truth ! Rand . George D. Rand No , no , I could n't trust him with it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Still , father , do n't you owe it to him ? Even more than money ! And do n't you suppose he suspects it , anyway ? Rand . George D. Rand No , and he must n't know . He 'd tell everybody ! It would be my ruin ; and your mother ?  --  break her heart ,  --  and for what good ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . With a sudden idea . Father , why not come to the City and escape him ? Rand . George D. Rand Escape him ! He 'd follow ! That 's his hunting ground ! When you came back home from college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . But I did n't want you two to meet , so I got him a good place in Boston . But in six months he 'd lost it , and was mixed up in some scrape in New York ! No ! Remember , George , you gave me your promise you would n't leave me ! You 'll stay with me here . We must take care of this man , of course , for our own sakes , as well as his . I am his father ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . And I 'm his brother , and Cicely and Tess are his sisters ! It 's hard lines on him ! I ca n't help feeling , father , we owe him a good deal . Rand . George D.

I feel so badly again ! I  --  I 'm going to my room to lie down . Do n't let them disturb me till suppertime . George goes to help him out . Rand smiles , though with an effort . No , no ! I 'm not so far gone as all that ,  --  not yet a while , boy , not quite yet  --  ! Goes out alone . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Coming back . Who 'd have thought it ! Who 'd have thought it ! Father ! A heavy fall is heard in the hall outside . George looks up , and then starts on , but stops and lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dread is on his face . Then he turns to the door and walks into the hall . A moment after , off stage , he cries , " Father ! " The following scene takes place off stage . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand In a voice of excitement . What was it ? Father ? Did he faint ? Calling . James ! James , bring me water , quick ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 'll telephone for the doctor . I 'll get Dr. Hull from across the street . He 'll be the quickest . Passes by the door from Left to Right . The telephone bell is heard . The Maidservant hurries past the door with water . Hello . Give me sixteen  --  Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand To Maidservant . Is John in the kitchen having his supper ? Maidservant . Su san Yes , ma'am . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Hello ? Mrs. Rand .

Rings telephone bell , and passes before the door on his way from Right to Left . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand I 've sent for John . I thought between us we could carry him . Maidservant passes through hall from Right to Left . Susan , get a pillow from upstairs , and put it on the sofa in the parlor , and send Miss Cicely . Maidservant . Su san Yes , ma'am . Before doorway , John passes from Right to Left . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Here , John ! Father 's very ill . John , we want to get him on to the sofa in the parlor . Cicely .

As soon as the doctor comes  --  Front doorbell rings outside . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand There he is ! Susan , go to the door . Enter Cicely . She doses the door behind her , frightened , and leans against it , listening . Cicely . Cicely Rand Whispers . He 's dead ,  --  I know it ,  --  he 's dead ! She carefully opens the door on a crack to listen . She sees Maidservant . Susan ! Maidservant approaches in the hall beyond the half open door . Was it the doctor ? Maidservant . Susan In doorway .

He 's sure to hear we 've put off our little party , and come around to find out . If any one asks , never mind who ,  --  you know nothing except that Mr. Rand was taken suddenly sick . That 's all . You do n't know how , or what it is . You understand ? Maidservant . Susan Yes , sir . George . George D. Rand , Jr . All right . Nods to her to go . She goes out . He walks over to the desk and looks where his father sat and stood . Why , it was only a minute ago he was there , talking with me ! It does n't seem possible  --  that now  --  he 's dead  --  dead  --  he wipes the tears out of his eyes , and gives a long sigh ; sinks in the seat gone for good out of this life ! I do n't understand it ! What does it all mean ? He is staring straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes possession of him . I know one thing it means for me !  --  He rises and stands straight . It means New York . There is a tapping on the glass of the window . He does n't hear it at first . It is Teresa , outside , tapping . She taps again . He looks up and sees her . Tess ! ! He hurries to the window and opens it . Tess ! Embraces her enthusiastically . Teresa . Teresa Rand I thought I 'd stroll in and surprise you ! It 's the same old room !  --  smiling around , as she recognizes things not a thing changed !  --  nor in the town , either , from the smelly old barn of a depot  --  past the same gay houses with the empty old iron urns , right up to ours ,  --  bigger and uglier than all the rest ! Nothing 's changed ! And oh , George , how can I live here ? I 'll never be able to stand it ! I ca n't do it ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Tess ! You wo n't have to ! We 're going to live in New York ! Teresa . Teresa Rand George ! ! What do you mean ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . We 're going to live in the City ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Oh , George ! You do n't know how much that means to me ! I can be married in New York , then ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Amazed . Married ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Sh ! That 's my surprise ! Heavens , how hard it 's been to keep it out of my letters ! I met him first in Egypt , and then he joined us at Nice , at Paris , and in London , and there he proposed . George . George D. Rand , Jr . But who ? Teresa . Teresa Rand I just told you ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Smiling . No , you did n't ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . Don Van Vranken ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Yes ! Think what my position will be in New York ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But Tess ! He 's the fastest fellow going ! He 's notorious ! Look at the scandals that have been more or less public property about him . It 's the last one that drove him abroad , afraid of the witness bench ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Oh , you ca n't believe everything you hear ! He 's a handsome darling , and I love him , and he loves me ,  --  so do n't worry ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But I ca n't help worrying ! Your happiness is n't safe with a man like Don Van Vranken . Teresa . Teresa Rand Oh , come , you have n't been away from Middleburg enough ! Here , maybe , the husbands do go to the altar like Easter lilies ! But in the City , you do n't marry a man for what he has or has n't been ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope he 's going to be ! But I did dread a wedding here  --  with his people and friends ! How in the world did you persuade father ? A second 's pause , as George suddenly comes back with a terrific shock . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Good God ! I forgot ! I 've some awful news ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Mother  --  ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ,  --  father . Teresa . Teresa Rand What ?  --  not  --  ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes . To-day ,  --  just a little while ago ! Suddenly  --  in a second ! His heart gave out  --  I was talking with him two minutes before . Teresa . Teresa Rand Oh , poor mother ! Where is she ? Let me go to her ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . She 's up in her room . Teresa . Teresa Rand Mother !  --  As she goes out in great distress , she is heard again in the distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stands where she left him  --  alone  --  his head bowed . He straightens up , and lifts his head ; and his face flushes with the uncontrolled impulses of youth and ambition . With a voice of suppressed excitement , full of emotion , and with a trembling ring of triumph , he says : The City ... ! The Curtain Falls ACT II Scene : Several years later . The library in the Rands ' house in New York . The walls are panelled in light walnut . Two French windows , with the sun shining in , are on the Left . There are small doors , Right and Left Centre , opening into other rooms . Between the bookcases , which occupy most of the wall space , are marble busts , standing in deep niches . There are flowers about . The sofa , chairs , hangings , and cushions are of golden yellow brocade , except one big armchair , upholstered in red , standing in front of the open wood fire . A Sargent portrait is built in over the mantel . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of the room , with chairs grouped near it , is a long carved table , with all the desk fittings of a luxurious but busy man ; there is also a bunch of violets on it , in a silver goblet  --  and at present it is strewn with papers , etc . Foot is arranging the fire . There is a knock at the door . Hannock enters . He comes in , in evident and only partly suppressed , nervous excitement . He wears a white flower in his buttonhole . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Hello , Foot . Is Mr. Rand out ? Foot . Foot Yes , sir . Rises , having finished the fire . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock He left no message for me ? Foot . Foot Yes , sir . He left some papers on the desk , which he said he 'd like you to go over carefully , at once , and two letters he wanted you to answer . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock All right . Get me a package of longish papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hall . Foot . Foot Yes , sir . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Has the stenographer been here ? Foot . Foot Yes , but he 's gone ; said he could n't wait any longer , as he has an appointment . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Angry ; making nervous , irritable movements . He 'll be sorry ! I 'll see to it he loses Mr. Rand 's job , that 's all , if he do n't knuckle down to me ! Foot . Foot Yes , sir . It 's none of my business , but Mr. Rand did n't like your being late . He said you knew it was an important day for him , and he could n't understand it . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock He 'll understand all right when I explain ! It 's an important day for me too ! Foot . Foot Eagerl y . Is he going to get the nomination for governor , sir ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Nothing surer !  --  except his election . That 'll be a knockout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foot . Foot I 'm sure I wish you luck , sir . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Thanks ! Oh , yes , I shall tie my fortune up to Mr. Rand 's ! Foot . Foot Yes , sir  --  He goes out . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Yes , sir , imitating Foot.  --  damned " important " day for me , too ! Phew ! A great sigh , showing he is carrying something big on his mind . I wonder just how he 'll take it ? I wish it was over . He goes to the typewriting table , rummages in a drawer , takes out a little box , containing a hypodermic needle , and tries it ; then , putting it to his arm just above the wrist , he presses it , half grinning and mumbling to himself ,  --  looking furtively over his shoulder , fearing an interruption . Just as he finishes , the door opens . Cicely half comes in . She is in hat , gloves , etc . Cicely . Cicely Rand Half whispering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypodermic needle . I 've just this minute come in , and I did n't meet a soul . I 've sent for Eleanor Vorhees  --  she 's the best . Enter Teresa hurriedly , in great and angry emotional excitement , pushing past Cicely . Teresa . Teresa Rand Good morning , Cicely . Where 's George ? Cicely . Cicely Rand Give it up ! Following her in . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock He 'll be in soon , Mrs. Van Vranken . He 's an appointment with Mr. Vorhees . Enter Foot . Foot . Foot I ca n't find any papers with an elastic band , sir . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Irritated . Oh , well , perhaps there was n't a band ! Use your common sense ! I 'll look myself . To the ladies . Excuse me . Goes out followed by Foot . Cicely . Cicely Rand What 's the matter with you , Tess ? Don on the loose again ? Teresa . Teresa Rand I do n't know and I do n't care ! I 've left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good ? Honest ? Or has he left you ? Teresa . Teresa Rand What do you mean by that ? That 's a nice thing for my sister to say ! Cicely . Cicely Rand My dear !  --  even donkeys  --  I mean sisters  --  have ears ,  --  and you must know how every one has been talking about you and Jimmy Cairns ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Well , if I ca n't depend upon my own family , I do n't suppose I can expect my husband to protect me . Cicely . Cicely Rand After all , what can Don say ? He ca n't find any fault with you ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Exactly !  --  and I went to him , perfectly calm and reasonable , and said very sweetly : " Don , I 'm going to divorce you . We need n't have any disagreeable feeling about it , or any scandal . I will simply bring the divorce , mentioning this woman "  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand Mrs. Judly ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Of course  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , or with sealed papers , or whatever they call it . Only , of course he must give me the children ! Cicely . Cicely Rand Oh !  --  and he refused ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Absolutely refuses ,  --  and to let me get the divorce as I propose ! He will only agree to a legal separation , the children 's time to be divided between us . That 's all he 'll stand for . Cicely . Cicely Rand Let him agree to what he likes ! You 've got your case , all right . You could prove everything you want to , could n't you ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Getting angry . Yes , but he  --  Oh , the beast !  --  he dares to threaten ! If I attempt to do this , he 'll bring a counter suit , mentioning Mr. Cairns ! Cicely . Cicely Rand Tess ! Teresa . Teresa Rand You see ! He ties my hands ! Cicely . Cicely Rand But not if he could n't  --  Teresa . Teresa Rand Sh-h ! Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that horrid Hannock to know anything . I despise him ! Cicely . Cicely Rand On the defensive . I do n't know why ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Well , I 'm not alone in my feelings . I do n't know any one who likes him . Cicely . Cicely Rand Yes , you do , because I 'm one . Teresa . Teresa Rand He always affects me like a person who would listen at keyholes ! Cicely . Cicely Rand Some day you 'll be very sorry you said that . Hannock renters . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Mr. Vorhees is here with Miss Vorhees . Cicely . Cicely Rand I asked Eleanor to come . She goes out to greet them . Teresa . Teresa Rand To Hannock . Let me know the minute Mr. Rand comes in . She goes out . Hannock takes up letters on desk which are for him to answer , goes to the typewriting table , and sits down to write , reading over to himself one of the letters  --  mumbling the words . He laughs to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose he thinks this is legitimate business !  --  that this sort of a deal goes hand in hand with his " clean record , " with his " white politics , " with the Vorhees " good government . " Humph ! " Teddy , Jr . " is a good nickname for him ,  --  I guess not ! The public would put George Rand in the Roosevelt class with a vengeance , would n't they !  --  if they were on to this one piece of manipulation ! Following in father 's footsteps , all right , and going popper one better ! That 's what ! And he pretends to think his methods are on the level ! All the same , I guess he is just as square as the rest of ' em . You ca n't tell me Vorhees is n't feathering his nest good ! You bet I 'm on to Vorhees ! He looks up , half startled . Damn it , when am I going to stop talking in my sleep when I 'm wide awake ? Looking at the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the needle , I guess ! Enter Servant with Vorhees . Servant goes out . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Good morning , Hannock . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Good morning , Mr. Vorhees . You 're ten minutes early for your appointment , sir . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Mr. Rand is generally ready ahead of time . I thought I 'd probably find him . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock He is n't here yet . I hope he gets the nomination for governor ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Well , I 'm inclined to think it 's all up to him now , Hannock , and that to-day will decide . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Is n't it wonderful how far he 's got in barely five years ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Well , it was Rand 's good luck  --  to come along at the right psychological moment  --  the party tired of the political gambler , the manipulator . We wanted a candidate with just the freshness , the force and stability of a small town 's bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party , will come forward unanimously , and speak for their young fellow townsman . His family is the boast of the place ! His father 's name stands for everything that 's best and finest in public and private life , and , when George took hold in New York , with all the political vitality and straightforward vigor of his blood and bringing up , and not only helped along our reforms , but created new ones of his own , giving his time and his strength and his money to the public good ! Well , you know what the man in the street 's been calling him for a year now ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock With a covert sneer . " Teddy , Jr. ! " Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Yes , " Teddy , Jr . " That idea ought to land him in Albany , all right ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock With the bare suggestion of a bully 's manner . I hope , Mr. Vorhees , I have n't been altogether overlooked in all the enthusiasm . Vorhees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Well , I 've been George Rand 's right hand , you know ! I 've done my share of the work . Where do I come in on the reward end ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Strongly . I really do n't understand you . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Smiling , but serious and determined , and speaking deliberately . What do I get out of it ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees After a pause . You get a damned lot of pride in the man you 've had the honor of serving , that 's what you get ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Angry at the snub , and suspicious that he is to be thrown down . And a hell of a lot of good that 'd do me ! Look here , Mr. Vorhees , I might as well have my say out now ! If George Rand wants to be elected Governor of New York , he and his electors have got to square me ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Well , never mind what I talk like ; I know what I 'm talking about , and I say there 's something good in the way of a job coming to his confidential secretary out of " Gov . " Rand 's election ! Vorhees half laughs , half sneers , but still is slightly disturbed . George enters . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Hello ! Am I late ? Sorry ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees No , I 'm early . Well ! ! Can we have our talk ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Smiling at himself . I believe I 'm nervous ! Go ahead ! Fire your first gun ! Takes a chair . Hannock also sits . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees With a glance toward Hannock . I 'll wait , if you have any business to discuss with Mr. Hannock . George . George D. Rand , Jr . No , nothing in a hurry ; that 's all right , go on  --  Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk with you privately . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Certainly . Would you mind , Hannock , waiting in  --  Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Interrupting ; to Hannock . Eleanor 's in the drawing-room . Cicely sent for her ; wants her advice , I believe , about something or other , very important ! Guying the latter with a smile . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well , suppose you go to my room , Hannock , and use the desk there . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock In a hard voice , reluctant to leave them . Very good . Rises , takes papers , and starts to go . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees With the tone of a final good-by . Good morning , Hannock . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Good morning , sir . Stops at the door . If I wanted to speak with you later on to-day , after I 've had a talk with Mr. Rand , could I call you upon the ' phone , and make an appointment ? Vorhees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a satisfied voice . Thank you . Goes out . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees How do you fell ? Eager , eh ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . That depends on what I 'm going to get ! I 'm eager , all right , if you 've come to tell me what I want to hear ! ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees You 're warm , as the children say ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . What would n't I give  --  that was honest to give  --  for this chance , not just to talk , not to boast , not to promise , only  --  Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Interrupting him . Exactly ! That 's exactly what we want  --  the man behind the gun in front of the gun ! We do n't want a Fourth of July orator only , in the Capitol ! We want a man who 'll be doing something , George ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can hire a human phonograph to do the talking . The party 's full of them ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I want to make my name mean , in this whole country , what father 's meant in that small , up-State town we came from ! ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Your name can take care of itself . Do n't think of any glory you 're going to get ! You 'll get most by keeping busy for the good of the State , for the welfare of the people  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Eagerly , not waiting for Vorhees to finish . I know ! But I 'm going to show the gods and the demigods , the rabble and the riffraff , that one good lesson we 've learned from the success of the last administration is that the real leader of a party must be its independent choice , and not its tool . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Approving . Right ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Machine politics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine , and smashed the works ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Man is greater than a machine , because God 's soul is in him . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , and what I 'm going to show is that the soul of a political party is the uncompromising honesty of its leader . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Do n't always be emphasizing the leader ;  --  let it go at the party 's honesty ! You 're inclined , George , to over-emphasize the personal side of it ! It 's E Pluribus Unum , not E Pluribus me-um ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . All right , all right ! Only , do n't forget that I 've got an inordinate ambition , and you 're dangling in front of my eyes the talisman that may land me , God knows how high ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Well , come back to earth ! Now , I 've come here with the nomination in one hand  --  George draws a long , excited breath . George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Yes . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well , give it to us ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees The Committee decided it was up to me ! I 've known you as a boy . You 're going to marry my sister . We 're brothers practically . I can speak frankly , without giving any offence  --  that 's sure , is n't it ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Nothing surer ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees It 's just this ! Of course the minute you 're nominated , our political opponents will get busy ! The muckrakes are all ready ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . You bet they are , and the searchlights have n't any Foolish Virgins in charge of them . They 're trimmed , all right , and filled with gasoline ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Very seriously . You can stand it , George ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . I can . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in you , but it wants your word confirming its confidences ,  --  that 's all . George . George D. Rand , Jr . That 's the least it can ask . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Is there anything in your life that is n't absolutely above board , George ? No skeleton in your heart , or your cupboard ? It 's safe for us to put you up ? You 're sure not a particle of the mud they 'll rake can stick ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Not a particle . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Look back a little . Sometimes I think you 're a little too cocksure of yourself . No man can be , absolutely , till he 's been tried in the furnace , and you have n't been , yet . But we 're getting the fires ready ! Smiles . You 're all right at heart , I 'm sure of it . Nobody in this world believes more in you than I do ,  --  again smiling except , perhaps , you yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? You know they 'll dig , and dig , and dig ! ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But I give you my word of honor , so help me God , I 've never done a dishonest or dishonorable act , or an act  --  Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Interrupting . In business ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Hesitates just one moment . You know what my father stood for ,  --  and my business methods he taught me . I 've gone ahead of him , of course ,  --  gone on with the times ,  --  but on the road father blazed for me ! I 've not deviated from a single principle . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Good ! I know what George Rand , Sr. , stood for in Middleburg ! That 's good enough for me . And in your private life ?

Vorhees Of course I knew you were clean and above board , but different men have different ideas about some things . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Listen ,  --  I 'm no little tin god ! I 'm as full of faults as the next man , but I 'm not afraid to own up my mistakes ; I 'm not afraid to tell the truth to my own disadvantage ; I 'm not afraid to stand or fall by my sincere conviction !

Vorhees Smiling . Well  --  I 'm taking any bets ! ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I owe the whole business to you , you know , and I know it ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Nonsense ! With that overwhelming ambition of yours ! Perhaps I taught you your primer of politics , your grammar of public life ; that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! Enter Foot . Foot .

Foot Yes , sir . Goes out . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees There is just one more thing before I can go . George . George D. Rand , Jr . What ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Nothing that really concerns you , though it may cause you some inconvenience . The Committee thinks you 'd better get rid of your secretary . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Astounded . Hannock ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Yes ,  --  he 's no good ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No good ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees A damn rotten specimen . We 've found out enough about him to make sure we do n't want him mixed up with us in any way in the election . George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off my feet ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees If you want more detailed information , ask any detective with tenderloin experience . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 've never liked him . I ca n't say I 've really trusted him . And yet I laid my prejudice to a personal source . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees He 's dishonest besides . You ca n't have him in a confidential position . You could n't help getting tarred with some of his pitch ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But are you sure of what you say ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Sure ! Why , just now , here , he showed me the hoof of a blackmailer . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Looks up quickly . At that again ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees How do you mean " again " ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Explain to me what you mean . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Oh , he did n't get far  --  we were interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a demand , as to what he was going to get out of this election . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Carelessly , and not very loudly . He need n't think I 'm father ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Not understanding . What 's that ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . You leave Hannock to me . I 'll take care of him ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees You 'll discharge him ? A pause . George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ,  --  I ca n't . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Astonished .

It is n't in my closet , but it concerns those that are nearest and dearest to me . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Then you must risk sacrificing them , if you want the position . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 'd have to sacrifice a memory , too ,  --  and I have n't the right ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees If I went to the Committee , and said to them ,  --  Rand refuses to dismiss Hannock ; does n't deny he may be a scoundrel ; owns up , in fact , that his family is in some way in the man 's power ; says he himself is not ; but still he does n't dismiss him ,  --  do you believe for a minute the Committee will go on with your nomination ? George . George D. Rand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell the Committee anything of the sort ! Perhaps I can handle Hannock  --  beg him off ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees I do n't like the sound of that . There 's one thing about you I 'm afraid of , George . You 're one of those men who think wrong means are justified by right ends ;  --  unsafe and dishonest policy ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I tell you he ca n't hurt me , George Rand  --  after a second " Jr . " Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees That do n't do for the Committee . You ca n't handle mud and not  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Interrupting . Very well , then if I ca n't buy him off , I will dismiss him ! And the others must face the music ! There 's too much at stake for the future , to over-consider the past .

Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Good morning . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 'm very busy now . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken With a jeer . I wo n't interrupt you long ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Would you like me to hunt up Eleanor and Cicely , and come back later ? Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Oh , you might as well stop . You 're as good as in the family , now . You 'll be sure to be asked to put your oar in ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Sit down , Don , and cool off ! Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken I have n't time . I 'm on the way to my lawyer !

Donald Van Vranken She threatens to take my children from me by bringing a suit for divorce ,  --  mentioning Nellie Jud  --  Mrs. Judly . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well , can you blame her ? Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken It 's a pity you have n't gone out , once in a while , into the society that bores you so , and kept your ears open . George . George D. Rand , Jr . What for ? Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken You 'd have heard a whisper , or caught a look that would have kept you from being surprised at what I 'm going to tell you . George . George D. Rand , Jr . What ? Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken If your sister starts a suit against me , bringing in Nellie 's  --  Mrs. Judly 's  --  name , I 'll bring a counter suit against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jr . You drunken liar ! Going for him . Vorhees holds George back . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken You did n't know I could win . I would n't put such a stumbling block in the way of my little daughter 's happiness ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Liar ! ! Struggles to free himself . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees No , George ! Even I 've heard enough to wonder something of it has n't come your way . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Thickly , whiningly . All I ask for is a noiseless , dignified separation ,  --  that 's all I want , and God , I want that bad ! Legal or not , as she wishes ,  --  only she 's got to agree to cut out Cairns . I give her this chance for my little daughter 's sake ,  --  not for hers ! But in another day , maybe , it 'll be too late . I get my children six months of the year , and she the other six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fair ! I 'd like my complete freedom as well as she . So far as love goes , it 's a pretty even thing between us ! And when the children are grown up , and settled in life , she can do what she damn pleases , and good luck to her ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees I 've heard the gossip , Van Vranken , but you know enough of our world to realize half that gets about , gets about wrong . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Granted Tess has been foolish . That 's bad enough , God knows ! Still  --  I ca n't believe worse than that ! I grew up with her ,  --  I know her ! Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken You knew her before she came to New York . She had n't developed yet , in that mudhole you all lived in ! There 's no smoke without  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , there is ! There 's a smoldering that never breaks into a flame ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for Tess 's heart to smolder , yes , and burn , too  --  though I do n't believe it . While we 're about it , let 's finish the whole ugly business here , now . You 're a drunkard , and your best friends are the most depraved crew in town ,  --  a crowd that is used individually as markers to tally off each smart scandal that crops up . It never occurred to you , before you married Tess , that you would be faithful to her afterwards ; and you did n't disappoint yourself . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken What right had she to be disappointed ? I never made any bluff or pose , and you all fought the match ! She married me with her eyes open . George . George D. Rand , Jr . You had the glamour of the City about you . Tess was a real woman , full of good and bad ; she was ready to be what the man she loved would make of her . And , poor girl , she married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's done . What about the present ? Van Vranken is right in saying any divorce scandal would endanger your election . We might lose the entire Catholic vote , and the support of the anti-divorce party ,  --  both of which we 're banking on . And besides , one of the strongest planks of our platform is the Sanctity of the Home ! We 're putting you up as the representative of the great section of the country which stands for the Purity of Family Life . We 'd have to drop that platform , or be ridiculed off the face of the earth . And it does n't seem right in any way to me ! And it 's not up to you to suffer for your sister . To Van Vranken . If we persuade Mrs. Van Vranken to a dignified separation such as you want  --  Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken And she gives her promise to call off Cairns  --  ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Quickly . Tess will be as anxious to stop gossip , when she hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my shoulders . Van Vranken looks at him , and half smiles cynically at his confidence . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Very well ! Will you , Van Vranken , be willing to hush the whole business up ? Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Glad to ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Live on with Mrs. Van Vranken in your house as if nothing had happened ? Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken No ! Not by a damned sight ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Come , do n't be a yellow dog ! Do all or nothing . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken She left my house of her own accord , and I 've sworn she shall never put her foot in it again . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Oh , well , what 's an oath more or less to you ! It will be only till after the election ! Rand 's nomination is practically settled on  --  Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Oh , I see ! Why did n't you say that at first ? I 've nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure Mrs. Van Vranken , on her side , will do all she can to protect his interests . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken I suppose I 'll have to give in  --  Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Good ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 'll see her now , if she 's in the house . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees To Van Vranken . I will communicate something to you , after Rand has seen your wife . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Very good . She took both the children when she left this morning . One child must go back with me now . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Both must go back , to-day , and Mrs. Van Vranken , herself ,  --  to live under your roof till after the election . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken That 's true ! Of course ! All right ! God , it 'll be a hell of a life ! However , there 'll be an end of it to look forward to ! Good-by . Vorhees and George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good-by . Enter Teresa and , Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand is very altered . Her hair is dressed fashionably , etc. , and , instead of the sweet , motherly woman she was , in Act I , she is now a rather overdressed , nervous-looking woman , ultra-smart , but no longer comfortable-looking and happy . Teresa . Teresa Rand As she enters . George ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand George ! They both stop short , as they see Van Vranken . He bows to Teresa ; she only glares at him . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken To Mrs. Rand . Good morning . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Looking at him ,  --  outraged and angry . You wicked man ! Van Vranken is somewhat taken aback ; from her , he turns and looks at the two men ; he raises his eyebrows , smiles , shrugs his shoulders , and slouches out indifferently . Vorhees . Al bert F. Vorhees I must go , too . Teresa . Teresa Rand Good morning , Bert . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rand . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand I do n't know where I am , Bert . I never felt the need of Mr. Rand more than to-day ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Bert , will you have to tell the Committee about this ? Wo n't it queer my nomination ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Not if Tess will do what we expect . I 'll leave you to explain to her . Moving to go . George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ,  --  stay , Bert ! Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand George ! Tess could n't possibly tell you everything she wants to , before Bert . Teresa . Teresa Rand Oh , do n't worry , mother . I guess Don has n't left much for me to tell ! Besides , Bert 's a lawyer . I 'd like his advice . To George . Don gave you his version , did n't he ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Listen ! My whole future is at stake , and it 's in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are full of my own troubles . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand To nobody in particular , and nobody pays any attention to her . What a tragedy ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees George is right . His nomination for governor was decided on , this morning , provided he had an open chance . If you make a scandal now , he 'll lose the nomination , sure ,  --  and if not , what 's worse , the election ! Teresa . Teresa Rand You are trying to influence me against what I want to do , through George . I will never live with Don again ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Wo n't you ? Only till after the election ? Teresa . Teresa Rand No ! I intend to begin proceedings for a divorce to-day . George . George D. Rand , Jr . But Don offers you a legal separation , and to share the children . Teresa . Teresa Rand That 's done purposely to keep me tied , so I could n't marry again ! I want the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . George D. Rand , Jr . But you know what he threatens to do ? Teresa . Teresa Rand He wo n't dare ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees That 's not his reputation in New York . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand At random . If she only would n't decide at once  --  all of a sudden . That 's where women always slip up ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Did he pretend he wanted me to come back ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Smiling in spite of himself . No , but we persuaded him to be willing . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees For George 's sake , till after the election , on one condition  --  Teresa . Teresa Rand Quickly . What condition ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees That you agree to the sort of separation he planned . George . George D. Rand , Jr . And promise to put an end , once for all , to the Cairns gossip . Teresa . Teresa Rand Just what I told you ! The whole thing with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice the children and me and everything else , to keep me from being happy with Jim . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Surprised at the apparent confession . Do you mean you do love Cairns ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Yes . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Breaking in . No , she does n't mean that ! She does n't love him now , but she will , if she gets her divorce . George . George D. Rand , Jr . To Teresa . What you really want to divorce Don for , then , is not because of Mrs. Judly , but so you can marry Cairns ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Exactly . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Looking at his watch . I must go . To George . The Committee will be waiting now for me . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Mortified . You 've shocked Bert , Tess . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Smiling . Oh , no , I 've a report to make before George 's nomination can be official , and I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that report exactly as I wish . George . George D. Rand , Jr . You mean on account of Tess ! Teresa . Teresa Rand I 'll make any sacrifice I can for George , except my own personal happiness . That , I have n't the right to sacrifice , because that belongs half to some one else . George . George D. Rand , Jr . You go on and call me up by telephone when you get there . I 'll have had a longer talk with Tess , and I may have something different to say to you . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees All right . Going to Teresa . Teresa . Teresa Rand I shall want you for my lawyer , Bert . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Thanks . That is n't exactly in my line , but I hope you wo n't need a lawyer . Do what you can for George , wo n't you ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Of course . Mrs. Rand goes out with Vorhees . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand As they go out . Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tess said , will you ? She 's her father 's own daughter , and you know a Rand could n't do a really wrong thing ; it 's not in the blood . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Now , look here , Tess ! On one side is a great career and me , and a dignified life for you , with independence and the happiness and the love and the respect of your children ; on the other is probable failure for me , and worse than failure for you . Don 'll do what he says , and if he wins his suit , you 'll lose both children and everything else you ought to care about  --  Teresa . Teresa Rand Except Jim ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Would he make up for any thing ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Everything ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Even the children ? Teresa . Teresa Rand Almost breaking down . How can you say that ? You know I would n't have to give up my children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances to one you 'd have to . Teresa . Teresa Rand I do n't believe any judge would give Don the children in preference to me . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Believe me , it 'll be taking awful chances . Teresa . Teresa Rand All life is that . She turns aside , crying quietly . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Going over to her . Tess ! But you do n't realize what this nomination means to me  --  more than anything in the world ! I want it with every nerve and sinew in my body , with every thought in my brain , with every ambition I 've got ! Just let me get this one big thing in my hands , and nothing shall stop me ! I 'll climb on up the ladder of achievement and fame , and I 'll take you all up with me ! Remember our boy and girl days , Tess , in Middleburg . We were never selfish , you and I , with each other . It used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't go back on me this time . You 've got it in your power to give me a great boost , or push the whole scaffolding of my career from under my feet . For the love of God , stand by me to-day ! Teresa . Teresa Rand It 's your future against my future ! Why should you expect me to sacrifice mine for yours ? We are n't children now , and this is n't Middleburg ! I love you very much , but not in that old-fashioned way . George . George D. Rand , Jr . But has any one in this world the right to absolutely ignore everybody else , and think only of one 's self ? Teresa . Teresa Rand It sounds to me exactly like what you 're doing ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I suppose I do sound like a selfish brute ; but I ca n't help feeling that what I ask of you , if six for me , is half a dozen for you , too , in the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full divorce , I 'll do anything for you  --  live with the beast two years , if necessary , and not see Jim all that time . But do n't ask me to give up Jim  --  with emotion again because I love him , and I wo n't , I could n't ; if I said I would , I 'd lie ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But Don wo n't give you what you want , and if you insist , he 'll do what he says  --  divorce you , with a filthy scandal ! Teresa . Teresa Rand The hour after the divorce was granted , Jim Cairns and I would be married . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Listen ! Would you do this ? Deceive me now ? Teresa . Teresa Rand How ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well  --  agree to what Don asks  --  Teresa . Teresa Rand Never ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Wait ! After the election , you might change your mind . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teresa . Teresa Rand Does that seem to you quite square ? Is n't it a good deal like breaking your word ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Has Don done much else beside break his since he answered " I will " with you to the Bishop in the chancel ? Teresa . Teresa Rand His word was cracked before I knew him ! But I was n't thinking of Don and me . Are n't you playing a trick on the party that is putting its trust in you ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . I do n't see it ! If your divorce comes out after my election , it need n't affect the party . My acts will be speaking for themselves , then . I intend to be square in office , and to succeed or fail by that standard . I do n't mind a failure , doing the right thing ; what I ca n't stand is failure doing nothing with having had my chance ! Teresa . Teresa Rand I see ; a sort of **28;0;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not exactly , because I do n't see anything wrong . It 's just election tactics ! The others 'd do it ; we must fight them with their weapons . Teresa . Teresa Rand Rather cunningly . Will you tell Bert Vorhees ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . After a second 's pause . No . Teresa . Teresa Rand That 's just what I mean ! It 's something father would n't do . George . George D. Rand , Jr . He would n't ! Why , father 's whole business success was due to his not letting his left hand know what his right hand was after , but to square things in the end by a good division !  --  one third to the left hand on the basis that the right hand had done all the work ! And you know what father 's name stood for  --  the very criterion of business honor ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Well , George , suppose I do it . I 'm in no position to criticise , any way . I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to carry out Don 's plan . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Thank you , Tess . But the enthusiasm is gone . Teresa . Teresa Rand Only , somehow it does n't coincide with my idea of what I thought you were being and striving for . Maybe you 're on your way up the ladder , but you , at the same time , are coming down from the pedestal I 'd put you on , to join me at the bottom of mine . There is a moment 's pause , both looking straight ahead , not liking to look into each other 's eyes . Enter Hannock . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Excuse me , Mr. Rand . Mr. Vorhees is on the ' phone . Teresa . Teresa Rand Quickly , to George . I 'll tell him . Then you wo n't have to lie , if he asks any difficult questions . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I would n't lie ; I 'd just beg anything I do n't want to answer  --  and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she goes . Teresa . Teresa Rand Very serious . I wonder if she 'd approve of this little plot of ours ? I wish it did n't seem contemptible to me ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Hurt and showing a hint of shame for the first time . For God 's sake , Tess , do n't suggest such a thing ! Eleanor is the one thing in the world I would n't give up to get this election . Teresa looks at him meaningly as she goes out . George . George D. Rand , Jr . What did you mean by looking for personal graft out of this election just now , with Mr. Vorhees . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I was showing my hand , that 's all . I was calling the pot ! It 's time ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . You do n't know the men you 're dealing with ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Looking George squarely and meaningly in the face . I know one of them better than he knows himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hannock ! That day my father died , I promised myself and his memory I 'd look after you , and look after you well  --  not like a dependent on father 's charity  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Interrupts . Damned unwilling charity  --  he was afraid  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . We wo n't go into the story of your mother  --  Hannock winces . I 've tried to treat you as I would a  --  brother who was unlucky  --  somebody I was glad to give a hand to  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Interrupting . Well , have n't I made good ? What complaints have you  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Going on . You 've been of the greatest service to me in every way . There 's no question about that ! But it 's time for us now to open a new pack , and each go his own way  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Thunderstruck . What 's that you say ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  a sum we 'll agree on ,  --  and you 're to get a job elsewhere , that 's all  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Dry and ugly . Is it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . What do you say ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Oh , I 've got a hell of a lot to say ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Cut it down to yes or no , and we 'll discuss the amount of the income ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock No ! ! ! You have n't got to give half of what I expect to get out of the present situation ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Angry , but controlled . If you do n't look out , you 'll get nothing . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Sneers . Pah ! Just wait till I begin to open your eyes for you ! For instance , how about the New Brunswick deal ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . What about it ? On the defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that 's ever been in " high finance " ! With a sneer . George . George D. Rand , Jr . What do you mean ? You knew that deal from the very beginning  --  you knew every step I took in it ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Yes , I did ! I notice you kept the transaction pretty quiet from everybody else . George . George D. Rand , Jr . It was nobody else 's business . My father taught me that  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Not listening out . Yes !  --  and he taught you a lot of other things , too ! But you go farther than he would have dared . George . George D. Rand , Jr . That 's enough ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock What 's the difference between your deal , and the Troy business that sent Pealy to State 's Prison ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Every difference ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Triumphantly . Is there ? Think a minute ! A second 's pause . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bank 's . George . George D. Rand , Jr . It was n't my partner 's money ; it was the firm 's . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock But you were the only one who knew what was being done with it . George . George D. Rand , Jr . My partner got his fair share , did n't he ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Yes , but you got the unfair ! You got paid pretty high for your " influence . " Nobody else had any chance to sell theirs ! If that is n't taking money under false pretences , if it is n't using funds you have n't the right to use ,  --  there was a miscarriage of justice in the Pealy case , that 's all . George . George D. Rand , Jr . But  --  ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Go over the two deals with Vorhees , if you do n't believe me ! Show him the differences between the Brunswick Transaction and the Pealy case ,  --  if he can see any ! Enter Eleanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ! She sees Hannock ; her manner changes to a cold one . Good morning , Mr. Hannock . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Good morning , Miss Vorhees . Excuse me ! He passes Miss Vorhees , and goes out ; as he goes , with his back to them , he is seen taking out from his pocket his hypodermic needle , and a small bottle ,  --  and , by then , he is out . Eleanor and George silently follow him with their eyes . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Turning . What is it about him ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Kisses her . You do n't like him either ? Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees I detest him ! What Cicely can see in him I  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Quietly . Cicely ? Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Yes , I 've come to-day as a go-between  --  between you and Cicely  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Ha ! Cicely 's clever enough to know how to get what she wants from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleanor Vorhees She 's in love with your secretary . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Not taking it in . What ? Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Cicely and Mr. Hannock are in love with each other  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Aghast . Impossible  --  Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees I know ; I felt the same as you do . I detest him ; he 's no match for Cicely  --  I feel instinctively the last man in the world for her . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Even not that  --  Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees But Cicely insists . They wish to marry . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Never ! Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees She guessed you would be against it . She says we none of us like Hannock , and nobody 's fair to him ; and so she begged me to persuade you . She asked me to remember how much I loved you , and what our marriage meant to us . You see , I could n't refuse ! But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart is n't in it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Hardly hearing Eleanor . It 's beyond believing ! He touches the bell with decision . I must talk to Cicely now , before she sees Hannock again . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Would n't it be better without me ? She might resent your refusing and giving your reasons before me . Enter Foot . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Ask Miss Cicely to come here at once , please . Foot . Foot Yes , sir . He goes out . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Perhaps it would be better . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees George , it does n't make any difference to you that Hannock has no family or position ? Cicely thinks you 're prejudiced against him because his mother was a milliner or dressmaker  --  or something  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Of course that makes no difference to me  --  Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees And you would n't be influenced against a man by your personal feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He shakes his head . If you do n't know anything against Hannock , you 'll let him have a chance to prove himself worthy of Cicely , wo n't you ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Eleanor , it ca n't be ! Do n't ask me any questions , but believe me , nothing could make such a thing possible ,  --  personal prejudice and any other kind aside ! I want you to help me pull Cicely through it . I may even ask you to take Cicely into your house for a while . Would you do this for me ? Teresa and Don , you know , would be no comfort , and , on the other hand , would set her a bad example , and fan every little rebellious flame in her ! Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Of course , I 'll do whatever I possibly can , dear . This is the very sort of thing I want to share with you , if I ca n't take it entirely off your shoulders . Enter Cicely . Cicely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ? Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Going . To Cicely , speaking tenderly . I wo n't go home yet . I 'll wait for you upstairs . Cicely . Cicely Rand Humph ! Thank you ; I know what that means ! Eleanor goes out . George . George D. Rand , Jr . My dear girl , it is n't possible that you care for Hannock ? Cicely . Cicely Rand Determined . Yes , very much ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well , even that may be , but still not in the way you think . Cicely . Cicely Rand I love him ! Oh , I knew you 'd be against it ! Nobody cares for him in this house ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Quickly . And that 's why you do ! You 're sorry for him , my dear girl ! It 's pity , not love ! Cicely . Cicely Rand Increasing her resentment and determination . Nothing of the sort ! He does n't need my pity in any way . George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would feel toward a girl who seemed to me to be ignored . Cicely . Cicely Rand Abused ! As good as insulted here , by everybody ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . You think so , and your sympathy is aroused ,  --  but that 's not love . Cicely . Cicely Rand You do n't know what you 're talking about ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , I do ,  --  better than you . You 've never been in love in your life , and so you mistake something , that is probably like a sisterly affection for this man , for the other thing . Cicely . Cicely Rand Ridiculous ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . You do n't know the difference now  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand Nonsense ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But you 'll realize it some day when the right man comes along  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand Satirically . I hope not ! It would be awkward , as I shall be married to Fred Hannock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll never be married to Hannock ! Cicely . Cicely Rand You 're not my father ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But I represent him , and I tell you you must give up this idea  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand Interrupting angrily . And I tell you I wo n't ! Good-by ! Starting to go . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Wait a minute . Rings bell . You ca n't marry this man . He is n't good enough for you ! Cicely . Cicely Rand Humph ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Or for any self-respecting woman to marry , as far as that goes . Cicely . Cicely Rand Your opinion as to whom I shall marry , or not , means absolutely nothing to me . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Very well , I 'll go even farther . I 'll tell you that , even if both my reasons for disapproving of Hannock were done away with ,  --  still , I say for you to marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing your father , forbid it . Enter Foot . Foot . Foot Yes , sir ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Ask Mr. Hannock to come here . Foot . Foot Yes , sir . Goes out . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I shall tell him , before you , anything between him and you is absolutely impossible ,  --  that I forbid it , and that he is dismissed from my service . Cicely . Cicely Rand Then I will go with him , if he wants me to . Do you think I 'm going to have him lose his position and everything through me , and not stick to him ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . With tension . Sorry for him ! That 's all it is ! Sorry for him ! Cicely . Cicely Rand It 's not  --  and you can forbid now till doomsday . I 'm my own mistress , and I shall do as I darn please ! I shall marry the man I want to , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I wanted to give you the chance to stand by me  --  Her voice falters , and she turns away ; she cries . I felt you would n't , but I wanted you to , and that 's why  --  I 've come here now  --  and let you  --  humiliate me  --  in this  --  way . I wanted my own brother to sympathize with me , to help me . Everybody will follow your lead ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Goes to her , and puts his arms about her . Cis ! I ca n't tell you how sorry I am ! Not since father died have I felt as I do now . I 've nothing to gain or lose except your affection , dear girl , and your happiness , so you can believe me when I say this marriage ca n't be  --  She pushes his arm away and faces him . Cicely . Cicely Rand Literal and absolutely unconvinced or frightened . Why not ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . I ca n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me well enough to realize such reasoning with me is a waste of breath . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Suffering . I want to spare you  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand What ? It does n't seem to me you 're sparing me much ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But listen  --  Vorhees just now told me  --  Hannock is n't on the level ,  --  he is n't honest ! Cicely . Cicely Rand I wo n't take Bert Vorhees ' word for that ! Fred 's been your right-hand man here for four years and over . Have you ever found him doing a single dishonest thing ? I 'm sure you have n't , or you would n't have kept him . I do n't know why you did anyway ! It was perfectly evident you did n't like him ! Hannock enters . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Quickly , before he is fully in the room , and going to the door . Hannock , please excuse me . Will you wait one minute in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . He looks questioningly at Cicely . She nods her head . Certainly . He goes out . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Intensely , with his hand on the knob , holding the door closed behind him . Listen to me , for God 's sake ! You 're my sister , I 'm your brother . Have I ever showed that I did anything but love you ? Cicely . Cicely Rand No , that 's why I hoped  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Interrupting , almost beside himself . But it ca n't be ! ! Wo n't you trust me ,  --  wo n't you ? Let me tell Hannock , without going any deeper into it , that  --  you realize the marriage ca n't be ; that you and he must n't meet again ! You can say what kind things you  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand Flashing . Never ! ! You ought to know me better than to propose any such thing ! She moves toward the door . George . George D. Rand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own sake , for his sake , for mother 's , for everybody 's  --  trust me and  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand Looking him directly in the face after a second 's silence , speaks with the note of finality . Listen ! I married Fred Hannock this morning ! George looks at her , his eyes dilating . There is a pause . George . George D. Rand , Jr . In horror . What ! ! Cicely . Cicely Rand I married Fred Hannock half an hour ago . We walked home from the church , separately . He went to his work , and I sent for Eleanor . George . George D. Rand , Jr . In a voice of terrible but suppressed rage , goes to the door , throws it open with violence , and calls loudly : Come in ! Hannock enters quietly , expecting a fight or a scene ; he is on the defensive and not in any way frightened . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Controlling himself by a big effort . Is this true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been making love to her  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand Interrupting him . I never said that ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . That you 've repaid all that I 've done for you , and all my father did , by taking advantage of our kindness and your position here to run off with  --  Cicely . Cicely Rand Interrupting . I was as anxious to run off as he  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . But why was n't I told ? Why do it secretly ? To Hannock . Why did n't you go about it in the square , open way , unless you knew you were doing wrong ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I knew you 'd fight it for all you were worth , and I was n't going to run any risk of losing her ! Cicely . Cicely Rand But you would n't have ! My brother would have wasted his words then , as much as he is now  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I was afraid  --  any fool in my place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only friend I had in the house , or who ever came to it , was she ! With a wave of his hand toward Cicely . George . George D. Rand , Jr . And that 's why ! Ca n't you see it ? Do n't you know the difference between pity and love ? Cicely . Cicely Rand I love him and he knows it ;  --  do n't you , Fred ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Yes , I do know it ! As well as I know your brother only kept me here because  --  turning to George you were afraid of me ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Afraid of you ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Yes ! Do you suppose I did n't guess your father must have told you I was on to him in the bank ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Leave the dead alone ! You 've got your hands full with the living ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Well , I know my business well enough to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make the best of it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Never ! I tell you this marriage is no marriage ! Cicely and Hannock exclaim in derision . Cicely . Cicely Rand What 's the use of talking any more about it ? We are n't getting anywhere ! It 's done  --  and George has got to make the best of it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I tell you it ca n't be ! Will you take my word , Hannock ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock No ! Laughs loudly . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Then , I must go ahead without you ! You 're dismissed . Do you hear ? You 're discharged from my employ ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Getting very angry , but controlled . You take care ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Continues determinedly . You 'll leave this house to-day . I 'll give you an hour to pack up and get out , and you 'll never lay your eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes now , I 'll go with him . I 'm his wife ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . You wo n't go with him ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Who 'll prevent her ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . I will ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock In a blaze . Try it ! ! Cicely . Cicely Rand I 've just promised to love , honor and obey him  --  and if he says to come , I 'll go ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Slowly but strongly . He wo n't say it . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I do say it ! Come on , Cicely ! But if you want to come back , you can , because , before I 'm through with your brother , I 'll get him down on to his knees , begging me to come back , and I wo n't come without you ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Going to the door and holding it open . Cicely , will you wait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Frederick Hannock Oh , we can speak out before her ! I want my wife to know the truth about everything ! I do n't intend to be the goat in this family any longer ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well , you can tell Cicely , afterward , what I 'm going to tell you , if you like . God keep me from ever having to tell her ! After a look straight at Hannock , he looks at Cicely very seriously . She responds to his look , impressed by it , and turns her eyes to Hannock . Neither quite understands , but each feels the depth of seriousness in George 's attitude . Hannock . Geo rge Frederick Hannock Doggedly to Cicely . Go on . Cicely . Cicely Rand To Hannock . I 'll wait there for you . Do n't do anything without me . I 'm so sorry my brother takes this attitude ! Do n't think it can influence me , any more than the disgraceful way you 've always been treated here has ; nothing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves them . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I did n't want to have to tell you this . I 'd rather almost die than have to tell Cicely ! I must break faith with father , but of course he 'd be the first to ask me to . I must dig out a skeleton that is rotting in its closet  --  that 's the trouble ! I must do this , and a lot more , if you make me , and give you a couple of blows which will come pretty near to knocking you out , if you 've anything at all of a man in you . And every bit of it can be spared everybody , if you 'll go away and let Cicely  --  divorce you . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Well , I wo n't ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Because you wo n't give up Cicely ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Exactly . I love her better than anything ,  --  money , comfort , happiness , everything you can think of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let 's get through with it ! My wife  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . With excitement . She is n't your wife !  --  Hannock looks at him and sneers . George 's rage at Hannock is only governed by the tragedy of the whole thing . Your marriage was n't any marriage ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock A little frightened , and very angry now . What do you mean ?  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Looks towards the door where Cicely has gone , and , with difficulty , manages to control his voice , as he lowers it . Cicely is your sister ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock With a cry . Cicely is what ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Your sister ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Sees " red , " and goes nearly mad . You 're a God damn liar ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . It 's the truth  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Out of his mind , with an insane laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to come in . Hannock shouts at her angrily , in an ugly voice : You go back !  --  and shut the door ! Do you hear ! Get out of this room ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Strong , but more kind . Wait in the room till I call you . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Brokenly  --  ugly . I do n't want her hanging round here now ! This is none of her business , none o ' hers ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Speaks toward the doorway . Eleanor , I do n't want Cicely to hear what we 're saying . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Answering . Very good . She is seen shutting the door . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Making guttural sounds , and unable to pronounce the words clearly . Hugh  --  hugh  --  hah !  --  You 'd play any game to get rid of me , would n't you ? But you ca n't fool me like that ! ! He sits in a chair , mumbling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth and his chin wet with saliva . George . George D. Rand , Jr . That day I saw you first , just before he died , my father told me . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I do n't believe it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . He made me promise two things :  --  that I would n't tell you  --  never !  --  and that I would look out for you . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I do n't believe it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . That 's why your mother got her allowance ,  --  and to buy her silence  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I do n't believe it ! Laughing and weeping . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Now , you see why you must leave here to-day  --  leave New York ! Why there was no marriage this morning and never can be ! Why  --  Hannock . George Frederick Hannock His mind deranged , rises unevenly ; he is loud , partly incoherent , and his face is twitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole body wracked and trembling , but still strong , with a nervous madman 's strength . It 's all a lie  --  to separate Cicely from me ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Goes to him and sees the change . Hannock ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I 'll never believe it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Taking him by the shoulder . Have you gone out of your mind ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I 'll never give her up ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . What ! ! I tell you , she 's your sister ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock And I say I do n't believe it ! I love her , she loves me . I wo n't give her up ! ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , you will ! ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I wo n't ! Do you think I 'd give her up to some other fellow to hold in his arms ! For some other man to love and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said if I said come , she 'd go with me , and I 'll say it ! ! He starts toward the door . George takes hold of him to stop him from calling her . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Wait ! If you do n't give her up now , after what I 've told you , and leave here before she comes out of that room , I 'll have to do the only thing left ,  --  tell her ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Furious . No , you wo n't ! You sha' n't tell her ! It is n't true ! And if it was , by God , she sha' n't know it ! It would separate us ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Horrified at what this means , calls sternly and with determination : Cicely ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Wildly . Do n't you dare to tell her that lie ! Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Opening the door . You want Cicely to come in ? George . George D. Rand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving it open behind her . Cicely appears , and enters ,  --  leaving the door open . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock There is n't any lie too big for him to make up to separate us ! I 'm going ! Will you come with me ? Cicely . Cicely Rand Of course ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Cicely ! Are you strong ? Are you brave ? You must hear something unbelievably terrible ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Holding out his hand beggingly . Come along , do n't listen to him ! She makes a movement toward Hannock . George . George D. Rand , Jr . You ca n't ! Taking hold of her . Cicely . Cicely Rand I will ! Leave go of me ! Struggling desperately . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Puts his arms about her , and holds her in his arms  --  her back to him . My poor child , he 's your  --  Hannock , without warning , pulls out a pistol from his hip pocket , and shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vorhees Calls , in fright . George ! ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Cicely ! He holds her in his arms , and carries her over to sofa . Calls brokenly : Cicely ! Eleanor enters quickly , and goes to them . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees In horror as she sees . Oh ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Take her . Eleanor takes Cicely tenderly from him . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Now , you nor nobody else can separate us ! Lifts the pistol to his heart to shoot , feeling for the place he showed in Act I. George springs forward and gets hold of him and the pistol before he can shoot . George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! That 's too good for you ! That 's too easy ! By God , you 've got to pay . Enter Foot in excitement . Foot . Foot Excuse me , sir , I heard  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . All right . Telephone for the police . Is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God ! Bowing his head , emotion surges up in him . Hannock , in this moment of weakness , almost frees himself and almost gets hold of the pistol . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Who is watching , cries out in alarm . George ! George , be careful ! George pulls himself together too quickly for him , and prevents Hannock . Foot starts to go . To Foot : Help me ; it wo n't take you a moment ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! Foot , I know I can trust you . Giving him the pistol . Keep this , yourself , and do n't let him get out of the room . Foot . Foot Yes , sir . Takes the pistol , and stands before Hannock . George goes to Cicely , and takes her in his arms . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Poor little woman ! little sister ! Why did this have to be ! I wonder if this is what they call the sins of the fathers ? He carries her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hannock , the moment they are gone , makes a movement . Foot at once covers him with the pistol . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Give me that pistol ! Foot . Foot No , sir . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Name your own price ! Foot . Foot Miss Cicely 's life back , sir ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock You 're against me too , are you ! Every one 's against me ! George comes back . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Taking the pistol from Foot . Thank you . Now , telephone , and ask them to be quick , please . Foot . Foot Shall I come back , sir ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . No , I think this job had better be mine . Looking hard at Hannock . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Quickly . I wo n't try to get away ,  --  I give you my word of honor . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Your word of honor ! To Foot . When you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Ask her to keep my mother and Mrs. Van Vranken from coming here . Foot . Foot Yes , sir . Goes out . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Makes a move for George . Give me that gun ! There is a short struggle . George breaks from Hannock , and , crossing to the table , lays the pistol on it . Hannock makes a tricky attempt to get to it quickly , but is caught by George , who holds him . The following scene takes place with George keeping hold of Hannock , who sometimes struggles and sometimes tries to break , suddenly or craftily , away from George 's grip , and at other times remains quiescent . You 're a damn fool ! Do n't you see it 's the easiest way all around for us ? I 've got to die anyway . George . George D. Rand , Jr . But not that way . That 's too easy for you ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Well , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way ! There 's no arrest , no trial , no scandal ! Nobody 'll know I was her brother ; nobody 'll know about your father ! Think what it 'll save your mother ! Think what it 'll save you ! Think what it 'll save everybody ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Including you ,  --  and you do n't deserve to be saved anything ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Still , even I am your own blood ! For God 's sake , go on , let me ! All you have to do is to turn your back a minute  --  it wo n't take two ! Please ! Think of her  --  what it 'll save her memory ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Then for your mother 's sake ! How can she go through a trial and all that means ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Your work in the next room is worse than any trial for her to bear . Hannock . George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will my trial do to your election ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 'm not thinking of my election now ,  --  I 'm thinking of that little , still figure lying in the next room ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Emotionally , almost crying . There 'd have been two , if you had n't stopped me ! For the love of God , give me the gun  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! You 've got to sit in the chair ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock With an ugly change . Well , you 'll get your punishment , too ,  --  do n't you forget that ! ! I know how eaten up with ambition you are ! And every single wish nearest to your heart will die just as dead as I do , if you let me go to trial ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . What do you think you 're doing ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock If I have to pay my price , I 'll make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politically , before I go into the condemned cell . George . George D. Rand , Jr . You 're crazy , and that 's the only thing that may save you , if Matteawan is salvation ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock I knew your father was dishonest , and I told him that day ; I guess it killed him . And I 've watched you , and tempted you , and helped you go on with his methods ! Every bit of this will come out in my trial . I 'll get a clever enough lawyer to manage that ! And you 'll lose , not only your ambition , but your position in the world , and one more thing besides ,  --  the woman you 're in love with ! For that kind of a highbrowed moral crank would n't stand for one half you stand for in business , and when she finds out how deceived she 's been in you , if I know human nature , she wo n't have that much love left for you  --  Snapping his fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know !  --  your party and the other party ! That election 'll be a hell of a walkover for the other side ! Eleanor enters . George . George D. Rand , Jr . What is it , Eleanor ? I do n't want you here . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Half aside , with a half jeer , and a half smile . Hah ! Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Excuse me . Bert wants you on the telephone . Shall I answer ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , please . Hannock begins to steal behind , toward the pistol . Does mother know ? Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Yes , and she 's very plucky . But I 'm surprised how full she is of the desire for revenge ! George turns and sees Hannock , and quickly but quietly intercepts him , and stands with his hand on the pistol . She wants Hannock punished ! She 's watching for the police ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . They ought to be here soon , now . Eleanor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly . Goes out . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Do you realize how completely you 'll be done for , if you do n't let me do it ? The New Brunswick business is n't a patch on some of your other deals I know about ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 've never done a thing in business that could n't stand the strictest overhauling . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock If you believe that , you 're a bigger fool than I thought ! I 'd rather be a crook than a fool , any day ! Quick , before she comes from the telephone ! Turn your back ; walk to the door there ! It 's easily explained ;  --  you 're not to blame ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Hysterically . If you do n't , I 'll explain now , before her , where and how your standard in business is rotten , and your dealings crooked ,  --  and you can begin to take your medicine ! George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Eleanor comes back . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Bert wants me to tell you it 's settled ,  --  your nomination  --  and he adds , " good luck ! " George . George D. Rand , Jr . Did you tell him about  --  ? Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees No  --  I  --  I told him to come here as soon as he could . George . George D. Rand , Jr . All right . Eleanor starts to go . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Excitedly . Wait a minute , Miss Vorhees ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No , Eleanor , go back , please ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Quickly . This man , who thinks he has it on me , is afraid to have you hear the truth about himself . That 's why he do n't want you to stay . George . George D. Rand , Jr . To Eleanor . Stay ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock You think George Rand stands for honesty , and the square deal in the business world ! Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was n't paying up to the hilt  --  East , West , North and South  --  to protect himself , everybody in this country would know what we , on the inside , do ! Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees George , unless you 'd really rather I stayed , I do n't want to hear what he has to say about you . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Quickly . I do n't blame you for not wanting to hear about the suicide of Henry Bodes ! To George . Do you know who killed Bodes ? You did ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . The man 's out of his mind still , Eleanor . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Am I ? Bodes was on to your Copper Pit scheme , and saw it succeed  --  so he tried one like it , and it failed ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Was that my fault ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Yes ! It was your example set him on , and do you think your scheme was legitimate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me God , I do ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Then why , when it failed , did Bodes kill himself ? He was n't broke ! It was n't money that drove him to it ! It was shame , because his scheme was crooked , just as yours was . Success covered it , but failure showed it up . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Do n't ask me to listen to this any longer ! She goes out . George watches her go , but Hannock only gives a quick glance after her . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Bodes was one of your sweet , weak family men , who ca n't stand on disgrace ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Disgrace ! ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Ask Vorhees ,  --  and about the New Brunswick case ! And get him to tell you the truth ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Half to himself . Good God ! If there is something in all this ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock What are you paying Elmer Caston ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jr . For his legal services ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Rot ! The firm 's never used him  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . But keeping him on our pay list keeps him from working against us . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Hush money ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Why were all these Amsterdam tunnel bonds made over to Parker Jennings ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . He helped us get the bill passed ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Ask Vorhees if he would n't put that down in the expense-book under the name of Blackmail . George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Ask Vorhees ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . You ca n't alter the diplomacy of the business world  --  calling it by ugly names . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock No , I ca n't , but Roosevelt did ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . If you think I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come ! Stop bluffing ! If you do n't realize I know what I 'm talking about , I 'll go on . I know at least five separate deals of yours so damned crooked , if any one of them were made public you 'd be out of business over night , and out of the country , if you know your job . He waits . No answer . George is weighing the truth or the lie of what he is saying . He evidently sees some truth in it . And I 've got proof of what I say ! Every proof ! I 've got copies of letters and telegrams , when I could n't get the originals . I 've got shorthand reports of private telephone conversations . I 've got data enough for fifty trials , if it should come to that . I 've been preparing for a deal of my own with you ever since I came to you ! Only  --  God ! He is moved as he thinks of Cicely . I did n't think it would be trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you finance a big game for me ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . If what you say is true  --  and I do n't know but what some of it may be ,  --  then it 's good-by to everything for me , and it 'll be about all I 'm worth having come to me . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock That 's it ! Even Middleburg 'll be too small for you , if I show you up ! But you know what 'll shut my lips tight ! Gim me the gun  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Quickly . No . Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Pleadingly . You 've everything to get , and nothing to lose by it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , I have something to lose !  --  what rag of honor I 've got left ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock No ! Think a minute  --  if I 'm out of the way ? There 's no real scandal  --  your father 's old story  --  our father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . I shot Cicely , and killed myself ,  --  it 's an ordinary story . I was drunk or crazy  --  she would n't have me . Any story you want to make up , and there 'll not be a murmur against Cicely , then ! But can you see the papers if the real story comes out ! ! All over this country , and all the countries , it 'll be telegraphed and pictured and revelled in . It 'll even get into the cinematograph shows in Europe  --  with some low down girl masquerading as Cicely . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Stop ! Stop ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock And the story will come out , if I go to trial . I 'll stop at nothing to take it out of you . Whether you believe or not what I say about your business methods , you take my word for it , my arrest will put a quietus on your election , and finish you , not only in a political career , but any old career at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a finish ! What a finish of all I hoped to do and be ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock And  --  you 'll lose the woman who 's just left this room . Whether all her brother 's high-browed talk is bunkum or not , even I know hers is serious ; and if she finds you 've deceived her all the time , that your high ideals are fake  --  ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Interrupts , crying , in an agony half to himself : They 're not ! They 're not ! God knows , nobody 's been more deceived in me than I 've been myself ! Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Well , you know she wo n't stand for it . A girl like  --  her heart could n't stomach it ! Go on , bring me to trial and lose everything you 've banked on for a career ! Lose your business standing , lose your best friends , lose the woman you want , and raise the rottenest scandal for your family , for your mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go foul under ! Do it all , and be damned to you ! ! He falls on his knees with exhaustion . George . George D. Rand , Jr . My God , how can I ? Hannock . George Frederick Hannock Whining , pleading . All you have to do , to save every mother 's son of us , is to let me do what the law 'll do anyway ! Leave that pistol where I can get it , and walk half a dozen steps away . That 's all you need do ! He sees George hesitate . It 's all or nothing for you ! ! It 's the finish or the beginning ! Are you ready and willing to be down and out , and go through the hell my living 'll mean for you ? He sees George weaken more . You 'll be Governor ! Sure , you 'll marry Miss Vorhees ! You 'll find all the proofs I told you about in my safety deposit box at the Manhattan . And there 'll be only white flowers and pity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove by the future that you were made of the right stuff at heart , after all ! George puts down the pistol not far from Hannock 's reach , and starts to walk away with a set face  --  suffering . Hannock makes a slow , silent step towards the pistol , but , before he can get it , George turns and recovers it , with a terrific revulsion of feeling . He seizes the pistol and throws it through the big glass window . George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! I have n't the right ! You must take your punishment as it comes , and I must take mine ! He suddenly breaks down ; tears fill his throat and pour from his eyes . Hannock is crouching and drivelling on the floor . This is my only chance to show I can be on the level ! That I can be straight , when it 's plain what is the right thing to do ! God help me do it ! The door opens and a Policeman enters with Foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Act II , only seen from another point of view . The mantel is now Right and the windows Back . Left is the wall not seen before . Later the same day . Vorhees and George are seated at the desk before a mass of business papers . There is a tall whiskey-and-soda glass , nearly empty , and a plate with the remnants of some sandwiches , beside George . The shades of the windows are drawn , but it is still daylight . George looks crushed , mentally and physically , but is calm and immovable . Vorhees looks stern and disappointed . There is a pause ; neither men move . George . George D. Rand , Jr . That 's all ? Vorhees nods his head . George drinks , and gathers up the papers . What 's to be done with these papers ? Are they Hannock 's or mine ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees They have only to do with your affairs . Hannock had n't any right to them ! In any case , you do n't pretend to deny anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Rand , Jr . But  --  Getting up all the papers , except some of his own , which he separates and leaves on the desk . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees I doubt if , when it comes to the point , Hannock will go into all this business ! He will have had months to cool down , and his hands will be full enough . He gives George a couple of papers he has had in his hand , and motions to the fireplace . Here ! do n't wash your dirty linen ; burn it ! George goes to the fireplace with a mass of papers , and burns them . George . George D. Rand , Jr . As the papers burn . Has Eleanor gone home ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Yes , but she promised your mother to come back later and stop over-night with her . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I wonder if she 'd be willing to see me ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Yes , because I 'm sure she did n't believe Hannock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stay with mother . There 'll be no need of her pretending to go back to Don , now . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Pretending ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes . That 's something else I did ,  --  persuaded Tess to make Don believe she 'd come back in accordance with his conditions . But it was agreed between us she was to break her word to him , after the election ! He burns his last batch of papers . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees It 's a pity you ca n't burn that , too ! I 'd have staked my reputation on your being absolutely on the level ! How I have been taken in by you ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I know , it sounds ridiculous , and I do n't expect you to understand it ; but I 've been taken in by myself , too ! Shall I write my withdrawal from the nomination , or will you take a verbal message ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Write it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation . George goes to the desk and writes . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , George . I know what it means to you ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Somehow now , it does n't seem so much , after all ; I suppose that 's Cicely  --  poor little girl  --  poor little girl ,  --  and  --  Eleanor . He adds the last , almost in a whisper . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees You 're a young man , George ! You 've got a good chance yet to make good , and it 's all up to you ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I know that  --  Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees I suppose you wo n't want to go back to Middleburg ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . No ! No ! ! For everybody 's sake ! But , would it have been wrong  --  leave me out of it ,  --  to have saved father 's memory , to have saved mother  --  could I have let him do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , and anyway , I did n't . Why ca n't I forget it ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Oh , it 'll be many a day before you deserve to forget it ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But , will you ever have any confidence in me ? Can any one ever believe in me again ? Buries his face in his hands , and groans . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees I can . Whether I do or not , is entirely up to you . George . George D. Rand , Jr . You 're sure of that ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Takes his hand and shakes it . Sure . George . George D. Rand , Jr . And Eleanor ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Well  --  there 's no use in my lying about it . If I know her , you must give up all idea of marrying her . Eleanor 's husband must be a man she can look up to . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do believe she 'll help you with her friendship . If you do n't go back to Middleburg , where will you go ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Here ! I stay right here ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Surprised . Here ! It 'll be hard . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I suppose it will ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees How will you start ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . First , make a clean breast to my partners ! Give back all the money I 've made in ways which you 've proved to me are illegal . Publish every form of graft I 've benefited by , for the sake of future protection ! Resign from all  --  Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees It 's gigantic ! It 's colossal ! Can you do it ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Simply . I can try . I 'm going to have a go at it , anyway ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees The Press ! Among your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll be hell for you to go through ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . I know it ! I know it ! But to get back where I want to be  --  if I ever can ! I 've got to fight it out right here , and make good here , or not at all . I do n't care what it costs me ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Opening the door . May I come in ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes , come in , Tess . Where 's mother ? Teresa . Teresa Rand She 's locked herself in her room ! She 's turned against me in the most extraordinary manner ! Says my influence over Cicely is at the bottom of everything ! She begins to cry . She goes so far as to say , if I 'd behaved like a decent woman , she does n't believe this would have happened ! I did n't care what other people believe of me , but this I did n't bargain for ! I have been unfaithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps ,  --  but that 's all  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . I always felt it , Tess ! Teresa . Teresa Rand Ca n't you persuade mother ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Bert could , because he represents the outside world . Teresa . Teresa Rand But you know Bert . He would n't persuade her , unless he believed in me himself . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees That 's true , and I 'll go talk with her now , if Mrs. Rand will see me . He goes toward door . Teresa . Teresa Rand Deeply moved , and grateful . Thank you ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees That 's all right . He goes out . Teresa . Teresa Rand George , I do n't know  --  but everything , even Jimmy Cairns , seems so little now , in comparison with Cicely  --  dead ,  --  the bottom fallen out of everything ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Even worse than that , for me . I 've given up the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bert feel you had to ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . No more than I did . You wo n't have to act a lie for me after all , Tess . Teresa . Teresa Rand I 'm glad ! I know , if Eleanor Vorhees knew I was doing it  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . She 's going to know it ,  --  and that I 'm a liar ! She 's going to know much worse things than that ! Everybody 's going to know them , I guess ! Father was a crook in business ,  --  that 's the ugly , unvarnished fact ,  --  and I 've been a worse one ! But I 'd rather she 'd learn these things from me ,  --  what Hannock has n't already told her  --  rather than she learned them outside . Teresa . Teresa Rand But George ! George ! ! Do n't you realize you 'll lose her ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Well , I 've lost everything else , except  --  Teresa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jr . Except that ! After all , I do n't believe , way down at the bottom , I 'm not fundamentally straight ! I mean to give myself , all by myself , a chance to prove it ! I know there are lots of " good men " who are born crooks . I want to see if I 'm not a crook who was born good ! Vorhees renters . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees It 's all right . They 've told Mrs. Rand she can go in and see Cicely now , and she wants you to go with her . Teresa . Teresa Rand Holds his hand in her two , for a moment . Thank you ! She goes out . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees And give me that paper you wrote . The sooner we get that off our hands , the better . George takes up the paper and , reading it over to himself , goes slowly to Vorhees , and gives it to him . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Too bad , old man , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George D. Rand , Jr . I know ! Vorhees starts to go . Bert ,  --  Eleanor has n't come yet ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees No . Are you sure you want to see her , or shall I first  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . No , leave it to me ! I 'd rather . I do n't want a loophole , anywhere , for her thinking me a coward . I want to make a clean breast of it all ! That 's what I 'm after ,  --  a clean breast , no matter what the doing it costs me ! Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees You 're right . About to go . Enter Foot . Foot . Fo ot A gentleman for a newspaper , sir . George . George D. Rand , Jr . Will you see him , Bert ? Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees Yes . To Foot . You refer all the reporters to me .

I 'd like your help in laying out a plan of action . Of course I sha n't do anything till after  --  He hesitates , and raises his head and eyes to upstairs . Vorhees . Albert F. Vorhees I would n't . Goes out . Foot exits . George stands alone in the room , a picture of utter dejection , of ruin and sorrow , but with a bulldog look all the while ,  --  the look of a man who is licked , beaten , but not dead yet . He stands immovable almost  --  in complete silence . Slowly and softly , the door opens . Van Vranken looks in . He speaks in a sullen , hushed , and somewhat awed voice . He is pale ; all evidence of drinking and excitement are gone . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken George ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . In a monotonous voice . Hello , Don  --  you know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's true ? George , with a set face and stern lips , nods his head firmly , still standing . Van Vranken collapses in a chair . God ! Poor Cicely ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Tough , is n't it ? With a great sigh . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken I was having an awful time , George , with Mrs. Judly . She was giving it to me good for being willing to patch it up , temporarily , with Tess ! She did n't care about you ! I 've come to the conclusion she do n't care about anybody , anyway , but herself . Her brother telephoned it from his Club , and she  --  his anger rises had the rottenness to say she believed there was something between Hannock and Cicely . That was more than I could stand for ! God knows I 'm as bad as they make them , but , with that little girl dead like that  --  to think such a thing , let alone say it  --  I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It did n't seem to me it was the time to have a low quarrel between two people like us ! It made us seem so beastly small ! Death 's such an awful  --  such a big  --  I suppose I 'll feel differently to-morrow  --  but to-day  --  now  --  George , I could n't stand for it ! She kicked me out , and I give you my word of honor I 'm glad she did ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Not deeply impressed , but civil . As you say , you 'll feel differently to-morrow . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Very likely ! Still , I 've got these few decent hours , anyway , to put on your sister 's grave . A pause . George sits . George . George D. Rand , Jr . I 've given up running for governor . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Surprised . Because  --  ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . No . You 'll hear all the reasons soon enough . The point for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further  --  living together . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Thoughtfully . I see . After a pause . George  --  ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . What ?

Then , perhaps I 'd better not go  --  ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . I think I would , if I were you . Van Vranken looks at George questioningly . Teresa enters . Teresa . Teresa Rand Quietly . Don  --  Her voice fills ; she turns aside , and hastily wipes her eyes . Van Vranken . Donald Van Vranken Moved . I was going upstairs . Teresa . Teresa Rand Not now ! Mother and I have just left .

I take it all back , Tess . You can have it your own way entirely . Leave Mrs. Judly out of it ,  --  that 's all I 'll ask . Outside that , I 'll fix it easy for you . Teresa . Teresa Rand Thank you , Don , after a second 's pause but , if you do n't mind , I 'd rather go back with you for the present , anyway . It seems to me , between us , we 've pretty well spoiled everything except  --  well ,  --  perhaps , in thinking of the children 's happiness we might find something for ourselves ! What do you say ? Van Vranken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as you 're willing ! Enter Mrs. Rand in a flurry . Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand Has any one thought to send for a dressmaker ? Nobody answers .

In Middleburg , I 'd have known ,  --  but here , I 'm always wrong ! If I 'd had my way , I 'd never have taken off my crpe veil for your father , and now I wish I had n't ! She sees Don . Oh ! I did n't see you , Don . Have you come to beg Tess 's pardon ? Has this terrible thing reformed you ? Van Vranken .

Mrs. Rand . Mrs. Rand It 's the truth ,  --  I have n't ! I 've never been anything , in New York , but a fizzle ! I 've been snubbed right and left by the people I wanted to know ! I 'm lonesome for my church , and if I died I would n't have a handful of people at my funeral ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . But you 're going to live , mother , and you 'll see we 'll make you happy yet ! Mrs. Rand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself !

She breaks down into hysterical sobbing . It 's more than I can bear ! I tell you , children , I ca n't bear it ! And it 's all thanks to coming here ! ! This is what we get for not doing what your father wished . Why did n't we stay home ? I amounted to something there . I had as much sense as my neighbors . I could hold my own !

She and I , in a small town , would have been happy always ! I 'd not have been tempted like I am here  --  I could n't have had the chances  --  George . George D. Rand , Jr . Rising and speaking with the fulness of conviction . No ! You 're all wrong ! Do n't blame the City . It 's not her fault ! It 's our own ! What the City does is to bring out what 's strongest in us . If at heart we 're good , the good in us will win ! If the bad is strongest , God help us ! Do n't blame the City ! She gives the man his opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it !

But the village gives him no chance to find it out , to prove it to his fellows  --  the small town is too easy ! But the City ! ! ! A man goes to the gates of the City and knocks !  --  New York or Chicago , Boston or San Francisco , no matter what city so long as it 's big , and busy , and selfish , and self-centred . And she comes to her gates and takes him in , and she stands him in the middle of her market place  --  where Wall Street and Herald Square and Fifth Avenue and the Bowery , and Harlem , and Forty-second Street all meet , and there she strips him naked of all his disguises  --  and all his hypocrisies ,  --  and she paints his ambition on her fences , and lights up her skyscrapers with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks he is !  --  and then she says to him , Make good if you can , or to Hell with you !

Give up principal I gained on somebody else 's risk than my own ! Begin all over again at the bottom , but on the level , and climb , only if I can do it on the square ! Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees I understand ! I understand it all , now ! You 've done wrong ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes . Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees Oh , so wrong , but you 're owning all up , and giving all up ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? George . George D. Rand , Jr . Of course I could fight it , but what 's the use ? It 's true ! Now I realize that , I ca n't own up fast enough ! I ca n't begin over again soon enough ! I ca n't eat or sleep or take a long breath even , till I 'm on the level again with myself . Even at the price of you ! But I 'll make you believe in me again , Eleanor ,  --  you 'll see , if we live long enough ! Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees We do n't have to live any longer for that . George . George D. Rand , Jr . In what way ? Eleanor . Eleanor Vorhees The man who has done wrong , and can own it up ,  --  face life all over again empty-handed , emptying his own hands of his own accord , turn his back on everything he counted on and lived for , because it is the right thing to do , and because  --  leaving the world out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that  --  George  --  is the man I look up to ten times more than the one who was born good and lived good because he never was tempted to enjoy the spoils of going wrong ! It 's the man whom it costs something to be good ,  --  that 's what makes real character ! And to me  --  she goes up to him , and puts her hand on his arm you , here , to-day , are twice the man you were yesterday ! You needed a test , though we did n't know it ! And at the same time we found that out , you had to go through it ; and thank God , your real self has triumphed ! To-day you are the man I loved yesterday ! George . George D. Rand , Jr . Looking away . Now , I know what those people mean who say a man gets all the Hell that 's coming to him in this world ,  --  looking at her  --  and all the Heaven , too !
