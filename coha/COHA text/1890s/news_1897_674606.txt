txt Patrick Jerome Gleason was interrogated Yesterday evening concerning a story printed in The Brooklyn Eagle that he was a candidate for Mayor of Greater New York merely to trouble the Democrats and in fulfillment of a bargain made with Thomas C. Platt , who had agreed to rush the special Long Island City legislation asked for by the Mayor on condition that the latter would perturb the pelucid stream of the municipal Democratic canvass . Mayor Gleason had just alighted from a wagon in which he had been driving about inspecting his domain . He was comfortably tipped back in a chair on the pavement in front of his headquarters a hundred feet above the landing from the Thirty-fourth Street Ferry . Above him there was a huge red transparency bearing the name and likeness of Patrick J. Gleason , candidate for Mayor of Greater New York , and the Gleason battle s xe outlined In incandescent Electric lights which shine far at night . " All rot and a lie , " Mayor Gleason remarked descriptively , speaking of the Eagle story . " Have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If these people will meet me anywhere in any public meeting and make their charges I 'll answer them . " Then the mayor went on to say  --  declaring meanwhile that he considered the assaults upon him unworthy of notice  --  that the only opposition to his Lonk Island City bills in the Legislature was from Finn , acting for Tammany Hall under the orders of John C. Sheehan . " Why is Sheehan against you ? " he was asked . " Because I proved that he failed to keep his contracts and that he left Long Island City with work undone , " the big spectacled Mayor replied promptly . " He has never forgiven me for that . But , while he can control the machinery of Tammany Hall and the work'of men like this Finn , he ca n't turn the Tammany vote agin me . " " I asked for $500,000 for public schools . We 'll have 3,000 children without school facilities this year . It takes $1011,000 to provide for a thousand children . I wanted $500,000 because Long Island City grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years there would be need of all we called for . The Legislature was with me on the merits of my case , except the Tammany gang . What best me was the opposition  --  of my own Aldermen . The result is that Long Island City is the only thing on Long Island that has n't had a whack at Greater New York . Everything else on the Island has added to its bonded debt  --  towns , villages , and all . We have added nothing , and we 'll have the pleasure of helping to pay the bills of the rest . " Then the Mayor of Long Island City settled himself beneath the lurid sunset light of his own transparency . He drew his straw hat over his eyes , and with rough words , but kindly expression , dismissed a pretty public school teacher who had asked an official favor and tripped away happy , obviously believing more in the Mayor 's looks than his words .. ? ( After that - he strolled- - down-  to the - barroom at the corner , where a violent row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing eyes , and after edging to and from the storm centre , where beer glasses were beginning to fly , he said sadly ; , " ' Twould n't do . Me inimies would make much of it . Oi cod wade in an ' make monkeys of thim toughs from New York , but twouldn ' t do . " Sadly he telephoned orders for two policemen to stop the row . At the sight of the fight he dropped into a brogue , thick as ever landed at Castle Garden in the old days , but the prudence of the candidate triumphed over the instincts of the Irishman , and the Mayor kept out of the light . " I have ' bargains with nobody , " he said when this incident had passed , " I 'm me own man . Long Island City has lost a million and a half dollars by the work of its Aldermen . The Republicans favored me bills on their merits . I 'm running on me merits . I 'm Pat Gleason , and I 'm right here , candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain by me is rot and lies . Let the man who says so meet me on the stump . "
