txt When the troops reached the agency here they found that the friendly Indians had maintained a picket line covering the whole line of woods which surround the settlement . As many as fifty of the Indians have done picket duty . Now that the troops are on the ground , these formal preparations for defense probably will be abandoned , but there will be Indian scouts out all the time , ready . to bring prompt warning of anything that looks dangerous . Last night , Mah-Ge-Gah-Bow , one of the head men of the Bear Island Indians , arrived on the agency point with twenty-seven canoe loads of the Bear Islanders , comprising those of them who are for peace . There were seventy-five or one hundred in the party , men , women , and children . They went into camp about five miles from the agency , and Mah-Ge-Gah-Bow called on Gen. Bacon at once . He said that he had told the hostiles on the island that he could not go with them ; that he and his friends were , for peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the agency . " All right , " said the hostiles , laconically , " tell them what we are doing , " and they allowed Mah-Ge-Gah-Bow to depart in peace . He said that so far as he knew none of the hostiles was killed in the fight . Esti-. mates of the number of Indians actually on the warpath vary from 25 to 100 . Dr. Hart has prepared a paper which the Indians are being asked to sign as fast as they come into the agency . It is already signed by more than 100 Indians , including a dozen or fifteen of the chiefs and head men . It reads as follows : To the Great Father , Washington : We . the undersigned Chlppewa-Pillager Indians of the Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota , deplore the outbreak of some of our brethren upon this reservation , and believing you desire that justice shall be done in your dealings with us , we have , therefore , resolved In council assembled , to remain loyal to the United States and friendly to our white brethren , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives , the Bear Island Indians , to lay down their arms and Quietly submit to the authorities of the United States .
