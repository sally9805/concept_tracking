OCTOBER , 1897 . No. 6 . THE ROLL OF HONOR OF THE NEW YORK POLICE . BY THEODORE ROOSEVELT . WITH PICTURES BY JAY HAMBIDGE . IT may be true that , inasmuch as a price must always be paid for everything , we pay for peace the price of a certain softening of national and civic fiber which , if carried too far , would be very serious indeed . Nevertheless , in our present highly complicated civilization there are a number of occupations which , even when carried on during a time of profound peace , call for the development in a very high degree of the prime virtues of the soldier-energy , daring , hardihood , discipline , power of command , power of obedience , and marked bodily prowess . Some of these occupations are the ordinary vocations of great classes of people in civilized life . A notable case in point is the profession of railroad-men . Engineers , firemen , brakemen , and train-hands generally , follow an occupation which makes more of a demand upon heart , hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some way with war , which was ever carried on before the present century . The men of the fishing-fleet , the men who follow other hazardous occupations at sea , are the only ones whose business in life implies the acceptance of risk and responsibility , and the exercise of courage and judgment , in the way which is true of almost all work connected with the business of transportation as now conducted . But besides the employments of private business , there are in every large city two departments where men enter the service knowing that part of their duty is to show willingness to face danger , and even death , in the course of their regular work . These are the police and the fire departments . In the two years following May , 1895 , I was President of the New York Police Board , and so , of course , was brought into close contact with the police , and grew to know well their daily life and the emergencies which they have continually to meet . As soon as our Board of Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical changes in the management of the force , and one of these changes was the effort systematically to acknowledge gallantry . We did not have to work a revolution in the force as to courage in the way we had to work a revolution as to honesty . The police force had always been brave and efficient in dealing with rioters and the like ; but by degrees , under the rule of Tammany , it had become very corrupt . Our great work , therefore , was the stamping out of dishonesty ; and so far as the ridiculousbi-partizan lawunderwhich the department was administered would permit , this work was thoroughly done . But we were anxious that while stamping out what was evil in the force , we should keep and improve Copyright , 1897 , by THE CENTURY Co . All rights reserved . // what was good . While warring on dishonesty , we made every effort to increase the efficiency of the force . After all , it is unfortunately true , as has been shown by sad experience , that at times a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet show itself weak in some great crisis , or unable to deal with the more dangerous kinds of criminals . This we were determined to prevent . Our efforts were crowned with entire success . The improvement in the efficiency of the force went hand in hand with the improvement as to honesty . The men in uniform and the men in plain clothes-the detectives - did better work than ever before . The aggregate of crimes where punishment followed the commission of the crime increased , while the aggregate of crimes where the criminal escaped unpunished decreased . Every discredited politician , every sensational newspaper , and every timid fool who could be scared by clamor , was against us . All three classes strove by every means in their power to show that in making the force honest we had impaired its efficiency ; indeed , by their utterances they actually tended to bring about the very condition of things against which they professed to protest . But we went steadily along the path we had marked out . The fight was hard , and there was plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination neither to falter nor to swerve can accomplish a good deal even under the most unfavorable conditions . The result in this case was that in February , 1897 , the judge who charged the grand jury was able to congratulate them on the phenomenal decrease of crime , especially of the violent sort , in New York . This decrease was steady during the two years . The police , after the reform policy had been thoroughly tried , proved more successful than ever before in protecting life and property , and in putting down crime and vice . The part played by the actual personal prowess of the members of the police force , and its recognition by the board , in producing this state of affairs was appreciable , though there were many other factors that combined to bring about the improvement . The immense improvement of discipline by punishing all offenders without mercy , no matter how great their political or personal influence ; the resolute warfare against every kind of criminal who had hitherto been able to purchase protection ; the prompt recognition of ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were elements which had enormous weight in producing the change . Mere courage and daring , and the rewarding of courage and daring , could not supply the lack of discipline , of ability , of honesty ; but they are of vital consequence , nevertheless . No police force is worth anything if its members are not intelligent and honest ; but neither is it worth anything unless its members are brave , hardy , and well disciplined . We showed recognition of daring and personal prowess in two ways : first , by awarding a medal or a certificate in remembrance of the deed ; and , second , by giving it weight in making any promotion , especially to the lower grades . In the higher grades-in all promotions above that of sergeant , for instanceresolute and daring courage can not normally be considered as a factor of determining weight in making promotions ; rather is it a quality the lack of which unfits a man for promotion : for in the higher places we must assume the existence of such a quality in any fit candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's energy , executive capacity , and power of command . In the lower grades , however , marked gallantry should always be taken into account in deciding among different candidates for any given place , and , wherever possible , should be made the determining consideration . During our two years ' service we found it necessary to single out men for special mention , because of some feat of heroism , over a hundred times . The heroism usuallytook one of four forms : saving somebody from drowning , saving somebody from a burning building , stopping a runaway team , or arresting some law-breaker under exceptional circumstances . Of course we occasionally awarded honorable mention for some other reason , such as coolness which averted a panic , or unusual nerve and skill in some arrest of the ordinary kind ; but these instances were rare . The above-mentioned four kinds of gallantry are naturally those in which policemen are most apt to distinguish themselves . Their business is to prevent disorder and to arrest criminals , and now and then a desperate criminal or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets , so that they necessarily observe every runaway , and try to stop it . They are of course present at every fire , and almost invariably before the firemen get there , so that they frequently have a chance to display gallantry in the rescue of life and property before the men of hose and ladder make their appearance . Finally , the river-front of the city is very ex // tensive , and the policemen stationed along it have unusual opportunities to see and rescue people who are drowning . Perhaps the best way to convey an idea of why we awarded medals is to give a list of the men thus rewarded for two months . In October , 1895 , we , on the 1st of the month , awarded a medal to a patrolman for peculiar gallantry in stopping a runaway horse under circumstances which made the act one of great danger to himself , and which doubtless resulted in saving the lives of those in the vehicle . The patrolman thus rewarded was also later made a roundsman , and put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first called to him by this act . On the same day we gave honorable mention , but without a certificate or medal , to three other officers : one had also stopped a runaway horse ; another had rescued a man from drowning ; and the third had arrested an insane man armed with a revolver , under circumstances which went to show that the officer 's coolness and // presence of mind saved both himself and the onlookers from death or injury at the hands of the armed maniac . On the 8th of the month we gave a medal to an officer who had rescued a boy from drowning by plunging into the water between the wharf and the steamer from which the boy fell , at the imminent risk of being crushed to death between the two , a fate from which he and the rescued boy were saved purely by his pluck and his skill as a swimmer . Honorable mention was made of two other officers-one for rescuing a boy from drowning , and one for stopping a runaway horse . On the 15th yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowning ; and on the 22d a sergeant and two patrolmen were commended for the coolness and skill they displayed in stopping a prize-fight and arresting both the participants and the spectators , though they were an uncommonly tough crowd , and showed immediate fight . In February , 1897 , we rewarded five men : two for stopping runaways ; one for arresting a murderer , an ex-convict , who was armed and showed fight ; and two for saving women from burning buildings . Among the first promotions we made were two which illustrated the attitude of the board toward cases of this kind , and which also incidentally illustrated exactly what we mean by ( ( taking the force out of politics ) ) - that is , by administering it on principles of decency , and appointing and promoting men on their merits , without regard to their political backing . The first case was that of an old fellow , a veteran of the Civil War , who was at the time a roundsman . I happened to notice one day that he had saved a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look into the matter . The old fellow brought up his record before me , and showed not a little nervousness and agitation ; for it appeared that he had grown gray in the service , had performed feat after feat of heroism , but had no political backing of any account . He was a Grand Army man , but not one of the ( ( political ) ) type , and so had not received any attention from the former police boards ; and now , at last , he thought there was a chance for him . He had been twenty-two years on the force , and during that time had saved some twenty-five persons from death by drowning , varying the performance once or twice by saving persons from burning buildings . Twice Congress had passed laws especially to empower the then Secretary of the Treasury , John Sherman , to give him a medal for distinguished gallantry in saving life . The Life-Saving Society had also given him its medal , and so had the Police Department . On examining into his record carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any infraction of duty , and that he was sober and trustworthy . We felt that he was entitled to his promotion , and he got it . We did not know his politics , nor did we care about them . It is very unlikely that the woman whom he last saved , as he swam out toward her , felt any special interest as to whether he had voted for Cleveland or Harrison ; nor did we . He had risked his life freely again and again in the performance of his duty ; he had conducted himself so as to be a credit to the department and a credit to the city ; and we felt that he was entitled to his reward . It is worth while mentioning that he kept on saving life after he was promoted to a sergeantcy . On October 21 , 1896 , he again saved a man from drowning . It was at night , nobody else was in the neighborhood , and the slip from which he jumped was in absolute darkness , and he was about ten minutes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the precinct , in reporting the case , said : ( ( The sergeant was off the bulkhead and into the water after his man quicker than it takes to say ( Jack Robinson . ) ) ) There was no way in which the board could reward him for this , except by telling him that he was an honor to the department ; for he had been given all the medals , and bars to the medals , that he could be given . It was the twenty-ninth person whose life he had saved during his twenty-three years ' service in the department , and he was fifty-five years old when he saved him . Can any intelligent and honest man say that we were wrong in rewarding this man ? Yet it was because of our constantly acting in this manner , resolutely warring on dishonesty , and on that peculiar form of baseness which masquerades as ( ( practical ) ) politics , and steadily refusing to pay heed to any consideration except the good of the service and the city , and the merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads the bitter animosity , the malignant hostility , of the bread-and-butter spoils politicians . Through their tools in the legislature they repealed the civil-service law . They attempted to legislate us out of office , and desisted only because at last decent citizens were roused to take action in our favor . They denounced us with a ferocity that became fairly incoherent . They joined // with the baser portion of the sensational press in every species of foul , indecent falsehood and slander as to what we were doing . When all this failed they tried intrigue . But they could not make one of my colleagues , Major Avery D. Andrews , swerve a hand'sbreadth ; and though they finally caused a split in the board , it was , fortunately , not until most of our work was done . They did all this on the plea that we were impractical , hostile to the ( ( organization , ) ) and not good politicians , because , forsooth , we applied in public life the principles of common sense , honor , and morality which any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our term we promoted a patrolman to the grade of roundsman for activity in catching a burglar under rather peculiar circumstances . I happened to note his getting a burglar one week . Apparently he had fallen into the habit , for he got another the next week . In the latter case the burglar escaped from the house soon after midnight , and ran away toward Park Avenue , with the policeman in hot chase . The New York Central Railroad runs under Park Avenue , and there is a succession of openings in the top of the tunnel . Finding that the policeman was gaining on him , the burglar took a desperate chance , and leaped down one of these openings , at the risk of breaking his neck . Now the burglar was running for his liberty , and it was the part of wisdom for him to imperil life or limb ; but the policeman was merely doing his duty , and nobody could have blamed him for not taking the jump . However , he jumped ; and in this particular case the hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the breath knocked out of him , and the ( ( *** ) ) did n't . When his victim could walk the officer trotted him around to the station-house , and a week afterward he himself was promoted , it appearing , upon careful investigation , that he was sober , trustworthy , and strictly attentive to his duty . Here again it seems to me that we followed the eminently common-sense plan of promoting a man who had earned his promotion by faithful and distinguished service , and by proved superior capacity . We cared no more for the policeman 's views on the tariff or the currency than we did for those of the burglar . Our interest , and the interest of citizens generally , was to have the officer catch that burglar and otherwise do his duty . If he did his duty we were for him ; if he did not we were against him ; in neither event did we care whether the officer had or had not the backing of the congressional delegation of the city or the Central Committee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to wild outcries from the local political bosses and heelers , and much sneering at ( ( civil-service reform ) ) ; but all the outcries and sneers meant was that we were doing our duty as decent men and as public officials , with some slight appreciation of what was implied by the words honor and uprightness . Political organizations are eminently necessary and useful ; but when they are seized by professional spoils politicians of low morality , who run the ( ( machine ) ) in their own interests , who clamor against honesty , and defy decency , and rail against that device for obtaining clean government which is known as civil-service reform-then it is time for all citizens who believe in good citizenship to rise in revolt . Two or three cases may be given as examples where the men 's names were put on the roll of honor , but where it was not possible or advisable to promote them . First I will take a couple of instances of gallantry at fires which occurred in January , 1897 . In one case an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a number of people gathered round a fire-box on a street corner , and trying ineffectively to send off an alarm . The officer at once stopped , sent off the alarm , and ran round to where the fire was supposed to be . It was in a tenement-house , and the inmates , with the curious apathy they sometimes show , had declined to take any interest in the fire . The officer dashed up-stairs , and literally drove them all out of their rooms . Once out , they saw that the hallway was filled with smoke , and came down quickly enough of their own accord . But while the officer was hunting through the rooms to see whether any children had been left behind , the flames suddenly burst out , running through the halls and up the staircases . Shielding his eyes , he dashed down one flight of stairs through the flames , leaped the balusters , and rolled down the next flight into the street . He was badly scorched , and the skin was hanging from his hands , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not been for his prompt action there would have been a very serious loss of life in the building . The other case , where the officer did fireman 's work at about the same time , resulted in a rather more definite saving of life . Two policemen saw flames and smoke coming out of a four-story brick building . After sending in an alarm , one of them hastily established // the fire-line to keep the crowd away from the building , and got everything in readiness for the coming of the firemen , while the other was alarming the people within . Almost all of them got out ; but one woman , having run to the window of the second story , disappeared back into the room , and did not emerge . There was no flame in the halls , but they were thick with smoke , as were the rooms . The officer ran up-stairs , holding his breath . When he got on the landing he heard the woman moaning inside , and groped his way in on all fours . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he himself was almost smothered ; but he maw aged to carry her down-stairs before he fell . 808 A RESCUE AT A FIRE . // She speedily came to . The firemen arrived two or three minutes later , and got the fire under control . In November , 1896 , an officer who had previously saved a man from death by drowning added to his record by saving five persons from burning . He was at the time asleep , when he was aroused by a fire in a house a few doors away . Running over the roofs of the adjoining houses until he reached the burning building , he found that on the fourth floor the flames had cut off all exit from an apartment in which there were four women , two of them over fifty , and one of the others with a six-months-old baby . The officer ran down into the adjoining house , broke open the door of the apartment on the same fioor ,  --  the fourth ,  --  and crept out on the coping , less than three inches wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being a large and very powerful and active man , he managed to keep hold of the casing of the window with one hand , and with the other to reach to the window of the apartment where the women and child were . The firemen appeared , and s*tretched a net underneath . The crowd that was looking on suddenly became motionless and silent . Then , one by one , he drew the women out of their window , and holding them tight against the wall , passed them into the other window . The exertion in such an attitude was great , and he strained himself badly ; but he possessed a practical mind , and as soon as the women were saved he began a prompt investigation of the cause of the fire , and arrested two men whose carelessness , as was afterward proved , caused it . A number of cases occurred in which the officers were obliged to use their revolvers in dealing with criminals who used theirs . We promoted one patrolman  --  a man with an already excellent record-for gallantry shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was after a gang of toughs who had just waylaid , robbed , and beaten a man . They scattered , and he pursued the ringleader . Running hard , he gained on his man , whereupon the latter suddenly turned , and fired full in his face . The officer already had his revolver drawn , and the two shots rang out almost together . The policeman was within a fraction of death , for the bullet from his opponent 's pistol went through his helmet , and just broke the skin of his head . His own aim was truer , and the man he was after fell dead , shot through the heart . In May , 1896 , a number of burglaries occurred far up-town , in the neighborhood of 156th street and Union Avenue . Two officers VOL . LIV. - 102. were sent out each night to patrol the streets in plain clothes . About two o'clock on the morning of May 8 , they caught a glimpse of two men loitering about a large corner house , and determined to make them explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one officer went down one street , and one the other . The first officer , whose name was Ryan , found the two men at the gateway of the side entrance of the house , and hailed to know what they were doing . Without answering , they turned and ran toward Prospect Avenue , with Ryan in close pursuit . After running about one hundred feet , one of them turned , and fired three shots at Ryan , but failed to hit him . The two then separated , and the man who had done the shooting escaped . The other man , whose name proved to be O'Connor , again took to his heels , with Ryan still after him ; they turned the corner , and met the other officer , whose name was Reid , running as hard as he could toward the shooting . When O'Connor saw himself cut off by Reid , he fired at his new foe , the bullet cutting Reid 's overcoat on the left shoulder . Reid promptly fired in return , his bullet going into O'Connor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two officers then cared for their prisoner until the ambulance arrived , when he was taken to the hospital , and pronounced mortally wounded . His companion was afterward caught , and they turned out to be the very burglars for whom Reid and Ryan had been on the lookout . In December , 1896 , one of our officers was shot . A row occurred in a restaurant , which ended in two young toughs drawing their revolvers and literally running amuck , shooting two or three men . A policeman , attracted by the noise , ran up , and seized one of them , whereupon the other shot him in the mouth , wounding him badly . Nevertheless , the officer kept his prisoner , and carried him to the station-house . The tough who had done the shooting ran out , and was seized by another officer . He fired at him , the bullet passing through the officer 's overcoat , but he was promptly knocked down , disarmed , and brought to the station-house . In this case neither policeman used his revolver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter was armed and resisted arrest , one of the officers taking in his prisoner after having been himself severely wounded . A lamentable feature of the case was that this same officer was a man who , though capable of great gallantry , was also given to shirk his work , and we were finally obliged to dismiss // him from the force , after passing over two or three glaring misdeeds in view of his record for gallantry . We promoted another man on account of finding out accidentally that he had performed a very notable feat , which he had forborne even to mention , so that his name never came on the roll of honor . Late at night , while patrolling in a lonely part of his post , he came upon three young toughs who had turned highwaymen and were robbing a peddler . He ran in at once with his nightstick , whereupon the toughs showed fight , and one of them struck at him with a bludgeon , breaking his left hand . The officer , however , made such good use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereupon the third ran away , and he brought both of his prisoners to the station-house . Then he went round to the hospital , had his broken hand set in plaster , and actually reported for duty at the next tour , without losing one hour . He was a quiet fellow , with a record free from complaints , and we made him roundsman . The mounted squad have , of course , many opportunities to distinguish themselves in stopping runaways . In May , 1895 , a mounted policeman succeeded in stopping a runaway at Kingsbridge under rather noteworthy circumstances . Two men were driving in a buggy , when the horse stumbled , and in recovering himself broke the head-stall , so that the bridle fell off . The horse was a spirited trotter , and at once ran away at full speed . Heyer saw the occurrence , and followed at a run . When he got alongside the runaway he seized him by the forelock , guided him dexterously over the bridge , preventing him from running into the numerous wagons that were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into a wagon-shed . Three months later this same officer saved a man from drowning . The members of the bicycle squad , which was established soon after we took office , soon grew to show not only extraordinary proficiency on the wheel , but extraordinary daring . They frequently stopped runaways , wheeling alongside of them , grasping the horses while going at full speed ; and , what was even more remarkable , they managed not only to overtake , but to jump into the vehicle and capture , on two or three different occasions , men who were guilty of reckless driving , and who fought violently in resisting arrest . They were picked men , being young and active , and any feat of daring which could be accomplished on the wheel they were certain to accomplish . THE SHOOTING OF BURGLAR 0 CONNOR . // Three of the best riders of the bicycle squad , whose names and records happen to occur to me , were men of the three ethnic strains most strongly represented in the New York police force , being respectively of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Li this particular case of mixed 8cotch and Irish-parentage . The German was a man of enormous power , and he was able to stop each of the many runaways he tackled without losing his wheel . Choosing his time , he would get alongside the horse , and seize the bit in his left hand , keeping his right on the crossbar of the wheel . By degrees he then got the animal under control . He never failed to stop it , and never lost his wheel . He also never failed to overtake any ( ( scorcher , ) ) although many of these were professional riders who deliberately violated the law to // see if they could not get away from him ; for the wheelmen soon get to know the officers whose beats they cross . The Yankee , though a tall , powerful man and a very good rider , scarcely came up to the German in either respect ; he possessed exceptional ability , however , as well as exceptional nerve and coolness , and he won his promotion first . He stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really panic-stricken he usually had to turn his wheel loose , getting a firm grip on the horse 's reins , and then kicking his wheel so that it would fall out of the way of injury from the wagon . On one occasion he had a fight with a drunken and reckless driver who was urging to top speed a very spirited horse . He first got hold of the horse , whereupon the driver lashed both him and the beast , and the animal , already mad with terror , could not be stopped . The officer had of course kicked away his wheel at the beginning , and after being dragged along for some distance he let go the beast , and made a grab at the wagon . The driver hit him with his whip , . but he managed to get in , and after a vigorous tussle overcame his man , and disposed of him by getting him down and sitting on him . This left his hands free for the reins . By degrees he got the horse under control , and drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . " I jounced up and down on him to keep him quiet when he turned ugly , ) ) he remarked to me parenthetically . Having disposed of the wagon , he took the man round to the court , and on the way the latter suddenly sprang on him , and tried to throttle him . Convinced at last that patience had ceased to be a virtue , he quieted his assailant with a smash on the head that took all the fight out of him until he was brought before the judge and fined . Like the other ( ( bicycle cops , * this officer made a number of arrests of criminals , such as thieves , highwaymen , and the like , in addition to his natural prey-scorchers , runaways , and reckless drivers . The third member of the trio , a tall , sinewy man with flaming red hair , which rather added to the terror he inspired in evil-doers , was usually stationed in a rather tough part of the city , where there was a tendency to crimes of violence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer was as good off his wheel as on it , and he speedilyestablished perfect order on his beat , being always willing to ( ( take chances ) ) in getting his man . He was no respecter of persons , and when it became his duty to arrest a wealthy man for persistently refusing to have his carriage-lamps lighted after nightfall , he brought him in with the same indifference that he displayed in arresting a street-corner tough who had thrown a brick at a wheelman . Soon after it came into office the board undertook to train the men in the use of the pistol . A school of pistol practice was established , and the marksmanship of the officers was wonderfully improved in a very short while . The man who was put in charge of the school was a roundsman whom we promoted to sergeant . He was one of the champion revolver shots of the country , and prided himself on being able to hit just where he aimed . Twice he was forced to fire at criminals who resisted arrest , and in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simply stopping him or crippling him , without danger to his life . This same roundsman one Sunday met a volunteer military company returning from a spree , which had included both shooting at a target and heavy drinking . They were very noisy and disorderly , and the roundsman promptly arrested the captain . The company attempted to rescue him , but he held them at bay , brought in his prisoner in triumph , and then sallied out with reinforcements , and brought in all the others . These are only a few cases out of the many on the roll of honor . Wherever we could , we recognized any signal feat of courage which resulted in the saving of life , or which was incidental to the performance of police duty . Besides awarding a medal , we also strove to give more tangible proof of our appreciation where this was possible , either by passing over , so far as we could , an infraction of discipline , or by actual promotion where the man was worthy . In considering promotions to the higher grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical courage or hardihood , although , of course , its lack would have been a conclusive bar to advancement ; for in the higher grades good judgment , power of command , and ability to take and bear responsibility , are needed beyond all other qualities . But in promotion to the lower grades , where there is much less demand upon the higher mental qualities , proof of signal physical courage can often be made a determining factor in a promotion . Of course other qualities must go with courage , and it may often happen that the best man for a position will earn his promotion in spite of the fact that no opportunity is thrown in his way to show his hardihood or physical prowess . An alert , active , hard- // working fellow , evidently possessed of intelligence and resolution , and fit to bear responsibility , can not be held back merely because there has never been a chance for him to distinguish himself at a fire or against a dangerous criminal . Nor can we promote a man given to drink or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie may be . Very frequently careful and patient investigation has shown that some man who had distinguished himself by a brilliant exhibition of personal gallantry on some given occasion was nevertheless unfit for promotion , whether because of lack of steadiness and sobriety , or for some other good reason . I remember one very gallant man whom I would have liked to promote , but who could not keep clear of drink . We overlooked this so far as we could while he was patrolman , because of his occasional per- // formance of deeds of marked excellence ; but it rendered him unfit for promotion . I remember another man whom we promoted , but were forced afterward to reduce . He displayed great courage and address on several different occasions in arresting criminals and saving human life ; but he was not truthful , and he proved a poor disciplinarian , protecting his favorites and wreaking vengeance upon those whom he did not like . In making promotions , therefore , we could not consider courage and personal prowess as conclusive . But we did treat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sober , steady , and orderly as well as daring and energetic , there was no difficulty whatever in giving him his promotion ; and if we found a man to be deficient , even in a very slight degree , in courage , no amount of faithful performance of his ordinary duties could atone for the deficiency . The difficulty came in the mixed cases . A man who was sober , industrious , and intelligent , but who had never had a chance to display heroism , could not be permanently kept back ; and yet in promoting him there was a risk lest he might prove to be deficient in the quality of rising to a serious crisis . On the other hand , if the man had repeatedly shown striking qualities of daring and resource , and yet had been guilty of marked shortcomings , it was a case to be carefully weighed . If , on the whole , the shortcomings were so serious that we could not trust the man , then his promotion had to be denied ; but unless they were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show what he was made of . Generally the result justified our judgment . The responsibility sobered the man , the recognition of his merits made him proud , and he felt bound to justify himself by proving that he was fit to hold the position he had reached . The man with strong virtues and strong failings is always preferable to the bloodless creature with neither . Of course the best men of all are those who have the virtues without the shortcomingswho are resolute , strong , and clear-eyed , without being wild or disorderly . But there is small use indeed in the man whose virtue is merely one of the incidents of a condition of low vitality . A policeman is worth little unless he is honest , temperate , orderly , and cleanly without and within ; but he is worth even less if he does not possess the positive , virile good qualities of hardihood , energy , resolution , and personal daring . I doubt if the average citizen , especially the average stay-at-home citizen , realizes how often the man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier would be called heroic . His feats in saving life or in arresting dangerous criminals , alone and at night , attract no special attention when mentioned in the newspapers ; but they often imply just as much courage as those of the man who captures an enemy 's flag in battle , or plants his own flag on a hostile parapet . The men of the New York police force represent all the different creeds and different race origins that go to the make-up of our stock ; but they all become good Americans who pay no heed to differences of creed and race , for otherwise they would be useless . The police occupy positions of great importance . They not merely preserve order , the first essential of both liberty and civilization , but to a large portion of our population they stand as the embodiment as well as the representative of the law of the land . To the average dweller in a tenement-house district , especially if born abroad , the policeman is in his own person all that there is of government : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting . His power and influence are great . For any vice or shortcoming he should be sternly punished , but for gallantry and good conduct he should receive prompt and generous recognition .
