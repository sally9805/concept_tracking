txt Michael Melvin , a plasterer 's assistant , was accidentally killed Thursday afternoon by falling through a hoistway in the new building of the American Tract Society , now in course of erection at ? Nassau and . Spruce Streets . He left a wife and three young children unprovided for . As this building is being erected by a purely benevolent society , at a cost of over $1,000,000 , in order to make money for the purpose of spreading Christianity through the distribution of tracts , there was naturally some curiosity shown yesterday by those who had read of Melvin 's death to know if the members of this rich corporation had made any move toward assisting the ? unfortunate man 's widow and family , or had been informed as to their needy condition . The Rev. George L. Shearer , Financial Secretary of the American Tract Society , when informed by a reporter for The New-York Times of the conuition of Melvin 's family and asked what assistance the society - would extend to Mrs. Melvin , said : " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Tract Society , but by a contractor , and there is an explicit stipulation in our contract with all contractors that the society shall not be held in any wise responsible for accidents to the workmen . If we were to assume such responsibility we would not be able to put up any building . " " But might not the society stretch a point in a case of this kind and do something for Melvin 's family ? " asked ' the reporter , " or is the society not a benevolent institution ? " " The American Tract Society , " replied Mr. Shearer , " was organized for the purpose of disseminating the Gospel and literature of the Lord Jesus Chrfat by such means as Christians may approve . Another thing about Melvin . He was not killed while at work , but during the noon hour . I can not see why the society should be called upon in such a case . It is presumed that the workmen in the building are protected by proper safeguards . " " How much is the society 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Something over a Million dollars .. There will be a heavy mortgage on it .. The exact estimate is *1,050,000 . The society expected , to occupy the building this month , but the labor . strikes delayed its construction and also prevented us from renting a good deal of it this year . " Melvin 's comrades did not stop to consider whether or not they were legally or morally : responsible . for- his death , . but , - at once thought of doing what they could out of their scanty wages for his widow and children . As a matter of fact , the reason why Mel . vin was at work during ? the noon-hour , was because the-plasterers have the use of the elevator ' Per ' hoisting their materials only during that hour , and consequently go ? to dinner an ho.ur.later than . the workmen engaged on other parts of the building . A piece of galvanized iron pipe , with pieces . roughly soldered . on each end , attracted the attention of those who passed by the huge building yesterday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen to bear the following inscription , roughly lettered with black smudge : O Drop in contributions here in aid or the family of Michael Melvin , ? who was killed on this job , Thursday , May 10 , 1895 . The extemporized collecting box was the conception of Melvin 's comrades , who were themselves the largest contributors , their pay and their needs being taken into consideration . The foremen employed in the building were also prompt to do their share toward Melvin 's unfortunate wife and three little ones . They passed around a subscription paper during the day , and soon had $106 on it in sums of not less than $1 . Mrs. Melvin is lir:Ely to need all the help she can get before long . Her sole support has been cut off near to the time when she expects to become a mother again . Her husband was sober and industrious , well liked by his mates , and a regular member of the Plasterers ' Union . Out of his membership comes $100 , which will about suffice to pay the expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The crowds coming up Nassau Street yesterday afternoon on their way home stopped at the zinc box to read the inscription upon it . Before it had been up half an hour there were several bank notes in it , besides the shower of quarters and half dollars which fell steadily from the sympathetic passers-by . Melvin 's body was taken yesterday afternoon to his late home , 318 East Ninety-ninth Street . Mrs. Melvin was almost prostrated when her husband 's body was carried into the front room on the top floor of the tenement house , and her two children wept bitterly when they saw the crushed form of their father . A reporter for The New-York Times called at the house a few minutes after the arrival of the body . The Melvins occupy three rooms , which are poorly furnished , because the family can not afford anything better . The children are named Fannie and Sarah , and their respective ages are ten and three years , " Mrs. Melvin has n't a cent in the house , " said her sister to the reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to live . No one has been near the house to offer money or any kind of assistance . This is pay night . Melvin got $2.75 a day . " ? Re Favors More Drinking Fountains . Mayor Strong was asked yesterday to lend his aid ' to the : eStablishment of drinking fountains throughout the city . He was called upon by Col. and Mrs. B. F. Watson and Miss H. D. Fellows of the Church Temperance Society , who said that , besides slaking thirst , the fountains would prevent , to a more or less extent , drinking of intoxicating beverages . They said that this city was not as well supplied as many smaller European cities with public drinking fountains . The Mayor said that he was in sympathy with their aims , and would do all he could to further them .
