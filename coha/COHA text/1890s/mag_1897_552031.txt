ITS EDITOR . By George Willis Cooke . THE first attempt in New England at the publication of a popular illustrated magazine devoted to literature in the special sense of that word is worthy of being recalled and studied . That magazine bore the same name as the one in which this paper appears ; and a comparison between them , especially in the matter of illustrations , shows the advance which has been made in sixty years . The first number of the original New England Maga2ine was dated July , 1831 , and was edited and published by Joseph Tinker Buckingham and Edwin 3uckingham , father and son , who were also the editors and publishers of the Boston Daily Courier . The magazine was the special project of the son , but he was assisted by his father , who became the sole editor on the death of the son , in May , 1833 . Joseph T. Buckiugham was one of the 103 most independent and hard-working men who ever edited a Boston newspaper ; and his history is eminently worthy of being retold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember his manly life of integrity and sturdy fidelity to his own convictions ; but the younger members of the community know not of the difficulties which had to be overcome in order to make any kind of publication a success in the days seventy-five years ago . The career of Buckingham is interesting in itself , for it shows what difficulties can be niastered and what success attained by a man of energetic will who is always loyal to his own convictions . Joseph Tinker Buckingham was born in Wiudham , Connecticut , December 21 , 1779 , the youngest in a family of ten children . His father was Nehemiah Tinker , a shoemaker of excellent ability , who carried on a large business . For several years he was the deputy-sheriff and jailer of the county of Windham and a captain in the militia . At the beginning of the Revolution he sold out his business and became the keeper of a tavern . His zeal for the success of the colonies in their struggle for independence was so great that lie spent the whole of his large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His confidence in the good faith of the Continental Congress was such that he even pledged his credit in the same behalf . He died in 1783 , at the age of fortythree ; and his family were left in abject poverty . Joseph was baptized by the name of Buckingham , which was that of his maternal grandmother , at the request of one of his mother 's relatives and JOSEPH T. BUCKINGHAM . // intimate friends . In 1804 the legislature of Massachusetts legalized his name as Joseph Tinker Buckingham . The poverty of his mother was 50 great that she was obliged to allow the selectmen of the town to apprentice Joseph to a farmer . He received the scanty training of a country school , but early developed a passion for reading . On the conclusion of his term of service with the farmer , in March , 1796 , he went to Walpole , N. H. , and entered a printing-office , which he had been desirous of doing for several years . His companions proving disorderly , he went to Greenfield , Mass. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the office of Manning and Loring , the largest book-printers in the town . In a few weeks he entered the office of Thomas and Andrews , then supposed to be the largest printing establishment in America . For the first year he received six dollars a week , and after that seven . He set up every piece of * This picture and those which follow are reproduced from the various volumes of the old New EogloodMagazzoe and are all which appeared in the entire series . type on the " Mathematics " of Profes -- sor Webber of Harvard College ; and in doing so there was scarcely a font of letters in Boston , Worcester , Charlestown and Cambridge which was not laid under contribution , there being no type-foundry at hand to supply deficiencies . In the spring of 1804 Buckingham took charge of the printing business of Thomas and Andrews , and soon after married . In order to increase his income he did work in the hours not occupied by his duties as superintendent of the office . In December , 1805 , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i8mo pages . This publication was continned until July , 1807 , five volumes of four numbers each being issued . 1'Iost of the twenty numbers had a portrait as a frontispiece , of some man attracting attention at the time or who had made his mark in the history of the city or nation ; and among the persons thus honored were Dr. Belkuap , Commodore Preble , General Wayne , Samuel Adams , General Warren , and Dr. Byles . Each of these portraits was accompanied by a biographical sketch written by a personal associate of the subject or by Buckingham himself from facts obtained from those who could give accurate information . Evidently the contributions to this periodical were not paid for and were mostly provided by young men just out of college , who had no other occupation as yet . They are of the desultory character of the writing found in most of the periodicals of that day , display but a small amount of literary merit , and were written to amuse an idle hour rather than with any definite literary purpose . Many selections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggerel kind was inserted . The dramatic criticisms , written by Buckiugham himself , were independent in tone and rather dogmatic in temper . One of these provoked the wrath of the father of Edgar A. Poe , who took ofPAUL REVERE. * // and called at the editor 's house to " chastise his impertinence . " " Both he and his wife , " said Buckingham in writing of this incident at a later period , " were performers of considerable merit , but somewhat vain of their personal accomplishments . " This periodical did not bring the editor and publisher sufficient financial support to pay for paper , printing and engraving . It was the first attempt in Boston , perhaps in the United States , to publish a magazine with a regular series of portraits ; but the public were not ready to give it support . In 1812 two more volumes were published ; and these were followed by four volumes in octavo . The general character of the magazine was the same as before . Among the portraits published was one of William Emerson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father of Ralph Waldo Emerson . In 1809 Buckingham published The Ordeal , devoted to politics , but with the same financial result . Buckingham bought the printing establishment in which he had been 105 employed , but soon failed ; then tried school-keeping , and with even more disastrous results . Again he became the overseer of a printing establishment , and then the publisher of the periodicals edited by Dr. Noah Worcester . In the autumn of 1817 he began the publication of a weekly newspaper called The New England Gala.ry and Masonic Magazine . With the poorest possible mechanical equipment he set out upon this venture , and with little prospect or expectation of success . He had no money , was obliged to procure everything on credit , but in this way secured a font of second-hand type and an old , nearly worthless hand-press . The new paper had several influential patrons , however ; and it secured the cooperation of the Masonic order , which was then prosperous . For several months the editor was Samuel L. Knapp , who was an enthusiastic Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that The New England Galaxy was one of the first independent newspapers published in this country . Its attitude in this respect , not only with relation to poli GATE OF MOUNT AUBURN CEMETERY . THE FIRST " NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE . " // tics but also to religion , was clearly defined in the first number : " For the essays of the manly and temperate politician , whatever doctrines he may adopt , our pages are free and open . We do not demand that his views of the utility of public measures and the conduct of public men should coincide with ours . We believe that men may differ essentially in their opinions of causes and consequences , of character and conduct , of motives and means , and yet be very honest men . By allowing this freedom of discussion , we by no means relinquish our own independence . We claim and shall exercise the same right of judging for ourselves and expressing our thoughts , subject to the same restrictions which we lay upon others . We solicit the cooperation of the statesman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering our paper a vehicle of instruction and information and , consequently , an auxiliary to the cause of human freedom , virtue , and happiness . The same evenhanded justice shall be observed towards all writers on ' subjects connected with the science of divinity . The Roman Catholic may here , if he pleases , advocate the infallibility of the Pope ; the Episcopalian may defend the divine right and uninterrupted succession of his bishops ; the Calvinist may descant upon total depravity and moral inability ; the Trinitarian may establish his orthodoxy , and the Unitarian his liberality . We proclaim an armed neutrality towards every sect of Christians . . . . We wish to see a calm and dispassionate discussion of the causes of difference among those who profess to follow one Lord , to be guided by the same teacher and to be subject to the same law , who have the same hopes and fears and motives , and who have the same common interest to pursue . To us Christianity appears to be a system , not of abstruse principles and metaphysical deductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wit and ingenuity of man , but to his heart and affections-not a calendar of rites and forms , but a manual of reciprocal love and personal purity . " In time the new venture proved a success , and Buckiugham continued as the editor and publisher of this newspaper for eleven years . After a time the sub-title was abandoned , but the paper continued to advocate the interests of the Masonic order . Among the contributors were Mrs. Susanna Rowson , Rev. N. L. Frothingham , Charles Sprague and John Everett . Edward Everett also furnished the paper with a humorous story . Much of the writing in it was of the desultory character which results from anonymity , in connection with inability* of the editor to pay for what he publishes . The editor had occasion to express his sense of obligation to correspondents " who have lightened our task by the production of their hours of leisure or amusement . " Such writing evidently saved him from many an hour of drudgery at his desk , but it gave little evidence of literary merit . Buckingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expressed his opinions without fear or favor . At the end of the first volume of the Galaxy he said : " We have been too much in the habit ( at least , for our own interest ) of calling things by their true and proper names . We have obeyed too implicitly the dictates of truth and independence , and have followed too much the devices and desires of our own heart , without reference to the approbation of the sordid , the mean , the foolish or the wicked in high places . We have left undone all that lION . EDWARD EVERETT . // would have put us in favor with the rich , the proud , aud the powerful . " His criticism of the actors of the day was fearless and independent , sometimes severe , but usually just . Edmund Kean was uot approved fully by him , and he gave the preference to Thomas A. Cooper . He attacked severely several religious sensationalists of the day ; and he used no conipromise with the system of religious begging carried on by various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came under his condemnation , his lecture was said to be made up of " the most trivial circumstances , " and his " ostentatious display of egotism and self conceit " was disapproved . He attacked the law which permitted imprisonment for debt , and the agitation he started resulted in its abolition . His plain dealing with those with whom he did not agree , however , a n d especially those who used the public for their own benefit , resulted in several suits for libel , which cost much of time and annoyance , but without any more severe punishment . In politics the Galaxy did not commit itself to either of the political parties of the day ; but it was opposed to John Quincy Adams ,  - -  which Buckingham lived to regret , and to make atonement for as best he could . The winter of 1826-27 was spent by him in Washington , as the correspondent of his journal , and he wrote freely of public men and events . In the autumn of 1828 the Galaxy was sold to Willard Phillips and Theophi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of his attention to the Boston Courier , a daily newspaper , the publication of which he had begun with the opening of the year 1824 . When the Courier began its career there were only one or two other daily newspapers published in Boston , the Advertiser being the earliest of these , having been started in 1813 . Buckingham 's purpose in starting a daily newspaper was to provide an organ of the " American system , " and its immediate object was to obtain from Congress the enactment of a protective tariff . The merchants a n d manufacturers of Boston who believed in this method of encouraging the industries of the country , came to the support of the paper , and it started out prosperously , on the second of March . In politics it was proposed to make the paper entirely independent , though the editor leaned in his sympathies towards the Fedetalist party . " The prominent feature intended to be exhibited in the character of the Courier , " says Mr. Buckingham in his autobiography , " was uncompromising adherence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , namely , protection to infant manufactures of cotton and woolen cloths , and to all agricultural , mechanical , and manufacturing products , against foreign competition ; in short , to uphold and advocate all measures that could tend to develop the natural resources of the country and to encourage and support the 1IATTHEW CAREY . // operations of American labor , ingennity and industry . To effect this object was the constant and almost daily task of the editor and his correspondents . " When the Courier set out on its career there was not another newspaper in Massachusetts which advocated protection ; and there were only three or four in the whole conntry . Among the chief supporters of the new jonrnal and its principles was Daniel Webster , who helped to furnish the funds necessary to its establishment . Dnring the first year of its existence the Courier was opposed to the election of John Qnincy Adams to the presidency , and favored that of Henry Clay . It brought forward the name of Edward Everett as a candidate for representative in Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto , Buckingham was a strong fighter , opposing with uncompromising energy what he believed was wrong . He fought the anti-masonic movement , and he opposed a fast which Congress proposed should be held in view of the prevalence of the cholera , in 1832 . The affairs of the United States bank received much attention in 1836 ; Buckiugham was strongly opposed to its operation . The Courier was especially the champion of Daniel Webster , proposing him for the presidency and defending his interests in season and out of season . His support of " protection to domestic industry " made him the hero of the editor , and he was admired on personal grounds . In his autobiography , l3uckingham says : " I would have travelled from Dan to Beersheba to make him President . " In the Courier much attention was given to other interests than those of politics ; and many literary communications of value appeared in its columns . Among its contributors were Rev. N. L. Frothingham , William VVT . Story , Charles Sprague , and S. C. Goodrich , who furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Russell Lowell 's " The Present Crisis , " and " On the Capture of Certain Fugitive Slaves near Washington . " In prose much attention was also given to literary interests , and many articles of value appeared . When the Whig party nominated Zachary Taylor for the presidency , in June , 1848 , Buckingham sold the Courier , and retired from the editorial profession . He felt that Webster had been sacrificed to expediency , he had no admiration for Taylor , and he was not able to continue his advocacy of the interests of the Whig party . In terminating his connection with the paper he wrote : " My relations to the public , as the editor of this and another paper , have existed more than thirty years , and have occupied the most active and vigorous portion of my life . Circumstances render it expedient , and even a duty , that I should retire , and seek some other path in which to close the career of life . Without sacrificing my own personal integrity to the views of others , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor and independence , I could not retain my position . . . . H*d I been less liberal in the avowal of personal opinions , more flexible in temper , and more submissive to individual or party dictation , I might now withdraw from public notice with more WILLIAM GOODRIcH. // a period of life when new pursuits and further attempts to obtain independence by intellectual or physical exertion would be equally unavailing ; but I make no complaints . In my comments on public measures , and on the conduct and characters of public men , there is but little I would cancel or retract . " Buckingham was in the lower house of the Massachusetts legislature from Boston for the year 1828 , and for three terms from 1831 to 1833 . Then he removed to Cambridge as a place of residence , and was elected to the lower house in 1836 , and again in 1838 and 1839 . He was elected to the Massachusetts senate for the county of Middlesex for four terms , from 1847 to i8*i . He was an active member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many valuable reports during his years of legislative service . He labored for the suppression of lotteries and slavery , and he did what he could to further the interests of agriculture . In i8io Buckingham became a member of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics ' Association , and was for five years its secretary , three years a trustee , two years vice-president and three years president . Of the Bunker Hill Monument Association he was JACOB KUHN. 109 the first vice-president , holding that office for three years , and then was president for ten successive years . During his term of service the funds for the erection of the monument were procured and that structure was completed . Of the Middlesex Agricultural Society he was three years the vice-president and two the president ; and he gave the anniversary address before it in 1845 . He gave addresses on variou s other occasions connected with the societies of which he was a member , and all were marked by sound judgment and practical common sense . During his career as an editor and publisher Buckingham compiled several books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a volume of " Miscellanies selected from the Public Journals , " which he published in 1822 , and which consisted of a variety of prose and verse from a wide range of newspapers and other periodicals . A similar volume , in verse , was issued in 1834 , under the title of " The Rosary . " In 1844 he published , through James Munroe , a book of " Devotional Exercises for Schools and Families , " which was carefully and judiciously edited . His " Specimens of Newspaper Literature , with Personal Memoirs , Anecdotes , and Reminiscences , " two volumes , which appeared in Boston in 1850 , consisted of a series of articles on the early newspapers and other publications of the United States . It is a work of much value , and has a genuine antiquarian interest . This was succeeded , in 1852 , by his " Personal Memoirs and Recollections of Editorial Life , " in two volumes , published *n Boston by Tjcknor , Reed and Fields . This work is not so much a biography as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston . It contains extended sketches of all his associates and liberal extracts from his editorial and other writings . His last volume , which appeared in 1853 , was the " Annals of the Massachusetts Chari THE FIRST " NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE . " // table Mechanics ' Association . " Buckingham died at his home in Cambridge , April ii , i86i . As already stated , the New England Maga2ine was projected by Edwin Buckingham , who was born in Boston , June 26 , i8io . He left the English High School , in 1824 , to enter the office of the New England Gala y as an apprentice , where he became a skillful compositor , and was entrusted with the general arrangement of the mechanical details of that paper . In 1828 he became an assistant of his father in the business and editorial departments of the Courier . Then he spent two years in Washington , reporting the proceedings of Congress for the Courier and one or two other newspapers . In September , 1830 , he made a tour of the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this time consumption showed itself , but he passed the winter in Washington . In October , 1832 , he went on a small brig to Smyrna , in search of health ; but on his arrival , the disease had progressed so far that he despaired of recovery , and started for home on the return trip of the brig . He died five days before the arrival of the vessel in Boston , at the age of twenty-two . After the return of Edwin Buckingham from his western tour , in April , 1831 , he made preparations for publishing a magazine . The father gave the following account of the purposes had in view in entering upon this undertaking : " In projecting the work the idea of making money was no part of the consideration . The elder of the editors had previously had sufficient experience in the publication of **27;247;TOOLONG him to feel how uncertain and delusive are all calculations of that sort . The other was just passing that point in age where the law sets up a distinction between the man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a pecuniary independence that should correspond in some measure to the fearless moral and intellectual independence which had , from the days of childhood , been an imposing and distinctive trait in his character . He had already , for several years , been co-editor of a daily newspaper ; but for him something more was needed as a field for improvement in the pleasanter departments of literature , for the cultivation of a better taste , and for the development of faculties that have no kindred with the noise and bustle of trade and the turbulence of politics . Such was the origin of this magazine . No promises were made , to win the favor of the public , except that it should be continued for one year , in order that none who contracted to receive it for that period should be disappointed . " As soon as Edwin Buckingham had decided upon the publication of a literary magazine , he sought the assistance of several popular writers . Among these were Edward Everett , Richard Hildreth , George S. Hillard , Hannah F. Gould , Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reading public of that day . The contributors whose names will now attract most attention were then but little or not at all known ; and among these were Henry W. Longfellow , John G. Whittier , Samuel G. Howe , and 0 . W. Holmes . From the outset of the magazine paid for its contributions , one dollar a page for prose and two dollars for poetry . JAMES THACHER M D // The subscription price of the magazine per year was five dollars . The prospectus , which accompanied the first number , said : " The readers of the New England Magazine will perceive that it is arranged on a plan somewhat different from that of any periodical work now published in the United States . It does not , consequently , assume to be a rival to any existing publication . It is intended to occupy a station in the ranks of American periodicals which seemed to he vacant , and to ask for no other portion of the popular favor than it may be thought to deserve , independent of all its contemporaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we entertain hopes , that , as the New England Magazine shall increase in age , it may go on from strength to strength till it shall attain a vigorous manhood . Gentlemen of education and talent , some who have already enjoyed the voluntary approbation of the public , in its fullest fruition , have engaged to become contrihutors . On the fulfilment of these engagements we place the most perfect reliance , and such fulfilment will enable us to select for future n u m b e r s from a much more copious supp 1 y o f materials . Contributions of original papers are solicited-not gratuitously-for we mean to publish none but those for which we pay ; and , of course , while we open our hand to receive , on such terms , we shall feel no hesitation in rejecting whatever we may deem unsuitable to our purpose . " The first number , dated July , 1831 , opened with a paper bearing the title , " On the Consideration Due to the Mecbanical Arts , " by Rev. N. L. Frothingham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Schoolmaster , Chap . I , " without any signature , but written by H. W. Longfellow . Following two more papers was one by Samuel G. Howe , with the title : " From the MSS. of a Traveller in the East . No. i . A Death and Burial . " This was succeeded by a short paper from the pen of Edward Everett , " The Progress of Exaggeration . " Half a dozen other articles followed . As none of the articles were signed , there is now no clue to their writers , except in those instances where the elder Buckingham made them known in his " Personal Memoirs . " The magazine concluded with a " Monthly Record , " under the several beads of politics and statistics , literary notices , miscellanies , ordinations , installations , etc. , deaths , literary intelligence . In the second number appeared the second paper by Samuel G. Howe , a lecture on the French Revolution by Alexander H. Everett , " Curiosity Baffled " by Edward Everett , and the first of a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special subject being " Fitz-Greene Halleck . " In the third number Howe 's article was entitled " A Modern Greek , " the second part of Longfellow 's serial appeared , Richard Hildreth began a series of sketches called " The Limping Philosopher , " a series of ornithological papers on " Our Birds " by Samuel Kettell , was begun , and there was a poem , " To an Insect , " with these letters following it , " 0 . W. H. " As that poem now appears on one of the first pages of the complete works of Oliver Wendell Holmes , we have the clue to the authorship of numerous contributions with the same signature . DANIEL WEBSTER . // The articles by Dr. Samuel G. Howe were among the most interesting which appeared in the magazine . They were vivid and picturesque sketches of his own adventures in Greece , and were continued to the number of five or six . Numerous extracts from them may be found in Mr. F. B. Sanborn 's biography of Dr. Howe . The sketches by Longfellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traditions which there came to his knowledge . In the second number he translated an ancient song of Normandy , which is as old as the fourteenth century . " THE CIDER OF NORMANDY . " At us the Southern Frenchman laughs , But , whatsoever sayeth he , Verily the cider of Normandie Is better than the wine he quaffs . Down , down ; and rest , rest ! How it strengthens throat and hreast ! " Thy own merits , golden liquor ! Still to drink thee do invite me Yet , I prithee , to requite me , Fuddle not my hrains the quicker . Down , down ; and rest , rest ! How it strengthens throat and breast ! " Neighbor ! from all law-suits flee , Take the goods the gods present ; Man should always be content For alway enough bath he . Down , down ; and rest , rest ! How it strengthens throat and breast ! " In the third of these sketches appear descriptions of a wedding and a funeral in the village of Autenil . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Place may be found here for the account of the wedding , as it is the better of the two . " I was one morning called to my window by the sound of rustic music . I looked out , and beheld a procession of villagers advancing along the road , attired in gay dresses and marching merrily on in the direction of a church . I soon perceived that it was a marriage festival . The procession was headed by a long ourang-outang of a man in a straw hat and white bob-coat , playing an asthmatic clarionet , from which he contrived to blow unearthly sounds , ever and anon squeaking off at right angles from his tune , and winding up in full jubilee with a flourish on the guttural notes . Behind him , led by his little boy , came the blind fiddler , his honest features glowing with all the hilarity of a rustic bridal , and , as he stumbled along , sawing away upon his fiddle till he made all crack again . Then came the happy bridegroom , dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his buttonhole , and close beside him his blushing bride , with downcast eyes , clad in white robe and slippers and wearing a wreath of white roses in her hair . The friends and relations brought up the procession ; and a troop of village urchins came shouting along in the rear , scrambling among themselves for the largess of sons and sugar-plums , that now and then issued in large handfuls from the pockets of a lean man in black who seemed to officiate as master of ceremonies on the occasion . I gazed on the procession till it was out of sight ; and when the last wheeze of the clarionet died upon my ear , I could not help thinking how happy were they , who were thus to dwell together in the peaceful bosom of their native village , far from the gilded misery and the pestilential vices of the town . " To this magazine Dr. Holmes contributed seven poems and six prose articles . Of the poems , " To an Insect , " " My Aunt , " " Ugly Reflections " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comet " may be found in his complete poems . In the eighth number of the magazine , for March , 1832 , appeared a poem which has not been reprinted , and which will be given here : " THE DESTROYERS . " Sow thick thy fiowerets , gentle Spring ! The soil is ghastly bare , And pour from every balmy leaf Thy sweetness on the air ; Ay , wrap the hills and vales in green , Waste all thy perfumed breath , The mould is black with crumbling shapes , The winds are damp with death . " Soft as a kiss on lady 's cheek , The ripples touch the shore ; To-morrow , and the strangling shriek Shall swell the billow 's roar . And many an eye that maiden loves The rolling wave shall close , And lips that children weep to hear Lie sealed in long repose . " The scorching sunbeam sears the field That gleamed with Autumn 's gold , And dying mothers bare their breasts To babes whose lips are cold . By night the livid Plague went by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smothering cry ? Why screams the carrion bird ? // " And , thou , the parent and the tomb , That rocks and shrouds us all , Whose bosom warms our growing limbs And veils them when they fall ,  - -  Beneath the bounding foot of life Heaves up thy bursting soil , And Pleasure 's wreath is rank and green , Gorged with thy loathsome spoil . " The eagle sits upon his cliff , And watches for the dead ; The worm is coiled beneath the sod , The slumberer 's dreamless bed ; The shark is swimming in the wakeNone , none shall lose his claim ; Four hands have spread the banquet boardEarth , Ocean , Air , and Flame ! " lit is not difficult to understand why this poem was not reprinted , its unlikeness to Dr. Holmes ' accredited work being a sufficient reason , though it has merit enough to give reputation to a budding poetaster . After reading these lines one can not be surprised that Dr. Holmes ' patients were not contented to have his name appear in the magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the following , which appeared in the number for July , 1833 : " Six VERSES . " I loved her , but there came a blight , That seared my brain and chilled my heart ; I love her , yet I do not grieve That we are far apart . And still Ihope , before I die , To look into her clear blue eye . " I could not meet her in the place Where once in better hours we met , And look unaltered in her face , Fresh in its beauty yet ; - Nor speak unmoved the once loved name , Now burning with the brand of shame . " The livid waves are murmtiring low , The lightning sleeps in yonder cloud ; But soon the rushing winds shall blow , And thunders rattle loud . 0 , then , upon the shivering sea , I would I were alone with thee . " Alone with thee  --  but sea and air Should raise around the dirge of sin , And Memory 's mocking lip lay bare Her poisoned fangs within ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast . " Then shouldst thou see how sleepless we Can scourge the lazy steps of time , And hear , in accents calm and low , The tale of buried crime . Thou , who my earliest love didst share With me should die-like me despair . " Yet when the walled and tottering waves Hung o'er us in their arching sweep , If I could hear one word of grief , For wrongs so dark and deep , Though fiends had in thy bosom slept , I could but weep as once I wept . " Of a much better kind and quality were some lines which appeared in a prose article called " A Week of Frailty , " which also contained the verses which have reappeared as " L'Inconnue . " The following seem to be quite as good : " Hast thou a look for me , love ? A glance is lightly given ; Though small the cost to thee , love , To me it may be heaven . " Hast thou a smile for me , dear ? One smile may chain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Love 's first page turns over . " Hast thou a word for me , love ? Why , not a soul is near thee ; And there is none that will betray , And only one to hear thee . " Hast thou a kiss for me , dear ? O spoil it not by keeping ; For cheeks will fade , and hearts grow cold , While youth and joy are sleeping . " Of the six prose articles , the first has just been mentioned ; and other titles were " Old Books . " " The D&amp; but , " and " May and October . " From " The Debut " this paragraph may be taken , as indicating that some of the author 's characteristics were already in the process of development : " I may be a serious man ; I trust I am not an ill-natured one . But there are things that curdle the milk of human kindness in the bosom , where it flowed most freely . I had rather be chained to the rock of Prometheus , and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecked at by the hooting owl , and have my blood sucked out in drops by the fluttering bat . Tear the captive into fragments with wild horsesit is but a gasp of agony , and soul and sense dissolve ; but strain him slowly on the rack , let him feel the sinew bursting , and the bone cracking ; this is the poetry of torment . " // The following sketch from the same article , indicates Dr. Holmes in the process of finding that literary method which he exemplified so perfectly in later years : " I stood alone in a corner , while the floor trembled beneath me to the sound of music and the step of dancers . A little circle of young gentlemen were talking in an earnest and mysterious kind of way , at a little distance from me ; and fromtheir occasional and anxiously careless glances at me , or it may be from that subtle instinct which everybody feels and nobody can account for , I believed myself the subject of their observations . At last , one of them came towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an affable and easy air , which put my embarrassment to the blush . I have longed for the pleasure of your acquaintance for some time , ' he said , and I must make it even in this felonious manlier , while I have the opportunity . ' So gracious a beginning might have excused a heavier offence-indeed , it completely threw me off my guard , and my heart swelled while he proceeded : I am so familiar with the productions of your pen , that I almost feel as if I knew the author . I hardly know whether I have been most pleased with your comic or your serious efforts . I piqued myself vastly in detecting your hand in those capital verses , beginning : " My father 's horse was black and white , My grandam 's cat was gray- " ' I was unconscious of ever having made any such verses , but as it would have been awkward to disclaim them , I bowed as if in acknowledgment of the tribute paid to my supposed offspring and myself . ( Within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but six stanzas of doggerel , beginning with those accursed lines , and my name at the head of them ! ) In the meantime he went on in such expressions of kindness and respect for me and my talents , that I could not resist the temptation , and out came something I had resolved never to say anything about until the world had seen it in print , and the public voice should be clamorous for its unknown author . Just as I began , he begged me to seat myself , which , as I was tired of standing , I was very glad to do . He took a fan from the edge of a sofa and began exercising it first for himself , then back and forward between us , and then for my exclusive benefit . I had warmed from elocution into declamation , and was rising from the declamation into gesticulation-when the music suddenly ceased  --  the cotillons deserted their stations , and all eyes turned , and all ears listened to the simpleton spouting to the jackanapes that stood fanning him as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first volume , fifth number , of the magazine , was printed an article by Dr. Holmes , bearing the title : " The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table . " It began in this wise : " The aim of the warrior 's ambition is to govern ; of the philosopher 's , to dogmatize . The first has accomplished his object when his power is undisputed ; the second when his opinions are held sacred . I trust my opinions are held sacred at the breakfast table of my respected landlady , who has requested me to save her the expense of an advertisement , by stating in this place that she will be happy to accommodate two more boarders on reasonable terms . That it has cost me some pains to accomplish this mental infallibility , I do not deny . I have axvarded the name of cherub to two infants respectively , neither of whose outward features were laudable , and one of whom was almost a lusus . I have looked unmoved upon the plate of smoking rolls , which has now and then breathed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laminre around it , like love in a desert , under the false pretext of dyspepsia , always remembering to give my stomach a little something in private to atone for the insulting imputation . I have sacrificed my personal vanity to my effective weight of character , as men clip the feathers of a game-cock to fit him for action . All this and much more have I done , and in this manner I have gained the enviable privilege of asserting without contradiction and deciding withoub argument . In cutting out my extracts from the columns of domestic life , I may perhaps now and then include a little irrelevant matter , as one sometimes finds , in a lady 's scrapbook , the poet 's font and the grocer 's advertisement included in the same incision . " Such was the beginning ; and a few paragraphs may be given of what followed : - " Every individual character is a centre , determined by converging attributes . If it were not for a troublesome and thankless office to scrutinize a man 's nature too nicely , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few tests like the following , before admitting him into society : Kick him , to see if he will show fight . Request the immediate loan of seven and sixpence . Tell him his talents are rather of the solid than the brilliant order . Observe that externals are of little consequence , with evident allusion to his personal appearance . Talk him down in the presence of several young ladies . " // " Once on a time , a notion was started , that if all the people in the world would shout at once , it might be heard in the moon . So the projectors agreed it should be done in just ten years . Some thousand shiploads of chronometers were distributed to the selectmen and other great folks of all the different nations . For a year beforehand , nothing else was talked about but the awful noise that was to be made on the great occ-asion . When the time came everybody had their ears so wide open to hear the universal ejaculation of Boo-the word agreed upon-that nobody spoke , except a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman in Pekin , so that the world was never so still since the creation . " " My forte in literary matters rests chiefly in prose and poetry . These two pleasing verses were made while sailing up the Dela-ware : TO A LADY WITH HER BACK TO ME . I know thy face is fresh and bright , Thou angel-molded girl ; I caught one glimpse of purest white , I saw one auburn curl . 0 , would the whispering ripples breathe The thoughts that vainly strive . She turns-she turns to look at me ; Black ! cross-eyed ! seventy-five ! ' " How much easier it is to be witty on some old , hackneyed subjects , than to find out the ridiculous for one 's self . If I had been a married man , regard for my personal safety would have saved the world two epigrams . TO FAME . They say thou hast a hundred tongues ; My wife has only one ; If she had been equipped like thee , 0 , what should I have done ! ' THE ECHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife has worn the Echo out . ' " " The mind of a bigot is like the pupil of the eye ; the more light you pour upon it , the closer it contracts . I do not mean to call this a good simile , and , for aught I can say , it may be an old one ; but , if new , it was very respectable for one to say in a dream , although it may not be worth repeating when awake . " " I generally subscribe my initials to my little printed follies , because the few friends who recognize them will be very ready to forgive , and what is much more , perhaps to read the trifles which go with them . To others , the name they half conceal is nothing , for it has neither rung through the trumpet of fame , nor whistled through the catcall of notoriety . " In the February number of the next year a second part to " The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table " was printed . It was an improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . No third part appeared ; but when The Atlantic Monthly was projected and Holmes was urged to contribute , these two papers were thought of by him , the title was revived , and the general style of writing was renewed . There was greater wisdom , a sounder philosophy , a sharper wit , and a better literary method , in the new Autocrat ; but the two differed as a young man differs from one who has reached the maturity of his powers . Among the later contributors to the New England Magazine were James G. Percival , Frederic H. Hedge , Henry T. Tuckerman , R. C. Waterston , Mrs. L. H. Sigourney , William E. Channing , the younger , Charles Sprague , John G. Whittier and Nathaniel Hawthorne . Whittier 's first article was the " Passaconaway , " whiCh is printed in the " Tales and Sketches " of his prose works and is a story of the early settlement of Haverhill . In later volumes appeared " New England Superstitions , " " The Proselytes , " and several other contributions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was published " Mogg Megone . " In the eighth volume appeared Hawthorne 's first contribution , which was printed in the number for January , 1835 . It was the story called " The Gray Champion , " and was reprinted in the first volume of " Twice-told Tales . " It was printed as " by the Author of The Gentle Boy , " while all his later contributions to the magazine were announced as " by the author of The Gray Champion . " The other contributions by Hawthorne , which appeared nearly every month during 1835 , were " My Visit to Niagara , " " Young Goodman Brown , " " Wakefield , " " The Ambitious Guest , " " A Rill from the Town Pump , " " The Old Maid in the Winding-sheet , " and " 5 // " The Vision of the Fountain . " All these sketches and stories may be found in " Twice-told Tales " and " Mosses from an Old Manse . " At the opening of the second year of the magazine the editors said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization of our hopes , have not disappointed our expectations . " They announced that the circulation had steadily increased , and that they were encouraged to enter upon another year . They also said : " It was originally intended to embellish the magazine with a series of portraits . This intention it has been impossible to fulfil . There is some difficulty in procuring original likenesses , and more in obtaining correct copies of originals . The fastidiousness of individuals in two or three instances has frustrated the designs . But , with all these discouragements , the design will not be abandoned . We make no promises , the fulfilment of which depends upon the whims and caprices of others . Areliance on our own resources is the basis of any pledge we may offer to the public . " Evidently there were many difficulties in the way of illustrating a magazine in those days , the present methods being as yet almost wholly a thing of the future . It was not until the sixteenth number , October , 1832 , that the first portrait appeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life , the article being the second in a series on " Early American Artists and Mechanics . " Other portraits were published , and a sketch of the entrance to Mount Auburn cemetery , all of which are reproduced in connection with this paper . It is hard to determine what principle governed the selection of the portraits . Several of the faces which appear are of men now entirely forgotten and who could not at the time have had notable prominence . With the number for December , 1834 , Buckiugham 's connection with the New England Magazine came to an end . The urgency of his other duties was doubtless the cause of this action . He had continued it because it was the pet project of his son , even though he was not able to give it an undivided interest . " With this number , " he wrote , " which completes the seventh volume , our connection with the New England Magazine , ' as editor and proprietor , is dissolved . The work passes into the hands of Dr. Samuel G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue the publication . These gentlemen have been contributors to the pages of the magazine from its commencement , and are known to the public as writers of ability and taste . Their interest and their reputation are sufficient pledges that any claim it may have to public favor and support , will not be lost or forfeited by the change that is about to take place . " The magazine went on very much as before , but with the addition of several new writers . In the first number under the new management Dr. Howe had a notable article on " Atheism in New England , " and George S. Hilliard wrote of " Mr. Greenough 's new Group of Statuary . " Among the other contributors were John Neal , James G. Percival , Frederic H. Hedge and Park Benjamin . In this number , also , appeared Hawthorne 's story called " The Gray Champion . " The most important result of the change in management was the introduction of Hawthorne to the readers of the magazine . At the end of the first volume under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The remuneration which we have been enabled to extend is not , we are deeply conscious , commensurate with your deserts ; but the terms of one dollar by the page of prose , and double the sum for poetry , is all that the magazine can afford ; and though lamentable the confession , we must own that , even with these rates , not one solitary penny is left to reward the editorial labor at the close of the year . With the extension of our subscription list , your compensation shall be increased , to twoyes , three dollars the page ; and even then we could wish it were more . We will look // for our own reward in the consciousness of having done something to encourage American literature . " We can not be surprised , however , that the editors did not remain at their post for a long period . Whatever their love for American literature , the gratuitous editino- of a magazine was sure to have its legitimate effect . They soon put the editorial work into the hands of Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine . It is not remarkable , however , that in a few months more the magazine came to an end , as a separate publication . In his statement to his readers in the last number , December , 1835 , Mr. Benjamin said : " It has represented , froni month to month , to its readers the best papers from writers who were generously content with a very inadequate remuneration . . . . Could the American publishers afford , like the English , to pay handsomely for articles , we should soon secure journals assuming a different character , and vieing successfully with the best transatlantic productions . As the case stands , it is unfair to make comparisons between the great literature of Great Britain and the United States . There are few educated men in this country who can yield themselves to the pursuits of literature and the liberal studies . With the exception of those whom fortune has placed beyond the necessity of exertion , there are no authors by profession . The efforts of American writers are , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time devoted to their regular business . When a poor man has attempted to live by authorship , he has been compelled to seek a resource from poverty as an instructor , or a lecturer , or in some such mind-wearing employment . I believe , however , that we shall see better days . . . . This magazine will hereafter be conducted under better auspices . It will , on the first of January , be united with another work of a similar kind , in New York , and be styled in future The American Monthly Magazine . ' I shall enjoy the inestimable privilege of being connected in the editorial duties , with gentlemen of talent and experience . . It is not my purpose to follow the fortunes of the new magazine , or of its editors , Charles Fenno Hoffman and Park Benjamin . It is enough to say that the New England Magasine , was an admirable publication of its kind , and that it was conducted in awenterprising and able manner . In view of the circumstances of its publication , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best writing . Many of the articles it published would do credit to any magazine of to-day . It encouraged the first efforts of several men who have become known to all readers of books . There was a feeble character to much it published , however , which was the inevitable result of the inability of the editors to pay for first class writing . In reality , the old New England Magasine was a worthy predecessor of the Atlantic , the Century , and Harper 's . If it did not reach the same high standard , it was because there was not yet developed a reading public ready to sustain it . This early New England Aifagazine differs from the present one more in the absence of the numercus illustrations than in its literary qualities . Its purpose was distinctly literary , however , though adding various features corresponding to those especially cultivated in the present magazine . Such a study as I have tried to make of this early magazine is of value in showing us how far we have advanced . When we compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century with this early publication , we get a realizing sense of the vast improvements made in the methods of printing and publishing , the gigantic strides made in the art of illustration , and the remarkable growth in the number of the reading public . What the public schools have done it is impossible to comprehend except by means of some such concrete proof of their widening of the circle of those who delight in good reading . Park Benjamin 's prediction of a better future for American literature has been realized in a degree which he could not have anticipated .
