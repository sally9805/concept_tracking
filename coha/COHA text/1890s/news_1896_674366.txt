txt Mortimer Hendricks of New York City to-day made an application to Attorney General Hancock asking him to commence a suit against the Directors of the Manhattan Railway Company . The objects of the suit will be to compel the Directors to pay back- to the railway company the amount of money paid to the stockholders as dividends in Excess of surplus profits , remove them from office , and restrain their successors from paying dividends in excess of the profits of the corporation . In his application Mr. Hendricks sets forth that he is a bondholder of the company , and that during the year ended June 30 , 1895 , the company paid $1,800,000 dividends , which was $277,951 in excess of their surplus profits , and that during the year ended June 30 , 1896 , the company paid the same amount of dividends , which was $681,902 in excess of the surplus profits . He . says that since June 30 , 1896 , the Directors declared a quarterly dividend amounting to $450,000 , although the net income was only $147,000 . The earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been sufficient during the last two years to pay the expenses of operating the road , its fixed charges , and the dividends cn the stock by about $1,020,000 . This excess has , he claims , been paid out of loans made by the corporation , and that thus a. debt was created amounting to over $1,000,000 . The application more particularly sets forth that by the stock-corporation law the Directors of a stock corporation shall not declare dividends except from the surplus profits of the corporation , and any violation of this renders the Directors personally liable for the full amount so illegally paid as dividends . He then shows that the company has a capital stock of $30,000,000 . Their report upon this basis for the year 1895 shows that they paid to the stockholders in dividends $1,800,000 , and that the net income of the corporation for the same time was $1,522,048.01 . This left a deficit Of $277,951,99 . This deficit , the report said , was paid out of the surplus profits . " But , " says the application , " the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits from which to make said payments of dividends . " The same process , according to Mr. Hendricks , was repeated for the year ending JUne 30. 1896 ; $1,800,000 were again paid out as dividends , while the net income was $1,11S,097.35 . The deficit this year was $681 , - 902.65 . The method by Which this was done , the aplication alleges , appears from the said reports of 1895 and 1896 . On the general balance sheets of said reports , the surplus profits are made to appear by-deducting the liabilities for the assets , the excess ? of assets , as they appear on the books of said company , being the surplus . In each year the " cost of road " and the " cost of equipment " make the largest item of assets charged against said company . For the year 1895 the items are : cast of road , $52 , - 085,338.93 ; cost of equipment , $4.499,990 . For the year 1896 the items are : Cost of road , $53,392,181.71 ; cost of equipment , $4 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of road , " are " legal expenses , " which in the years 1895 and 1896 aggregated over $400,000 , " discounts and interest charged to construction , " which during said years aggregated over $600,000 ; " land damages , " which during said years aggregated over $1,800,000 , and , In fact , every expense to which said company has been put in acquiring title to its road has been included in said item , whether for tangible property or not . Continuing , it is alleged that the earnings of said corporation have steadily decreased for several years last past , while the cost of maintenance of the road and equipment has steadily increased , as appears by the reports of 1895 and 1896 of said company . In view of these facts , the application concludes the assets of the company are not more than sufficient to meet its liabilities , and will be less able as time goes on . Mr. Hendricks was directed to serve notice ? of his application upon the Directors of the company , and a hearing was set before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
