txt In making choice of his Cabinet officers a President-elect is beset-by a multitude of perplexities . Mr. CLEVELAND . with all his experience and wider knowledge , has found the task scarcely less difficult now than eight years ago . With less than four weeks remaining before his inauguration he has still to choose the greater part of his Cabinet . If it be true , however , that he proposes to offer the Postmaster Generalship to Mr. ISIDOE STRAUS , and if Mr. STRAUS accepts , Mr. CLEVELAND will have saved satisfactorily one of the most difficult of the problems that confronted him . Mr. STRAUS is a man of affairs whose training amply equips him for the ereat business-office in connection with which his name has been mentioned . Besides , he has borne a conspicuous part in the fight for sound money , for tariff reform , for good administration ? for the principles of the Cleveland De-. mocracy , in short , and he would be a sound and useful adviser in the Executive Council Chamber at Washington . The execution of Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very much more serious on the Mexican side of the border than on our own . It may indicate that the discipline of the Mexican Army is Much mere severe than our own . Certainly it is inconceivable that an American officer should be punished with death , not for actual cowardice in the face of the enemy , but only for apathy and want of enterprise , except in what was universally recognized as a state of general war . It is very doubtful if such a punishment could be inflicted even then . Indian warfare is not recognized by our Government as war , in the distribution of military honors , and it would be unfair to recognize it by the infliction of military penalties proper only under martial law .
