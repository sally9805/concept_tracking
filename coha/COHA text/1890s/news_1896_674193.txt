txt We present elsewhere in our columns to-day the record of the Manhattan Railway Company in its relations with the City of New-York , to show how little claim it has for consideration at the hands of the Rapid Transit Commission . The original elevated railroads were born of the dire stress of the city for better means of transit nearly thirty years ago , and franchises of enormous value were granted for nothing and extraordinary privileges were allowed in the use of the city streets . Instead of being used with due regahl for the rights and interests of the public , these favors have been made the means of enormous stock-jobbing and speculative profits , But there is a much stronger ground than this evil record for not permitting the Manhattan Company to occupy more down-town streets , make up-town extensions , or lay third tracks for so-called express trains . If it runs a line along West Street to reach the North River ferries , and makes connections from this with the Ninth and Sixth Avenue lines , and makes a similar connection from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a further congestion upon the main tracks , and not a relief . The third tracks will do little to relax the pressure , and nowhere on the system will there be rapid transit . The company would be able to squeeze the public a Utile more for its own benefit , and to obstruct a little longer by its makeshifts the progress 3f real rapid transit . These ramshackle structures are . not adapted to a heavier traffic , and on them a higher speed is unattainable . To load them more by means of connections with bridge and ferry , and by intersecting lines and extensions northward , Would only renew the old crowding , which development on surface lines has somewhat relieved , and compel slower movement . There is no rapid transit in this , and It would only continue the opportunity of a monopoly to abuse the public patience . The present Rapid Transit Commission was not created for a purpose like this , and it should not permit itself to be used to defeat the object of Its own creation . The Rapid Transit Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the task of constructing a rapidtransit system for the city , at the expense of the municipality and for its ownership and control . That purpose is fundamental , and to do anything subversive of it or inconsistent with it would be a betrayal of trust . Municipal construction and control must be adhered to , and all work of the commission should be for its promotion , and not its hindrance . If the Manhattan Company should be divested wholly of its franchise and of its property , with due indemnity based upon actual value , it ' would be a. public benefit . Its $50,000,000 or so of capitalization represents less than 820 , - 000,000 of actual outlay in construction . Its entire system could be duplicated for much less than this latter sum . For $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 much more solid and less unsightly structures could be built along its ' present lines and the proposed ' extensions with four tracks , and upon them better equipment might be operated possibly at rapid-transit speed . If elevated railroads in the public streets are to be ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be constructed by the city on a vastly improved plan , and the Manhattan Company should be forced to give way altogether . But if the final solution lies in an underground system or a viaduct system , the commission should proceed with that with all possible dispatch . In any case , the city must provide itself with the means of rapid transit . Whether this shall be by an underground or an overground system is for the commie- lion to determine , but It should do everything to accomplish that object , and nothing  --  to hinder it . It should not begin by giving advantage to the city 's chief competitor in the business , but should , if possible , drive the competitor out of the field . In plain terms , it is the duty ' of the Rapid Transit Commission , acting for this city by authority of the State , to construct a municipal system of rapid transit , and to set its face against any proposition of the Manhattan Company to enlarge its makeshift , which is only an obstruction.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
