Toral was in a desperate condition , the spread of yellow fever might in a few days have compelled the Americans to raise the siege and retire . Official information regarding the conditions of surrender is anxiously awaited . " The Government 's unusual reticence concerning the long dispatches received .. from Capt . Gen , Blanco causes anxiety . The correspondents note , as n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always declared that he would remain in Cuba so long as he had hope of the island being preserved to Spain , has left Havana for some unblockaded port , where he hopes , to find a neutral ship to take him to Europe . " The Official Gazette publishes a memorandum from the President of the Council to the Queen Regent , explanatory of the royal decree slispending the constitutional guarantees , and briefly sketching the military situation .
