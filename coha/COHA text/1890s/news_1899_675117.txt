txt Perhaps some of our readers who otherwise might not be attracted to them may care to know that the London cable dispatches published in our Financial Review each Monday signed E. J. W. are examples of a literary style employed in the discussion of the usually dry subject such as in the opinion of good judges has not been excelled since the days of the lamented WALTER BAGEHOT . The peculiarity of the writer 's style is , the lightness of touch that is possible only to one sure of his facts and clear in his views of their relations and significance . We vent- , ure to reproduce the following from the dispatch of yesterday as giving an impressive and picturesque but entirely sober and accurate statement of a complex and extended situation : f We have been ; bothered with several worries of the nightmare-engendering sort .

This week it has been China and Muscat principally , whence various small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and France . Prices have therefore been disposed to droop , and in no department have the large supporting houses done anything to sustain them . The consequence is that the speculative position wears an overloaded appearance in places , as if many plungers were oppressed by the mass of paper they bought madly a month ago . All this would disappear In five minutes if you would only give us some encouragement by purchasing more freely and displaying better bank statements . It is too bad that your associated banks should be rapidly diminishing their surplus reserves just when we had calculated on seeing them well maintained , and , worse still , that the Treasury deficits should be dangled like death 's heads before our eyes by Congress .
