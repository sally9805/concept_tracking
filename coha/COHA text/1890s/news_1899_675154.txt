Mr. Sherman was sleeping soundly . Suddenly he was awakened by a noise In the hallway outside his door . He paid no attention to It at first , but when the sound came a second time he sat up and listened . It seemed as if some one had turned the knob of the door . Sherman listened more attentively . The door opened slowly . By the dim light of a street lamp that streamed through the drawn blinds Mr. Sherman could see the form of a man . The intruder pulled a pistol from his pocket and pointecl- , : it at Mr. Sherman 's head . Just as Mr. Sherman was about to spring from the bed and grapple with the burglar the latter said in a husky tone : " I do n't want you to make any noise ! " Then he walked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at Mr-Sherman , and leaning over , said : " Have you any money in this house ? " " I have not , " answered Mr. Sherman . " Have you any jewelry ? " " I have not , " said the banker . " Then , " said Mr. Sherman , as he related his weird experience , " the man walked into the middle of the room with the ease and coolness of an old friend . He saw that I was unarmed , so he put up his gun , and as we went on talking he walked about the room , picking up various articles and examining them . He put two or three valuable little ornaments in his pocket . I told him he 'd better not take such things as those , as they were all marked , some with initials , and he could not very well pawn them . " The man said he guessed that was right , and he put the articles back . " Have n't you got any ready money at all ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have n't you something , a watch , or something like that ? " Mr. Sherman says he told the man he had a watch under his pillow , and , the man , saying that would do , took the watch , which he put in his pocket . " Have n't you got another ? " he asked . " I told him that there was an antique watch on the bureau , ' said Mr. Sherman , " and I noticed as he walked to where it lay he took out his pistol again , and waved it beside him , as a reminder to me , 1 suppose , not to fool him . All this time 1 remained in bed , for a man only goes through such an experience once in a life , and I did not care to take any risk in attacking him , with his great advantage . " Well , be picked up the antique watch and examined it closely , saying that it was very pretty , and dropped it in his bag .

All the time he talked in the most nonchalant manner , and even referred to politics and the war . Several times he even laughed , and once asked me if I would not like to be a burglar . too . ? It 's such easy work , you see , ' were his assuring wores " After the man had taken the scarfpin3 Mr. Sherman said : " I could touch an electric button and . summon a number of persons , but as some one might get hurt .

Several persons ran to doors and windows and shouted for the police .
