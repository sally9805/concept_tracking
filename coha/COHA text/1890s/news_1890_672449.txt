txt Republicans who have been looking forward with fear and trembling to the effective use of passages from Mr. Bt A UCE 'S recent letters by the Democrats in the coming Congressional campaign must now be prepared to see the list of quoted passages considerably prolonged by the addition of extracts from the remarks of Senator PLUMB . Perhaps it is too much to expect that Mr. PLUMB will vote against the pend-iue Tariff bill as a whole , for we do not forget the rather disappointing collapse of his campaign against the metals schedule of the Allison bill .
