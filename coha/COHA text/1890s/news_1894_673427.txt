txt There is not much use in indulging in surmises as to the contents of the official dispatches from Honolulu brought by the Corti in , and the " impressions " reported from Washington seem to be based upon surmises . There will soon be definite information upon which something more than impressions may be based . It is possible that Minister WILLis misconceived the purpose of the Administration in telling him to await further instructions after the Queen declined to promise amnesty to the supporters of the provisional Government , and that he assumed that he was to proceed in case she changed her mind , instead of letting the whole matter stand in abeyance until Congress saw fit to act . If so , and the Queen signified her assent to the conditions proposed , he may have proceeded to lay the question of restoration before the provisional Government in accordance with former instructions . If he did that , he erred in overlooking the fact that the Queen 's change of intention created a new situation not covered by his instructions . Bat we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wu.tis misapprehended the matter . All he was authorized to do was to present a proposal to the provisional Government , and the worst it could do was to reject it , as the Queen was at first reported to have rejected the conditions presented to her . In that case Mr. WILLIS was explicitly directed to await further instructions . The bare proposition that the provisional Government give way to a restoration of the status quo of a year ago may have caused a " big row " in the sense of producing popular excitement in Honolulu , for it seems to take very little to produce excitement there , but there is no reason for supposing that the situation was materially changed unless it has been changed by THURSTON. who evidently went home to make mischief . We have no occasion for getting excited , at all events .
