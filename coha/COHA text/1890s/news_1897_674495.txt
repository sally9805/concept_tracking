txt The last public hearing on the Civil Service bill was held in Albany , May G. Carl Schurz , at the head of a delegation , spoke against the measure . The exhortation of his speech , to which the Governor makes reply , was as.follows : Sir , if this bill is really intended to improve the existir ' , civil service system , it must be regarded as one of the most pitiable abortions ever brought forth by human ingenuity . But if it had been devised by its authors to subvert that system and to open again all the gates to the abuses of spoils politics , then we would have to admit It to be a success . In that case , the only fault to be found with the authors would be that they did not have the courage openly to avow their purpose , but with craven hypocrisy hid that purpose behind a network of false pretenses . " For such reasons , Governor , we appear here to pray that you may refuse your signature to this bill . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abraham Lincoln pointed out to a friend the usual crowd of office hunters and their backers besieging his door , and he said : ' Look at this . Now we have overcome the rebellion , but here you see something that may become more dangerous to this Republic than the rebel-. lion itself . ' Had he lived , he would perhaps himself have led in the effort to avert a danger which his great mind so clearly foresaw . But that task has dropped upon the shoulders of another generation -- the task of destroying the spoils system , which , according to Lincoln 's utterance , appeared to him no less important than the task of de- stroying the slave power , and which has proved hardly less difficult . But it is certainly no less hopeful . Like the Slave Power . " With faithful and unremitting effort the opponents of the spoils system sucrieeded in the enactment of laws and the introduction of rules promising the complete accomplish , ment of their object , in a future not very remote . The obstacles the advancing reform had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in vividly recall to my mind the changing fortunes of the struggle against slavery . I remember the enthusiastic uprising of the anti-slavery sentiment after the pro-slavery attempt upon Kansas , the high hopes of immediate victory that were set upon the Fremont campaign of ** the thick gloom that followed Fremont 's defeat , how the . lave power seemed to carry all before it under Buchanan 's Administration . how t ven the highest judiciary of the Republic wrote one of the few dark pages of its history in fortifying slavery by the Dred Scott decision , how all seemed lost , and how then those dismal days were speedily followed by the complete and final triunqh of freedom . " With proud confluence in the sense of National honor , in the virtue and the wisdom of the American people , I venture to predict that as they wiped out the blot of slavery from the National escutcheon , so they will surely at List sweep away the barbarism and corruption of spoils politics . It is true , a violent and noisy effort is now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered . TM- party in power , which has been most positive in its pledges to support and advance the reform , is urged by some of its members with furious cries to dishonor itself by breaking its word ; and timid leaders are frightened by the deafening clamor of a greedy minority as if it were the voice of the people , All this may appear very formidable to-day , but it will not prevent the ultimate consummation . The reform cause may , indeed , meet with temporary obstruction , as the anti-slavery movement did in Buchanan 's time . Some men in conspicuous position may disgrace themselves and regret their weakness forever after . This or that political party may prove faithless to its pledges , and invite the discipline of defeat . The Buchanan of New York . " You may sign this bill and make it a law  --  although I think it can hardly be the ambition of a Governor to fiqure as the Buchanan of New York in the history of the State . If it does become a law , it may indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may serve for a short while to interrupt and retard the onward march of reform . But the whole reactionary attempt of which this bill is a part can not finally stop that onward march . The present attempt can only succeed in reviving old abuses and scandals . and in furnishing fresh object lessons which will teach the people all the more clearly that the comp:etest and most rigorous enforcement of the reform is imperatively required for the honor as well as the weinire of the Republic . And that will all the more certainly come . We are . therefore , very far from begging here for the life of the reform movement . That is well enough assured . We ask only that trouble which is altogether useleSs and unnecessarily disturbing be avoided . We may add . by way of friendly caution . that the time is not far when pu'tilie men will lie as F , o:ry to have figured as the adders and abettors of the barbarous and corrupt spoils system , as , in the North at least , other public men arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alders and abettors of slavery . Humble private citizen as I am. it may appear in me a presumptuous fancy to imagine myself as occupying , the seat of power now held by yoU . Pardon me for indulging myself in that dream for a moment , to consider what I would do in your place . I would  --  as I trust you do  --  keep steadily before my mind the solemnity of the oath I had sworn , to support the Constitution of the State according to the best of my ability . ' I would ask myself most conscientiously whether the scheme involved In this bill was really the best that my ability could devise to carry out the true intent of that Constitution , which I had taken a sacred oath to support . I would most scrupulously avoid doing or sanctioning anything that might prejudice or obstruct those among my people that are poor and lowly and without power and influence , in enjoying their full right to public position according to their merit , on a footing of perfect equality with others more favored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave
