txt The recommendations of Mr. William H. Maxwell . Superintendent of Public Instruction in Brooklyn . are this year , as usual , extremely sensible , but it seems unfortunate that there should be any need of making some of them . Among these is one for the " weeding out of inefficient Principals , heads of departments , and teachers . " With a proper mode of appointment , inspection , and promotion , it ought to be possible to secure a body of teachers that would not need weeding out . Though much is said of the hardships of a teacher 's calling- , it is obviously a desirable one , or at any rate one very much desired , and the pressure for appointment is such that very severe tests would not reduce the available number below what a great city requires . Two other suggestions are to be noted which are closely connected with each other ? " more liberal appropriations for buildings " and " reduction in the size of the very large classes . " Unless matters have greatly changed in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils , who make up the " very large classes . " If the same organization that now prevails is to be maintained , of course the only means of getting more room is by erecting or enlarging School buildings . But it is well worth considering whether a reorganization , with a reduction of space allotted to the so-called upper classes , would not give room enough for the younger pupils . They are far the most important element in the school population , and it would be a safe rule that , until they are fairly provided for , not a dollar should be expended oh the advanced classes .
