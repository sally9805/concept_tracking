txt The Republican Congressional Ca ? npaign Committee is not relying upon a " still hunt " to win the eleotions of members of the Fifty-second Congress . On the contrary , the committee is working with all its might , and without any special care to hide the fact , with the expeotation of letting everybody know that there is to be an election , and that the Republicans expect to carry it . The " brass band " is not dispened with , nor the help of printing ink in seductive and mysterious ways . Talk cheap , a good deal of it ? is called in to tile assistance of the committee , and with noisy ' palaver about the prodigious benefits that have been conferred by the Reed rule in Congress , the inestimable boons that have been conferred upon the laboring man by pretending to pass acts for him that are only half passed , and that may never get upon the statute books , it is hoped to " fuddle " the workingmen of the country , and with their help postpone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule is established beyond the power of overthrow . The Republican Congressional Committee 18 established in a building that gives it five stories of working spaoe and all the floors are in use and a large force of clerks is busy day and night . The building is on Lafayette Square , only a stone 's throw from the White House and three doors away from the house of Mr. Blaine . On a street that is a good deal of a thoroughfare and convenient to hotels and boarding houses , in which members of both houses of Congress live , it is convenient also as a place to visit , and members of Congress find it easy and agreeable to drop in and give advice as to what should be done to interest the people of their districts . The headquarters have been under the management of Mr. J. J. Belden until lately . Now Mr. J. 8 . Clarkson is in full oontrol , and the Congressional elections are conducted from his room to a greater extent than such elections were ever before run by the Republican Party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and who also help him in calulationa of the work necessary to be done to enable contests to be made in districts in which the Democrats , if they rely too much upon a supposed popular feeling against the Republicans . may neglect the efforts to which the Republicans are devoting themselves , without regard to the comforting notion prevailing in Democratic headquarters that this is an " off year " and that the Democrats ought to win because they have the best of the argument that they are diligently presenting to the people . It takes money to run this expensive as well as extensive establishment , and the Republicans are getting it . Quay is milking the Federal office holders for the Pennsylvania campaign , and the Congressional committee says that it is not receiving a cent directly or indirectly from any person in a Federal office . Whether that is absolutely true or not , it is evident that somebody is sufficiently interested in the success of the party to provide the means to print documents , to mail them , and to send speakers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign was supplied with speakers by the Congressional committee , and it did not wait to ask the Chairman of the Maine Republican State Committee whether he wanted to have speakers before ordering them to go there and appeal to the voters to return Republicans to the Fifty-second Congress . The principal speeches sent out by the committee are those of on the tariff , Lodge on elections , Henderson of Iowa on tile same subject , and Cannon and McComas on the finances . A series of highly-decorated and exaggerated reviews of what the Republicans tried to accomplish in the session of Congress just ended is also going out . Then there has been some pictorial appealing to the multitude . Speaker Reed is the hero of the campaign . His picture in great and small form and a good deal of boasting about how he has " knocked out obstruction " have been put before the voters in all the shapes that would catch the eye . Harrison is " not in it " to any extent . This is not Harrison 's campaign . It is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland Collectorship in opposition to the wishes of the Speaker there is more enthusiasm about Reed than there was before . Visitors are not discouraged , when they call at the Republican Committee room , by being told that the committee does not know anything about the work in the districts . It knows all about the work in every district , and so much about it that no impostor or " striker " is likely to deceive all of the adroit men through whose hands the adventurer will have to pass . The Secretary of the committee , Representative Carter of Montana , 1B one of the most knowing of politicians , as oily as a duck 's back , and he is an indefatigable worker . Now that Congress has adjourned , his working force is being recruited by men from the House who are familiar with business about a campaign headquarters , and the results of their labors are seen in the huge boxes of documents that are taken from the door every day and that are sent to all the States of the Union . The Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ohio , in Kentucky , and in Maryland , in which States there have been rearrangements of the districts by the Democrats , and in which the Democrats are confident that they will make gains . They are devoting a good deal of attention to country districts and are confident that the Tariff bill has been passed just early enough to make it attractive to the farmer . They also assume that it will not have been in operation long enough by election day for the agriculturist to discover that it is a delusion and a snare . The city districts are being cultivated , too , in the same hope . While the Democrats are living in fancied security and relying on a reprobation of " Tom " Reed to carry the election , the Republicans are resorting to the plan of trying to convince people that the rule of Reed has resulted in the arrival of the millennium without a formal introduction . The Republican Congressional Committee is confident that It will win the fight . No one about Clarkson will admit for au instant that there Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retention of control and for the aggrandizement of Reed . It is a committee that is electing the Congress and preparing the way for the nomination of the next Republican candidate for President . There is no Harrison in it anywhere . All that the committe boasts about as having been accomplished is attributed to the Speaker . The victory will be one for Reed , not Harrison . Whatever expenditure is incurred , and whatever effort may be put forth , will be for the development of Reed as the leader of the Republican Party and his elevation to the head of the ticket in 1892 . One of the latest appeals to the voters illustrates this by means of a poster upon which the House of Representatives is displayed sitting like an array of wooden dolls in front of Speaker Reed , while a very wooden doll that is supposed to be is addressing the Republican and Democratic dolls on the Tariff bill . Reed is watching over the wooden resentatives with a ponderous gavel uplifted in a threatening manner , and the remarkable and unheard-of situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirtyfifth is speaking . This is set off with a bold headline advising everybody to " read and reflect , " and then follow extracts from speeches by on the Tariff bill that passed and on the Force bill and the Eight-hou ? bill that did not pass . The committee has not yet issued the picture showing House empty eon the Democratic side . When that is published , the Democrats ought to duplicate it , to show . how Reed 's quorum idea was demolished by the expedient of compelling the Republicans to furnish a Republican quorum to do Republican political work . These are the signs that everybody may see at Republican headquarters . The dullest comprehension can make out that the headquarters is a hive and that the men who are running it are running it for all it is worth . The sources of the supply of money with which to run the headquarters are only to be , coectured . That is a matter which is not advertised at the committee rooms of either party . That there Is not a money famine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five stories of the headquarters bit dding are under pay , and the printed matter that they prepare for the malls is not printed for nothing . The activity at headquarters is incomparably greater than it has been at any time these ten years . Those Democrats who are predicting that the Democratic majority in the next Congress will be from thirty to seventy , would do well to ascertain what the Republicans are doing outside of the Congressional Committee , before wagering any money on the size of the majoilty . Some Senators and ilepresentatives are inclined to criticise President Harrison for failing to approve six or seven bills passed for the relief of various contractors who built vessels for the Government during the last war . Two of the bills were vetoed and the others were killed by withholding the Executive approval The chief criticism seems to be that the President was inconsistent in refusing to let these bills become laws when he had promptly approved the bills for the settlement of the famous claim , which was in all material respects a measure of exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and in his veto of the bill for the relief of the Portland Company of Portland , Me. , he refers to it . The Portland bill authorized the Court of Claims to find out how much the machinery built by the company for the vessels Agawan and Pontoosuo coot above the contract price paid by the Government . and directed that judgment for that sum be entered . It did not make this extra allowance contingent upon the feet that the additional expense was the result of the acts of the Government , and in this , the President says , it differed from the measiTte . It seemed to him that there would be no object in the Government 's making a contract for work if it was to be binding only in ease the contractor made a profit . The Portland claim amounts to $80 , - 867.46 . A similar bill for the relief of the administration of George W. Lawrence , and carrying over $17,000 for extra work on the hulls of the Agawan and Pontoosuo , was left unsigned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work upon the iron vessels Suwanee , Watoree , and Shamokin , by Reaney , Son az Archibold , shared the same fate . The bill for the relief of the assignees of John Roach , which was also left unsigned , carried over $61,000 for extra cost of machinery for the wooden vessel Peoria . Another of the same sort carried $11,708 for extra work on the hull of the Tosco . This was also " pocketed " by Mr. Harrison . The bill for the relief of Charles P. Chouteau provided that the Court of Claims should give another hearing to the Chouteau claim for increased cost of work upon an ironclad steam battery . The case was once fully heard by the court , which found against the claimant , because a settlement had been made and a receipt given in full . The President saw no reason for a rehearing in the absence of any new testimony , saying in effect that , if Congress wanted to take any action on the claim , the finding already made by the court furnished a complete basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Harrison signed the Tariff act yesterday errors were being discovered in the enrolled bill , and efforts were being made to have them corrected by the joint action of the two houses . It remained for the most astonishing and most important error to be discovered in the shape of the omission of an entire section of the bill . Section 30 as it came from the House provided that on all original and unbroken factory packages of smoking and manufactured tobacco and snuff held by manufacturers or dealers on Jan. 1,1891 , upon which the tax had been paid , there should be allowed a drawback or rebate of the full amount of the reduction of tax , which goes into effect on that date . The Senate struck out this section . In the bill accompanying the conference report appears the statement , " Conference restores Section 30 , " and in the report itself , which was adopted by both houses , is the statement that the Senate recedes from its amendment , numbered 449 , which is the striking out of Section 30 . Section 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the vote of each house , but in the enrolled bill signed by President Harrison , and which is now the tariff law of the country , that section is entirely omitted . Unless Congress sees fit to amend the law in December , holders of paid tobacco will not get the rebate that Congresa voted should be given to them . It is not expected that this will amount to much to the tobacco nitre as they have the next three months in which to dispose of their stooks on hand , and manufacturers will , of course , not put up any more under the present tax than they can dispose of before New Year 's , when the tax will be reduced to 6 cents a pound . It is asserted to-night that the conferees really intended to leave Section 30 out of the bill anyhow , but the fact remains that they put it in and that both houses voted to retain it , and yet it is dropped out of the law by somebody 's gross carelessness . How many more evidences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found remains to be seen . Daring the session the roll was called 462 times . It takes on the average 21 minutes to call the roll , so that 11,088 minutes were thus occupied . This was 184 hours . The average length of the daily sessions of the House was live hours . and , therefore , no less than thirty-six and four-fifths days of the session were spent in simply calling the roll of the Representatives . It is almost impossible to get at the exact cost to the people of the House of Representatives , but it is estimated at $6,500 a day on the basis of its present membership . It has , therefore , cost for roll calls alone during the session ending yesterday the very tidy sum of $239,200 . It will probably appear to the average taxpayer that it is a pretty expensive thing to record the votes of the members of the House of Representatives .
