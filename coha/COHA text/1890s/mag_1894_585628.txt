txt IT is an interesting fact that the first creature which man won to domesticity was made captive and friend for the sake of companionship rather than for any grosser profit . The dog was , the world over , the first living possession of man beyond the limits of his own kindred . He has been so long separated from the primitive species whence he sprang that we can not trace with any certainty his kinship with the creatures of the wilderness . Like his master he has become so artificialized that it is hard to conjecture what his original state may have been . Naturalists are much divided in opinion in all that relates to the origin of our ancient and common domesticated animals , and this for the reason that the longer a creature has been subjected to the change - bringing conditions of our fields and households , the further it has departed from the parent stock . This difficulty is naturally the greatest in the case of the dogs , for the reason that they have been longer and more completely under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some students of the problem have inclined to the opinion that the dog is a descendant of the wolf : the whelps of this species , it is sup . posed , were captured by primitive men and brought under domestication . The difficulty of this view is that even with the high measure of care which the conditions of civilization permit us to devote to the effort , it has been found impossible to educate captive wolves to the point where they show any affection for their masters , or are in the least degree useful in the arts of the household or the occupations of the chase . They are in fact indomitably fierce and utterly self-regarding . It seems unreasonable to believe that any savage would have found either pleasure or profit from an effort to tame any of the known species of wolves . Moreover , the fact that dogs show little or no tendency to revert to the form and habits of their brutal kindred , or to interbreed with them , is clearly against the supposition that there is any close relation between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dog through the admixture of the blood of several different species , the wolf and the jackal being perhaps the principal or the only components of the hybrid stock . Here too the evidence of nature is against the supposition . No one has ever succeeded in hybridizing the wolf and the jackal , nor do our dogs show any more tendency to revert to the jackal than to the wolf . They meet their tropical relative with as much animosity as is proper , or at least customary , in the intercourse of allied yet distinct species . In fact , all the indices by which we are able to carry back the history of other domesticated animals to their priihitive or even extinct ancestry , fail in the case of the dog . When the stock is allowed to go as nearly wild as they can be induced to become , we do not find that they thereby approach to any known wild form . It therefore seems reasonable to betake ourselves to another basis for the natural history of the dog which has not yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to afford us more substantial truth than the conjectures which we have just considered . We should , in the first place , note the fact that the ancestors of our more important domesticated animals , those which have been longest in subjugation , have commonly disappeared from the wild state  --  the species , except for the cultivated forms , having gone into the irrecoverable past . This is the case with the wild kindred of our bulls , horses , sheep , and camels , there probably being none of the original wild species of these groups now living , except those* // which have been more or less completely subjugated by man and then have returned to the wilderness . The fact is that with any large mammal , the domestication of the species tends to bring about the destruction of the remaining wild forms . If we go back in fancy to the time when the dog was taken in from the wilderness , we readily perceive how certainly the subjugated individuals would have mingled with their wild kindred , so that either the wild would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists between slavery and freedom in our own species in any given territory may be said to hold in the case of captive animals . lit is particularly on this account that I am disposed to think that our races of dogs have been derived from one or more original species of truly canine ancestors , the wild forms of which have long since disap. - peared from the earth . Although there are no species of wild dogs now in existence to which we can refer the origin of our household friends , there are several known to us only in their fossil state from which they may possibly-indeed , we may say probably - have been derived . These creatures are , of course , represented only by their VOL . XV. - 71 skeletons , and even these remains have only been found in an imperfect state of preservation . It is evident , however , that these extinct species , or at least certain of them , lived down to the time when man had come upon the earth , and was beginning to speculate or his surroundings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is clearly a reasonable supposition that some of these primitive canine species may have been far more domesticable than the existing kindred of the dogthe wolves , foxes , jackals , or hyaenasdiffering from their fiercer kindred much as the zebras do from the wild asses , the one form being utterly undomesticable , and the other lending its back almost willingly to the burdens which man chooses to impose . It seems likely that this primitive species - perhaps more than one-whence the dog sprang waa not a very vigorous or widespread form , else , as before remarked , a savage would . have found it impossible to keep his half - tamed creatures from rejoining their wild kinsmen . Thus , if a man should in this day succeed in taming wolves , in a region where they were plenty , to the point where they began to abide his presence or even to have // some slight affection for him , the call of nature would be sure to lead them back to reunion with their kind . It seems pretty certain that the first steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any distinct purpose of acquiring a useful animal , but to that vague instinct which leads children to make captives of any wild animal with which they come in contact . The fancy for pets is not only common to all mankind , civilized and savage alike , but is clearly exhibited in many of the mammals below the level of man . Almost everyone has observed cases where dogs , cats , and horses have become attached to some creature of an alien species with which they have been by chance thrown in contact . The higher the grade of the intelligence , the more sympathetic with other life the animal is likely to become . Thus the elephants , whose natural endowments in the way of intelligence are perhaps superior to those of any other wild creatures , are , when brought into captivity , curiously prone to form attachments to human beings . Savages appear to make but little use of their dogs in hunting . In fact , those peculiar combinations of instinct and training which we find in our hounds , pointers , setters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of sportsmen , have been acquired but slowly , and are of no value except where the search for game is carried on under what we may term civilized conditions . The dog of the savage is in all countries much like his master  --  a creature with few arts and unaccustomed to subdue his rude native impulses to the attainment of any refined ends . It . seems most likely that for ages the principal use of the dogs which dwelt about the camps of the primitive people was found in the reserve food supply which they afforded their thriftless masters . When the hunting was successful the poor brutes had a chance to wax fat , and even in times of scarcity they managed to pick up enough food to keep them alive . When their masters were brought to a state of famine they were doubtless accustomed , as are many savages at the present time , to eat a portion of their pack . In the early conditions of humanity there was no other beast which could be made to serve so well this simple need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact the only animal ever domesticated which can be trusted through his own affections alone to abide with his master in the endless CoiHe. // ENGRAVED BY SCHUSSLER DRAWN NY CH . HERRMANN LON. // changes of camp and the rapid movements of flight and chase which characterized men before their housed state began . In a certain curious way the use of dogs for food has served greatly to advance the development of these captives . When the savage was driven to feed upon his dogs he was naturally more willing to sacrifice the least intelligent and affectionate of them , delaying to the point of extremity the time when he would kill those which had endeared themselves to him . In this way for ages a careful though unintended process of selection was applied to these creatures , and to it we may fairly attribute , as many considerate naturalists have done , a large part of the intellectual-indeed , we may say moral -- elevation to which they have attained . When the place of the dog as the first and most intimate companion of man was affirmed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first made free gradually enlarged to civilization , a number of special uses were found for the peculiar capacities of the creature . These varied in different parts of the world , according to the jeculiarities in the conditions of the masters . In high latitudes , where the ground is snow-covered during the winter season , dogs were used , as they are to this day , in dragging 696 sleds . They were , indeed , perhaps the first animals which were harnessed to vehicles . When they were brought to serve this definite end , we may well believe that the stronger and more enduring individuals were spared in times of dearth for the reason that they were almost indispensable to their masters , and even the little forethought which we find among primitive peoples would lead to their preservation . Here again , doubtless , came in the process of unintended selection which has made the Esquimau sled - dog one of the most remarkable varieties of his kind . Perhaps the most interesting of the early variations induced among dogs is that which has arisen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this custom of keeping sheep in large flocks was first instituted , but it is evidently of exceeding antiquity , probably far older than the pyramids of Egypt . The custom could hardly have been instituted without help of the shepherd 's mate , the sheep - dog . Although the creatures of this breed are probably in form very near to the original wild species whence our canines came , the variety has as regards its instincts been , by a process of education and selection , led very far away from the original stock . The wild forefathers of this species were clearly natural born sheep-slayers , Bull-Dog. // and the motive abides to this day in all the breeds which have the strength to assail our unresisting flocks . The spirit is so ingrained that even the most civilized of our house-dogs , which may for generations never have tasted blood and which show no disposition to at -- tack the other creatures of the barnyard , can not be trusted alone with sheep . When two or more of " them are together the old instincts of the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they are fairly exhausted with their fury . Their behavior on such occasions reminds one of the actions of their masters when possessed with the blind rage of a mob . Yet in the shepherd-dog we find this ancestral motive , once a large part of the life of the creature , so overcome by education and selection that they will not only care for a flock with all the devotion which self - interest can lead the master to give to the task , but they will cheerfully undergo almost any measure of privation in order to protect *their charges from harm . The annals of shepherd districts , especially those where winter snows fall deeply , as in Scotland , abound in anecdotes of a well-attested nature which show how profoundly the dogs which tend the flocks are imbued with the love of the animals committed to their care . This affection is more curious for the reason that it is never in any measure returned by the sheep . To them the custodian is ever a dreaded overseer . He seems to bring to them nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species acquired in far away times . It is very interesting to note the behavior of a young shepherd-dog when he is first brought in contact with a flock . It is easy to see that he has an amazingly keen interest in the sheep . He regards them with an attention which he gives to no other living things , except perhaps his master . Out of a litter of well-bred pups belonging to this variety , the greater part will at once assume a curatorial attitude toward a flock . They will show a disposition to keep them together , and will only seize on an individual in case he underGreyhound after " the Kill . " // takes to break away . They will generally use no more force than is necessary to reduce the recalcitrants to order . They arrest him by catching hold of the leg or fleece , and rarely seize hold of the throat , which other dogs , led by their inherited instincts , are apt at once to assaiL Very rarely does a shepherddog of good ancestry , even at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shows that the ancient proclivities have been revived in his spirit . Even then a little remonstrance , or at most a slight castigation , is pretty sure to turn him from his evil ways . If we could measure in some visible manner the psychic peculiarities of animals we would be led to regard this great change in the instincts of the dog , which has been brought about by his use in herding , as perhaps the most momentous transformation which man has ever accomplished in any creature , including himself ; for none of our own inherited savage traits are so completely sublated at the time of our birth as is this old and sometime dominant slaying motive in the shepherd-dog . With the advancing differentiation of human occupations and amusements , our breeds of dogs have , by more or 698 less deliberate selection , been developed until by form and instincts they fit a great variety of purposes . Some of these pertain to industrial work , but the greater portion are related to the sports or fancies of men . The turuspit was bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was serviceable in those treadmills of the hearth which have long since passed out of use , but which were for centuries features in our kitchens . The massive type of bull-dogs , characterized by heavy frames and an indomitable will , appears to have been brought about by a process of selection having for its unconscious end the development of a breed which should render the herdsman of horned cattle something like the assistance which the shepherd-dog gave to those who had charge of flocks . In the more primitive state of our bulls and cows the creaturca were much wilder than at present , and were generally kept , not in enclosed pastures , but on unfenced ranges . In these conditions the care taken needed the help which the ancestors of our modern bull-dog afforded . The tasks which the animal was called on to perform were of a ruder nature than those which were allotted to the shepherdPointer and Setter , Flushing Game . // dog . Their business was to conquer the unruly beast . They were taught to seize the muzzle , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercer small bulls of the ancient typc of form . From this original use the cattledogs were turned to the brutal sport of bull-baiting , a rude diversion which was indulged in by our ancestors for centuries , and has only disappeared in our less cruel modern days . Bred for the bull-ring , these dogs acquired the formidable strength and ferocity under excitement which made their name a terror and their qualities a satirical embodiment of the ruder traits which characterized the British folk . The training which instituted the breed of bull-dogs was evidently much less continuous and effective than that which developed the shepherding variety . The use for the creature in the care of herds has passed away . In the older parts of the world cattle are kept only in enclosures , and where , as on our frontier , they still range over unbounded fields they are guarded by horsemen who do not need the assistance of dogs to control the movements of the herds . No longer serviceable either in economies or sports , the breed of true bulldogs is rapidly disappearing . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peculiarities of this breed are now under the control of fancy , and the blood is being led far away from its old characteristics . The bull-terrier and other varieties , which retain something of the form and of the solemn demeanor which characterized their ancestors , but which are too small to assail horned cattle , mark the vanishing stages of this great stock , which will soon only be known in memory . The history of this peculiar herd-dog shows us how marvellously pliant the body and mind of this species has become under the conditions of civilization . The rude processes of unconscious selection , acting without steadfastness of purpose or rationally developed skill , serves to sway the qualities of the aniinal this way or that to meet the everchanging requirements of use or fancy . A similar selection in the case of our horned cattle has within a few centuries converted the cows into mild-mannered and sedentary milk-making machines , // and has deprived the bulls of the greater part of their ancient savage humor . Owing to this change in the quality of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great variations . The same type of interaction may be traced again and again in the isolated part of the world enclosed within our fences , as well as in the free realm of the wildernesses . All the individuals in the great host of life affect each other as do the soldiers of a well organized army in the movements of a battle . The shepherd-dog , the turuspit , and the bull-dog are the three remarkable variations of the canine blood which were brought about by a process of training and selection unconsciously directed to the institution of breeds suited to special economic ends . The other varieties of dogs have been shaped more distinctly for purposes of amusement or for the indulgence of mere fancy . The several varieties of hounds , harriers , beagles , pointers , setters , terriers , etc. , have been designed to meet a dozen or more variations in the conditions of the chase . The marvellously complete way in which special peculiarities have been developed in mind and body makes this field of domestic culture the most fascinating subject of inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritances determined so as to fit him for pursuing a small animal which can rarely be kept in view during its flight , and which can only be followed by the odor it leaves in its trail , so these creatures run almost altogether under the guidance of their sense of smell . The stag-hound , on thc other hand , pursues a relatively largc animal which can not well be followed by the nose , at least with any speed ; they therefore trust almost altogether to vision in their chase . The packs which hunt otters have developed the swimming habit and an array of instincts which fit them especially for this peculiar sport . If space allowed we could note at least a dozen divisions of the group of hounds or chasing dogs , each of which has developed a peculiar asseniblage of qualities , more or less precisely adapted to some particular game . Perhaps the most special adaptation which man has brought about in his domesticated animals is found in our pointers and setters . In these groups the dogs have been taught , in somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gunner . Although the modes of action of these two breeds are closely related , they are sufficiently distinct to meet certain differences of circumstances . The peculiarities of their actions , it should be noted , are altogether related to the qualities of our fowling pieces . These have been in use , at least in the form where shot took the place of the single ball , for less than two centuries , and the peculiar training of our pointers and setters has been brought about in even less time . It seems likely , indeed , that it is the result of about a hundred and fifty years of teaching , combined with the selection which so effectively works upon all our domesticated creatures . It thus appears that this peculiar impress upon the habits of the dog is the i'esult of somewhere near thirty generations of culture . Althouoh as Mr. Darwin has suggested , the pointing or setting habit probably rests upon an original custom of pausing for a moment before leaping upon their prey , which was possibly characteristic of the wild dog , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for we do not find this habit of creeping on the prey among our more primitive forms of dogs nor the wild allied species as a marked feature . All the canine animals trust rather to furious chase than to the cautious form of assault by stealthy approach and a final spring upon their prey , as is the habit with the cat tribe . Granting this somewhat doubtful claim that the induced habits of these dogs which have been specially adapted to the fowling - piece rests upon an original and native instinct , the amount of specialization which has been attained in thirty generations of care remains a very surprising feature and affords one of the most instructive lessons as to the possibilities of animal culture . It is an interesting fact that the variation of a spontaneous sort which is now taking place in our pointers and setters is considerable . It is , perhaps , more distinctly indicated here than in any other of the breeds which are characterized by peculiar qualities of mind . // ( Snowing the habit of attacking neck of prey . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERRMANN LEON . // All those familiar with the behavior of these strains of hunters have observed the high measure of individuality which characterizes them . I have recently been informed by a friend , who is a hunter and a very observing naturalist , of one of these variations in the pointer 's instinct which may , by careful selection , possibly lead to a very useful change in the habits of the animal . Hunting the Virginia partridge in the tall grass on the sea-coast of Georgia , his dog found by experience that his master could not disce*n him when he was pointing birds , and that a yelp of impatience would put up the covey before the gun was ready for them . The sagacious dog has therefore adopted the habit of backing away from the point where he first fixed himself , so that he could , by barking , denote the presence of the birds without giving them alarm . Although in this first instance the action is purely rational , and is indeed good evidence of singular discernment and contriving skill , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ht into the realm of pure instinct or inherited habit . The great variation in habits which is taking place in those varieties of dogs which are immediately under the mas ter 's eye during all the process of the chase is easily explained by the fact that these creatures are in a position to be immediately and constantly influenced during their most active and therefore teachable state of mind by the will of man . A pack of fox-hounds is to a reat extent out of hand while engaged in the pursuit of their prey , but a pointer or setter , even when under extreme excitement , is almost completely mastered by the superior will . When we observe the extent to which human intelligence is affecting the qualities of our hunters , it is not surprising to note that in almost every district where there are peculiar kinds of game , varieties of the dog are developing which are especially adapted to its pursuit . Thus in America , where the raccoon abounds , a peculiar variety of hunting dog is in process of development which has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of the chase . Although as yet " coon dogs** have not been cultivated for a sufficient time to acquire distinct physical characteristics , their habits exhibit a larger range of specialization than those of any other breed of sporting dogs . In those parts of the Americas where peccaries are hunted , the dogs used in ups . // their pursuit have learned to beware of assaulting the pack which they have brought to bay , and instead of indulging in the instinct which leads them into that way of danger and of certain death , they circle round the assemblage , compelling them to show front on every side , and so to remain stationary until the hunters come up . Perhaps a score of similar specializations in the modes of action of our dogs which are employed in the chase could be recited , but as they all lead us to one conclusion , which is to the effect that these creatures are , as far as their mental powers are concerned , like clay in the hands of the potter , we may pass them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writers who have discussed the problems of canine intelligence . So long as our dogs were employed in the labor or the organized recreations of man , the tendency of the association with the superior being was in a high measure educative . They were constantly submitted to a more or less critical but always effective selection which tended ever to develop a higher grade of intelligence . With the advance in the organization of society the dog is ever losing something of his utility , even in the way of sport . He is fast becoming a mere idle favorite , prized for unimportant peculiarities of form . The effort in the main is not now to make creatures which can help in the employments of man , but to breed for show alone , demanding no more intelligence than is necessary to make the creature a well-behaved denizen of a house . The result is the institution of a wonderful variety in the size , shape , and special peculiarities of different breeds with what appears to me to be a concomitant loss in their intelligence . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , that the ordinary mongrels are more intelligent and more susceptible of high training than the carefully inbred varieties , which are more highly prized because they conform to some thoroughly artificial standard of form or coloring . This is what we should expect from all we know concerning the principles of breeding . Where for generations the dog-fancier has selected for reproduction with reference to the trifling and often injurious features of shape he seeks to attain he naturally and almost necessarily neglects to choose the creatnres in regard to // their mental peculiarities . The result bones of the skeleton which we may is that the breed tends to fall back in trace among the domesticated pigeons . XVe therefore turn from these results of breeders ' fancy to consider certain of the mental qualities of dogs which have not come in our way in our review of the history of its relations to man . First of all , we may note the fact that the friendly relations which dogs have become accustomed to fo r m with men vary exceedingly in their range and activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly human characteristics as in the way in which he meets the individuals of the mastering species . The gamut of their social relations with men is almost exactly these regards to below the level of the parallel with our own . With from one to ordinary cur , who makes his place in the a dozen persons a dog may maintain reaffections of his owner because he has lations of almost equally complete symattractive or useful qualities of mind . pathy and mutual understanding . He It appears to me , in a word , that our may be on terms of acquaintanceship in treatment of this noble animal , where va ied degrees of familiarity with a few he is bred for ornament , is , in effect , score others with whom he comes in fre degrading. quent contact . Toward the rest of man- qwq cal plastieity of this species under the conditions of long domestieation . The r* nge in size between a tiny spaniel , such as tbose which are bred in Chihuahua , in northern Mexieo , and the great Danes or mastiffs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attained in the case of any mammal . In some cases the larger individuals belonging to the mastiff breed probably weigh near thiity times as much as their smaller kinsmen . Great as are these variations , they are only in form and bulk . They involve none of may note that his relations to the peothose curious changes in the number of plc are substantially those which the qwq // folk have to each other . He shows as they do a certain consideration for the individuals he encounters , gives them their due place , and yet holds to his own . It is particularly noticeable that he avoids all contact with the other passers ; in fact , a dog has to be much beside himself with rage or fear or insane from disease before he will break those 1*ounds of personality which civilization has set up to guide the conduct of life . The social culture of dogs appears to have gone to the point where they recognize the meaning of an introductionat least as far as the sympathetic relations of that understanding are concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master , or even by persons whom he knows but is not accustomed to obey , to a stranger to whom he has already exhibited some dislike . During the introduction he will submit to those formal exchanges of courtesy which he is accustomed to recognize as the indices of friendship . The impression of this understanding seems to be so permanent that on subsequent meetings the dog , though he may maintain his original dislike of the man who has been forced upon his acquaintance , will continue to treat hini with a certain consideration , though it is often easy to see that it is a difficult matter for him to conform to the requirements of soci ety . When we compare the conduct of dogs in these regards with the behavior of other animals , even highly domesticated forms , we perceive how marvellously successful has been man 's unconscious effort to mould this creature on his own nature . Another extremely human characteristic of our canine friends is shown in their susceptibility to ridicule . Faint traces of this quality are to be found in monkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere else save in man , and hardly there , except in the more sensitive natures , do we find contempt , expressed in laughter of the kind which conveys that emotion , so keenly and painfully appreciated . With those dogs which are endowed with a large human quality , such as our various breeds of hounds , it is possible by laughing in their faces not only to quell their rage , but to drive them to a distance . They seem in a way to be put to shame and at the same time hopelessly puzzled as to the nature of their predicament . In this connection we may note the very human feature that after you have cowed a dog by insistent laughter you can never hope to make friends with him . A case of this kind is fresh in my experience . A year or two ago I was imprudent enough to laugh at a very intelligent dog in my neighborhood , he // having unreasonably assailed me at my house-door , where he had been left for a long time to wait while his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy state of mind . Sympathizing with his situation I preferred to laugh him out of his humor rather than to beat him with my stick . I regret I did not take the other alternative , for I made the poor brute my implacable enemy by my pretence of contempt for him . I am inclined to think that if I had beaten him the matter could have been arranged afterward in a friendly way . Another very remarkable and I believe hitherto unnoticed relation between the mind of dogs and that of man is found in the fact that these dumb beasts , unlike all other inferior animals , except , perhaps , some of the more intelligent species of monkeys , will learn lessons from isolated experiences . In this regard they are indeed quite as apt as the lower kinds of men . Thus a dog who Thas had an unsavory or painful experience with a skunk or a porcupine is apt to keep away from these creatures for a long time thereafter . Where , as is not infrequently the case , a cur takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an egg which is placed where he can readily find it , is apt to effect an immediate and complete reform . This ready learning from experience is almost the gist of our human quality-at least on the intellectual side of it . Perhaps the greatest success to which man has attained in his education of the dog is to be found in the measure in which he has overcome the fierce rage which clearly characterized the ancestors of this creature when they first felt the mastering hand . The reader can not understand the intensity of the rage motive in the carnivora unless he has studied some of these brutes in their wild state , where from the time in the remote ages when they first began to take on the qualities of their species they have survived and won success by the fury of their assault . In almost all our breeds of dogs this primal ferocity has been overlaid by the various motives of rationality , sympathy , and conventional demeanor , until one may live half a lifetime with well-bred dogs without a chance to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have in our own beneath a host of civilizing influences . It is rare indeed in our day that a dog , unless insane , will bite a human being . The most of their assaults are pure bluster , mere pretence of fury , as is shown by the fact that if , carried away by their pretence , they are led to use their teeth , it is a mere sham assault , having no semblance of the effectiveness of true combat . Something of the pristine fury of the primitive dogs may still be noted in a certain brutal variety of watch - dogs which are still to be found in parts of continental Europe . The best types of this nature which I have ever seen are to be found among the dogs which are kept to guard the quarries of Solenhofen , in Bavaria , whence come all the fine lithographic stones which are so extensively used in printing pictures . These quarries are scattered over several square miles of untilled country , and the separate pits are to be numbered by the score . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarries their care is confided to packs of watch - dogs which are turned loose at night and appear as if by instinct to spend the hours of darkness in prowling over the territory . Such is their size and ferocity that it takes a sturdy beggar to face them . I remember inadvertently disturbing one of these brutes from sleep , in the strong cage where he was confined , and I have never beheld such a picture of blind fury as he exhibited . I had not come within twenty feet of him , and was merely moving past his place of confinement , yet he sprang to the grating and strove with his teeth to break his way through the bars . I thought the animal must be mad , but his keeper assured me that such was his ordinary state of mind and that the humor was common to all the breed ; even the masters dwelt in fear of them . Ordinarily the only exhibitions of the innate ferocity of our dogs are to be seen in their combats with each other , when for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Even these occasional exhibitions of fury are not found among all breeds of dogs , and among // many individuals even of the combative strains of blood the motive of battle appears to have quite passed away . In antithesis to the old Ishmaelitic humor of our primitive dogs man has developed a singular sympathetic and kindly motive in these creatures . From the point of view of the dog 's education we must not set too much store by his affection for his master . This kind of devotion of one being to another is displayed elsewhere in the animal kingdom , though it is more common among birds than among mammals . We find traces of it in the greater part of our domesticated creatures or in those which we have individually adopted from the wilderness . It is a part of the great sympathetic motive , which , originating far down in the series of animals , increases as they gain in the scale of being , until it reaches the highest level it has yet attained in spiritually minded men . The eminent peculiarity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life is formed of the affections , which are evidently the same as those which rule the days of the most cultivated men . To him these elements of friendliness are absolutely neccssary to a comfortable existence . If by chance he becomes separated from his master and the other people with whom he is familiar , his bereavement is intense ; but in most cases , at the end of a day or two , he is compelled to form new bonds , and he sets about the task in an exceedingly human way . I dwell in a town where dogs abound and where the frequent coming and going of the people puts many of the creatures astray . Perhaps as often as once a week , almost always late in the evening , one of these nuhappy lost ones seeks to make friends with me . His advances toward this end always begin by his dogging my footsteps at a little distance . If I do not repulse him he will come nearer until he has made sure of my attention . A friendly word will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never effusive , as it would be if he had found his rightful owner , but mildly propitiative and with a touch of sadness . The Pounce of e Terrier . // There is , it seems to me , no other feature in the life of the dog which tells so much as to his moral nature as his conduct under these unhappy circumstances . In the long catalogue of human qualities which characterize our thoroughly domesticated dogs , we must not fail to take account of their sense of property . In this the creature differs from all other of our domesticated animals . It is a common characteristic of mammals , both in their wild and tame state , that they feel a motive of ownership in the food which they have captured or in the den which they have made their lair ; but beyond these narrow personal limits we see no evidence of any sense of ownership in land or effects . We readily observe , however , that our household dogs not only know the chattels of their master and distinguish them from those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounds of their house lot or even of a considerable farm . When a dog , even of a militant quality , enters on territory which he does not feel to belong to him , he is at once a very different creature as compared to his condition when he is on his own land . He treads warily and will accept without dispute an order to take himself off . A perception of this sort indicates an extraordinary amount 708 of sympathy and discernment . It requires us to assume that the creature has a good sense of topography and that he observes closely the various acts , none of them perhaps very indicative , which go to show the limits of his master 's claims . Although the mental qualities of our highly domesticated dogs are singularly like those of their m asters , the likeness going to the point that the household pet is apt to have acquired something of the general character of the people with whom he dwells , there are many suggestive differences arising from failures of development which are in the highest measure interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place , that although for ages in contact with the constructive work which occupies his masters , the dog shows no tendency whatever to essay any undertakings of this nature . He is quite alive to considerations of personal comfort and is particularly fond of a warm bed , yet except for a few unverified stories we may say that there is no evidence whatever to show that they ever try to improve their conditions by deliberately providing themselves with warm bedding . In no well - attested case has a dog shown any sense as to the nature of any mechanical contrivance . They will learn which way a door St. Bernard . // opens , and rarely if ever do they undiscerningly close it when it is slightly ajar when they wish to pass through the opening , but I have never been able to observe or obtain evidence to show that they would pull down a latch in the way in which a cat readily learns to do . Much as dogs have had to do with guns , they display no kind of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sport to come . They connect the explosion with the capture of game , and will search for it in the direction toward which the barrel was pointed . I have not , however , been able to find that they know , as they might readily do , and as a crow would surely do , when the weapon was loaded and when empty . They show no interest in it , such as monkeys readily display toward any mechanical contrivance to which their attention has been directed . All these negative features indicate that the mechanical side of the canine mind is entirely undeveloped . Although there is some evidence that the sense of number attains a measure of development in dogs , the ability to form mathematical conceptions of any kind appears to be very weak in these species . The fact that shepherd- dogs in a way keep an account of considerable flocks so that they will know when one is gone astray , can readily be explained on the supposition that they know their charges individually and not in sum . The absence of arithrnetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mechanical sense , for the reason that such incapacity is also common in the lowest races of men . Although dogs , as before noted , quickly and clearly acquire a sense of property rights in all which pertains to their owner 's holdings , they appear never to extend their sense of their own personal possessions beyond the original limit to which they had attained when the species was domesticated . The creature feels a sense of personal property in his food and in his sleeping-place , but appears not to extend his conception of individual rights beyond these primitively established limits . All our well - bred household dogs quickly learn certain bodily habits which are necessary to make them acceptVOL XV. - 72 able members of a household . These habits are not well affirmed by inherited instinct , but the ease with which the instruction is acquired shows that they have become prone to submit to such regulations . Culture on this line rests upon a primal instinct originating we know not how , which leads a number of wild animals to conceal their excrement . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modesty , though that in a more or less complete measure is characteristic of all human tribes whatsoever . The most curious imitation which we find in dogs is as to the measure of expression to which they have attained . No one who has well considered the facts can doubt that our civilized varieties of this species have something like a hundred times as much which deserves utterance as their savage forefathers possessed . Yet the capacity for giving note to these thoughts or emotions has not gained anything like the proportion to the needs . It seems , however , that some gain in this direction has been made , and that much may be won hereafter in the way of further advance . Never having known the species whence our dogs came in its wild state , we are uncertain as to its modes of expression ; but observing the varieties of dogs which are kept by savages , it seems tolerably sure that the primitive canines used their voice only in howling or yelping ; that is , as a continuous sound akin to the bellowings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of all these primitive forms of utterance that they are , to a great extent , involuntary , and that when the outcry is begun it continues in a mechanical manner , with no trace of modulation arising from the conditions of the moment . In other words , these actions resemble in a way sneezing or hiccoughing in human kind ; actions which are stimulated by certain states of the body , but which are not at all under the control of the will . Howling or bellowing doubtless represents in a measure a state of mind as well as of body , but the action is of a general and uncontrolled kind . The effect of advancing culture upon a dog has been gradually to decrease this // ancient undifferentiated mode of expression afforded by howling and yelping , and to replace it by the much more speechlike bark . There is some doubt whether the dogs possessed by savages have the power of uttering the sharp specialized note which is so characteristic of the civilized forms of their species . It is clear , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it but rarely . On the other hand , our high-bred dogs have to a great extent lost the power to express themselves in the ancient way . Many of our breeds appear to have become incapable of ululating . There is no doubt but this change in the mode of expression greatly increases the capacit*y of our dogs to set forth their states of mind . If we watch a high-bred dog , one with a wide range of sensibilities , which we may find in breeds which have long been closely associated with man , we may readily note five or six varieties of sound in the bark , each of which is clearly related to a certain state of mind . The bark of welcome , of fear , of rage , of doubt , and of pure fun are almost always perfectly distinct to the educated ear , and this although the ob - server may not be acquainted with the creature ; if he knows him well he may be able to distinguish various other intonations : those which express irnpatience and even an element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not seem to me that we should regard the bark as a new and useful invention ; there are , indeed , few such in the organic world ; the sound appears to me to have been derived from the primitive habit of howling . If we hearken to this utterance we perceive that it is not an unbroken sound , but is somewhat intermittent . At either end of the prolonged sound we can often notice that it is divided into rather distinct yelps more or less completely separated from the other notes . The cries of a dog when beaten often exhibit the same peculiarity ; so , too , the puppy , before he has attained skill in barking , will often prolong each utterance in a way which makes its relation to the ancient mode of expression tolerably clear . At the risk of being deemed fanciful , I venture to suggest that the bark is in effect a division of the howl into clearly separated notes , the change having come about as a similar alteration is effected in our own speech , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to express . I conceive that while the primitive and massive emotions found satisfying utterance in the long - drawn notes , the more divided state of mind of the humanized successor has led to a change in its utterances . Although these modifications of speech , if such we may term them , have doubtless been developed on the basis of the dog 's human relations , there is , it seems to me , good reason to believe that the diversities in note have come to have a distinct conventional value between the individuals of all the different breeds . Anyone who closely observes these animals must have noticed the fact that the degree of attention they give to the utterances of their kindred varies in a way which indicates that they have great varieties of denotations . Some of the shades of meaning which a dog 's bark has to others of his species probably escape our less fine ears . The creation of something like a language among our civilized dogs has naturally been accompanied by the development of an understanding of human speech . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdote on this point , there is enough which is well attested , sufficient indeed which has come within the limits of my own observation , to make it clear that dogs , even without deliberate teaching , frequently acquire a tolerably clear understanding of a number of words and even of short phrases . They will catch these not only when given in distinct command , but when uttered in an ordinary tone without any sign that they relate to their affairs . It is true that these understood words generally relate to some action which the dog is accustomed to perform , yet there are instances so well attested that they deserve credit , which seem to show that the creatures can get some sense of the drift of conversation even when it is carried on by persons with whom they are not familiar and does not clearly relate to their own affairs . It should be observed that within the // narrow limits of this essay little or no effort has been made to interpret the state of mind of dogs from the vast but rather untrustworthy mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large a part of this evidence is contaminated by prepossessions and a yet larger part is so unverified in any scientific sense , that for purposes of sound inquiry it is worthless . It therefore seems best to limit ourselves , as has been done in this paper , to those general actions of the creatures which are matters of common knowledge and safely beyond question . From these indices we are able to determine a basis for some important conclusions . These are in effect as follows , viz. Our domestic dog is derived from a species , one or more , akin to the wolf , the jackal , and the fox ; to a group of animals not characterized by great native intelligence , but distinguished for their ferocity and their general untamableness . There is no reason to believe that the primitive dog had any more foundation for his great attainments than his obstinately savage kindred , except that he may have had a greater disposition to form an attachment to a master . We can hardly believe that he had any share of that marvellous sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-bred varieties of his species . All this vast transformation , which from a psychological point of view has carried the dog relatively as far up above his origin as civilization has lifted man above his lowest estate , has been due to human intercourse and the long and effective concomitant selection of good from bad . It is hardly too much to say that a large part of our human nature has been transferred into the descendants of this ancient wild beast . The sense of property , a great part of human affections , many of the attributes which constitute the gentleman , have been passed over to his possession . Vast as has been the work of man upon the dog-it deserves , indeed , to be ranked high among all the great accomplishments of his culture-there is reason to believe that if he but go forward with understanding in the ways which have hitherto led him blindly to his success , the final result may be very much more perfect than that which has been attained . It is on this account that I feel it fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue . Except in the case of dogs used in sport and for herding sheep , the sole effort appears to be to create breeds which shall exhibit peculiarities of form which are mere extravagances and move the real lover of this noble animal to indignation . In these preposterous and unseemly tasks no care is taken to continue the mental development on lines which have been established by long use . Still less is there any effort to essay the development of the intelligence in ways which are clearly open to us , and which afford possibilities of lifting this species to a yet nobler companionship with our own kind.
