txt The House Committee on Judiciary has been discussing Senator Hill 's bill " to prevent government by injunction , " and will be ready to report to the House in a few days . The intent of the bill , as it passed the Senate , was to put a limit on the power of Federal Judges to punish for long-range contempt . It met with very little opposition In the Senate , but a disposition has been developed in the House Committee to tack on amendments which will prevent the passing of the measure this session . The amendment which the committee seems determined to add , and which is lOoked upon as tantamount to defeat , is one relieving from direct and peremptory jurigdietion of the court : persons cited for contempt in failing to obey subpdenas . The indications point to the death of the Hill bill by being loaded down with dangerous and Offensive amendments . SHERMAN ON PAPER MONEY .

The letter was written in the Senate Chamber at Washington , and is as follows : " Mr. Albert H. Walker . " My Dear Sir : Your kind note of the 26th ult. is received . I do not sympathiie with the movement proposed to retire Unified States notes from circulation . I believe it is easy to maintain a limited amount of these in circulation , without danger or difficulty . " The maintenance in 4irctilation of $346 , - 000,000 United States notes ; supported by a reserve of $100,000,000 gold , not only saves the interest on $246,000,000 of debt , but is a vast convenience to the people at large . " The best form of paper money is that which is backed by the Government and maintained at the specie standard . The absolute security of these notes was never called in question , after the resumption of specie payments in 1879 , until the reserve was being trenched upon , to meet deficiencies in Current revenue , brought about by what is known as the Wilson tariff law of 1894 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
