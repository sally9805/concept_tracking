txt Chicago 's wheat trade was upset early by some surprising buying for a local operator . This was followed by just as surprising sealing , and a decided break in prices to the lowest point of the week . For the first hour December wheat sold at 761/4 cents and 74% cents ; May at 80 cents and 78 cents . The shrewdest brokers in the pit were at a loss to know whether the early activity in wheat was legitimate or forced by certain leaders . If it was manipulation they could not tell whether the shaking up and shaking out of the first hour was to make a strong market to sell out on or a weak market to buy in additional lines . One commission house , very shortly after the opening , took about 500,000 bushels of wheat . This gave the sharp up turn . On the advance there was just as good evidence of selling by bull leaders . There was a drop in prices of 2 cents straight in one hour after the early bulge , followed by a rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade was the London report of rains in India . The cable news said rains on two coasts had benefited crops , and conditions favored rains for the interior wheat sections . Liverpool cables came 3d. lower for wheat . This looked as if the English houses accepted the rap-4 reports .. The night report on what San Francisco did yesterday was of a bearish character . There was some selling by New-York . Argentina reported 80,000 bushe.s of wheat shipped for the week . Bradstreet 's report on exports was 3,931,000 bushels of wheat and flour , both coasts . This was encouraging to buyers . St. Louis showed remarkable strength at 8 cents to 10 cents over Chicago . Altogether , a much firmer tone prevailed toward the close . Shorts covered , fearing a bull market Monday on decreased stocks . The late advance was to 757/s cents , December , and 79% cents , May , only three-eighths of a cent under top prices of the morning , and one-half of a cent over last night .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
