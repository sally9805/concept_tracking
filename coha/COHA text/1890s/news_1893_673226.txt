txt ABUSES IN THE PENSION SERVICE . Owing to a popular demand for information as to the methods which have prevailed in the Pension Bureau , and to a belief that persons employed in the pension service can now criticise those methods without exposing themselves to punishment , there have recently been published several interesting articles in which pension abuses have been discussed by experts . One of the best of these may be found in the Century for May . the author being A. B. CASSELMAN , who began his term of service in 1881 as a clerk , was for some years Special Examiner and Supervising Examiner of the Chicago district , and for the last three years has been a member of the Board of Pension Appeals . We can direct attention here to only a few of Mr. CASSELMAN 'S assertions and opinions . It should be remembered , he remarks at the beginning , that the business of the bureau has been conducted hitherto with a view to political results . Each Commissioner has sought to issue more pension certificates than were issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of haste and a desire to make a record for political effect , has tended to encourage and invite fraud . The effect of the domination of a political purpose , in bureau methods and in legislation , has been to obliterate distinctions which ought to have much weight . For example , " it counts nothing in favor of a claimant that he served four years , and nothing against him that he served only three months . The lateness of filing an application counts nothing against an applicant . Thus A , who served four years and was wounded in battle , filed his application in 1865 and is receiving a pension of $4 per month for his wound . B , who served three months in 1861 , and was never in a battle , filed his claim in 1888 , and is now receiving a. pension of $30 per month for ' malarial poisoning . ' " The laxity which has prevailed is illustrated by a case in which a pension was granted for partial deafness . The application was filed in 1885 , the claimant alleging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim was allowed in 1892 , but it was decided that the payments should begin in 1891 , on the ground that there was evidence that not until that year had the deafness become sufficiently developed to call for a pension . Upon appeal a pension was granted from 1885 , and the decision was applied to all similar cases . In this instance " it was officially admitted that the deafness did not develop in a pensionable degree until twenty-nine years after the termination of the claimant 's military service . " Claims for pensions in the cases of insane persons afford opportunities for collusion and fraud . " I do not regard it as improbable , " says Mr. CASSELNIAN , " that more or less collusion has been practiced in the allowance of such claims . A pension of $3,000 , $5,000 , or $8.000 , with a current rate of $30 , $50 , or $72 per month , paid to the guardian of an insane man who is confined iu an asylum , and who probably has no near relatives , is well adapted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to suspect collusion in the allowance of a pension of $4 per month ; but it is quite different in respect to a , pension of $50 or $72 per month , with back pension amounting to $5,000 or $10,000 . " He is of the opinion that " a large percentage of the admitted claims of this character are entirely without merit . " Much depends upon the local boards of examining surgeons . Mr. CASSELMAN thinks that a majority of these boards are efficient and honest , but he has this to say about one of them : " I was told recently that the Secretary of a certain board in a ' Western city had declared that no claimant should ever be turned from their office without a favorable recommendation ; and I find that the record of this board confirms the statement of my informant . This board rendered during the year about 900 certificates , 250 of which I examined in consecutive order without finding one in which they did not describe the claimant as being entitled to a substantial rate of pension . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to about $1,750,000 per annum . Mr. CASSELMAN suggests that the pension expenditures can be reduced materially without injustice to any one by a reduction of rates that are excessive . Those who are receiving the higher rates are frequently those who were the latest to file their claims , who were but a short time in the service , and whose claims are the most dubious in character , but have been pushed with the most vigor and persistency . Since 1885 the average rate paid per month has increased by 26 per cent , and this increase has not been caused by legislation . In the last five years the number of those drawing $24 per month has increased 80 per cent. , . while the increase for those receiving $30 has been 66 per cent , and the number of pensioners drawing $50 or $72 has been enlarged by 45 per cent . The increase in the average rate per month for all pensioners in the last five years amounts to more than $15,000 ; 000 per annum . It is supposed by many persons that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But such disclosures as are made in Mr. CASSELMAN 'S article show that while unwise legislation has supplied a warrant or an excuse for an increase , a very large part of the addition has been caused by the reckless course of public officers whose purpose has been to make the payments as large as possible . We believe that if the pension laws had been enforced rigidly , and if the rules of evidence had been carefully observed in the consideration of applications , the annual pension expenditures would now be less by $40,000,000 than the slim that will be paid this year .
