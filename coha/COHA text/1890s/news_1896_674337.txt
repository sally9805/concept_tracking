txt Flarper 's Magazine for December contains an article on this subject by Dr. WILLIAM W. JAcQuks . It is valuable as a brief and very clear statement of a partial solution of the most important industrial problem of the day . For a long time now the brightest minds in the world of science and invention have been intently and patiently at work trying to discover the means of getting electricity direct from some form of chemical action , instead of , as now , from the use of the force of steam produced by the evaporation of water by the heat resulting from ' the combustion of coal . Dr. JAcquEs states that he has " surprised qwq , even combustion and heat itself and convert the stored-up energy of coal directly into electricity . " The apparatus first used was very simple . A platinum crucible was partially filled with common potash , kept liquid by suspension over a gas flame . A lump of coke was hung in the potash by a platinum wire . Into the molten potash a stream of air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the negative pole , and a second wire attached to the crucible was the positive pole of the generator . The oxygen of the air combined with the carbon ; the production of heat was prevented by the liquid ; a conducting path was afforded in which a current of electricity was developed ; the two wires were attached to a small electric motor which moved in proportion to the current of air blown Into the liquid . Defining an " electrolytic carrier " as a liquid which allows atoms of oxygen and a current of electricity to pass through it , Dr. JACQUES pays : " Stated scientifically , my discovery is that if the oxyg-n of the air be caused to comb.ne with carbon , not directly as in combustion , but through an intervening electrolytic carrier , the stored-up energy of the carbon may be converted directly into electrical energy , and not into heat . " Stated crudely , my invention consists in generating electricity by causing the oxygen of the air to combine with coal beneath the level of a su.table liquid . " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to a point where it is commercially available , though he thinks that he has made substantial progress and believes that the object con be attained . If his belief is justified , there is , of course , nothing less than a revolution impending more im- ' portant in its ultimate effects than the discovery of steam power and the invention of the steam engine . Electricity is already not only a motive power , but a source of heat and light . It is now produced , according to Dr. JACQUES , at an average waste of 97.4 per cent. , and by the use of only 2.6 per cent . of the energy theoretically obtainable from coal , though the maximum results are at least three times as good as this . Dr. JACQUES 'S two-horse-power apparatus , he says , saves 32 per cent . That is an enormous gain . Imagine the value of the coal supply of the world multiplied by four , taking the best results now got , or by twelve , taking the average ; then imagine even that gain doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow
