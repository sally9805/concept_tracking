txt Thomasville , for the first time since the President 's visit , was rife with political gossip to-day . Jekyl Island , which the President will visit on Monday , speculation ran , was to be the scene of an important political gathering , where the future course of the Republican Party would be gone over and settled far from the public and the press , and shielded from intrusion by strict enforcement of the " no trespassing " regulations . of the club , The sudden appearance of Speaker Reed at Jekyl Island , the authoritative statement that President , Vice - President Hobart . and Senator Hanna would make their trip there on Monday , and the visit of Judge Day , formerly Secretary of State , to Thomasville , though absolutely mere coincidence , according to the gentlemen named , revived at once recollections of the important part in National history born of Thomasville conferences four years ago . The conferences now , said the gossip , were to be transferred to Jekyl Island . Senator Ham-ia . Vice President Hobart , and President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their present visit South , and that it is undertaken solely for rest and recuperation . As to Speaker Reed 's presence at Jekyl Island , both Senator Hanna and Vice President Hobart said they did not know the Speaker was there until they saw the papers . The latter , before the arrival of the papers , was so positive that the Speaker was not to be at Jekyl Island that when newspaper man told him Mr. Reed was to be there he promptly bet him a suit of clothes that Speaker Reed was not at Jekyl Island and would not be at Jekyl . The news , it was evident , was also surprising to others in the President 's party , who ordinarily would have heard of it if there had been any comment about the house on the subject . As regards Judge Day , he is not going to Jekyl , and probably will be out of Thomasville on the way home by the time the President returns . There is , nevertheless , a possibility that the Jekyl Island trip , though not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important political bearing . It is thought that it may prove to be the reconciliation ground of President and Speaker Reed . That their relations are strained and development of party policy in legislation hindered thereby is a matter of common report . Judge Moore , whose guest Speaker Reed is , and Cornelius N. Blis ; , who asked President and party to visit him , are common friends of all parties personally and politically , and through them harmonious fellowship may again prevail between the two foremost Republicans . Should this consummation come , it is thought likely that neither the Speaker nor the President would have been : privyto its inception . for knowledge by them of such an ulterior hope by their hosts would have prevented its accomplishment . This view is held to be entirely consistent with the statements of the principal persons who will be there , for they declared absolutely that politics " cut no figure " in the trip , and their denials were broad and comprehensive . Judge Day arrived in Thomasville at 2:40 this afternoon . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Mrs. Day being tired , retired for an hour or so . His cheeks were tanned and he seemed to have gained a little flesh . Late in the afternoon he said : " We are working our way north from Palm Beach , and , hearing that Thomasville was a fine place , we decided to stop here and pay our respects to the President . I wanted to see him and Mrs. Day wanted to see Mrs. . Yes , you will be safe In saying positively that neither politics nor international affairs are in any way connected with our visit . We are here only to pay our respects to the President and enjoy ourselves . " Judge Day said that he was not going to Jekyl Island , and would leave here for the North the early part of next week . Senator Hanna learned of his arrival and called as the correspondent was talking to Judge Day . The Senator , when told of the reports that there was to be a big " pow-wow " at Jekyl with Speaker Reed and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about political conferences bn this trip . It is for rest and nothing else . I wish they would let up talking about politics being in it . The Vice President had the grip and is run down , and I mean to keep him here as long as I stay . Mr. 's nerves were worn out with the strain . He needed to ' brace up . ' These drives about here and the quiet life are just building him right up . You see how much better he is . No ; the trip to Jekyl Island has nothing to do with politics . We would not come way down here to talk politics . YeS , I see Speaker Reed is at Jekyl , but it has nothing to do with our trip . " To-day an aged and bent negro , with shaggy white locks , stumped on a cane past the Hanna home . He did not look up , but cast furtive glances at the house . Behind came another aged negro , wearing huge green goggles and apparently over eighty years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a dozen old negro men and two old " mammies. " one with her woolly hair bound in a red bandana. had gone past the gate . Then they hobbled around the house . Some were too backward even to look up and over the fence . A dozen times they made the circuit , stealing glances across the lawn . At last two or three plucked up a little spirit after much urging from their companions . But the direct route thrcugh the gate was too much for them . They went to the side gate and sidled along the path . keeping ir the seclusion of the porch . Mrs. Hanna and Charles Cain . her nephew , saw them ,  --  and asked what they wanted . They replied that they would like to see the President . Mrs. Hanna said perhaps she could gratify them . She went into the house , and presently the President was leaning over the rail shaking hands with them and the others , who meanwhile had gathered courage to join their scouts .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
