txt Blessings and benefactions were show-. ered upon Columbia College yesterday . President Low 's gift may fairly be called colossal . Very few men have ever given away a million dollars for any purpose . Only a man of great wealth could have undertaken out of his own money to build the splendid new library building of the college . Only a man of President Low 's deep attachment to the college and sincere devotion to " the things it stands for " would have done it . And as a memorial of his father , the President 's gift to Columbia becomes not only generous almost beyond precedent , but inexpressibly gracious as a mark of filial reverence . The gifts of Mr. William C. Schermerhorn and of Mr. F. Augustus Schermerhorn are Iess notable only because Mr. Low made ? it mighty hard for anybody who came after him . He must have a long spoon who would sup with a certain Personage , says the ancient proverb . He must have a long purse and a big heart who would play the game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Trustees are the best possible judges of the kind of buildings it needs most . In giving $300,000 to the college for any kind of a building the Trustees might determine that it most needed , Mr. William C. Schermerhorn showed himself to be not only generous , but practical-minded . A conditioned and restricted gift to a college is often an embarrassment to its Trustees and of questionable advantage . Mr. F. Augustus Schermerhorn 's present to the college is unique , but useful and desirable . Congress has been repeatedly advised by The Times and by many other newspapers to buy the Townsend Library of War Records . It is a valuable collection for historical purposes , and we are glad it is to stay in New-York . Columbia is fortunate in her distinguished President , in her Trustees , and in her alumni . She needs more buildings . But what a list of children she has to look to for the multitudinous roofs she requires ! On the roll are the names of Astor , Goelet , Cutting , Stevens , Field , Rhinelander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aldrich , Taylor , and Higgins . If President Low 's example is immediately inspiring to other sons of Columbia , Morningside Heights will not hold her domiciles.
