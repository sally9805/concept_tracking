txt British pride in the navy of Great Britain does not close the eyes - act all British writers to what they admit may be defects in the establishment . The fault to which The Pall Mall Gazette has just directed attention is not one of a - serious kind . It does not attribute to the men who have built the fine battleships and Cruisers for England any neglect to embody in the new vessels the best and most approved ideas in naval architecture and ordnance . The complaint is one of a sentimental nature , a rather impatient and analytical protest against what appears to be a disposition on the part of the Admiralty to ' name warships without due regard for the great events and the helloes of British ' history . The heedlessness occasionally suggested in the naming of new vessels provokes the fear that the example may have been imitated of the Lord of the Admiralty who labeled English ships with alien names ' out of a lexicon . While " Agamemnon " is tolerable because it recalls Nelson and his dearest ship , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Andromache " is objected to , and so is " Aphllo , " Which the sailors - call " Andramaich " and " Appolo , " with great stress on the last " o . " Of eighty-three British iron-clads , twenty-five have Classical names ; four only recall victories by . sea , and two are named for achievements on land ; seven are called after Admirals , eight after great Englishmen or the royal house , four are named for French prizes won in hard fight , five are names of places , nine are adjectives , and eighteen are named by " divers nouns . " Some of the names not historically English , such as " Renown " and " Caesar , " are considered tolerable by the British critic . But " Jupiter " and " Hannibal , " " Illustrious " and " Victorious , " are considered most unhappy , and two of the names are disapproved as " a pair of ridiculous adjectives . " " Brunswick , " it is insisted , should not be a fine name - going begging for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically cherished names as " Vanguard , " the ship that fought the Armada , that was with Blake , and that bore Nelson 's flag at the Nile . And it is somewhat impatiently objected that " Defiance , " " Defence , " " London , " " Captain , " " Impregnable , " " Goliath , " and " Culloden , " with other names of ships that have figured in famous actions , should not be dropped - from the - naval list . This feeling of regret has recalled in the mind of The Pall Mall Gazette critic the conceit of the Roman Emperor who served upon his table viands that began with the same letter . And it has - seemed to him that the notion of the sovereign who made a feast of " . pig , pie , puddings , pork , pancakes " might have inspired the men . who Chose " Barrosa , " " Barracouta , " " Blonde , " and other names meaningless and devoid of association . As for the gunboats , which are called " worthless ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plover , " " Pheasant , " and " Partridge " seem to be fitting , in the estimation of the critic of the Admiralty , who declares that the torpedo destroyers have had " most unworthy - names ; " without endearing associations , " dumped down upon them " with such labels as " Sturgeon , " " Sunfish , " " Swordfish , " and the like . No " Cromwell " or " Chatham " or " Drake " " Alfred " or " Elizabeth " or " Henry VIII. , " it is regretted , has been provided for the navy . The naming of vessels for the ' United States Navy is regulated by statute , - but within - the statutory limits the Secretary of the Navy has an opportunity to encourage local pride by the selection of names . It is only incidentally and occasionally that historical names find employment . Our - naval list carries a few names of ships that are historically famous , but there is no " Hull " or " Decatur " or " Lawrence " or " Bainbridge " or - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , but they were dropped as the vessels which carried them disappeared from the navy . " Kearsarge " is to be continued , by speeisl act , as a firstclass battleship , and by - and by there may be a new " Constitution " and perhaps a " John Paul Jones " and a " Parragut . " Our plan of naming warships for States and cities commands : the approval of the writer who attributes something like undignified frivolity to the lack of national pride in the British haphazard selection of names . The Pall Mall Gazette says of our method ; " The United States christens its splendid cruisers after great cities , its battleships after States . We might take a leaf from ow cousins ' book , especially as there is English precedent for it , and it would interest the people in the navy , which is , after all , one great object to be striven for . These things may seem trifles , but there is a philosophy of ' names which tells that great titles Procreate , great deeds in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And let us hive no more fishes among our destroyers , but make a change for the better by henceforth calling them after Captains who have fallen galiantly in battle  --  Riou , Harvey , and their like . No service has such splendid traditions as ours , no Admiralty so forgetful of its traditions .
