The walk are white woodwork , framing in old tapestries of deep foliage design , with here and there a flaming flamingo ; white furniture with old , green brocade cushions . The room is in the purest Louis XVI . The noon sunlight streams through a window on the Left . On the opposite side is a door to the hall . At back double doors open into a corridor which leads to the ballroom . At Left Centre are double doors to the front hall . A great , luxurious sofa is at the left , with chairs sociably near it , and on the other side of the room a table has chairs grouped about it . On floral small table are books and objets d'art , and everywhere there is a profusion of white roses and maidenhair fern . In the stage directions Left and Right mean Left and Right of actor , as he faces audience . Three smart-looking Servants are peering through the crack of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , slender Maid is on a chair . The elderly Butler dignifiedly stands on the floor . The plump , overfed little Housemaid is kneeling so as to see beneath the head of the Butler . Housemaid . Housemaid Gasping . Oh , ai n't it a beautiful sight ! Butler . Butler Pompously . Not to me who ' ave seen a Lord married in Hengland . Maggie . Maggie Oh , you make me sick , Mr. Potts , always talking of your English Aristocracy ! I 'm sure there never was no prettier wedding than this . Nor as pretty a bride as Miss Jinny . Butler . Butler Correcting her . Mrs. Haustin ! Housemaid . Housemaid She looks for all the world like one of them frosted angels on a Christmas card . My , I wish I could ' a ' seen her go up the aisle with the organ going for all it was worth ! Maggie . Maggie It was a beautiful sight ! Butler . Butler A good many ' appens to be ' aving the sense to be going now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do , " and make them other remarks ? Maggie . Maggie Yes , plain , though her voice was trembly like . But Mr. Austin he almost shouted ! Laughing nervously in excitement . Butler . Butler ' E 's glad to get ' er ! Maggie . Maggie And her him ! Housemaid . Housemaid Yes , that 's what I likes about it Did any one cry ? Maggie . Maggie Mrs. Tillman . Lots of people are going now . Housemaid . Housemaid What elegant clothes ! Oh , gosh ! Butler . Butler S uperciliously . Mrs. Cullingham do n't seem in no ' urry ; she 's a common lot ! Maggie . Maggie I do n't care , she 's rich and Miss Jinny likes her ; she just throws money around to any poor person or church or hospital that wants it , or do n't ! So she ca n't be so very common neither , Mr. Potts ! Housemaid . Housemaid Say , I catch on to something ! Young Mr. Tillman 's sweet on that there tall bridesmaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler Miss Chester . I 've seen there was something goin ' hon between them whenever she 's dined or lunched ' ere . Maggie . Maggie A ngry . ' Tai n't true ! Butler . Butler I 'll bet my month 's wages . Maggie . Maggie I do n't believe you ! Butler . Butler Why , what 's it to you , please ? Maggie . Maggie Saving herself . Nothing  --  Housemaid . Housem aid Well , I guess it 's truth enough . That 's the second time I 've seen him squeeze her hand when no one was n't lookin ' . Maggie . Maggie Here , change places with me ! Getting down from her chair . If you was a gentleman , Mr. Potts , you 'd have given me your place ! Witheringly . Butler . Butler If I was a gentleman , miss , I would n't be here ; I 'd be on the other side of the door . He moves the chairs away Maggie . Maggie To Housemaid . Honest , you saw something between them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? Mr. Geoffrey and Miss Chester  --  Housemaid . Housemaid Cheese it ! they 're coming this way ! She and the Maid and the Butler vanish through the door Right . Geoffrey and Ruth enter through the double doors quickly at back . Geoffrey is a young , good-looking man , but with a weak face . He is of course very smartly dressed . Ruth is a very serenely beautiful girl , rather noble in type , but unconscious and unpretending in manner . They close the doors quickly behind them . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman We 'll not be interrupted here , and I must have a few words with you before you go . He follows her to the sofa where she sits , and leans over it , with his arm about her shoulder . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Oh , Geof ,  --  Geof , why were n't we married like this ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman It could n't be helped , darling ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester It is n't the big wedding I miss , oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did we have to steal off to Brooklyn , to that poor , strange little preacher in his stuffy back parlour , and behave as if we were doing something of which we were ashamed ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman You love me , I love you ,  --  is n't that the chief thing , dearest ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester But how much longer must we keep it secret ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Till I can straighten my affairs out . I ca n't explain it all to you ; there are terrible debts ,  --  one more than all the others ,  --  a debt I made when I was in college . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester If I could only help you ! I have a little money . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman No , I love you too much ; besides , this debt is n't money , and I hope to get rid of it somehow before long . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Forgive me for worrying you . It is only that every one is so happy at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , as I would be ,  --  and it 's made me feel  --  a little  --  Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Comes around the sofa and sits beside her . I know , dear , and it 's made me feel what a brute I am ! Oh , if you knew how I hate myself for all I 've done , and for the pain and trouble I cause you now ! Maggie , her sharp features set tense , appears in the doorway on the left behind the curtains and listens . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Never mind , we wo n't think of that any more . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman I can never throw it off , not for a minute ! I 'm a worthless fellow and how can you love me  --  Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Interrupting him . I do ! You are worth everything to me , and you will be worth much to the world yet ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman I love you , Ruth  --  that 's the one claim I can make to deserve you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beastly pleasures I used to indulge in ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Softy . Geof ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Which I used to think the only things worth living for , and which now , thanks to you , I loathe ,  --  every one of them . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester I 'm so glad ! I 've been some help , then . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman If I 'd only got you earlier , I 'd have been a different man , Ruth ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Smiling and taking his nervous hand in hers . Then I might n't have fallen in love with you if you were a different man ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Dear girl ! Anyway , this is the good news that I want to tell you  --  I hope now to have things settled in a couple of weeks . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester In glad relief . Geoffrey ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman But  --  I may n't be successful ; it might be , Ruth  --  it might be , we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chester Quietly . I do n't think I could bear that ! It 's not easy for me to lie and deceive as I 've had to the last few months ; I do n't think I could keep it up . Peter Cullingham enters suddenly , from the ballroom , a pale young man , but , unlike Geoffrey , hard and virile . Peter . Peter Cullingham Oh , here you are ! I say , are you two spoony ? Just the way I feel ! Laughing . I caught and hugged old Mrs. Parmby just now ! I think it 's sort of in the air at weddings , do n't you ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Rising . I 'm surprised to see you 've left the refreshment table , Peter . Peter . Peter Cullingham They sent me to find Miss Chester  --  they 're going to cut the bridesmaid 's cake , and if you two really are spoony , Miss Chester , you 'd better not miss it  --  you might get the ring ! They laugh as Peter takes out a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he puts in his mouth . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Also rising . I 'd better go . Peter is making frantic efforts to swallow the tablet . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Noticing him . What 's the matter with you ? Peter . Peter Cullingham O dear ! I 've eaten so many ices and fancy cakes , I 've got awful indigestion , and I 'm trying to swallow a charcoal tablet . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Come with me and get a glass of water . Peter . Peter Cullingham No , it 's very bad to drink water with your meals ; but I 'll get a piece of bridesmaid 's cake  --  that 'll push it down ! Peter and Ruth go out through the double doors . The moment they are out of the room , Maggie comes from behind the curtain and goes straight up to Geoffrey . He looks astonished and frightened . Geoffrey . Geof frey Tillman What do you want ? Have you been listening ? Maggie . Maggie So that 's it , is it ? You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman With relief . What do you mean ? Maggie . Maggie Oh , I may not have heard everything , but I heard and saw enough to catch on that you 're in love with Miss Chester . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Well ? Maggie . Maggie Well , you wo n't marry her  --  I 'll never set you free . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Sh ! Looking about and closing the doors . Maggie . Maggie Oh , they 're all in the dining room . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Angry . What do you want , anyway ? Maggie . Maggie She pleads a little . When I came here to your house and got a position , it was because I loved you , if you had treated me bad , and I hoped by seeing you again , and being near you , you might come back to me and everything be made straight ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Never ! Never ! It 's impossible . Maggie . Maggie Angry again . Oh , is it ! Well , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue quiet so long 's you behave yourself and do n't run after any other girls ! But the minute you try to throw me down , I 'll come out with the whole story . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman I was drunk when I married you ! Maggie . Maggie More shame to you ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman You 're right . But I was only twenty  --  and you  --  led me on  --  Maggie . Maggie I nterrupting him . Me ! led you on ! me , as decent and nice a girl as there was in New Haven if I do do housework , and that 's my wedding ring and you put it there , and mother 's got the certificate locked up good and safe in her box with my dead baby sister 's hair and the silver plate off my father 's coffin ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman We must n't talk here any more ! Maggie . Maggie You look out ! If I was n't so fond of your sister Miss Jinny , and if the old people were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right up here  --  now ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman I 'll buy you off if I ca n't divorce you ! Maggie . Maggie You ! Poof ! Girls ' voices are heard from the ballroom . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Look out  --  some one 's coming ! Maggie . Maggie Going . You have n't got a red cent ; my cheque 's always one of your father 's ! She goes out Right . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Good God ! what am I going to do  --  shoot myself , if I do n't get out of this soon  --  I must get some air ! He goes out Left . Jinny opens the double doors , looks in , and then enters . She is an adorable little human being , pretty , high-strung , temperamental , full of certain feminine fascination that defies analysis , which is partly due to the few faults she possesses . She is , of course , dressed in the conventional wedding-dress , a tulle veil thrown over her face . Jinny . Jinny Austin Not a soul ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridesmaids  --  nice girls every one of them  --  and also , very slyly , by Susie , a very modern spoiled child , who sits unobserved out of the way at the back . Now , my dears , I wish to say good-by all by ourselves so I can make you a little speech ! All laugh gently . In the first place I want to tell you that there 's nothing like marriage ! And you must every one of you try it ! Really , I was never so happy in my life ! Grace . Miss Grace Dane Must we stand , or may we sit down ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , stand ; it wo n't be long and you 'll only crush your lovely frocks . In fact , I advise you not to lose any time sitting down again until you 've got the happy day fixed ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester You know , Jinny darling , that there is no one so glad for your happiness as your four bridesmaids are  --  is n't that so , girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace Jinny , saying , " Dear old Jinny , " " Darling Jinny , " " We 'll miss you dreadfully , " etc. , ad lib. , till they get tearful . Jinny . Jinny Austin Good gracious , girls , we must n't cry . I 'll get red eyes , and Jack 'll think what an awful difference just the marriage service makes in a woman . The doors at the back open , and Austin appears in the doorway . Austin is a typical New Yorker in appearance , thirty-two years old , good-looking , manly , self-poised , and somewhat phlegmatic in temperament . Austin . John Austin Hello ! May a mere man come in to this delectable tea party ? Jinny . Jinny Austin No , Jack ! But wait  --  by the door till I call you ! Austin . John Austin Amused . Thank you ! He goes out , closing the door . Gertrude . Miss Gertrude Wood We 'll miss you so awfully , Jinny . Jinny . Jinny Austin Just what I say ! Get a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one . Belle . Miss Belle Westing Yes , but attractive men with lots of money do n't come into the Grand Central Station by every train ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Putting her arm about her . You want too much , my dear Belle ! And you are n't watching the Grand Central Station either half so much as you are the steamer docks for a suitable person . Now do n't be angry ; you know you want a good big title , and you 've got the money to pay , but , my dear Belle , it 's those ideas of yours that have kept you single till  --  twenty-six !  --  now that you must confess was nice of me , to take off three years ! Belle . Miss Belle Westing Laughing . Jinny , you 're horrid ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No , I 'm not ! You know I 'm really fond of you , or you would n't be my bridesmaid to-day ; it 's only that I want your wedding to be as happy as mine  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to remember your disagreeable but loving friend by ! Giving her a small jewelry box . Belle . Miss Belle Westing Thank you , Jinny ! Thank you ! A little moved . Grace . Miss Grace Dane Mercy ! I hope you 're not going to take each one of us ! Jinny . Jinny Austin I am , and come here , you 're next ! Grace . Miss Grace Dane I 'll swear I do n't want to get married at all ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Do n't be silly , you icicle ! Of course you do n't ; you freeze all the men away , so that you 've no idea how nice and comfy they can be ! My advice to you , Grace darling ,  --  and I love you , or I would n't bother ,  --  is to thaw ! Laughs . I used to be awfully jealous of you  --  Grace . Miss Grace Dane Interrupting . Oh ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Yes , I was ! You 're lots prettier than I am . Grace . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But I got over it because I soon saw you were so cold , there was no danger of any conflagration near you ! Oh , I 've watched your eyes often to see if any man had lighted the fires in them yet . And now I 'm determined they shall be lighted . You 're too cold ! Thaw , dear ,  --  not to everybody ,  --  that would be like slushy weather , but do n't keep yourself so continually so far below zero that you wo n't have time to strike  --  well  --  say eighty-five in the shade , when the right bit of masculine sunshine does come along ! Here  --  with my best love ! Giving her a small jewelry box . Grace kisses Jinny . Gertrude . Miss Gertrude Wood I am the next victim , I believe ! Jinny . Jinny Austin All I 've got to say to you , Miss , is , that if you do n't decide pretty soon on one of the half dozen men you are flirting with disgracefully at present , they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in for widowers . Gertrude . Miss Gertrude Wood Mockingly . Horrors ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , I do n't know ! I suppose a widower is sort of broken in and would be more likely to put up with your caprices ! For the sake of your charm and wit and true heart underneath it all , you dear old girl you ! Giving her a small jewel box . Gertrude . Miss Gertrude Wood Thank you , Jinny . I 'm only afraid I will do the wrong thing with you away ! You know you 're always my ballast ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Nonsense ! Female ballast is no good ; masculine ballast is the only kind that 's safe if you want to make life 's journey in a love balloon . She turns to Ruth Chester . Ruth  --  the trouble with you is , you 're too sad lately , and show such a lack of interest . I should think you might be in love , only I have n't been able to find the man . Anyway , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in things . Of course , men 's affairs are awfully dull , but they do n't like you to talk about them , so it 's really very easy . All you have to do is listen , stare them straight in the eyes , think of whatever you like , and look pleased ! It does flatter them , and they think they are interesting , and you charming ! Wear this , and think of me ! Giving her a box. and be happy ! I want you to be happy  --  and I can see you are n't ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Kissing her . Thank you , dear ! Jinny . Jinny Austin There , that 's all !  --  except  --  when I come home from abroad in October , if every one of you are n't engaged to be married , I 'll wash my hands of you  --  They all laugh . Susie , sliding off her chair at back , comes forward . Susie . Susie Now , it 's my turn ! You ca n't chuck me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! where did you come from and what do you mean ? Susie . Susie Oh , you give me a pain !  --  I went up the aisle with you to-day , too  --  what 's the matter with telling me how to get married ! Jinny . Jinny Austin I 'll tell you this , your language is dreadful ; where do you get all the boy 's slang ? You do n't talk like a lady . Susie . Susie I 'm not a lady . I 'm a little girl ! Jinny . Jinny Austin You talk much more like a common boy . Susie . Susie Well , I 'd rather be a boy ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Susie , I shall tell Aunt Laura her daughter needs looking after . Susie . Susie Oh , very well , cousin Jinny . If you 're going to make trouble , why , forget it ! Turns and goes out haughtily , Right . Jinny . Jinny Austin Going to the double doors , calls . Now you can come in , Jack . Austin enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to say good-by . All your guests have gone except the Cullinghams , who are upstairs with your mother , looking at the presents . Gertrude . Miss Gertrude Wood Come ! All hands around him ! The five Girls join hands , with Austin in the centre . Belle . Miss Belle Westing We do n't care if every one else has gone or not , we 're here yet ! Austin . John Austin So I see ! But I am ordered by my father-in-law  --  ahem ! all laugh  --  to go to my room , or he thinks there will be danger of our losing our train . All the Bridesmaids . All the Bridesmaids Ad lib . Where are you going ? Where are you going ? We wo n't let you out till you tell us . Austin . John Austin I dare n't  --  I 'm afraid of my wife ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Bravo , Jack ! Grace . Miss Grace Dane Very well , then , we 'll let you out , on one condition , that you kiss us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jinny Austin No ! No ! Breaking away . He sha n't do any such thing ! They all laugh and break up the ring . Gertrude . Miss Gertrude Wood Dear me , is n't she jealous ! Belle . Miss Belle Westing Yes , it is evidently time we all went ! Good-by , Jinny ! Kissing her . A happy journey to Washington ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No , it is n't ! General good-bys . Jinny begins with Ruth at one end , and Austin at the other ; he says good-by and shakes hands with each girl . Gertrude . Miss Gertrude Wood Kissing Jinny . Good-by , and a pleasant trip to Niagara Falls ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Not a bit ! Grace . Miss Grace Dane Kissing Jinny . Good-by , I believe it 's Boston or Chicago ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Neither ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Good-by , dear , and all the happiness in the world ! Kisses her . Jinny . Jinny Austin Thank you . She turns and goes with the other three girls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Mr. Austin ? Austin . John Austin Yes ? Joining her . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Embarrassed . You like your new brother , do n't you ? Austin . John Austin Geoff ? most certainly I do , and Jinny adores him . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester I know , then , you 'll be a good friend to him if he needs one . Austin . John Austin Surely I will . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester I think he does need one . Austin . John Austin Really  --  The Girls are passing out through the doors . Belle . Miss Belle Westing Come along , Ruth . They pass out and Jinny stands in the doorway talking to them till they are out of hearing . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Sh ! please do n't tell any one , not even Jinny , what I 've said ! I may be betraying something I 've no right to do , and do n't tell him I 've spoken to you . Austin John Austin All right ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth Chester Thank you  --  and good-by . Shaking his hand again . Jinny notices that they shake hands twice . A queer little look comes into her face . Austin . John Austin Good-by . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Have they gone ?  --  Oh ! Hurrying past Jinny . Good-by , dear . She goes out through the double doors . Jinny . Jinny Austin In a curious little voice . Good-by ... She comes slowly down the room toward Austin , and smiles at him quizzically . What were you two saying ? Austin . John Austin Good-by ! Jinny . Jinny Austin But you 'd said it once to her already ! Why did you have to say good-by twice to Ruth ? Once was enough for all the other girls ! Austin . John Austin Banteringly . The first time I said good-by to her , and the second time she said good-by to me ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Do you know what I believe  --  Ruth Chester 's in love with you ! Austin . John Austin Oh , darling ! Laughs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . No wonder she was triste to-day . Austin . John Austin Laughing . Jinny , sweetheart , do n't get such an absurd notion into your head . Jinny . Jinny Austin Looks straight at him a moment , then speaks tenderly . No  --  no  --  I know it 's not your fault . There was no other woman in this house for you to-day but me , was there ? Austin . John Austin There was no other woman in the world for me since the first week I knew you . Taking her into his arms . Jinny . Jinny Austin This is good-by to Jinny Tillman ! He kisses her . Jack , darling , do you think I could sit on your knee like a little child and put my arm around your neck and rest my head on your shoulder for just five seconds  --  I 'm so tired ! Mrs. Cullingham opens the door . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Oh ! Shuts the door very quickly and knocks . Jinny and Austin laugh . Jinny . Jinny Austin Yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome , whole-souled , florid woman ; one of those creatures of inexhaustible vitality who make people of a nervous temperament tired almost on contact by sheer contrast . She is the kindest , best meaning creature in the world . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Oh , do excuse me ! I have n't any more tact !  --  and I hate to interrupt you , but I must say good-by . Calls . Peter ! Peter . Peter Cullingham Yes 'm . Entering with a glass of water and a powder . He sits in the arm-chair at right , and constantly looks at his watch . Austin . John Austin I 'm much obliged to you , Mrs. Cullingham , for the interruption , as I was sent long ago to make myself ready for the train , if you 'll excuse me ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Certainly ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Good-by ! Taking his hand as he passes her . Austin . John Austin Good-by ! He goes out Right . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham If it 's time for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep you a minute ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No , really we 've plenty of time ,  --  both sit on sofa . Was n't it a lovely wedding ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham I never saw a sweeter , my dear ! And it was perfectly elegant ! Simply great ! Jinny . Jinny Austin And is n't Jack  --  Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham He is ! And so are you ! In fact I 've been telling your mother I do n't know how to thank you both . You 've asked me to-day to meet the swellest crowd I 've ever been in where I was invited , and did n't have to buy tickets , and felt I had a right to say something besides " excuse me , " and " I beg your pardon . " Of course , I 've sat next to them all before in restaurants and at concerts , but this time I felt like the real thing myself , and I shall never forget it ! If you or your husband ever want any mining tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about mines is n't worth knowing ! Jinny . Jinny Austin I 'm as glad as I can be if you 've had a good time , and you must n't feel indebted to us . Ever since we met in Egypt that winter , mamma and I have always felt you were one of our best friends . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Of course you know it is n't for my own sake I 'm doing these stunts to get into Society . It 's all for my boy . He 's got to have the best  --  or the worst , however you look at it ! Laughing . Anyway , I want him to have a chance at it , and it belongs to him through his father , for my first husband was a real swell ! Looking at Peter lovingly . At this moment , Peter , having again looked at his watch , tips up the powder on his tongue , and swallows it down with the water . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Poor darling ! He suffers terribly from indigestion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating . Peter , we must say good-by now . Peter . Peter Cullingham Coming up . Good-by , Miss Jinny . Mrs. Cullingham .

Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Thank you  --  Rises to go . I was just saying we wo n't forget in our social life , will we , Peter , that Miss Jinny gave us the biggest boost up we 've had yet ? Jinny also rises . Peter . Peter Cullingham Well , you know , mother , I do n't think the game 's worth the candle . It 's begun to pall on me already . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter . Peter Cullingham I only go now for your sake . Mrs. Tillman , coming from Right , speaks off stage . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Jinny ! Jinny !

Peter Cullingham Many happy returns ! Jinny goes out Right . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Come , I want to give you some of Jinny 's flowers to take home with you . Would you like some ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham I should love them ! They go out through the doors at back . Peter is suffering with indigestion . He takes a charcoal tablet , and Susie cautiously enters Right . Susie . Susie There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peter Cullingham No , I gave them back to you . Susie . Susie Then they 're in there on the table  --  get ' em quick , the trunks are coming down now ! Peter goes out quickly at back , as the Butler and Man Servant enter Right , carrying a large new trunk with a portmanteau on top of it . Susie . Susie Put them right over there for a minute ! They put them down in the centre of the room , and the Footman goes out Right . And mind , you do n't split on us , Thomas . Auntie Tillman knows all about it  --  it 's just to be a nice little surprise for Cousin Jinny and my new uncle . Butler . Butler Very well , miss . He also goes out Right .

Maggie I 've been trying for a chance to see you alone . I would n't bother you , sir  --  but it 's only because I 'm fond of Miss Jinny , and of Mr. and Mrs. Tillman , and they 've all been so good to me ; I know it would nearly kill ' em if they knew . Austin . John Austin Come , Maggie , knew what ? Maggie . Maggie Well , one member of this family ai n't been good to me , sir . From this point her feelings begin to get the better of her and she speaks rapidly and hysterically . He 's been bad , bad as he could , and somebody 's got to talk to him , and I do n't see who 's a-goin ' to do it but you . If he do n't change , I 'll not hold my tongue any longer . It 's all I can do for their sakes to hold it now ! Austin . John Austin Look here , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoffrey ? Maggie . Maggie Yes , I do , sir ; he 's my husband . Austin . John Austin What ! ! Maggie . Maggie We was married when he was at Yale , sir ; I was in a shop there . Austin . John Austin But  --  ! Well , after all , is n't this your and Geoffrey 's affair ? Why bring me in ? Maggie . Maggie Because he 's making love to Miss Chester , and promising to marry her now , and if he do n't stop  --  I 'll make trouble ! Austin . John Austin But if he 's married to you , as you say  --  he ca n't marry  --  any one else . Maggie . Maggie He 's tried to make me believe our marriage ai n't legal , because he was only twenty and he 'd been drinking ! Austin . John Austin What makes you think Mr. Geoffrey cares for  --  Miss Chester ? Maggie . Maggie I just heard and see him making love to her here ! Austin . John Austin This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , and the worst is , sir , I know I ai n't good enough for him , and that 's why I 've kept still about it these three years , but I ca n't help loving him no matter how ugly he 's treated me . Breaking down into tears . I just ca n't help it ! I love him , sir , even if I 'm only a servant girl , and I ca n't stand it thinking he 's going to try and get rid of me for some one else ! She sobs out loud . Austin . John Austin Sh !  --  Maggie . Sit down a minute , and control yourself . Somebody 'll hear you , and besides they 'll be coming down presently . I 'll have a talk with Mr. Geoffrey when I come back  --  Interrupted as Geoffrey enters Left . He does n't see Maggie , who is collapsed in a corner of the sofa . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman To Austin . Ah ! Thank goodness I 've caught you ; I had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I was afraid I might have missed you ! I knew in that case Jinny would never forgive me , nor  --  I  --  myself  --  for that  --  matter  --  His voice grows less exuberant in the middle of his speech and finally at the end almost dies away , as he sees the expression in Austin 's face and realizes that something is wrong somewhere . When he stops speaking , Maggie gives a gasping sob . He hears it , and starting , sees her . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Maggie ! Austin . John Austin Geoffrey , is what this girl says true ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman That I married her in New Haven ? Yes . Maggie . Maggie Ri ses . I 'll go , please , I 'd rather go . Austin . John Austin Yes , go , Maggie ; it 's better .

It 's awful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to pieces and led a rotten life ,  --  and one night , drunk , I married her , and it is n't so much her fault . I suppose she thought I loved her ,  --  but this would break up the old lady and gentleman so , if they knew , I could n't stand it ! And Jinny , for God 's sake , do n't tell Jinny . She respects me . You wo n't tell her , will you ? Austin . John Austin No . But Maggie says you want to marry some one else now . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman With a change , in great shame . That 's true , too . He sits in utter dejection on the sofa . Austin . John Austin How are you going to do it ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman I must make money somehow and buy off Maggie . Austin . John Austin Yes , go out to Sioux Falls , get a divorce there on respectable grounds , and settle a sum of money on Maggie . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman I ca n't do anything that would give publicity , and that divorce would . Austin . John Austin Any divorce would ; you ca n't get rid of that . Geoffrey . Geoff rey Tillman I tell you I ca n't have publicity . Ruth  --  Miss Chester  --  would hear of it . Austin . John Austin Well , if she loves you , she 'll forgive your wild oats , especially as every one sees now what a steady , straight fellow you 've become . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman It 's Ruth ! But I ca n't do that No , Jack , you must help  --  you will , wo n't you ? Oh , do , for Jinny 's sake ! Help me to persuade Maggie to keep silent for good , tear up that certificate of marriage . I was only twenty ; it 's hardly legal , and I 'll settle a good sum  --  Interrupted . Austin . John Austin Going straight to him , puts his hand heavily on his shoulder . Good God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; do n't stoop to crime ! The two Men face each other a moment . Geoffrey 's head drops . Austin . John Austin Forget you ever said that ; do what I tell you when Jinny and I have gone abroad , so she will be away from it a little , and if you want money , let me know . Jinny enters Right , with nervous gaiety , covering an upheaving emotion which is very near the surface . Jinny . Jinny Austin Ready ! And there you are , Geof . I 've been sending all over the house after you ! Good-by ! Throwing her arms about him . Dear old Geof ! Have n't we had good times together ! Always , always from the youngest days I can remember  --  I do n't believe there were ever a brother and sister so sympathetic ; I know there was never a brother such a perfect darling as you were  --  I 'll miss you , Geof ! The tears come into her voice , anyway . I used to think I 'd never marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do think he is the only man in the world who could have taken me away from home , so long as you were there ! To Austin , smiling . You are n't jealous ? Austin . John Austin No ! Jinny . Jinny Austin In jest . Is n't it awful ! You ca n't make him jealous ! I think it 's a positive flaw in his character ! Not like  --  us , is he ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Dear old girl  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin Whispers to him . And I 've noticed how you 've overcome certain things , dear Geof . I know it 's been hard , and I 'm proud of you . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Sh ! Jinny , dear old sister ! I 'll miss you ! By George , Jin , the house 'll be awful without  --  but you  --  His voice grows husky.  --  just excuse me a minute ! He is about to break down , and so hurries out Right . Jinny . Jinny Austin Sniffling . He was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother to Geoffrey , wo n't you ? You know he 's been awfully dissipated , and he 's changed it all , all by himself ! If he should go wrong again  --  I believe it would break my heart , I love him so ! Austin . John Austin I 'll do more for him , if he ever needs me , than if he were my own brother , because he 's yours ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Presses his hand and looks up at him lovingly and gratefully . Thank you . Wait here just a minute ; I know he wo n't come back to say good-by . He 's gone up to his room , I 'm sure  --  I 'll just surprise him with a hug and my hands over his eyes like we used to do years ago . She starts to go out Right , and meets Mr. and Mrs. Tillman , who enter . Tillman . Mr. Tillman The carriage is here ! Jinny . Jinny Austin I wo n't be a second  --  She goes out Right . Mrs. Tillman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Austin Up to her brother . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Her father 's been locked up in his study for three hours  --  he says thinking , but to me his eyes look very suspicious ! Taking her husband 's arm affectionately . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Clears his throat . Nonsense ! Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Well , how many cigars did you smoke ? Tillman . Mr. Tillman Eight . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman The amount of emotion that a man can soak out of himself with tobacco is wonderful ! He uses it just like a sponge ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman Jack , the first thing I asked about you when I heard that  --  er  --  that things were getting this way was , does he smoke ? A man who smokes has always that outlet . If things go wrong  --  go out and smoke a cigar , and when the cigar 's finished , ten to one everything 's got right , somehow ! If you lose your temper , do n't speak !  --  a cigar , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temper all gone up in the smoke ! A woman 's happiness is safest with a man who smokes . He clears his throat , which is filling . God bless you , Jack , it is a wrench ; our only girl , you know . She 's been a great joy  --  ahem ! He quickly gets out a cigar . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Stopping him from smoking . No , no , dear , they 're going now ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman Well , the best I can say is , I wish you as happy a married life as her mother and I have had . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Thirty-five dear years ! But now , George , let me say a word  --  you always have monopolized our new son  --  he 'll be much fonder of you than me ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman Old lady !  --  Jealous !  --  Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Turn about is fair play  --  you 're jealous still of Jinny and me . She pauses a moment . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . The only rifts in our lute , Jack , have been little threads of jealousy that have snapped sometimes ! Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Nothing ever serious  --  of course , but it 's a fault that Jinny shares with us , and the only fault we 've ever been able to find . Tillman . Mr. Tillman We called her for years the girl with the green eyes . She goes it pretty strong sometimes ! Austin . John Austin Oh , that 's all right  --  I shall like it ! Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman You 'll always bear with her , wo n't you , if she should ever get jealous of you ? Austin . John Austin Of me ? I 'll never give her the chance . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman It is n't a question of chance ; you just ca n't help it sometimes , can you , George ? Tillman . Mr. Tillman No , you ca n't . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman And so  --  Austin . John Austin Do n't worry ! Your daughter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and I love Jinny so completely , so calmly , and yet with my heart , and soul , and mind , and body , she 'll never have a chance even to try to be jealous of me ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman Sh ! Jinny enters Right . Jinny . Jinny Austin I found poor Maggie up in my room crying ! She says she ca n't bear to have me go away . I think she 's sorry now she would n't come with me as maid  --  and I said good-by to cook and she sniffed ! Austin looks at his watch . Austin . John Austin Oh ! we ought to go ! Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Good-by , darling ! Kissing Jinny and embracing her a long time , while Austin and Tillman shake hands warmly and say good-by . Jinny . Jinny Austin Going to her father . Good-by , father . Dear old father ! With happy emotion . Austin meanwhile is shaking hands with Mrs. Tillman . Jinny . Jinny Austin Returns to her mother . Darling  --  oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mummy darling , I shall miss you ! You 'll send me a letter to-morrow , wo n't you , or a telegram ? Send a telegram  --  you 've got the address ! Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman With tears in her eyes . Yes , it 's written down ! Jinny . Jinny Austin You can tell father , but no one else ! Hugs and kisses her mother . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Come , Susan ! They 'll lose their train ! Jinny again embraces her father . All . All Good-by ! Good-by ! Jinny , starting to go with Austin , suddenly leaves him and runs back again to her mother and throws herself in her arms . They embrace , in tears . Jinny . Jinny Austin Good-by , mother ! Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Good-by , my darling ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman Come , come ! they 'll lose their train ! Jinny runs to Austin , and with his arms about her , they hurry to the door Left . They go through the doors at back to window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Austin face each other a moment . Jinny . Jinny Austin Looking up at him . Oh , Jack ! She throws her arms about his neck and buries her face on his shoulder . Austin . John Austin Jinny , Jinny dear , you 're not sorry ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Slowly raises her head and looks at him , smiling through her tears , and speaks in a voice full of tears and little sobs . Sorry ? Oh , no ! Oh , no ! It hurts me to leave them , but I never was so happy in my life ! He kisses her and they hurry out , with his arm about her . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman In the corridor , lifts the window . I hear the door  --  Tillman . Mr. Tillman There they are ! Susie rushes across the stage with a bowl of rice in her arms and goes out Left . Mr. and Mrs. Tillman wave and say " Good-by ! " " Good-by ! " " Good-by ! " They close the window in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom . They turn and come slowly forward , Tillman wiping his eyes and Mrs. Tillman biting her lips to keep the tears back . They come into the front room and stop , and for a second they look around the empty room . Tillman puts his hand in his pocket and takes out his cigar case . Mrs. Tillman , turning , sees him ; she goes to him swiftly and touches his arm , looking up at him through her tears . He turns to her and slowly takes her in his arms and holds her there close and kisses her tenderly on the cheek . Susie enters Left , with empty bowl , sobbing aloud , as the curtain falls ACT II ( Two months later ) The Vatican , Rome ; the Tribune of the Apollo Belvedere ; a semicircular room with dark red walls ; in the centre is the large statue of Apollo . There are doorways at Right and Left . There is a bench on the right side of the room . A single Lady Tourist enters Right , takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baedeker , goes out Left . A Papal Guard is seen passing outside in the court . A Frenchman and his Wife ( with Baedekers ) are seen approaching ; they are heard talking volubly . They enter Left . Both .

Voil un homme ! He . He Quelle grace ! She . She Quelle force ! Both talk at once in great admiration and intense excitement for a few moments . Then he suddenly drops into his ordinary tone and manner . He . He Allons , allons nous ! She . She In the same tone . Oui , j'ai faim ! They go out Right . Jinny and Austin enter Left , he looking over his shoulder . They stand a moment just inside the doorway . Jinny . Jinny Austin What are you looking back so much for , Jackie ? Austin . John Austin I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ? Austin . John Austin I did n't know who ; it just seemed to be a familiar back . Jinny . Jinny Austin Playfully . Oh , come ! I think the present works of art and your loving wife are quite enough for you to look at without hunting around for familiar backs ! Austin . John Austin And Baedeker ! Reading from Baedeker about the Apollo . Apollo Belvedere , found at the end of the fifteenth century , probably in a Roman villa  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin Of course , Apollo ! Austin . John Austin Great , is n't it ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Stunning ! She turns and looks at him , smiling quizzically . Still  --  but I suppose I 'm prejudiced ! Austin . John Austin Obtuse . Still what ? Jinny . Jinny Austin You dear old stupid ! You know , Jack , you 're deeply and fundamentally clever and brilliant , but you 're not quite  --  bright  --  not quick ! Laughing Austin . John Austin Do n't you think having one in the family quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , Jinny ? You do n't mean you 've found a family likeness in the statue over there ? I do n't want to be unappreciative , but it does n't suggest your father to me in the least ,  --  nor even Geoffrey . Jinny . Jinny Austin Stupid ! ! Of course it does n't suggest anybody to me  --  I was only thinking I sympathized with Mrs. Perkins of Boston ,  --  do n't you know the old story about her ? Austin . John Austin No , what was it ? Jinny . Jinny Austin After a quick look around to see that they are alone . Well  --  Mrs. Perkins from Boston was personally conducted here once and shown this very statue , and she looked at it for a few moments , and then turned around and said , " Yes , it 's all right , but give me Perkins !

Come , I 'm tired ; let 's sit down here and read my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bench at Right , and Jinny takes out a letter from Geoffrey . Austin . John Austin I 'll read ahead in Baedeker and you tell me if there 's any news . He opens the Baedeker and reads , and she opens and reads the letter . Where is Geof 's letter from ? Jinny . Jinny Austin New York , of course ; where else would it be ? Austin . John Austin I had an idea he was going away . Jinny . Jinny Austin Geof ! Where ? Austin . John Austin West , a good way somewhere . Jinny . Jinny Austin But why would he go West ? Austin . John Austin Oh , he had some business , I believe ; I remember thinking it was a good idea when he told me . It was the day we were married  --  I was waiting for you to come downstairs . Jinny . Jinny Austin I think it 's very funny Geof never said anything about it to me . Austin . John Austin My dear , what time had you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ! Thank heaven ! I 'm so happy , Jack ! Snuggling up to him on the bench . Austin . John Austin Steals a little , quick hug with his arm about her waist . Bless you , darling , I do n't think there was ever a man as happy as I am ! They start apart guickly as a German Couple enter Right , with a Young Daughter , who is munching a cake , and hanging , a tired and unwilling victim , to her mother 's hand . Woman .

Jinny Austin If you keep on talking like that , I shall kiss you ! Austin . John Austin What ! before the tall , white gentleman ? Motioning to Apollo . I am dumb . Jinny . Jinny Austin Very lovingly . Silly ! Well !  --  Mrs. Cullingham and Peter are over here and have brought Ruth Chester ! Austin . John Austin Speaking without thinking . Then it was her back .

The heat for two days was frightful  --  already they miss me more than he can say  --  Interrupted . Austin . John Austin I 'll bet . Jinny . Jinny Austin Father smoked nineteen cigars a day the first week I was gone . Austin . John Austin I have n't had to smoke any ! Jinny .

John Austin Of course not , but I think while you 're reading I 'll just take a little turn and see if I ca n't come across the Cullinghams . Rising . Jinny . Jinny Austin After the merest second 's pause , and looking seriously at him . Why do n't you ? Austin . John Austin I 'll bring them here if I find them  --  He goes out Right . Jinny looks up where he went off and gazes , motionless , for a few moments . Then she throws off the mood and opens a letter . Two tired Americans enter Right , a girl and her mother , Mrs. Lopp and Carrie . Mrs. Lopp . Mrs. Lopp What 's this , Carrie ? Carrie . Carrie Looking in her Baedeker .

You know she was the goddess who would n't let the men see her bathe . Mrs. Lopp . Mrs. Lopp Mercy , Carrie ! and did all the other goddesses ? I do n't think much of their habits . I suppose this is the same person those Italians sell on the streets at home , and call the Bather . Jinny is secretly very much amused , finally she speaks . Jinny . Jinny Austin Excuse me , but you are in one of the cabinets  --  and this is the Apollo Belvedere . Mrs. Lopp . Mrs. Lopp Oh , thank you very much . I guess we 've got mixed up with the rooms ,  --  seems as if there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I thought it was a man all the time ! Mrs. Lopp . Mrs. Lopp Well , what with so many of the statues only being piecemeal , as it were , and so many of the men having kinder women 's hair , I declare it seems as if I do n't know the ladies from the gentlemen half the time . Carrie . Carrie Did the rest of us go through here ? Jinny . Jinny Austin I beg your pardon ? Carrie . Carrie Thirty-four people with a gassy guide ? We got so tired hearing him talk that we jes ' sneaked off by ourselves , and now we 're a little scared about getting home ; we belong to the Cook 's Gentlemen and Ladies . Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , no , the others have n't passed through here ; probably they have gone to see the pictures ; you 'd better go back and keep asking the attendants the way to the pictures till you get there .

Oh , yes , you 'll find it much less tiring in a few days , I 'm sure . Mrs. Lopp . Mrs. Lopp Still Rome does seem a powerful way from home ! How 'll we ask for the pictures ? Carrie . Carrie Why , mommer ! " Tableaux ! " " Tableaux ! " I should think you 'd ' a ' learned that from our church entertainments ! Good-by ; thank you ever so much . Mrs. Lopp .

They all stoop to pick the collection up , Jinny helping . Jinny . Jinny Austin Handing . I 'm sure you 'll want these ! Mrs. Lopp . Mrs. Lopp Yes , indeed ; do n't you find them coupon meals very dissatisfactory ? Carrie . Carrie Thank you ever so much again . Come on , mommer ! Mrs. Lopp and Carrie go out Left . Jinny looks at her watch and goes back to her letter . Mrs. Cullingham enters Left Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Screams . Jinny ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Jumps up . Mrs. Cullingham ! They embrace .

Jinny Austin Laughing . Well , I 've this minute read a letter from Geoffrey saying you were over here . And Jack , who thought he got a glimpse of you a little while ago , went straight off to try and find you . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham What fun it is to see you  --  and how happy you look ! Jinny . Jinny Austin I could n't look as happy as I feel ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Glancing at the statue . Who 's your friend ? Nice gent , is n't he ? Laughing . Jinny . Jinny Austin Mr. Apollo ! Would you like to meet him ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Hesitates . Er  --  no  --  I do n't think ! You must draw the line somewhere ! He would n't do a thing to Corbett , would he ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Who was Corbett ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham He was a prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Do you mean to say you 've never heard of him ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , the name sounds familiar . But this , you know , is Apollo . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham No , I do n't know ; was he a champion ? Jinny . Jinny Austin No , he was a Greek god ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Oh , was he ? Well , I would n't have cared about being in the tailoring business in those days , would you ? Let 's sit down . They sit on bench Right . Of course you know we would n't accept a thing like that in Peoria , where I come from , as a gift ! No , indeed ! If the King of Italy sent it over to our Mayor , he 'd return it C.O.D . Jinny . Jinny Austin Sounds like Boston and the Macmonnies Bacchante ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Oh , my dear , worse than that ! It reminds me of a man at home who kept an underclothing store in our principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , I should think , in his window to show a suit of Jaegers on ,  --  you know , a " combination " ! And our Town Committee of Thirteen for the moral improvement of Peoria made the man take it out of his window and hang the suit up empty ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Poor man ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham You ought to see our Park !  --  you know we 've got a perfectly beautiful park ,  --  and all the men statues wear Prince Alberts , and stand like this  --  She poses with lifted arm at right angle to body.  --  as if they were saying , " This way out " or " To the monkey cage and zoo . " Jinny . Jinny Austin Laughing . But the women statues ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham My dear ! They only have heads and hands ; all the rest 's just clumps of drapery  --  we only have " Americans " and " Libertys , " anyway . They apply the Chinese emigration law to all Venuses and sich ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you say Peter and Ruth were ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Well , I left Peter  --  who is n't at all well ; I hoped this trip would help his indigestion , but it seems to have made it worse !  --  I left him  --  er  --  in a room with a lot of broken- up Venuses  --  I thought it was all right ; he was eating candy , and there was n't a whole woman among ' em ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Slight strain in her voice . How did you happen to bring over Ruth Chester ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Well , you know I always liked her . She never snubbed me in her life  --  I do n't think any one you 've introduced me to has been quite so nice to Peter and me as Mrs. Chester and her daughter . Jinny . Jinny Austin O they are real people ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Ruth is terribly depressed over something . She 's thin as a rail and the family are worried . She says there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find anything the matter with her ,  --  so Mrs. Chester asked me if I would n't take her abroad . They thought the voyage and change might do her good , and I seem to have a more cheery influence over her than most people . So here we are ! As Peter enters Left , eating . Here 's Peter ! How do you think the darling looks ? Peter . Peter Cullingham How do you do , Mrs. Austin ? Jinny . Jinny Austin How do you do , Peter ? They shake hands . I 'm sorry to hear you are seedy , but you eat too many sweet things . Peter . Peter Cullingham I 'm not eating candy ; it 's soda mints ! Showing a small bottle . I am bad to-day , mother . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham If you do n't get better , we 'll go to Carlsbad . Jinny . Jinny Austin How do you like Rome , Peter ? Peter . Peter Cullingham Oh , I do n't know  --  too much Boston and not enough Chicago to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin Laughing . I think I 'll go look for Jack and tell him you 've turned up . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Perhaps he 's found Ruth . Jinny . Jinny Austin With a change in her voice . Yes , perhaps . She goes out Right . Peter . Peter Cullingham Going to the doorway Right , calls after her . Ruth 's in a room on your left , with rows of men 's heads on shelves , Emperors and things ,  --  but gee , such a job lot ! Comes back and looks up at the statue . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Is n't it beautiful , Peter ? Peter . Peter Cullingham No , it 's too big ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Still this one is n't broken ! Peter . Peter Cullingham That 's a comfort ! Yes , it has been mended , too ! Examining . Oh , yes , it 's only another of these second-hand statues . Say , you missed one whole one , the best I 've seen yet ! A Venus off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  that 's where I 've been . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Why , Peter Cullingham ! Alone ? What kind of a Venus ? Peter . Peter Cullingham Oh , beautiful ! I forgot to take my medicine ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Was she  --  er  --  dressed , darling ? Peter . Peter Cullingham We  --  you know  --  she had been , but she 'd sort of pushed it a good way off ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham With a sigh . You know we ought to admire these things , Peter darling ; that 's partly what we 've come to Europe for ! Peter . Peter Cullingham O pshaw ! here comes a gang of tourists . Come on , let 's skip ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham But Ruth and Mrs. Austin ? Peter . Peter Cullingham We did n't agree to wait , and we can all meet at our hotel . A crowd of Tourists , led by a Guide , presses and crowds in the doorway . They drag their tired feet in a listless shuffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid bunch at the statue . One or two of the younger women nudge each other and giggle . The Guide stands a little in advance of them . The Guide describes the statue , and while he is doing so Peter and Mrs. Cullingham go out Right . Most of the Tourists turn and watch them go instead of looking at the statue . Guide . Guide This is the Apollo Belvedere , discovered at the end of the fifteenth century , some say in a Roman villa or farm-house near the Grotter Terratter . Very fine specimen both as marble and man . This statyer is calculated to make Sandow et cetery look like thirty cents . Height seven feet , weight  --  A Man Tourist . Man Tourist How much ? A Girl Tourist . Girl Tourist Was he married ? Titters from the group . Guide . Guide Give it up ! Should judge he was . The god once held a bow in his left hand and probably a laurel wreath in his right . Another Woman Tourist . Another Woman Tourist A what ? Guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good look at this , as it is a very fine piece . Now come along , please  --  make haste ; we must finish up this place before feeding ! He leads the way out Right , and the Tourists follow , shuffling along , without speaking , Mrs. Lopp and Carrie lagging in the rear . Austin enters Left , followed by Ruth . Austin . John Austin This is where I left her with Apollo ! Calls . Jinny ! She seems to have gone ! He looks behind the statue and out door , Right . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Probably the Cullinghams , who were headed in this direction , found her , and they 've all gone back for us ; you see I walked all around the court first without going into the rooms , so I missed them , but found you . Austin . John Austin What shall we do ? Sit down here and wait for them to come back , or shall I go in search ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Oh , no , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If you left Jinny here , she 's sure to come back to meet you . She sits on the bench and Austin stands behind her . Austin . John Austin I 'm sorry to learn you 've been ill . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Oh ! it 's nothing . Austin . John Austin Ah , I 'm afraid it 's a good deal . Will you forgive me if I say I think I know what it is ! She looks up startled . After a moment . You have n't forgotten the day of Jinny 's and my wedding , when you told me Geoffrey Tillman needed a friend ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester I hoped you 'd forgotten ; I ought n't to have told you ; I ought n't to have ! Austin . John Austin Why not ? I had a talk with Geoffrey , then , and he told me everything . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester He did ! You are sure ? Austin . John Austin Sure . He sits beside her . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Oh , but that is n't all . Austin . John Austin I know the rest ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester He told you  --  about  --  about  --  Austin . John Austin The marriage ?  --  Yes ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Oh , I 'm so glad , so glad ! Now I can speak of it to some one , and some one who can advise me , and will help us . Austin . John Austin I have already advised him , but he does n't seem to be taking my advice ; it has worried me . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester When I left he was awfully depressed . He said he saw no prospect of being able to publish our marriage for years , maybe ! Austin . John Austin What marriage ? In astonishment . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Our marriage , in Brooklyn ! She notices his expression and is alarmed . You said he had told you ! Austin . John Austin Recovering himself , and speaking at first with hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , I 'm a little confused . Rising and walking a moment . Let 's get it all quite clear now , that 's the only way I can help you  --  both ; I ought , of course , to have gone through it all with him , but there really was n't time . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester I ca n't go on like this much longer . It 's killing me to deceive mother ; I must tell her soon ! Austin . John Austin Quickly , stops walking . No . You must n't , not yet , if I 'm going to help you ; you 'll obey me , wo n't you ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Yes , if you only will help us ! Austin . John Austin You said you and Geoffrey Tillman were married where ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester In Brooklyn . Austin . John Austin When ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester A month before your wedding . Austin . John Austin To himself . It 's impossible ! Walking up and down . Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I remember the date only too well . Austin . John Austin I did n't mean that . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester I lied to my mother that day for the first time  --  at any rate , since I was a child  --  and I 've been lying to her ever since . Austin . John Austin Probing her . But  --  but why were you married so secretly ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester We could n't afford to marry and set up for ourselves . He expected then to be sent off at once to the Philippines , and  --  well he did n't want to leave me behind , free ; I 'm afraid he 's rather jealous  --  you must have found out by now that Jinny is . They all are ! And I did n't want him to go so far off without my belonging to him either ; I 'm that jealous , too ! Smiling . So  --  that 's why ! Austin . John Austin And this long period of secrecy since then  --  do you understand that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you his debts ? You know before he loved me he was very fast , but since  --  Austin . John Austin Yes , I know how he gave up every one of his old habits with a great deal of courage . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Nobody knows what it cost him ! How can you help us ? Get him something to do to pay off his debts ? Or ca n't you make him feel even if we do have to go on living at our different homes for a while , it is better to publish the fact that we are married ?  --  Austin . John Austin I shall go back at once to America if I can persuade Jinny ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester And I , too ? Austin . John Austin No . You must stay abroad till I send word for you to come home . If I am going to help you , you will help me by doing exactly as I say , wo n't you ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Yes . Austin . John Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester I will . A pause . Jinny , unnoticed by either of them , appears in the doorway at Right . Austin is walking up and down . Ruth is leaning her elbow on the back of the bench and burying her face in her hands . Austin . John Austin It 's awful ! My God , it 's awful ! Jinny . Jinny Austin In a strained , assumed , nonchalant tone . What is ? Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Jinny ! Rising . Austin . John Austin I did n't hear you , Jinny ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No , you both seemed so absorbed . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Going to Jinny . I 'm so glad to see you . Kisses her , but Jinny only gives her her cheek and that rather unwillingly ; she is looking all the time at her husband . Jinny . Jinny Austin Thank you , I 've just left the Cullinghams . They sent word to you they were going and would wait for you outside . Ruth . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them waiting . We 'll all meet at dinner to-night , wo n't we ? Good-by  --  good-by . With a grateful look at Austin , she goes out Right . Jinny . Jinny Austin Watches her go ; then turns to Austin . That was n't true , what I told her  --  I have n't seen the Cullinghams , and I do n't know where they are , and what 's more , I do n't care ! Austin . John Austin What do you mean ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Beginning by degrees to lose control of herself . What did she mean by following you to Rome ? Austin . John Austin Jinny ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , do n't try to deny it ; that 'll only make me suspect you ! Austin . John Austin My dear girl , you do n't know what you 're saying ! Jinny . Jinny Austin She 's ill , they say at home ! Yes , and they do n't know what 's the matter with her , do they ? No ! But I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's husband ! Austin . John Austin Taking her hand . Hush ! I wo n't allow you to say such things ! Jinny . Jinny Austin With a disagreeable little laugh . Oh , wo n't you ? You 'd better be careful ,  --  my eyes are opened ! Austin . John Austin Yes , and much too wide . Jinny . Jinny Austin A half-blind person would have known there was something between you two . When I came into this room just now , it was in the air  --  it was in both your faces ! She sits on the bench . Austin . John Austin You 've worked yourself up to such a pitch you 're not responsible for what you 're saying ! Jinny . Jinny Austin I not responsible ! What was it you were saying was so " awful " when I came in here ? " My God , so awful ! " He does n't answer . Almost hysterical , she rises . She had told you she loved you ! She 'd confessed she 'd followed you over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppositions ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , of course you 'd protect her ; you 're a gentleman ! But if I thought you knew she was coming over  --  Austin . John Austin Jinny ! Jinny ! How can you have such a thought ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Well , why did n't you tell me when you thought you saw her a little while ago ? Austin . John Austin Oh  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , it 's very easy to say " Oh ! " Imitating him. but why did n't you ? Austin . John Austin I told you I did n't think who it was ; I only thought something familiar flashed across my eyes . Jinny darling , this is sheer madness on your part , letting yourself go like this . It has no reason , it has no excuse ! Ask your own heart , and your own mind , if in speaking to me as you have , you have n't done me at least an injustice and my love for you a little wrong . Jinny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with you , anyway . Austin . John Austin No , she is n't ! And it 's disgraceful of you to say so ! I know she is n't  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin How do you know she is n't ? Austin . John Austin There 's no question of it . I 'm sure of it ! You must n't think , dear , that because you love me , everybody does  --  you idealize me ! Smiling apologetically . Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , you 're so modest you do n't see ! but I do  --  on the steamer , in the hotels , everywhere we go , always , all the women admire you awfully ! I see it ! Austin . John Austin Laughing . What utter nonsense ! Taking her into his arms . You 've got something in your eyes ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Only tears ! Austin . John Austin No , something else ,  --  something green . Jinny . Jinny Austin Laughs through her tears . Somebody 's told you my old nickname ! Austin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little embarrassed . The girl with the green eyes . Austin . John Austin Ahem !  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin Well , I do n't care if it is appropriate , I ca n't help it . Slipping from his arms . Austin . John Austin You must  --  or it will threaten our happiness if you let yourself be carried away by jealousy for no earthly reason outside of your dear , little imagination , like you have this time  --  Interrupted . Jinny . J inny Austin You honestly do n't think she cares for you ? Austin . John Austin Not a bit ! Jinny . Jinny Austin But what was it you were so serious about  --  what is between you ? Austin . John Austin She is in a little trouble , and I happen to know about it . Jinny . Jinny Austin How ? Austin . John Austin After a second 's hesitation . That you must n't ask me ; it was not from her I knew of it . Jinny . Jinny Austin Truly ? Austin . John Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had n't any business to go to you ! I should think she 'd have gone to a woman instead of a man for sympathy . She 's got Mrs. Cullingham ! Austin . John Austin She ca n't go to her , poor girl . Mrs. Cullingham knows nothing about it . Jinny . Jinny Austin Now do n't you get too sympathetic  --  that 's very dangerous ! Austin . John Austin Look out , your imagination is peeping through the keyhole . A moment 's pause . Jinny . Jinny Austin In a sympathetic tone , the jealousy gone . What is her trouble , Jack ? Austin . John Austin That , dear , I ca n't tell you now ; some day , perhaps , if you want me to , but not now . Only I give you my word of honor , it has nothing to do with you and me  --  does not touch our life ! And I want you to tell me you believe me , and trust me , and wo n't let yourself be jealous again ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do trust you , and I will try not to be jealous again ! Austin . John Austin That 's right . Jinny . Jinny Austin You know that book of De Maupassant 's They move away together . I was reading in the train the other day ,  --  about the young girl who killed herself with charcoal fumes when her lover deserted her ? Austin . John Austin Half laughing . This is apropos of what , please ? I have absolutely no sympathy with such people . Jinny . Jinny Austin In America that girl would have simply turned on the gas . Austin . John Austin You 're getting morbid , Jinny ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No , I 'm not ! but if ever  --  Austin . John Austin Interrupting  --  laughing it off . I shall install electric light as soon as we get home ! They both laugh . Jinny . Jinny Austin I 'm sorry I was so disagreeable to Ruth , but I 'll try to make up for it in every way I can . She sits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin . John Austin There 's one other thing , Jinny , I 'd like to speak of now . Would you mind giving up the Lakes and going home this week ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Going home  --  at once ? Austin . John Austin Yes  --  Wall Street is very uncertain . I 'm worried ,  --  I do n't mind telling you ,  --  and I want to see Geoffrey about his business . Jinny . Jinny Austin Half in earnest . Jack ! You 're not running away from her , are you ? Austin . John Austin Jinny ! After all we 've said ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No ! I was n't in earnest ! I 'm ready to go . I 've seen the Lakes , and whether you are in Italy or in New York , so long as we are together , it 's our honeymoon just the same . Austin . John Austin And may it last all our lives ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Still , I do n't mind owning up that leaving Ruth Chester behind here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . She is not going back , too ? Austin . John Austin Oh , no , not for a long time . They are over here indefinitely . Jinny . Jinny Austin I 've been too horrid and nasty for words this morning , Jack  --  I 'm so sorry . Austin . John Austin It 's over and forgotten now . Jinny . Jinny Austin You do forgive me ? Austin . John Austin Of course , dear ; only I want to say this one thing to you : to suspect unjustly a true love is to insult that love ! Jinny . Jinny Austin I did n't really suspect you . Austin . John Austin Of course I know you did n't ; this is only by way of a grandfatherly warning ! It is possible to insult a true love too often  --  and love can die  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin Sh ! do n't , please , say any more . You have forgiven me , have n't you ? Austin . John Austin Yes ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Then kiss me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , some one will see us ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No , only Apollo ; see , there 's no one else about  --  it 's luncheon hour ! Austin . John Austin But  --  Taking her hand . Jinny . Jinny Austin Pulling him . Come along , then , behind the statue . No one will see us there ! They are behind the statue a moment and then come around the other side . Jinny . Jinny Austin There ! no one saw us , and I 'm so happy , are you ? Austin . John Austin " So happy ! " Jinny takes his arm and they go to the Left entrance . She stops and looks up at him . Jinny . Jinny Austin Are my eyes green now ? Austin . John Austin Now they 're blue ! Jinny .

Mrs. Tillman sits at a pianola Right , playing " Tell me , Pretty Maiden " ; she stops once in a while , showing that she is unaccustomed to the instrument . Jinny enters from Left , singing as her mother plays . Jinny . Jinny Austin Darling mother ! She puts her arms about her and kisses her . They come away from the pianola together , to a big armchair . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman I really must get one of those sewing-machine pianos for your father .

Jinny Austin Yes  --  She rises and goes to a table near the centre of the room and looks at the titles of several books without realizing what they are . Mrs. Tillman .

Something was troubling Ruth that Jack knew , and he said he 'd help her . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman What ? Jinny . Jinny Austin That 's just it ; Jack wo n't tell me .

Jinny . Jinny Austin I do n't know , he just did n't want her ; and then last week he talked with her in the library for three-quarters of an hour by my watch . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Why ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , it seems she has troubles , too !

Jinny Austin Half laughing . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we had our last quarrel . Maggie enters Right . Maggie . Maggie Mrs. Cullingham . A second 's dead silence , the announcement falling like a bombshell . Jinny . Jinny Austin Astounded . Who ? She rises . Tillman and Mrs. Tillman . Mr. Tillman and Mrs. Tillman Who ? Maggie . Maggie Mrs. Cullingham and her son , madam . Jinny . Jinny Austin They 're in Europe . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Are you sure you 're not mistaken , Maggie ? Maggie . Maggie Oh , yes 'm . Even if you could mistake Mrs. Cullingham , you could n't mistake Mr. Peter ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Ask them to please come up , Maggie . Maggie . Maggie Yes 'm . She goes out Right . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Why , they only just sailed the other day , did n't they ? Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Yes , and they were supposed to be gone all summer at least , for Ruth Chester 's health ! What in the world can they have come back for ? Jinny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to find out . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Rising . We must be going , Susan ; we 've lost our train as it is . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Rising . We can take the seven-two . Maggie shows in Mrs. Cullingham and Peter . Peter shakes hands with Mrs. Tillman , then with Jinny , and then with Mr. Tillman . Mrs. Cullingham kisses Mrs. Tillman and shakes hands with Mr. Tillman . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Jinny , you angel , are n't you surprised ! Kissing her . Jinny . Jinny Austin Well , rather ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Well , you are n't a bit more surprised than I am . A clock strikes six- thirty . There goes the half hour , Peter ; you must take your powder . Peter . Peter Cullingham I beg your pardon , mother ; it 's the tablet now . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Excuse me , dear , I 'm so dead tired . Sits on the sofa . Jinny . Jinny Austin To Peter . Will you have some water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've learned now to take them au naturel , and without much , if any , inconvenience ! Takes his tablet with still a certain amount of difficulty , and sits Right . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman To Mrs. Cullingham . Did you have a bad voyage ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham No , perfectly beautiful ! Peter . Peter Cullingham Reproachfully , and with a final swallow . Oh , mother ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Except , of course , for poor Peter ; he gets worse every trip ! He can eat absolutely nothing  --  that is for long ! But it 's the Custom House that 's worn me out ; I was there from twelve till four . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman But you would n't have had time to buy anything ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Of course not ! But I took plenty of new dresses for the entire summer ; most of them had n't been worn , and they were determined to make me pay duty . Jinny . Jinny Austin We had to pay awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Jack would n't let me ! Mr. Tillman . Mr. Tillman I 'm afraid we must go ! All rise . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham What do you think the Inspector had the impudence to ask me finally ,  --  if I wanted to bring the dresses in as theatrical properties ! They laugh . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman You must have some gorgeous frocks ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Oh , there are some paillettes ! But who do you suppose he took me for  --  Sarah Bernhardt ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman Looking at his watch . I do n't wish to interrupt this vital political conversation , but , Susan , if you do n't want to miss the seven-two train , too  --  ! Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Rising . Oh , no , we must n't do that . Good-by . To Mrs. Cullingham , shaking hands . It 's nice to see you again , anyway . Is Ruth better ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham I 'm sorry to say  --  I do n't think she is  --  good-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bys . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman To Jinny . You want me to tell your father ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Yes , it 's better ; it does make him jealous if he thinks I tell you things and keep secrets from him . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Good-by , Peter . Mrs. Tillman . Mrs. Tillman Good-by , Peter . Peter . Peter Cullingham By-by . Mr. and Mrs. Tillman quickly go out Right , Jinny going to the door with them . Jinny . Jinny Austin Coming back from doorway . Now do tell me what it means . I thought you were abroad indefinitely , or for the summer at least . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham So did I ! I 'm just as surprised to be here as you seem to be ! They sit down near each other . Did n't you really know we were coming ? Jinny . Jinny Austin No ! How should I ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham I do n't know  --  I thought  --  She hesitates , embarrassed . After a pause . Jinny . Jinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cullingham Nothing , except that you must know we were coming home . Jinny . Jinny Austin Why  --  that I must ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham You must n't put me into a corner like that ! Jinny . Jinny Austin How do you mean " corner " ? How did you happen to come home like this ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Ruth suddenly got a cable  --  she did n't tell me from whom  --  but she said she must go home at once . Jinny . Jinny Austin But her mother 's never been better ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Carelessly . The cable was n't from her mother . Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , then , you know who it was from ? No answer . Oh , I see now why you thought I ought to know about it ; the cable was from Jack , was n't it ? Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Relieved . Yes . Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , it was ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham I looked at it when she was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of by accident  --  Very much embarrassed.  --  that is , I just happened to see  --  O dear , there ! You know what I mean ; it was dreadful of me , but I could n't help it . Jinny . Jinny Austin In a strained voice . Jack and Ruth are very good friends and he looks after some of her affairs . You know having no man in the family complicates things . Peter . Peter Cullingham Oh ! I say ! Standing up , suddenly . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham What is it , dear ? Peter . Peter Cullingham I believe I have n't got my before-dinner tabs . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Oh , look carefully ! Peter . Peter Cullingham He looks in his right-hand pocket , takes out a bottle . Soda mints ! From his left-hand pocket a box . Alkali powders ! From third pocket a bottle . Charcoal tablets ! From fourth pocket another bottle . Dr. Man 's Positive Cure ! From fifth pocket a box . Bicarbonate soda ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's my saccharine Showing bottle. and my lithia tabs . Showing another bottle . We 'll have to go , mother ; I 've left them home ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham We must go , anyway , my dear . Rising . Jinny also rises . Peter . Peter Cullingham Suddenly claps his hand behind him and speaks joyfully . No , we need n't go after all ; I forgot my hip pocket . Here they are ! Bringing them out . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham We must go all the same ! To Jinny . Sometimes I think he takes too much medicine stuff ! Jinny . Jinny Austin I should think so ! Peter , you ought to diet . Peter . Peter Cullingham I ca n't ! I 've tried , and I lose my appetite right away ! Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Good-by , dear . How long will you be in town ? Jinny . Jinny Austin I do n't know  --  several weeks , I imagine . Jack came home on some business , you know and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter . Peter . Peter Cullingham Good-by . You know you must n't drink water with your meals ; that 's the great thing . So I drink only champagne . He goes out Right . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Waits and speaks to Jinny with real feeling . I 'm awfully ashamed of myself , and I hope I have n't made any trouble or fuss with my meddling . Do n't let me ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No , of course not . With a strained smile . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham I wish I could believe you . Jinny . Jinny Austin Well , do . Mrs. Cullingham . Mrs. Cullingham Good-by . She goes out Right Jinny . Jinny Austin Good-by . Where 's that telegram that came for him a little while ago ? Going to the desk at Right , and finding the telegram . Of course it 's from her , saying that she 's arrived . That 's the trouble with telegrams ; the address does n't give the handwriting away . She must have sent it from the dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She walks to the window and stands there a moment , then comes back , looking at her watch . Nearly seven already , and no sign of him , and we must dress and dine  --  huh ! I think I might as well tear up my theatre tickets ! She paces up and down the room , stopping now and then with each new thought that comes to her . I wonder if he went down there to meet her  --  he must have known the boat ; if he cabled her to come back , she must have cabled an answer and what boat she 'd lake ! But no other telegram has come for Jack here to my knowledge  --  oh ! of course , what am I thinking of , she sent that one to his office to-day ; she was afraid he might have left before this one could get there , so she risked it here . Good Heavens ! why am I maudling on like this to myself out loud ? It 's really nothing  --  Jack will explain once more that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I 'll believe him again ! But I wo n't ! He promised me she should stay over there ! Looks at her watch again . He 's there , with her ! Nothing ever kept him half as late down town as this ! What a little fool I am ! Geoffrey enters suddenly Right . Jinny . Jinny Austin Cries out , joyfully . Geoffrey ! And rushing to him , embraces him . You brute , you , not to come straight back to New York when you heard I was home ! You dear old darling , you ! Geoffrey . Geoff rey Tillman I could n't , old girl ; there were reasons  --  I do n't have to tell you I wanted to . Jinny . Jinny Austin I do n't know ! Was there a pretty girl up there , Geof ? I 'm sure I should n't think her pretty if you were in love with her . I believe I shall be awfully jealous of your wife when you get one ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Rubbish ! Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come back " from where ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Brooklyn . Jinny . Jinny Austin Brooklyn ! Why , he told me  --  what did he go there for ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Embarrassed . I do n't know if you do n't  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin You do ! ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman No  --  really  --  I  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , it 's something to be concealed , then ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Hang it , Jinny ! drop the subject . I thought he said he was going to Brooklyn ; probably I was mistaken . Jinny . Jinny Austin Satirically . One is so apt to think just casually that every one 's going to Brooklyn ! Looks at her watch . Of course it 's Brooklyn . Goes and looks at the telegram ; turns . So you 're going back on me , too , are you ? You 're going to protect Jack at my expense ! Austin enters Right . Austin . John Austin Absorbed . Good evening , Jinny dear . Jinny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin Pleasantly . Is it ? Have you been waiting long , Geoffrey ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman No , I 've only just now come in . Jinny . Jinny Austin It 's I who have done the waiting ! Austin . John Austin I 'm sorry , but it could n't be helped . Jinny . Jinny Austin You did n't tell me you were going to Brooklyn . Austin . John Austin After a quick , sharp look at Geoffrey , who shakes his head once emphatically . It must have escaped my mind . Jinny . Jinny Austin That 's very likely ! Going to Brooklyn 's the sort of thing one talks about and dreads for days . Austin . John Austin Well , Jinny , that will bear postponement , and my conversation with Geoffrey wo n't ; will you please leave us together here for a while ? Jinny . Jinny Austin And what about the theatre ? Austin . John Austin What theatre ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , you 've forgotten entirely my little birthday party ! Thanks ! Austin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! I 'm awfully sorry ! I 've got a lot on my mind to-day Tries to put his arm about her and kiss her . She pushes herself away from him , refusing to let him kiss her . Jinny . Jinny Austin Yes  --  I know you have  --  At door Left.  --  I 'll leave you two to your confidences . You can trust Geof ; he just now refused to betray you . Austin only looks at her fixedly , seriously . She looks back at him with bravado . Then she deliberately crosses the room , gets the cable , and recrosses with it and goes out Left . Austin . John Austin Poor Jinny ! Turning to Geoffrey. and that , too , lies largely on your already overcrowded shoulders . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Breaking down . I know ! I know ! Austin . John Austin Sitting in the corner of the sofa . Here , do n't cry ! You 've got to be strong now , and you 've no use nor time for crying . I 've had another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tillman Yes ?  --  Austin . John Austin Drawing a chair near to him and sitting . Well , of course we both know that he 's doing wrong to keep silent , but he will . He wishes I had n't told him , because he thinks he 'd never have noticed your divorce from Maggie when it was granted  --  nor remembered your name if he had seen it in the papers . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman That 's what I told you ! Austin . John Austin You only argued that for fear I 'd insist on your going to this minister yourself . But in the bottom of your heart you know it was a risk we could n't afford to run . I 've explained everything to him  --  how such a fine , sweet girl would suffer if he did expose you , and I gave him my word you would be remarried to Ruth at once after the divorce . Of course we both know it 's wrong , but we both hope the end justifies the means that removes difficulty number two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin . John Austin She 's signed a paper ; she realizes you 'll never live with her , and  --  it 's pathetic  --  she loves you  --  that girl , too  --  so much as to give you your freedom  --  Good Lord ! what is it about you weak men that wins women so ? What is it in you that has made two women love you to such a self-sacrificing extent ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Half tragic , half comic laugh . I give it up ! Austin . John Austin Bitterly . So do I. Well , Maggie is to have six hundred dollars a year . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Where 'll I get it ? Austin . John Austin We 'll talk about that when the time comes . He rises . Now the most important , the most painful , task of all must be done and you must do it . Not I this time  --  you ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Looking up , frightened . What ? Austin . John Austin Ruth Chester landed this morning . Geoffrey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Austin The moment Maggie signed my paper I cabled Miss Chester to return . You ca n't go out west and institute proceedings for divorce without her knowing the whole truth from you first ! You do n't want her to find it out from the newspapers , do you ? Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman And you want me to tell her ? Austin . John Austin To-day . And to-morrow you start west ! Geoffrey . Geoff rey Tillman Facing Austin . I wo n't tell her ! Austin . John Austin Calmly . You 've got to ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman I 'd rather shoot myself ; do you understand me  --  I 'd rather shoot myself ! Austin . John Austin That 's nothing ! That would be decidedly the easiest course out of it , and the most cowardly . Geoffrey . Ge offrey Tillman She 'll hate me ! She 'll loathe me ! How could she help it at first ! But just after a little , if I were n't there , the love she has for me might move her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive  --  Austin . John Austin I do n't deny that you will have to go through a terrible degradation with her  --  but that is nothing compared with what you deserve . If you tell her , at least the humiliation is secret , locked there between you two , and no one else in the world can ever know what happens ; but if you send some one else , and no matter who ,  --  any one else but you is an outsider ,  --  you ask her to make a spectacle of her humiliation , to let a third in as witness to the relations and emotions between you two ! It 's insulting her again ! Do n't you see ? A pause . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Yes , I see ! My God ! I must tell her myself . Austin . John Austin That 's right , do n't waver , make up your mind and do it  --  Come ! Urging him up . Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Hesitates a moment . And Jinny ? Austin . John Austin Oh , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman And she does n't suspect ? Austin . John Austin Not the slightest . A pause . Geoffrey . Geoff rey Tillman Need she ? Austin . John Austin The worst ? No , never ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman He rises , with new encouragement . You 'll give me your word ? Austin . John Austin Yes . Shakes his hand . I know how much she loves you ; I would n't have her know anything . It 's made us some ugly scenes , but they soon pass , and when you are once out of your trouble for good , we 'll have no excuse , I 'm sure , for any more ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman Then I shall go to bed to-night with the respect still of at least two women who are dear to me , my mother and Jinny , even if I lose the respect and love of the one woman who is dearer ! Only think , Jack , how I 've got to stand up there  --  never mind about myself  --  and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the heart-breaking thing I must do . Austin . John Austin I am sure the one hope you have of forgiveness is in your manliness of going to her as you are doing and telling her yourself all the truth ! Geoffrey . Geoffrey Tillman And that , like everything else , I owe to you . Austin . John Austin No , to Jinny ! Good luck ! He shakes Geoffrey 's hand and Geoffrey goes out Right . Austin . John Austin Goes to the door Left , opens it , and calls to Jinny , in the next room . Jinny , Geoffrey 's gone ,  --  what are you doing ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Answers in a very little staccato voice . Waiting till you should have the leisure to receive me ! Austin . John Austin Come along ! Leaves the doorway . Jinny enters Left and stands in the doorway . Jinny . Jinny Austin With affected nonchalance . I did n't care to go downstairs for dinner , so I have had a tray up here . Maggie brought up something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Austin . John Austin Ignoring purposely her mood and manner . I should n't mind ! I do feel a little hungry . He sits in the armchair . Jinny . Jinny Austin Speaks off through the doorway Left . Bring in the tray for Mr. Austin , Maggie . Maggie . Maggie Off stage . Yes 'm . Jinny pulls forward a little tea table beside his chair . Her whole manner must be one of slow , dragging carelessness , like the calm before a storm . Her expression must be hard . She carries the telegram still unopened , and on top of it the theatre tickets torn into pieces . Maggie brings in the tray , puts it on the table , and goes out Right . On the tray are chops , peas , some whiskey , a syphon , a roll , etc . Austin . John Austin Sits down quickly and with a show of eagerness . Ah ! Begins to eat as if he were hungry and enjoyed it . Jinny sits on the sofa at his Left , and looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mood , but pretends not to notice it . Austin . John Austin After a silence during which he eats . I say I am hungry ! And these chops are very good , are n't they ? No answer . I 'll tell you what it is , Jinny ! Of course travelling is great sport and all the rest of it , but after all one does get tired of hotels , and to quote a somewhat familiar refrain , " There 's no place like home . " No answer . Have you a headache , Jinny ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Very short . No . Austin . John Austin That 's a good thing , and I hope you are not as disappointed as I am about the theatre . Jinny . Jinny Austin Half laughs . Humph ! Austin . John Austin I 'll celebrate your birthday to-morrow and take you . Jinny . Jinny Austin Quickly . Why did you go to Brooklyn ? Austin . John Austin On the private business of some one else . Jinny . Jinny Austin With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will give me ? Austin . John Austin My dear girl , it 's the only answer I can give you . Jinny . Jinny Austin When you are through I have something for you I Austin . John Austin What ? Jinny . Jinny Austin I 'll give it to you when you have finished . Austin . John Austin I 'm ready . He rises . Jinny rises too , and gives him the telegram with the torn tickets on top , and then rings the bell , at Right . What are these torn papers ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Our theatre tickets ! He looks at her . Austin . John Austin And when did this telegram come ? Jinny . Jinny Austin This afternoon . Austin . John Austin Why did n't I get it when I came in ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Bitingly . I kept it to have the pleasure of giving it to you myself ; it 's from Ruth Chester . Austin . John Austin How do you know ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , I have n't opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hand it burnt my fingers ! Maggie enters Right . Take away the tray , Maggie . Maggie Yes 'm . She leaves the room with the tray . Jinny replaces the small table carelessly , almost roughly . Austin opens and reads the telegram ; there is a second 's pause . Jinny . Jinny Austin May I read it ? Austin . John Austin After a moment 's hesitation . Yes , if you wish . Not handing it to her . Jinny . Jinny Austin I do ! Austin . John Austin Reaches over and hands her the telegram ; he speaks quietly . When you behave like this it 's impossible for me to feel the same toward you . Jinny . Jinny Austin And how do you think I fed when I read this ? Reads it , satirically , bitterly . " Arrived safely ; please let me see you before the day goes . Ruth . " " Ruth " if you please ! Austin . John Austin Standing over Jinny . I want you to be careful to-night . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal to-day , and if you make me angry God knows what I might n't say and do ! Jinny . Jinny Austin And I 've been through a great deal for many a day now , and I want the truth about this at last ! It 's all very well for you to spare her by not telling me what this mysterious trouble is about which you 've been hoodwinking me ever since we were married , but now you 've got to choose between sparing her and sparing me ! She sits determinedly . Austin . John Austin Is this your answer to me when I beg you to be very careful to-night to control yourself ? Jinny . Jinny Austin It 's your turn to be careful ! What did you marry me for if you were in love with Ruth ? Austin . John Austin Jinny ! Jinny . Jinny Austin A little frightened , to excuse herself . You gave me your word of honor she would stay abroad indefinitely . Austin . John Austin Nonsense ! I said I understood she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin It 's the same thing , and here she is back practically the moment we are ! Austin . John Austin I ca n't control Miss Chester 's movements  --  I could n't foresee when she would come back . In Rome she told me she would stay on . Jinny . Jinny Austin Rising and facing him . Ah ! that 's what I wanted to see , if you really would lie to me ! Austin . John Austin What do you mean ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Beside herself . Liar ! He only looks at her , with his face hard and set ; she is insane with jealousy for the moment . You sent for Ruth to come back . Austin . John Austin And if I did ? Jinny . Jinny Austin You tried to deceive me about it . And if you 'll tell me a lie about one thing , you 'll tell me a lie about another , and I do n't believe one word of all your explanations about the intrigue between you and Ruth Chester ! Austin . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in the armchair , half forced by him . Jinny . Jinny Austin Why did you send for Ruth Chester to come back ? Austin . John Austin I have told you before , I am trying to help Miss Chester . Jinny . Jinny Austin " Ruth ! " Austin . John Austin I am trying to help her in a great and serious trouble . Jinny . Jinny Austin Why did you send for her to come back ? What 's the trouble ? Austin . John Austin I 've told you before I ca n't tell you . Jinny . Jinny Austin You dare n't tell me , and you have n't even the face to tell another lie about it ! Austin . John Austin If you say another word , I shall hate you ! If you wo n't control yourself , I must make you , as well as keep my own sane balance . You have insulted my love for you to-night as you 've never done before ; you 've struck at my own ideal of you ; you 've almost done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do  --  kill the love I have for you ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Frightened . Jack ! Austin . John Austin I mean what I say ! Jinny . Jinny Austin In tears . That  --  that you  --  you do n't love me ? Austin . John Austin That is not what I said , but I tell you now that since I first began to care for you , never have I loved you so little as I do to-night . Jinny . Jinny Austin With an effort at angry justification . And suppose I tell you it is your own fault , because you have n't treated me  --  Austin . John Austin Interrupting her . Like a child , instead of a woman ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No , because you 've kept part of yourself from me , and that part you 've given  --  Austin . John Austin For God 's sake , stop ! A pause  --  Jinny is now thoroughly frightened ; slowly she comes to her senses . Do you want a rupture for good between us ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true ? That I ca n't bear any more to-night ? That if you keep on you will rob me of every bit of love I have for you , just as you 've already robbed me of the woman I thought you were ? Jinny . Jinny Austin " Already ! " No , no , Jack , do n't say that . Oh , what have I done ! She cries . Austin . John Austin You 've done something very serious , and before you do more  --  Speaking hardly.  --  I think we 'd better not stay in this evening ; it would be wiser for both of us if we went out somewhere . Jinny . Jinny Austin No , I could n't go out feeling this way ! I 've hurt you , hurt you terribly ! Oh , why do I do it ? Why ca n't I help myself ? Austin . John Austin I think one more scene to-night would finish things for us . I warn you of that , Jinny  --  He goes to the desk and sits at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost timidly , behind his chair . Jinny . Jinny Austin No , do n't say it ! do n't say it ! Try to forgive me  --  oh , Jack , I hate myself , and I 'm so ashamed of myself ! I know I 've disappointed you awfully , awfully ! You did idealize me ; I knew it when you married me , but I told you then I was n't worth your loving me , did n't I ? I never pretended to be worthy of you . I always knew I was n't . Austin . John Austin Hush ! Jinny . Jinny Austin It 's true ! it 's only too awfully true . But do you remember how you answered me then when I told you I was n't worth your loving me ? Austin . John Austin Coldly and without looking at her . No . Jinny . Jinny Austin You took me in your arms and held me so I could n't have got away if I 'd wanted to  --  which I did n't  --  and stopped the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He makes no reply . She goes on very pathetically . How I wish you 'd answer me that way now ! Austin . John Austin Whose fault is it ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , mine ! mine ! I know it . You do n't know it one-half so well as I ! I love you better than anything in the world , love everything of you  --  the turn of your head , the blessed touch of your hand , the smallest word that comes from your dear lips  --  the thoughts that your forehead hides , but which my heart guesses when I 'm sane ! And yet , try as hard as I can , these mad fits take hold of me , and although I 'd willingly die to save you pain , still I , I myself , hurt and wound you past all bearing ! It does n't make any difference that I suffer too ! I ought to ! I deserve to  --  you do n't ! Oh , no ! I know I 'm a disappointment and a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks . Austin . John Austin He turns to her . No , Jinny , not so bad as that , only I thought you were big  --  and you 're so little , oh , so small ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Yes , it 's true ; I 'm small  --  I 'm small ! Oh , I 'd like to be big , too ! I want to be noble and strong , but I 'm not  --  I 'm as weak as water  --  only it 's boiling water ! I want to be Brunhilde , and I 'm only Frou Frou ! Yes , I 'm little ; but I love you  --  I love you ! She sinks on to a stool beside him . A moment 's pause . With a trembling voice . You do n't mind my sitting here ? Austin . John Austin No  --  Very quietly , he places his arm about her neck , his hand on her shoulder . She quickly steals up her hand to take his , and leaning her head over it , kisses his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jinny . Jinny Austin Timidly , very softly . You forgive me ? Austin . John Austin With a long sigh . Yes . Jinny . Jinny Austin Bursting into tears and burying her face upon his knees . Thank you  --  thank you  --  I know I do n't deserve it  --  I do n't deserve it  --  I do n't deserve it ! Austin . John Austin Softly . Sh !  --  Jinny half turns and looks up at him . Jinny . Jinny Austin Very , very quietly . You forgive me  --  but still  --  yes , I see it in your face , you do n't love me the same . You look so tired , dear . Austin . John Austin Also very quietly . I am , Jinny . Jinny . Jinny Austin And  --  happy ? Austin . John Austin I 'm not quite happy . Jinny . Jinny Austin I wish I could make you so  --  make you love me the old way . You used to smile a little when you looked at me  --  Jack , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night , if I can , and to make you love me as much as ever you did . Austin . John Austin Good luck , dear . Jinny . Jinny Austin Brightening . What time is it ? Austin . John Austin Looking at his watch . Nearly nine . Jinny . Jinny Austin I suppose it is too late for me to dress and for us to go to the theatre ? Austin . John Austin Oh , yes ,  --  and I 'm too tired . Jinny . Jinny Austin Triumphantly . Well , then , you shall have your theatre at home ! If Mahomet wo n't go to the mountain , the mountain must go to your lordship ! Austin . John Austin I do n't understand ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Well , just wait  --  She blows her nose.  --  till I bathe my face and eyes a little ; I feel rather bleary ! Starting to go , she stops and turns . Good-by ? Questioningly . Austin . John Austin Quietly . Good-by . Jinny . Jinny Austin Who wanted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well ! but I 'll make you smile yet and kiss me of your own accord to-night  --  you 'll see ! She goes out Left . She is heard singing in her room . Austin goes to the desk and after a long sigh he begins to write . Austin . John Austin Writing . Dear Ruth . The satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your house to-night . My heart aches for the blow you must have this evening , but please God you will bear it bravely . The man who loves you is not bad , but he has been weak . However , I feel once he can shake off the burden of his present marriage , you will never have cause to complain of him again . And if your future happiness lies truly in his hands , it will be safe there . Jinny . Jinny Austin Calls from her room . Are you ready ? Austin . John Austin Yes . He stops writing . Jinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Austin Yes . Jinny . Jinny Austin What will you have , tragedy or comedy ? Austin . John Austin Smiling . Shall we begin with tragedy ? Jinny . Jinny Austin All right . Austin . John Austin Continues to write . So far I have been able to keep Jinny in absolute ignorance , but I fear the blow must fall upon her soon , and I dread to think of what she , too , will suffer . Help me to keep it from her as long as we can , wo n't you ? Jinny comes back ; she has changed her dress to a loose neglige gown , with a red turban on her head ; she brings two sheets with her . Jinny . Jinny Austin Excuse me one minute while I set the stage ! Moving toward each other the big armchair and the sofa , she covers them with the sheets . Austin turns from his letter on the desk , to watch . Uncle Tom 's Cabin , Act Four ! She goes out only for a moment , and renters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied in the middle with a silk scarf , eyes , nose , and mouth made on it with a burnt match . Eliza crossing the ice ! Come , honey darling ! To the pillow . Mammy 'll save you from de wicked white man ! Jumping up on the sofa , and moving with the springs . You ought to do the bloodhounds for me , Jack ! Excuse me , but you look the part ! Austin watches her , not unamused , but without smiling . Hold tight to Lize , honey , and do n't be afeerd o ' dat big black man over dah  --  dat 's Uncle Tom . Crossing to the arm-chair . Do n't be afeerd , honey ; it 's Lize dat 's cuttin ' de ice this time . She throws the pillow away and drags off the two sheets . Oh , I can see this is too serious for you ! She starts singing a cakewalk and dances across the room until she reaches him , where she finishes . Austin . John Austin Very good , Jinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the theatre . Jinny . Jinny Austin Ah ! You 're getting yourself again !  --  Darling ! Come !  --  Come !  --  come to the pianola and you shall have the sextette ! It 's in there ready ; I heard mother struggling with it . You do n't suppose she has designs upon the Casino , do you ? Now  --  ready ? He goes to the pianola and starts to play the sextette from " Florodora . " She runs to the opposite side of the room and begins to sing and dance , crossing to Austin as he plays . Austin . John Austin After a few moments . But I ca n't see you and play at the same time ; I do n't like it ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Delighted . You want to see me , do you ? Austin . John Austin Of course I do ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Jack ! Delighted . Well , then , turn round ! Jinny , hurrying the time of the song , turns it into a regular skirt dance . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face lightens , he smiles , and love comes into his eyes . Jinny sees and dances and sings all the better till she reaches him . Austin . John Austin Rising , he takes her into his arms . You adorable Jinny ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Ah , Jack ! You 're smiling again and  --  you love me ! Clasping her arms about his neck . Austin . John Austin Yes ! Is the theatre finished ? Jinny . Jinny Austin No , only the first act . He sits in the big armchair , Jinny on his knee . I 'm tired ! He kisses her . There is a pause . There is a knock on the door at Right . Oh , hang it ! Knock repeated . Do n't answer it ! We have n't half made up yet ! Austin . John Austin But we must answer it , dear . Jinny . Jinny Austin As she rises unwillingly . I do n't see why  --  I should have let her knock till she went away . Austin . John Austin Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jinny Austin What is it , Maggie ? Maggie . Maggie A note from Miss Chester , m 'm , and she 's downstairs herself waiting for an answer . Jinny . Jinny Austin For me ? Taking the letter . Maggie . Maggie No , m 'm ; I think she said it was for Mr. Austin . Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh !  --  You may wait outside for the answer , Maggie . Maggie . Maggie Yes , m 'm . She goes out . Jinny . Jinny Austin Slowly goes to Austin and gives him the letter , lightly . I see now why you were so anxious to let Maggie in . Perhaps you were expecting this . Austin . John Austin Jinny ! Holding her by the hand and trying to pull her over to him . Come , I 'll give you a kiss for the letter . Jinny . Jinny Austin No , thank you , I do n't want kisses that are given by you for letters from Ruth Chester . Yes ! do kiss me ! He kisses her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinching her teeth . See , I 'm not jealous a bit ! Read your old letter ! Austin opens the note and reads it . As he does so Jinny has passed on to the desk and sees Austin 's unfinished letter to Ruth , which after a little hesitation site picks up and reads . Austin , having read Ruth 's note , looks up thoughtfully a second , and then rereads it . Jinny is furious over what she reads . As she finishes she gives a little cry from the very depths of her heart . Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , Jack ! Austin . John Austin What is it ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Nothing ! She sinks by the desk , crushing the letter in her hand . She looks over at him , and then down at the letter , and then back at him . Austin . John Austin Maggie ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Rising suddenly . She speaks with a voice trembling with only half-contained emotion and passion . I told her to wait in the hall ; may I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Austin . John Austin Now look here , Jinny ,  --  I always let you read everything , do n't I ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Hiding his letter behind her back . Yes . Holding out her other hand . Give it to me ! Austin . John Austin Now begin to show that you really are going to turn over a new leaf , and that your love is going to have perfect confidence , and do n't ask to see this letter . Jinny . Jinny Austin But I do ask to see it ! Austin . John Austin Then this time I must refuse you ! Jinny . Jinny Austin What ! is it even more compromising than your letter to her ? Austin . John Austin What letter ? Looking first on the desk , he looks across at her and sees it in her hand . He is angry , but also frightened for fear it has told her her brother 's secret . And you 've read it ? Jinny . Jinny Austin It lay open on the desk there , and anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agony . What does it tell you ? I forget what I wrote ! Jinny . Jinny Austin It tells me that my jealousy all along has been right , that I 've been a fool to let you blind me ! Austin . John Austin With a great sigh of relief . Is that all ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Beside herself . " Is that all ! " Is n't that enough ? Dear God , is n't that enough ? That there 's an understanding between you and Ruth to get rid of me ! Austin . John Austin If it tells you that , the letter lies ! Give it to me ! Jinny . Jinny Austin No ! I 'll read it to you ! Reads with bitter emphasis . " The satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your house to-night ! " So  --  you and she went to Brooklyn , did you , and that 's why you came back too late to go to the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness . A pause . Why do n't you answer  --  why do n't you say something ? Austin . John Austin Because if I speak as I feel , I 'm afraid of saying something I 'll regret all my life ! Jinny . Jinny Austin You do n't deny , then ? Austin . John Austin Yes ! that is due to Ruth . Whatever you may feel about me , you have no right to insult her ! Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , there 's more to the letter ! Austin . John Austin Jinny , do n't you see what you 're doing ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Yes , I 'm getting at the truth at last ! Reads . " My heart aches for the blow you must have this evening ! The man who loves you  --  " Austin . John Austin You sha n't read any more ; you 're mad now ! Tearing the letter away from her . Jinny . Jinny Austin I do n't need the letter , the words are burning in here ! Pressing her hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bad , only weak . However , I feel once we can shake off the burden of this present marriage "  --  oh ! you  --  you brute to say that !  --  " you will never have cause to complain of him again ! So far I have been able to keep Jinny in perfect ignorance , but I feel the blow must fall upon her now  --  " Interrupted . Austin . John Austin Shall I tell you the truth ? Jinny . Jinny Austin You do n't have to ; I 've found it out for myself ! Austin . John Austin In weariness , in disgust , in utter hopelessness . No ! what 's the use . You 've done it now  --  let it go ! Let it all go  --  the whole thing ! What 's the use !  --  it 's finished !  --  A knock on the door at Right . Come in ! Maggie enters and doses the door behind her . Maggie . Maggie Please , sir , Miss Chester came upstairs and made me knock again to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her now or not . Jinny . Jinny Austin Suddenly  --  aflame with her idea . Yes ! Maggie , show her in ! Austin . John Austin No , no ! What do you want to do ! I 'll see Miss Chester to-morrow , Maggie . Jinny has crossed to the door , Right . Jinny . Jinny Austin Ruth ! Ruth ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Off stage . Yes ? May I come ? Jinny . Jinny Austin Do come in ! She recrosses room ; she and Austin face each other for a second . Austin . John Austin In a lowered voice . For God 's sake , be careful ! Ruth enters Right . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Jinny ! Going to her quickly to embrace her . Jinny , without speaking , draws away and stars at her with a look of hatred . Ruth , seeing it , stops short , and looks from Jinny to Austin for explanation  --  she turns to Austin and gives him her hand , which he takes , presses , and drops ; Jinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to Jinny . Ruth . M iss Ruth Chester What is it , Jinny ? To Austin . Surely she does n't blame me in any way . Jinny . Jinny Austin Blame you ! Austin . John Austin She does n't know . Jinny . Jinny Austin That 's a lie ! I know everything , Ruth ! I know why you followed my husband to Rome , and why he sent for you to come back here . I know that you and he were in Brooklyn this afternoon , and that you only plan to get rid of me by some divorce , and by hook or crook to marry each other ! Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester No !  --  No !  --  Jinny . Jinny Austin Oh , you can lie , too , can you ? I wo n't keep you waiting long ! You 've stolen my husband from me  --  take him . I wo n't share him with any woman ! He 's yours now , and I 'll soon be out of your way ! Austin . John Austin Jinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be told the truth . Austin bows his head . Jinny . Jinny Austin Now you 'll make up your story , will you ? I tell you it 's useless . If he would n't let me see your compromising letter , I 've seen a letter from him to you to-night that gives the whole thing away . Ruth . Miss Ruth Chester Very quietly . Your husband went to Brooklyn without me , as your brother will tell you , to see the clergyman who married me , or thought he married me to Geoffrey Tillman three months ago ! Jinny looks up with a start . That marriage was illegal because your brother was already married , and Mr. Austin tried and did get the promise of silence this afternoon about the Brooklyn service , to prevent a charge of bigamy against your brother . The first marriage , which still holds good , was with  --  Maggie , your present servant  --  Jinny stands immovable . There is a silence . Austin . John Austin Geoffrey is not at your house ? Ruth . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . As I wrote you in the note I sent upstairs , I was too stunned by what he told me to answer then , and I wanted a word of advice with you . She turns to Jinny . I knew what I thought was my marriage to your brother must be kept secret , but I could not learn why . This was my trouble , which , after your marriage , I selfishly laid on your husband 's shoulders , thinking he might help me ! No answer from Jinny , who stands as if struck dumb and into stone . Mr. Austin only learned the whole truth when we met that day in Rome . I did not learn till to-day that I was not honestly your brother 's wife . I had to be told , because divorce proceedings are to be started at once to break  --  the other  --  marriage . No answer from Jinny . To spare me , and above all to spare you the knowledge of your brother 's sin , your husband has kept Geoffrey 's secret from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Austin . Good-by  --  I feel to-night I could n't marry Geoffrey again . He 's tumbled so far off his pedestal he has fallen out of my heart . But still  --  we 'll see ; I 've told him to come to-morrow . Thank you from the bottom of my heart  --  it 's full of gratitude , even if it is broken ! She goes out Right . Jinny slowly turns , almost afraid to look at Austin . He stands stern , with set face . Jinny . Jinny Austin In a low voice , ashamed to go near him . Can you forgive me ? Can you  --  Austin . John Austin Ugh ! Crossing room for his coat . Jinny . Jinny Austin I 'm mad ! You know I do n't know what I do . But I love you  --  I love you ! Forgive me ! Austin . John Austin Never ! Taking up his coat . Jinny . Jinny Austin Where are you going ? Austin . John Austin Out of this house . Jinny . Jinny Austin If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll kill myself ! I warn you ! Austin . John Austin Bah !  --  Good-by ! Going to the door Right . Jinny . Jinny Austin No ! Where are you going ? Austin . John Austin Out of this house for good ! At the door he turns and looks at her . Jinny . Jinny Austin Echoes . For good ? Austin . John Austin For good ! He goes out , slamming the door behind him . Jinny stands a moment motionless . She then cries faintly  --  " Jack ! " She goes to the door and pushes it open , crying out again in loud , strong despair , " Jack ! " There is a moment 's pause . She cries out again weakly , heartbrokenly , " Jack ! "  --  comes back into the room , and throwing herself down on the floor , her head resting on her arms in the armchair , she sobs hysterically , wildly , " What have I done ! Dear God , what have I done ! " as the curtain falls ACT IV Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the curtain Jinny is by the open window , whose curtains she has thrown aside . The sky is blood-red and streaked with gold the moment before sunrise . Jinny is worn and haggard , with hair dishevelled . Jinny . Jinny Austin Turning and leaning against the window . Day at last ! What a night  --  what a night  --  but now it 's morning and he has n't come back ! He means it ! And it 's my own fault  --  it 's my own fault ! She shivers . She closes the window and comes away . After a moment 's pause she goes deliberately and looks at the several gas fixtures in the room . She then closes all the doors and locks them . She carefully draws down the shade and closes in the curtains of the window . She hesitates , then pulls aside the curtains and the shade , and takes a long , last look at the dawn . She closes it all in again . She gets Austin 's picture from the desk and places it on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gas bracket at the Right and turns on the gas . She lights it to see if the gas is all right ; then blows it out . She then crosses to the other bracket and turns that on ; she goes to the chandelier at centre , and , mounting a chair , turns on its three jets . She then sits down by the table with Austin 's picture before her , and looking into its eyes , her elbows on the table , her head in her hands , she waits . Oh , Jack , my beloved ! I could n't help it  --  I never for one minute stopped loving you better than everything else in my life , but no more than I could stop loving you could I stop or help being jealous ! Once the cruel idea has got hold of me it seems to have to work its way out ! Everything gets red before me and I do n't seem to know what I say or do ! It 's no excuse , I know . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive me when I 'm gone , wo n't you , Jack ? You 'll know I loved you !  --  loved you so I could n't live without you !  --  loved you !  --  loved you ! She kisses the photograph tenderly , adoringly , slowly , in tears . Loved  --  you  --  loved you !  --  loved  --  Her head drops forward as the curtain falls Scene II The same morning , three hours later . The curtain rises on the same scene in a dull , cold , early morning light . The lamp has burnt itself out . A tiny ray of sunlight steals through a slip between the curtains . Jinny sits by the table , her arms spread over it and her head on her arms  --  she is perfectly still . Austin 's picture is before her . There is a moment 's silence . Voices are heard outside , approaching door , at Right . Gradually what they say is distinguished . Maggie . Mag gie No , sir . She has n't been to bed ; I 've been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Tillman She 's been here all night ? Maggie . Maggie Yes , sir . But twice in the night , sir , I came to the door and spoke to her and she would n't answer me  --  but I could hear her walking up and down and sometimes talking to herself . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Calls softly . Jinny ! Knocks softly . It 's father ! No answer . It looks as if she were asleep now . Austin . John Austin At a little distance . Father ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman I 'm outside the library door . Austin . John Austin Nearer . I ca n't wait  --  have you seen her ? Will she see me ? Tillman . Mr. Tillman She 's locked herself in here . She 's not been to her own room . Austin . John Austin Not been to bed at all ! Poor Jinny  --  God forgive me . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Maggie says she 's walked the floor all night . He knocks on the door Right . Austin . John Austin Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so sorry ! I ca n't say how sorry I 've thought it out through the night , and I think I understand things better . He waits a moment for an answer . Jinny , answer me ! you shall be as jealous as you like , and I 'll always explain and kiss away those doubts of yours , and I 'll have no more secrets from you , dear . Not one ! Jinny ! As he calls there is a slight movement of one of Jinny 's arms . With a note of alarm . Father ! I ca n't hear a sound of breathing ! A moment 's pause as they listen . She threatened it  --  she threatened it several times ! With great determination . We must get into this room  --  do you hear me  --  we must get in if we have to break the door down ! They shake the door . He calls a little louder . Jinny , Jinny darling  --  do you hear me ? Jinny makes a sort of feeble effort to lift her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , answer me ! I love you Jinny  --  Jinny ! Very slowly Jinny lifts her head and , with difficulty , she hears as if in a dream ; she is dazed , barely alive . She does n't answer ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman See if the key is in the lock . Austin . John Austin No . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Get the other keys , Maggie . Austin . John Austin Father ! Gas ! Do n't you smell it ? Tillman . Mr. Tillman What ! Austin . John Austin Gas , I tell you ! O God ! she 's killed herself ! Jinny ! Jinny ! Beating the door . Jinny staggers up , she tries to call " Jack "  --  but the word only comes out in a half-articulate whisper ! She tries again , but fails . Maggie . Maggie Here 's a key , sir . Jinny tries to go to the door ; she staggers a few steps and then falls . They try one key  --  it does not unlock the door ; they try another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is unable and sinks back upon the floor . Austin . John Austin Break the door in , father ! We dare n't waste any more time ! Tillman . Mr. Tillman No , this has done it ! They open the door and rush in . They stop aghast at Jinny and the oppressiveness of the gas in the room . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Jinny ! Austin . John Austin Quick  --  the window ! Tillman tears aside the curtains and throws open the window . The sunshine of full morning pours in . He then rushes to the opposite gas burners and turns them off . Kneeling quickly beside her . Jinny ! My wife ! My beloved ! He takes her up in his arms and hurries to the window . Tillman . Mr. Tillman Are we too late ? Austin . John Austin I do n't know . No ! she 's breathing  --  and see  --  see !  --  she knows me !  --  she knows met Jinny smiles at him pathetically . Send Maggie for the doctor ! Tillman goes out Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive me ! Forgive me ! She slips her two arms up and joins them about his neck . Austin kisses her . Father ! We 've saved her ! Oh , thank God , we 've saved her ! Bringing her to big chair and putting her in it , he kneels at her feet . Jinny . Jinny Austin Whispers faintly . Dear Jack ! You forgive me  --  all my beastly jealousy ? Austin . John Austin There 's one thing stronger even than jealousy , my Jinny . And that 's love ! That 's love ! He kisses her hands , and Back matter the curtain falls
