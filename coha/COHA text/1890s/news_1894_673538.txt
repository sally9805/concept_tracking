txt Among the passengers of the Atlas Line steamship Alene , which yesterday arrived from Kingston , were nine naval cadets who were attached to the cruiser New-York , and . who are on their way to Annapolis to stand their final examination . Their names are J. F. Hines , F. H. ' Pram : . S. E. Moses , A. R. Davis , R. K. Crank , i . H. Russell , G. Mailison , L. , and A. Gamble . They all agreed that the New .. York is a splendid ship , and just the sort of cruiser that ought to be sent abroad to show what Americans can do in the way of shipbuilding . When asked about the report that the cruiser 's turrets did not work well , the cadets unanimously declared that the re ? ports were untrue . One of the number said : " There is no finer ship than the New York , and all her turrets are all right . Nothing could work better than they did . and we ought to know , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines , too , are just splendid , and worked beautifully . She is simply a model cruiser . I do not know , of course , anything about her armor , but I believe it is all right . " There was no serious illness whatever on board , although we were three months in Rio Harbor , which is a horrible hole . " We were in the harbor when Peixoto 's ships arrived . We saw the Di-stroyer in tha distance , and the Nictheroy quite close by . " The Rev. Dr. Charles H. Hall of Brooklyn was also a passenger on the Alene , having taken a trip to the West Indies for the benefit of his health . Dr. Hall is a member of the Civil Service Commission in Brooklyn , and was reappointed by Mayor Schieren.
