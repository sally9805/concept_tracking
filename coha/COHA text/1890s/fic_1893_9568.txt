Note : 1Kb Main text ACT I LOVE 'S STOWAWAY SCENE : The promenade-deck of the steamer Mesopotamia , two days out from Boston . It is morning , before breakfast . A group of sailors are hauling at a sheet ; and a sail is seen rising , with an audible clucking of the tackle . CHORUS OF SEAMEN If I had a sweetheart , and she was a rover , Haul away , boys , haul away ! I 'd follow her all the wide world over , Haul away , boys , haul away ! If she said yes , I never would leave her , Haul away , boys , haul away ! If she said no , I would go and grieve her , Haul away , boys , haul away ! For the will of a girl there is never any knowing , Haul away , boys , haul away ! She would want me to stay if she saw me going . Haul away , boys , haul away ! Then , never say die ; keep a stiff upper lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The wind is fair , and we 've got a good ship , boys , Haul away , haul , haul away ! The Seamen straggle forward over the deck , singing . Then Theron Gay steals from the door of the smoking-room , peering fearfully about him . THERON Recitative . A surmise or suspicion , I know not which to call it , Possesses me , that , without my intending , I am this very moment emulating The resolute behavior Of the heroic and ideal lover Whose bold philosophy has been indicated In the soul-stirring accents of the chorus . Four nights ago , sitting among the flowers In Mr. Vane 's conservatory , I told my love to Muriel his daughter . With what result will doubtless be conjectured When I have added that I took my passage By the first steamer I could get for Europe Early the following morning . And now , there are circumstances Which lead me to imagine That Muriel , flying from my hated presence , Has taken passage on this very steamer . Such is the simple and probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been sea-sick , And hardly any of us has been able To leave his state-room ; And it has been impossible to make certain Of what may be at last a mere conjecture . Yet now I can no longer bridle My wild impatience , And I will ask the first of the ship 's people Whom I encounter ; And apropos of that , just as it happens Always upon the stage at such a juncture , When they would hold the mirror up to nature , Here comes the very man , above all others , Who can relieve my mind . The Deck-Steward appears with a waiter , and a tumbler of lemonade on it . I will accost him . Steward ! STEWARD : Yes , sir . Beg your pardon , sir ? THERON : What 's this ? The sea 's like glass ; the ship 's as steady as a rock ; nobody 's sick this morning , surely ? STEWARD , confusedly : You 're quite right , sir . It 's  --  it 's the force of ' abit , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies stretched about ' ere on deck in hevery hattitude of hagony , that I just came hup this mornin ' , sir  --  THERON , sternly : Without the surgeon 's orders ? What do the rules and regulations say , which are printed , glazed , and framed , and hung up in all the state-rooms ? STEWARD , dropping on his knees , and extending his waiter imploringly , from which Theron mechanically takes the lemonade , and drinks it , setting back the empty glass : Do n't report me , sir ! It was merely the force of ' abit . THERON Aside . Now , whether , having got him in my power , ' T were better throw myself upon his mercy , And tell him all , Or rather try finesse , And lead him on , He knows not how or whither , To tell me what I wish ? I have an inspiration ; And , as might naturally be expected Under the unexpected circumstances , It takes the lyric form ; and I will sing it . THERON An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , pray , Ere the last frail tie you sever , Binding you to silence ! Stay , Do not give yourself away ! If the simple world believes you Wiser , richer , better , say , Than you are , although it grieves you , Do not undeceive it ! Stay , Do not give yourself away ! If you have upon your conscience , Sins that struggle to the day , Stay ! Confession would be nonscience ; ( So pronounced for the rhyme 's sake , pray ! ) Do not give yourself away ! If your note falls due to-morrow , And your heart sinks in dismay , Try to beg or steal or borrow , Ere you own you can not pay . Do not give yourself away ! If you adore some lovely being , And you long to tell her , stay , Since there can be no foreseeing That she will not answer nay ! Do not give yourself away ! If , in short , the cards are shuffled , So that you hold but deuce or trey In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let your opponent play . Do not give yourself away ! THERON Aside . I can not say just whence this inspiration Came , and some precepts in it Certainly strike me as being rather lurid . I might go on considerably farther ; But I have said enough already Quite to decide me not to tell this steward Aught of myself , but rather seek to pump him . Steward ! STEWARD : Beg your pardon , sir ? THERON : For the present I will spare you . And now , can you tell me  --  ( I must manage this with great subtlety , so as to throw him off his guard )  --  if there is a Miss Muriel Vane of Boston on board ? STEWARD : Well , that , sir , is a question which I can honly hanswer in one way , sir . THERON : How is that ? STEWARD : In a haria , sir . THERON : What is a haria ? STEWARD : Haria ? Why , haria is the Hitalian for hair , sir . THERON : Hair ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . A song , sir . THERON : Of course . I expected you to do that . People always do . Well ? STEWARD Haria I am a simple deck steward , Life has left me to leeward ! I am hold , I am gray , I am sad , well-a-day ! But my ' eart shall be hopen to youward . Welcome were sixpence or shilling ; Ready the ' and , sir , and willing ; Yet the truth must be told , Though for touch of the gold The palm may be throbbing and thrilling . THERON : And what am I to infer from this oracular rubbish ? STEWARD : I ' ad n't quite finished , you know , sir . I can not be quite explicit As to the fact you 'd elicit . There 's so many aboard , If I wentured the word , I might ' it , and again I might miss , it . That is , I ca n't say positively , sir . Most of the ladies ' as kept their berths , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , I must conceal myself ! It is the only way . He re-enters the door of the smoking-room . From the door of the saloon gangway appear two maids , carrying shawls , rugs , and wraps of every kind , with pillows and cushions ; Mrs. Vane with a Willoughby pug and smelling-bottle ; and Mr. Vane with a foot-stool , a sun-umbrella , and a steamer-chair . He wearily places the chair , and the maids arrange the wraps and cushions about it , while the old people advance and sing . MR . AND MRS . VANE Two long days and nights of dread commotion , Tossing on a couch of sleepless anguish , Victim of the wild unresting ocean , We have seen our hapless daughter languish . They take hands , and chassez gravely , with a dignified dancing-step . The maids , having finished their work , sing sotto-voce , looking over the shoulders of Mr. and Mrs. Vane . THE MAIDS Two long days and nights of whim and notion , Twisting , turning , scolding , crying , fretting , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain regretting . They make a saucy dancing-step on each side of the old people . MR . AND MRS . VANE He who would persistently adore her , When he might have seen she could not pity , Left her with no choice but flight before her From her country and her native city . They dance as before . THE MAIDS Spoiled and selfish thing , we hope ' twill please her , Now she 's left her true and faithful lover . We should have been willing , just to tease her , If it had been rough the whole way over . They dance as before . MRS . VANE : Have you finished , Mary ? MARY : Yes 'm . MRS . VANE : Is every thing ready , Sarah ? SARAH : Quite ready , ma'am . MRS . VANE : I feel as if nothing had been done for the poor child , after all . What have we done , Matthew ? MR . VANE : We have secured the captain 's room for her . MRS . VANE : Well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for ourselves , so as to be constantly near her . MRS . VANE : Well ? MR . VANE : We have secured the seat on the captain 's right at table for her . MRS . VANE : Well ? MR . VANE : We have secured the exclusive attendance of the head stewardess . MRS . VANE : Well ? MR . VANE : We have secured the whole time and services of the assistant surgeon . MRS . VANE : Well ? MR . VANE : In short , as nearly as possible , we have secured the entire ship in every way . MRS . VANE , sighing : It seems very little . MR . VANE : It is very little , but it 's all we could do . MRS . VANE : Well , let us go and see if Muriel can be persuaded to come up . Oh , when I think of what the child has undergone ! And all from that wretch ! And all for nothing ! MR . VANE : Well , my dear , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dance ; but I really ca n't see that he was so very much to blame . He is a person of respectable standing in society . MRS . VANE : Yes . MR . VANE : He was graduated at Harvard with three honors : Reading , Writing , and Arithmetic , I believe they were . MRS . VANE : Yes . MR . VANE : He is very talented , with an ambition to shine as the scholar in politics . MRS . VANE : Yes . MR . VANE : To this end he has already secured a position on a Sunday paper as reporter , with a salary of ten dollars a week . It is not a vast sum ; but , having a great deal of our own , we naturally despise money in others . MRS . VANE : Yes . MR . VANE : As such things go , he is in the way to promotion . In less than twenty-five years he might hope to be an Own Correspondent , with fifteen dollars a week . MRS . VANE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unblemished character and exceptionally pleasing manners . In dress he is a gentleman ,  --  an American gentleman of English pattern . MRS . VANE : Yes . MR . VANE : He was very much in love with Muriel , and it is customary with young men to tell their love . MRS . VANE : But wholly unnecessary ! All the young men were in love with Muriel , but none of them thought it necessary to tell it . Why should he ? MR . VANE , with conviction : True ! MRS . VANE : He might have seen how sensitive , how high-spirited , how delicately constituted she was , how little calculated to know her own mind . MR . VANE : Very true ! MRS . VANE : He might have known that it would be extremely repulsive and completely prostrating . MR . VANE : I see . MRS . VANE : But he was not even satisfied with telling Muriel that he loved her . He insisted upon knowing whether she loved him . MR . VANE : That was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no alternative but flight , and  --  here we are ! MR . VANE : Perfectly true ! He was obviously wrong . But what should he have done ? MRS . VANE : He should have waited . MR . VANE : Waited ? MRS . VANE : Yes . MR . VANE : What for ? MRS . VANE : For  --  for a more fitting opportunity . MR . VANE : Oh ! How long ? MRS . VANE : Indefinitely . Women sometimes have to wait all their lives . Why should n't men ? MR . VANE : There 's a great deal in that . MRS . VANE : Muriel is not exacting . Gratify her wishes , few and simple as they always are , and she asks nothing more . But come , Matthew ! The child will be distraccted at our absence . What are you stopping for ? MR . VANE : Oh , nothing ! Merely an appropriate little ode that I thought I might repeat . But no matter ! MRS . VANE : Is it very appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with resignation : Perhaps you had better repeat it , then . You would never feel easy if you did n't . MR . VANE : I think you are right , my dear . MR . VANE A little Ode There was a youth , He loved a maid . He spoke the truth , She fled affrayed . Had he forborne A little space , Fate might have worn Another face . In later mood It might have fared , That she had wooed , And he been scared ! MRS . VANE : I do n't think any thing of the kind would have happened with Muriel . MR . VANE : Very possibly . I merely throw out the suggestion . MRS . VANE : Yes , it has a very plausible sound ; but it 's much more probable that she would never have wooed him . MR . VANE : You think not ? But why ? MRS . VANE : Because , in that case , there would have been no opera . MR . VANE : That had n't occurred to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muriel will be so impatient ! As the Vanes go below , Theron dashes from his concealment , and clutches the Steward by the arm . THERON , wildly : Who  --  who  --  is this young lady ? STEWARD : What young lady , sir ? THERON : Do n't trifle with me ! The one who is coming up . STEWARD : The one who ' as taken the captain 's room ? THERON : Yes ! Her name ! STEWARD : I ' ave n't ' appened to ' ear ' er name , sir : but I ' ave a list of the cabin-passengers ' ere in my pocket , sir ; and if you 'll kindly ' old this waiter a moment , sir , I 'll read it for you . THERON , taking the waiter : Be quick ! I am of a very impulsive nature , though trained in the school of indifferentism at our leading university ; and I may not be able to restrain my impatience . STEWARD : All right , sir ! I 've got it ! ' Ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ( unfolding the list ) . Perhaps you would like to ' ave me sing it , sir ? THERON : Do you ordinarily sing it ? STEWARD : Well , yes , sir , we do , sir , on this ship , sir . The Mesopotamia is one of the new Retarders , you know , sir . THERON : Very good , then ! I should much prefer you to sing it . He takes a shilling from his pocket , and gives it to him with a great show of secrecy , which the Steward emulates in receiving it . STEWARD : Thank you kindly , sir . You wo n't forget the pound ten at the hend of the voyage , will you , sir ? Let me see a moment , sir . Oh , yes !

STEWARD , starting back : Then you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ; but I shall be obliged to report you . He picks up the fragments of the tumbler , and replaces them on the waiter . THERON : Report me ! And after I have spared you ? STEWARD : Well , you see , sir , a stowaway is very different , sir . The rules are very strict about reportin ' ' em , sir . You 'll be put in hirons , and sent back from Liverpool by the first return steamer . He winks , and wags his hand behind him for money . THERON : Irons ? Are you open to bribery ? ( The Steward turns round , wagging his hand . Theron continues aside . ) And am I the slave of this corrupt person ? Subject to the beck and call of a deck steward ? A thought strikes me !

The form and the face were the same ; but , ah , me ! Divided by many a billow , I make my moan to the pitiless sea , And he sighs under the willow . My moans can not reach him , my love , where he sighs In metaphor under the willow : The voice of his sorrow inaudible dies , Where I toss on the wandering billow .

MURIEL : Oh , it was n't perfect , I suppose ! Do you happen to know his name , Robert ? STEWARD : Well , no , miss , I do n't know ' is name : but I 've got my list of the passengers ' ere ; and if you 'll kindly ' old my waiter , miss ( he gives it to her , with the fragments of the tumbler on it ) , I 'll read it hover to you .

THERON , rushing from the door of the smoking-room : Muriel ! They fly into each other 's arms , and sing . A Collision . MURIEL Oh , if you be some fond and dear illusion , Some blessed dream , Born of the brain 's fantastical confusion , Be what you seem !

But you just requested me to remain ! MURIEL : That was under the impression that you were a pleasing unreality . I was very explicit . THERON : And , as a reality , am I so unpleasing ? MURIEL : That is not the question . You must release me . THERON : If you insist . But why ? MURIEL : For one thing , it is essential to the plot . THERON , releasing her : Oh ! if it is essential to the plot , of course I must yield . The literary instinct teaches that . MURIEL : And , besides , you have no right to be here .

MURIEL : Then I forgive you , but on condition that you go ashore instantly . THERON : Why , but , Muriel  --  MURIEL : Do n't reply ! I simply ask you , as a gentleman , to go ashore , and not persist in attentions which you must see are very disagreeable . ( She returns to her steamer-chair , and talks while he makes her comfortable in it with the shawls , cushions , and wraps . ) I will not ask you how it is that you came to choose this ship  --  THERON : It was a fatality . Will you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you . And I will not imply that you knew very well I was on board . THERON : Oh , I swear to you that it would be doing me serious injustice !

I will not insinuate that you have been planning this interview ever since you knew I was here , helpless and defenceless . THERON : Oh , never ! Will you have the pug in your lap , or in your arms ? MURIEL : In my arms , please . You are very kind , I 'm sure , and I 'm quite ashamed to give you so much trouble ; but I will merely say , that , if you have a spark of honorable feeling , you will go ashore at once . I will be calm , I will be reasonable ; but you must go . THERON : Why , but , Muriel , it 's quite impossible ! We are forty-eight hours out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speed characteristic of the Retarders , we must be two or three hundred miles at sea . I would do any thing to oblige a lady , any thing to gratify my dearest love ; but , at the moment , I find it quite impracticable to go ashore . MURIEL : You will not ? THERON : I can not ! MURIEL : Then , I shall simply go wild . MURIEL , THERON , STEWARD A Delirium Yes , I shall go wild ! Befooled , beguiled , Followed afar in my flight by insolent treason , I call , with the last ray of reason , Papa ! Mamma ! Come to your child ! THERON No , do not go wild : You are not beguiled ! Hear me , my loved one , my only one , listen to reason ! I am wholly guiltless of treason . Papa ! Mamma ! Come to your child ! STEWARD They both will go wild . He , unjustly reviled , Can not convince her that he is guiltless of treason , Can not make her listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ! Mr. and Mrs. Vane rush distractedly on deck , with the Chorus of Passengers , all bringing life-preservers . MR . VANE Mamma ! MRS . VANE Papa ! BOTH We come to you , child ! CHORUS Papa ! Mamma ! Come to your child ! MRS . VANE Oh ! what is it , my precious one ? MR . VANE My child , what is it ? CHORUS Is it an iceberg ? They get out their opera-glasses . THERON With exasperation . No : it is an ice girl ! CHORUS A nice girl ? THERON Yes , an ice girl ! CHORUS Oh , no puns ! We are not the ones To be amused with trivial word-play of that kind . THERON Furiously . I said a girl of ice , Not a girl that is nice . To any sort of jesting I am not now inclined . MURIEL , clinging to a hand of each : O papa ! O mamma ! See ! It 's Theron ! MRS . VANE , putting on her glasses : It is indeed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting on his glasses : Upon my word , so it is . Mr. Gay , you must be aware that this is very  --  very  --  MRS . VANE : Use some violent expression , Matthew ! MR . VANE : I will , my dear ,  --  unexpected ! THERON : I know it , Mr. Vane . It 's quite unintentional . MRS . VANE : Oh ! Unintentional ! MURIEL , faintly : Do n't be harsh with him , mamma . But when I simply asked him , as a gentleman , to go ashore , and leave me  --  MRS . VANE : He refused ? MURIEL : He said he could n't . MRS . VANE : A likely story ! Where is the captain ? I will see the captain about this . ( Running , and shaking her parasol at the man at the wheel ) Oh  --  ah ! My good man ! MAN AT THE WHEEL , looking round : Ay , ay , ma'am ! MRS . VANE : Where is the captain ? MAN AT THE WHEEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takin ' the reck'nin ' . MRS . VANE : Send him here at once . MAN AT THE WHEEL : Ay , ay , ma'am ! Recitative down speaking-tube . Captain , you 're wanted here ! And I may hadd , sir , Seems a young lady , taken wery bad , sir . I ca n't just tell you if there 's need to worry , But the young lady 's mother says to ' urry . The Captain appears on deck instantly , with a sextant in his hands , a telescope under one arm , and a speaking-trumpet under the other . CAPTAIN An Explanation I am the Mesopotamia 's very obliging commander ; And I will say it , with whom boasting was never the wont , No swifter craft than this has swum the seas since Leander Executed his famed feat on the dark Hellespont . No , the Mesopotamia is not an old-time Retarder , Such as we read of once in the American press , Flabby and flat in cuisine , and frowsy in state-room and larder , With ( as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here may converse with officers on and off duty , And will especially , please , talk with the man at the wheel ; Honor , obscurity , riches , poverty , homeliness , beauty , Constitute equal parts here of the same commonweal . Such are the company 's rules ; and I think you will easily gather From my behavior thus far , that the particular part I would assume toward you all , is the part of affectionate father , With the more delicate ones ' interests chiefly at heart . Well , ladies , which of you sent for me ? MRS . VANE : It was I , captain , on behalf of my daughter . MR . VANE : On behalf of our daughter  --  yes ! CAPTAIN : And what can I do for you , miss ? MURIEL : Nothing . But the man at the wheel makes me giddy , turning it round so . CAPTAIN , through his trumpet , to the Man at the Wheel : Lash your wheel ! MAN AT THE WHEEL , obeying : Ay , ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  --  CAPTAIN , sternly : Belay that ! ( To Muriel ) Anything more , miss ? MURIEL : No ,  --  only the ship seems to tremble a good deal . CAPTAIN , to the Man at the Wheel : Tell the officer on duty to send me the engineer . MAN AT THE WHEEL : Ay , ay , sir ! ( Down speaking-tube ) Engineer ! ENGINEER Appearing instantly , and attempting to sing . I am the  --  CHORUS Oh , stow it ! We know it . CAPTAIN We 've had enough of explanation , and we 'll show it . A Suggestion If you wish to deliver some long explanation , Mainly in honor and praise of yourself , Be not deceived with the fond expectation , That the world , which it brings neither glory nor pelf , Will list to your call : The right way for you is to hire a hall ! Yes , hire a hall ! If your tongue should be long , and be hung in the middle , And it chance that you be of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or fiddle , The soul of your husband to pierce and to vex , And you must caterwaul , The right way for you is to hire a hall ! Yes , hire a hall ! If you are a poet , and lately have written Some verses you fancy uncommonly fine ; If you are a lover , just given the mitten ,  --  And no one will hearken , you should not repine . ' T is the fortune of all ; The right way for you is to hire a hall ! Yes , hire a hall ! If you 're a pianist , and have a fell passion For banging away at the keys by the hour , Allow me ! There is a more merciful fashion Than socially making displays of your power ,  --  A fashion for all : The right way for you is to hire a hall ! Yes , hire a hall ! If you are a statesman or ward politician , A man with a grievance , a maid with a grief , An agent , a dentist , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends for relief . I 'll be frank with you all : The right way for you is to hire a hall ! Yes , hire a hall ! If you are a  --  CHORUS Oh , hire a hall ! CAPTAIN : I bow to the will of the  --  Remnant . ( To the Engineer ) Go down , and stop the engines . ENGINEER : Ay , ay , sir ! ( Exit . ) CAPTAIN , to Muriel : Is that all , miss ? MURIEL , reluctantly : Y-e-e-e-e-s . MRS . VANE : Muriel , I must speak , if you will not . Captain , she is annoyed by the presence of one of the young gentlemen on board , who refuses to go ashore . CAPTAIN : Which young gentleman is it , ma'am ? MRS . VANE : Shall I indicate him more particularly , Muriel ? MURIEL , veiling her eyes with her hand : I suppost you must , mamma . But do n't be harsh ! MRS . VANE : I will be firm . It is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not had the pleasure of seeing you before , sir , I think . THERON : Very true . I have lately been describing myself in song to the ladies and gentlemen present as Love 's Stowaway . So far as relates to the payment of my passage , the term is not perfectly accurate . The purser will tell you that my ticket was quite regular . I occupy Berth 81 on the saloon-deck ; but I called myself Love 's Stowaway because I was here without the knowledge of a young lady who was flying on your ship from a hemisphere which my attentions had rendered insupportable to her . I will not spare myself , sir  --  MURIEL , to Mrs. Vane : Oh , how generous , how magnanimous , he is ! MRS . VANE : Hush , my child ! If you give way , the affair must end here . MURIEL : Well , I will be patient , then . THERON : I will not shrink from saying that I told her my love at a moment when it was surprising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , by a series of accidents , I found myself on the same ship with Miss Vane . If you had been on deck immediately after the opening chorus , you could have heard me state the same facts in recitative . Now , do with me as you will . I am , strictly speaking , Love 's Unintentional Stowaway . But I am a stowaway , and I do not shrink from the penalty . Put me in irons . MRS . VANE , to Muriel , who is weeping : Remember , if you yield now , you spoil every thing . CAPTAIN : Well , ma'am , there are practical difficulties in the way of Mr. Gay 's going ashore . I have just been taking an observation in the boiler-room , and we are twenty-three miles from land . It is a very quick run : we are only two days out . MURIEL : But , captain , you could turn the ship round , and go back with him , could n't you ? CAPTAIN : Yes , miss , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe almost indefinitely . It would be simpler to throw him overboard . MURIEL : I do n't think I could quite consent to that . It would be inhuman , would n't it ? CAPTAIN : It would be unusual ; but , as I understand , it is an extreme case . MURIEL : Yes , it is . It is very provoking . Is there no other way ? CAPTAIN : Yes . If you could wait , miss , we might transfer him to the first homeward-bound ship we met . MURIEL : Perhaps we had better wait . CAPTAIN : In the meantime I will just have him loaded with chains . MURIEL , starting forward : With chains ? CAPTAIN : Yes , miss , as a stowaway by his own confession . MURIEL : Oh , yes ! ( She sinks back in her chair . ) Of course ! THERON A Defiance Yes , load me with chains ! What are your iron links To the bonds in which my last hope wanes , My spirit sinks ? Yes , load me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall lie , ' neath the suns and the rains , Death 's Stowaway ! A group of Seamen appear with handcuffs and heavy chains . At the end of each stanza they dance some steps of the Sailor 's Hornpipe . THE SEAMAN 'S PROTEST Oh ! do n't you think it 's hard on the sympathetic sailor , Whose heart is in his hand , and whose hand is on his hip , To make him play the part of policeman or of jailer , And render him detestable to all aboard the ship ? For our natural disposition we refer you to the pictures , And the story-books the landsmen write about the jolly tar ; Though we might make , of course , our suggestions and our strictures , You must go to them , if really you would know us as we are . ' T is our ordinary habit to sing of Sue and Polly As we lightly climb aloft , to reef the topsail in the gale ; We are all opposed , on principle , to care and melancholy ; We love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , when all the toils and dangers of the day are safely over , ' T is our custom to lie basking before the fo'c's'le fire , Spinning yarns and piping ditties of maiden and of lover , And watch the cheery flames till they flicker and expire . And nothing more repugnant to the feelings of a sailor , Than loading of a gentleman with chains can be conceived ; And that we should have to play the policeman or the jailer On this ship 's , a thing that none of us would ever have believed . They load Theron with chains . MURIEL , sobbing convulsively : But , captain , suppose we do n't meet any homeward-bound ship ? CAPTAIN : Then , miss ,  --  the idea has just occurred to me ,  --  we could put him off on an iceberg . We are now entering the region of floating ice , and we may encounter a suitable iceberg at any moment . They are continually drifting toward the coast of Labrador ; and the chances are , that within a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself within the Straits of Belle Isle , from whence he could easily make his way by the Intercolonial Railway to Halifax , and so by boat to Boston . MURIEL : Do you think an iceberg is preferable to a homeward-bound merchant-vessel ? CAPTAIN : It 's about an even thing , miss . MURIEL , thoughfully : It would be more romantic on an iceberg . CAPTAIN : Yes , it would certainly be more romantic . MURIEL : I should think Theron would prefer it . Well , then , let it be whichever we meet first . CAPTAIN : All right , miss . Steward ! STEWARD : Yes , sir ? CAPTAIN : Tell the third officer in charge of the passengers ' luggage to have Mr. Gay 's boxes brought up out of the hold ; and go and fetch his valise out of his state-room yourself . Not a moment is to be lost . STEWARD : Yes , sir . ( Exit . ) A derrick is seen lifting Theron 's trunk through a bulkhead in the deck . The Steward re-appears with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glengarry cap , and puts on his silk hat , as if going ashore . The Chorus , now fully realizing the horror of the situation , start forward in protest . CHORUS What is this , O dread commander Of the Mesopotam-i-a ? If we rightly understand her , We are filled with wild dismay . In default of home-bound vessel , Would she see her true-love , pray , Left with the winds and waves to wrestle , On an iceberg cast away ? CAPTAIN Yes ; for , if I understand her , She will brook no more delay . MURIEL Only because , O dread commander ! You can think of no other way . THERON Yes , fond friends and sympathizing , Truly there is no other way In the scope of our surmising ; And , as a gentleman , I obey . MR . VANE This is politeness most surprising . MRS . VANE It is the least that he could say ! MR . VANE Were I readier at devising , He should never be cast away . STEWARD I am worse by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dare say , At the hend of the voyage ! CHORUS Thr illing , Far beyond our feeble lay , Is the existing situation . No one , we think , will say us nay , When we add an execration Of the Fates that still betray . But since nothing can be more certain Than that there seems no other way , Dropping over our grief a curtain , Let us be light , let us be gay ! They dance . CAPTAIN , STEWARD , AND MR . AND MRS . VANE Dancing together . Let us be light , let us be gay ! THERON Dancing alone . Let them be light , let them be gay ! MURIEL Keeping time with her head . Let him be light , let him be gay ! But in the meantime , Theron , if you have any thing to say in justification of your strange conduct , I can not refuse to hear it ; though , of course , it wo n't affect the final result . THERON : No , Muriel , I understand that perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ship with you ? MURIEL : No : that is all past , now ! THERON : Oh ! Then , you mean my conduct in offering myself to you . Well , there is nothing I would like to say ; but there is something I would like to sing . MURIEL : Could you make it short ? I am really quite worn out . I have been so terribly sea-sick , Theron ! And I have n't literally slept a wink since I came on board . Singing seems to string the ideas out so ! And there has been so much of it ! And then , if there happens to be an encore , there 's no living through it . THERON : I will try to boil it down . MURIEL : Do ! And I hope the music is n't abrupt or dramatic ? I really could n't bear it , in my exhausted state . THERON : No : it 's a simple , pleasing air ,  --  rather soothing , than otherwise , I believe . MURIEL : Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theron , and take my hand in yours . We may part so soon ! ( He obeys . ) THERON A Justification You ask me why ? We both were young ; And round our lives the rosy air Full of divine expectance hung , Like the soft light that everywhere Clings to the leafless branches bare , In March while yet the trees are bare . You ask me why ? It was the time The bird begins to build its nest , And all the world is filled with rhyme Of soul to soul , and breast to breast ; With rapture wild , and sweet unrest , With spring-time 's wild and sweet unrest . You ask me why ? It was the hour When Doubt is lulled , and Hope awakes , And certain tender dreams have power Upon us for their own sweet sakes ; And all such different seeming takes , Such mystic midnight seeming takes . You ask me why ? It was the place Of many a summer-breathing flower ; The rose 's bloom , the lily 's grace , Drooped o'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gush and shower , The tiny fountain 's gush and shower . You ask me why ? We sat alone . In distant rooms we heard the waltz Throb dully ; and , in undertone , You bade me tell you of your faults ; Amid the pulses of the waltz , You bade me tell you of your faults . While he sings , she drowses , unseen by him . Her head sinks on her breast . THERON Muriel , love ? She weeps ! CHORUS No , no , she sleeps ! The aching heart , the weary brain , At last are free from pain . Muriel sleeps . MR . AND MRS . VANE Yes , yes , she sleeps ! Be silent , oh ! and make no stir , Lest you awaken her . Muriel sleeps . CAPTAIN Through his trumpet . Ay , ay , she sleeps ! The wretch who dares to breath a word Henceforth , goes overboard . Muriel sleeps . MAN AT THE WHEEL Sounding the whistle . Ay , ay , she sleeps ! Oh , softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeps . THERON Oh , joy ! She sleeps ! It was my song that brought surcease Of pain to her , and peace . Muriel sleeps . MURIEL Stirring in her sleep . Come back ! I love you too ! CHORUS OF ALL THE VOICES Hush , hush ! Our Muriel dreams . A tender flush Bepaints her cheek , and seems The light of dreams . Hush , hush ! Our Muriel raves . Oh , cease your roar and rush , Ye winds and waves ! Our Muriel raves . Hush , hush ! Of love she raves , And parting ; and a gush Of hot tears steals From underneath her fallen lids , and laves Her pale , worn cheeks , And eloquently speaks The sorrow that she feels , Even while she sleeps ! Even while she sleeps , She weeps ! The scene is slowly darkened until all the figures become invisible , while the Chorus continues . CURTAIN ACT II MURIEL 'S DREAM The scene is the same ; but the deck is now gorgeously decorated with rich stuffs in various colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pavilion , open at the back , so as to show the other guard of the steamer , and the sea beyond . The front of the house is wreathed with flowers , enormous rosettes adorn all the upright surfaces , the masts and funnels are likewise garlanded , and the mouths of the funnels are filled with vast bouquets , through which the smoke is seen escaping . There is a touch of something fantastic in all these decorations , and in the dress of all the persons present , who are in ball-costume . CHORUS Promenading arm in arm . Ladies and gentlemen , If at all singular In our appearance Some of us seem , Let us enlighten you : We are not really People , but only Things in a dream ,  --  Muriel 's dream ! All this magnificent Paraphernalia That you will notice Here , if you please , Is but the scenery That quite subjectively , As in a vision Dreaming she sees ,  --  Muriel sees ! And though the opera May appear tedious In its performance , Yet it is plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flashed on the brain ,  --  Muriel 's brain ! MURIEL , magnificently dressed , promenading arm in arm with Theron : And so we 're going to have a ball ! How perfectly fascinating ! Do you know , Theron , I 've often wondered they did n't have them oftener on the Retarders ? It would certainly be an attraction . THERON : Yes , I think it would . How do you like the decorations ? MURIEL , pausing a moment to glance up at them , with her hands clasped through his arm : Beautiful ! A little peculiar , perhaps ? THERON : No : I do n't think so . MURIEL : Well , perhaps not . Who did them ? THERON : They were designed by the Society for the Prevention of Decorative Art . The piano is from the establishment of Messrs . Chickerway &; Steining . He pauses , and takes up in his hand a toy grand piano . MURIEL : Oh , yes ! It 's one of their new Baby Grands . But ( regarding it critically ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is small ; but it will grow . MURIEL : Oh , certainly ! It will grow-in time . THERON : Yes : it will grow old . MURIEL : That was what I meant . There are to be refreshments , I suppose ? THERON : Well , very light . Bouillon for the ladies , and chocolate-creams and chewing-gum for the salesladies . MURIEL : Perfect ! Who suggested the ball ? THERON : Why , to tell the truth , I thought of it . MURIEL : But how came you to have such a fortunate inspiration ? You 're so stupid , usually , you know . ( It does n't seem to be quite what I meant to say ! ) THERON : Well , I do n't know . I thought it would be a graceful little attention to the steerage-passengers if I got up a sort of fte for them in celebration of my approaching departure . MURIEL , fondly : How like you , Theron ! But ( looking about ) I do n't see any of the steerage-passengers here . THERON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course we could n't have them present . MURIEL : Of course not . Theron ! THERON : Yes , dearest ? MURIEL : I never thought ! But where did the flowers come from ? So far at sea , you know . THERON : Oh ! The flowers are artificial . MURIEL : Why , so they are ! But they looked as unnatural as the real ones . THERON : The captain has them watered with cologne from time to time , and that keeps them fresh . Here comes the man , now . A seaman appears with garden-hose , and sprinkles the flowers , executing , at the same time , some steps of the Hornpipe . MURIEL : I never saw any thing so lavish ! And how characteristic of a seaman , to dance ! THERON : The captain has spared no expense , and the crew all enter into the spirit of the affair . MURIEL , with an uneasy sigh : I suppose the decorations are all right ; but do n't you think the company is rather queer ? THERON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , if I did n't know that I was awake , I should certainly think I was dreaming . Those Arab gentlemen , now : they seem to have become quite dark since I first saw them . THERON : Yes , they are Arabian Nights now . MURIEL : That accounts for it . Well , it must be right . But why do the gentlemen all keep their bonnets on ? THERON : To prevent the bees in them from escaping . They 've got bees in their bonnets , to a man ! MURIEL : I see . Theron ! THERON : Well ? MURIEL : I do n't like to ask so many questions , but why has the captain got on an over-skirt ? THERON , carelessly : Oh , I suppose he 's heard of the secretary of the treasury issuing a steamboat-captain 's commission to that lady in Mississippi , and wishes to be ready for the change . Footnote : 1Kb MURIEL : How stupid of me not to think ! But do you like papa in mamma 's fichu ? THERON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully : Perhaps the color is . But now  --  mamma in a dress-coat ! Do you think it 's quite the thing ? THERON : Why , it 's very common , you know . MURIEL : Yes . What have they all got on ? THERON : Their life-preservers . MURIEL : Oh ! I see . But is it safe , having them round the knees ? THERON : Well , they do less harm there , probably . They can take them off if any thing happens . MURIEL : True . Why have they got all these signs stuck about , " Keep off the grass " ? I do n't see any grass . THERON : No : it is n't up yet . But there 'll be plenty of it before we get to Liverpool ,  --  sea-grass , you know . The Mesopotamia is generally covered with it when it comes into port . It 's very decorative . MURIEL : I dare say . I would like to speak with the steward , please . STEWARD , instantly appearing , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss ? MURIEL , staring : Ugh ! Oh ! I merely wished to see the captain a moment . Robert ! STEWARD : Yes , miss ? MURIEL , indicating his hand : Is it  --  comfortable ? STEWARD : Perfectly , miss . It 's convenient ; and it ca n't fly hout of your ' old in rough weather , miss , like the hold style of waiter . MURIEL : Yes , there 's that to be said . And  --  Robert ! STEWARD : Yes , miss ? MURIEL : You do n't notice any thing odd about the company , do you ? STEWARD : Nothing whatever , miss . MURIEL , in bewilderment : Yes : that 's what Theron said . Well , send me the captain . ( The Steward vanishes , and the Captain appears . ) Oh ! I have been waiting for you . But ( severely ) I wish you would n't flash upon me in that disagreeable manner . One would think you were something at the theatre , coming up out of the floor . CAPTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I 've to get this ball over before breakfast . MURIEL : It seems to me it 's a very droll time for a ball . CAPTAIN : It 's a matine ; to let the steerage-passengers go to their work in season . Besides , I dare say you 've been at a great many balls where you had to hurry to get through before breakfast . MURIEL : That is perfectly true . But now tell me frankly , captain , do you notice any thing strange about your guests ? CAPTAIN , looking round : Well , no , miss . They seem dressed as people usually are at a dancing-party . MURIEL , in despair : Oh , dear ! But Theron , now : why does Theron wear that enormous bow on the small of his back ? Whisper it , please . CAPTAIN , glancing from Theron to the pug , which is similarly equipped , and then replying through his trumpet : Because the other one has it , I suppose . MURIEL , bursting into tears : Oh , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's inhuman ! ( She runs to him , and , detaching the bow , flings it into the sea . Then a thought seems to strike her . ) Theron ! THERON : Yes , Muriel ? MURIEL : Why , you are still here ! THERON : Yes . We have n't met any home-bound vessel yet . MURIEL : Well , it wo n't do . We have made all our preparations for parting , and we must part . Duet of Resignation MURIEL Yes , we must part , for parting comes to all : It is the thought that poisons love 's delight ; In rapture 's cup it is the drop of gall ; At noon it is the shadow of the night . THERON Yes , we must part . We only live to part : The bird must leave its native sky afar , The leaf its bough , the rose its stem , the heart Its hope ; the day must lose its morning star . BOTH Yes , we must part , O love ! or soon or late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh , It is of all that lives the common fate ; And love itself at last must fade and die . MURIEL , sobbing : But what about the iceberg , Theron ? The captain promised me , that , if we met no home-bound vessel , you should be put off on an iceberg ! THERON , sobbing : The lookout has n't sighted any iceberg yet . LOOKOUT , on top of the house : Sail , ho ! CAPTAIN , through his trumpet : Where away ? LOOKOUT : On the port-quarter , sir . CAPTAIN : Heave to ! LOOKOUT : Ay , ay , sir ! CAPTAIN : Cast the log ! LOOKOUT : Ay , ay , sir ! CAPTAIN : Reef the starboard watch ! LOOKOUT : Ay , ay , sir ! CAPTAIN : Eight bells ! LOOKOUT : Eight bells it is , sir ! CAPTAIN : Yare ! LOOKOUT : Ay , ay , sir ! CAPTAIN : Luff ! LOOKOUT : Ay , ay , sir ! CHORUS Oh , how excessively Novel and interesting ! Let us be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offering to trouble him With their conveyance  --  Home by our friend . They all take out postal-cards , and write . LOOKOUT : Little mistake , sir ! CAPTAIN : Well ? LOOKOUT : It is n't a sail , sir . It 's a hiceberg . CHORUS , getting out their glasses : An iceberg ! THERON : Muriel ! MURIEL : Theron ! They fly into each other 's arms . CHORUS OF ALL THE GENTLEMEN PASSENGERS Cruel girl ! Can nothing move you From the deed that you would do ? If it be worthy death to love you , Know that we are guilty too . Put us off on the iceberg too ! CHORUS OF ALL THE LADY PASSENGERS Shameless thing ! If we could only Do what we would like to do , His exile should not be lonely . Let these wretches stay with you ! We would go on the iceberg too . THERON Soothing Muriel . Nay , kind ladies , do not chide her : She but does what she must do . I am willing to abide her Final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming too . No , kind ladies , it would not do ! MURIEL : That is very sweet of you , Theron . Not that I care for them . But I 'm sure you wo n't suffer much , if any . It 's coming summer , and the iceberg will be cool and pleasant . You will be abundantly provided with food , fuel , cigars , and reading-matter . You 'll soon drift ashore somewhere . But , in any case , it ca n't be helped . You must go . There 's no other way of getting rid of you . Do n't you see , dearest ? THERON : Oh , yes ! I see , Muriel . You 're quite right . I dare say I shall do very well . MURIEL : Captain , we do n't seem to be approaching very rapidly . CAPTAIN : That 's because we 're going towards the iceberg . If we were sailing from it , you would see how soon we should overhaul it . MURIEL : Oh , yes ! I forgot that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing is heard . CAPTAIN : But , even as it is , we sha' n't be long . There , you can hear the people on the iceberg already . MR . VANE : Are they usually inhabited , captain ? CAPTAIN : Yes , usually , but not always . MR . VANE : How very odd ! MRS . VANE : And are the inhabitants like us ? CAPTAIN , with some embarrassment : Well , ma'am , that depends upon what you mean by us . If you mean me ,  --  well , no : they 're not precisely like us . They 're fairies . MURIEL : Fairies ? CAPTAIN : Yes , miss . And there 's another difference . They 're all beautiful young ladies . Yes , it 's a singular fact , but one well known to science , that the inhabitants of icebergs are all fairies , all young , all beautiful , and all ladies . MURIEL , with misgiving : O Theron , dear ! do you think you 'd better go ? If any thing should happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do n't be troubled , Muriel . I shall be perfectly safe , I 've no doubt . CAPTAIN : There , miss , you can hear them quite distinctly now . CHORUS OF THE ICEBERG FAIRIES As they sing , the iceberg approaches ; and they are seen scattered over its peaks and slopes , draped in flowing white and blue , and wearing fillets of frosted silver in their hair . The iceberg softly touches the side of the steamer , and the seamen make it fast . They place a staging from the rail to the deck . Out of the frozen realms of the North , From the dreamless solitudes Where immemorial silence broods Over a world that is white and whist As is the pale , dead moon , Singing a mystic rune , Clad all in pearl and amethyst , Life out of Death , we have wandered forth . Out of the beautiful northern sky , From the eerie flash and play Of lights that fairer than the day Paint the long night of half a year , We may describe ourselves As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere , Through the world are wandering far and night , MR . VANE : This is very interesting , very definite , and , upon the whole , satisfactory . But I 'm rather surprised that they should adopt that scientific view of the moon 's condition . From fairies I should expect something more poetical . CAPTAIN : Oh ! science has penetrated everywhere ; and I may say that Iceberg Fairies are , as a rule , nothing if not scientific . MR . VANE , with conviction : True . ( From moment to moment , various inscriptions reveal themselves on the sides of the iceberg , as " St. Jacob 's Oil Conquers Pain , " " Anti-Fat , " " Burdock Blood Bitters , " " Rock and Rye , " etc . ) I observe that they seem to have adopted several of our popular remedies at the North Pole . CAPTAIN : There 's a great deal of rheumatism there , and , with an exclusive meat-diet , the blood needs purifying in the spring . You 'll find the whole North Pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . VANE : Ah ! that 's an additional motive for not discovering it . Well , Muriel , I suppose there 's no occasion for further delay . Shall I speak to these ladies , or will you ? MURIEL : Perhaps I had better , papa , as they seem strangers . ( She advances to the rail of the steamer next the iceberg . ) Hmm ! Let me see ! Whom shall I ask for ? Oh ! Why , of course ! Ladies , can any of you tell me if the queen is at home ? THE ICE PRINCESS , advancing politely : Miss Vane ? MURIEL : Yes . The Ice Princess ? THE ICE PRINCESS , smiling : Yes . Mamma will be so sorry to miss you . But she 's confined to her cavern with a cold today . MURIEL : Oh , I 'm very sorry ! I hope it is n't any thing serious ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Oh , no ! Merely a cold in the head . But , of course , it 's trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MURIEL : You 're very kind . I do n't know that I ought to trouble you with a business-matter . Er  --  wo n't you come aboard ? THE ICE PRINCESS , complying , with all her fairies : Oh , thank you ! And I shall be only too glad if I can do any thing for you . MURIEL : It 's nothing . Merely a young gentleman whom I would like to have you take with you , and put ashore somewhere on the American coast . If you do n't actually touch anywhere , it do n't matter : he could swim a few miles . I suppose I need n't go into details ; but it 's quite necessary he should leave the steamer . Theron ! ( She extends her hand behind her ; and Theron , with his travelling-shawl over his arm , and carrying his valise , approaches , and takes it . ) The Ice Princess , Mr. Gay ! ( They bow in acknowledgment of the introduction . ) It is Mr. Gay whom I wish to have go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes ! ( She examines him through her pince-nez as he retires . ) Is n't he rather good-looking ? MURIEL : Yes ,  --  rather . THE ICE PRINCESS : And amiable ? MURIEL : Yes ,  --  rather amiable . THE ICE PRINCESS : Well , you see , we are all ladies , and , mamma not being at all well , do you think it would be very nice ? MURIEL : Oh , perfectly ! There are so many of you ! THE ICE PRINCESS : That is true . But he is a Harvard man , I suppose ; and none of us ever learned Greek . MURIEL : Oh ! they do n't learn Greek at Harvard . If you will read the College Fetich , you will see that they only study it . I dare say he did n't learn any thing . ( To Theron , who seems to have spoken . ) What ? ( To the Ice Princess , as if explaining . ) Oh , yes ! Athletics , of course , and modern languages ,  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , you know . THE ICE PRINCESS : Well , that 's very nice . What are his principles ? MURIEL : I do n't quite understand you . Do you mean his political principles ? He is a Protectionist . THE ICE PRINCESS : We are Protectionists too . MURIEL , with fine reluctance : Oh ! I do n't think he 's an extreme one . THE ICE PRINCESS : We are moderate too . We believe in a tariff for revenue ; for we must have pocket-money , you know . At the same time , we are Protectionists . As ladies , we have to be protected , of course . But I referred not so much to his political principles , as his theories of life . MURIEL : I believe , that , at one time , he thought it was hardly worth while . He had been reading a little of Mallock . Footnote : 1Kb But he told me he had got over that in his junior year . He is very earnest now . THE ICE PRINCESS : I am glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When you say we , do you mean yourself individually , or all the fairies ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Both . Is he literary , or scientific ? MURIEL : Scientific , I think . At any rate , he 's written a novel . THE ICE PRINCESS : Oh , indeed ! We have written novels too . Is he of the old romantic school , with real heroes and heroines , or the modern analytic , photographic school , with just common people ? MURIEL : I 'm sure I ca n't say : I could n't read it . THE ICE PRINCESS : Nobody can read ours either . Is he sceptical ? MURIEL : No , indeed ! That 's quite gone by . Are you ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Well , we 're rather scientific , you know . MURIEL : Why , you might as well  --  let me see !  --  you might as well wear a tie-back as to talk agnosticism now . THE ICE PRINCESS , thoughtfully : I had n't heard . Mr. Gay could convert us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MURIEL : Quite . THE ICE PRINCESS , sighing : He is certainly very handsome . He 's been abroad ? MURIEL : Of course . But he is n't at all Europeanized , if that 's what you mean . THE ICE PRINCESS : I 'm glad of that . Oh ! One thing more , please . I hope he is n't a Bostonian . Their manners are so cold . They chill us . MURIEL : I should n't have thought they could chill Ice Fairies . THE ICE PRINCESS : They can chill any thing . And precisely because we are Ice Fairies , we pine for warmth . An Illustration The rose that in some winter room So frailly grows , so palely blows , Knows in its heart a brighter bloom , And longs to be a summer rose ,  --  In sun and shower , a summer rose . The song each silent soul within That weakly tries , that meekly dies , For utterance that it may not win , From poet-lips would scale the skies ,  --  A poet 's song would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast , So kind a thing , so blind a thing , If with a smile or word caressed , Would wake , and rise , and be a king ,  --  Of life and death the lord and king . MURIEL : Yes , I admit all that ; but it stands to reason , that , if the manners of the Bostonians are cold , their hearts are warm . Theron , what should you say in evidence of the hidden warmth of the Bostonians ? For they certainly do hide it . THERON : Very little . I know there has been a good deal of talk about our manners ; but I ask , what if we do seem cold ? MURIEL , to the Princess : Yes , what if we do ? THERON : We make no pretence of being warm . MURIEL : No one could deny that ! THERON : And that is more than you could say of people whose manner is more cordial . MURIEL , fondly : O Theron , be a popular orator ! Be very , very classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Two or three points have occurred to me ; and , if her Highness will give me her attention for a few moments , I think she will admit their force . THE ICE PRINCESS : Why , certainly , Mr. Gay . I will listen , with pleasure . THERON A Rejoinder It is not where the greatest smoke is , That the fiercest fire is seen : It is not where the finest joke is , That the longest laugh comes in . It is not where the winds are coldest , That you find the deepest snow : It is not where the word is boldest , That you feel the heaviest blow . It is not where the surf is loudest , That the great sea-serpents hide : It is not where the throng is proudest , That you meet the blushing bride . THE ICE PRINCESS : Yes : I see , and it may all be as Mr. Gay says ; but we have never had a young gentleman among us yet , and I must take time to think it over . MURIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect you to decide immediately . THE ICE PRINCESS : No . And , while we are thinking , we should like to dance a little ballet , as people always do when anything important is pending . Perhaps it would amuse you ? MURIEL : It will be very good of your Highness . Imperial , or royal , by the way ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Imperial , please . The queen is an empress , you know . MURIEL : Oh , yes ! Like Victoria . We shall be perfectly delighted to have you dance . BALLET AND SONG BY THE ICE FAIRIES With the tender chords all muted , Fairy-voiced and fairy footed , Let us trip , and let us glide , Gleaming , Sparkling , Dreaming , Darkling , O'er the ocean 's frozen tide . Down the crystal ice-peaks swarming , On the crystal ice-field forming , Let us drift like falling snow , Swirling , Sweeping , Curling , Creeping , Like the lightly falling snow . Then let silence , deep and hollow , On our merry uproar follow : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shimmer , Lightly Glimmer , Stop as if all frozen so ! They all stop instantly . MURIEL : How perfectly charming ! What do you call it ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Frost on the Window-Panes . Is n't it a pretty name ? MURIEL : Lovely ! And so significant ! I think  --  if you 'll excuse my proposing it  --  the passengers would like to dance a little now , to show their appreciation and gratitude . THE ICE PRINCESS : Oh ! we shall be charmed , I 'm sure . BALLET AND SONG BY THE PASSENGERS With a burst of music flashing Lightning-like and thunder-crashing On the stilly , startled air , Quickly Forming , Thickly Storming , Fill the wide deck everywhere ! Swains and nymphs of every nation , Recking naught of race or station , Mingle in the merry dance , Widely Straying , Idly Playing , Back and forth , retire , advance ! Then , like leaves that whisk and rustle , When the winds of autumn hustle Through the woodlands bare and gray , Hither Hieing , Thither Flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRINCESS : Delicious ! And what do you call this , pray ? MURIEL : Oh ! it 's merely a little pastoral . I forget the name . Theron , what do they call this dance ? THERON : The Grasshopper ; or , The United Gayeties Sociable . THE ICE PRINCESS , with mortification : Why , certainly ! I ought to have recognized it . By the way , it reminds me of a little thing of our own , which I should like to have the fairies dance for you if  --  CHORUS OF PASSENGERS : Oh , no ! Miss Muriel would want us to dance again , and we 've had quite enough of it . CAPTAIN : Yes : give us a rest ! A Demand Give us a rest , for life at best is brief ; For life is full of weariness , at best : Give to the troubled heart and brain relief , Give us , with strife and loss and grief opprest , Give us a rest ! Nepenthe does not grow on every bush , Nor wealth await @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's unending shove and push , The idle turmoil , and the useless quest , Give us a rest ! From all endeavor to provoke encores , From plays on words , from puns with wit unblest , From all the sad variety of bores , And hobbies of peculiar interest , Give us a rest ! MR . VANE : Is n't this very much to the same purpose as the song you sang in the first act in regard to hiring a hall ? CAPTAIN : Yes , it is . But it suggests a less expensive method of relief . Sometimes it costs a great deal of money to hire a hall , but you can simply stop , any time , for nothing . MR . VANE : I had not looked at it in that light . CAPTAIN : Naturally . You have probably never been at sea before . MRS . VANE : I hope you 're satisfied now , Matthew ! Exposing your thoughtlessness before everybody ! THE ICE PRINCESS , to Muriel : I noticed that Mr. Gay seemed to dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICE PRINCESS : Well , I have thought it all over very seriously , and I have concluded to take him . She passes her hand through his arm . MURIEL , faintly : Thank you . Of course you will be kind to him ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Very kind . MURIEL : If he should be homesick  --  THE ICE PRINCESS : I will read to him , or sing ; or the fairies will dance . MURIEL : And if he should be ill  --  so far from a doctor  --  THE ICE PRINCESS : We have all the popular remedies . Besides , mamma understands sickness perfectly ,  --  she 's ill so much , herself ,  --  and he shall have the best of care . MURIEL : And if  --  if  --  he should be unhappy ? If he should ask  --  for  --  for  --  me ? THE ICE PRINCESS , with dignity : I think his interests may be safely intrusted to me , in every way . And it shall be my special charge to see that my husband does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MURIEL , aghast : Your husband ! But you 're not going to marry him ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Certainly . In fact ,  --  we Ice Fairies are very frank ; perhaps too much so ,  --  I find upon reflection , that I have always loved him . MURIEL : You have always loved him ? But you have never met him before ! THE ICE PRINCESS : That makes no difference . Though I 'm not so sure about not meeting him . A Reminiscence Somewhere before our lives began , Ere I was maid , or he was man , Somewhere in shapeless space , Ideas of what was to be , But wholly unembodied , we Met somehow , face to face . That he was he , and I was I , We inly knew , but knew not why , Though that we loved we knew : Something within us or without , Taught us to feel beyond a doubt , That we were one , though two . And still I feel that nameless thrill That trembled through me then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange , dim rapture of that hour , I feel again its heavenly power , I pant , I burn , I melt ! MR . VANE , interrupting : Excuse me , your Imperial Highness , but is n't that rather dangerous  --  for you ? THE ICE PRINCESS : What dangerous ? MR . VANE : Er  --  melting . THE ICE PRINCESS : Not at all . For , if I were to thaw altogether , I should re-form again immediately . I am a Reformer . MR . VANE : Civil Service ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Certainly ! MRS . VANE : Of course she is , Matthew ! Do n't be absurd ! MURIEL : Is there any more ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Only one more stanza :  --  And as it once was , ons since , It shall be ever , ons hence , Whether we live or die . In depths below , in heights above , To love we live , we die to love , We , we ; he , he ; I , I ! For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , politely : But you must allow us to offer you some refreshments first . They are just coming up . A train of table-stewards , in red and yellow tights and the ordinary stewards ' jackets , appears , bearing trays with cups of bouillon , and plates of chocolate-creams , and sticks of chewing-gum . They keep time to a march from Lohengrin blent with Yankee Doodle . THE ICE PRINCESS : You 're very kind ! MURIEL : Theron , what is it reminds one so of Lohengrin ? Something about the music  --  THERON : No : that reminds me rather more of our national anthem . MURIEL : Or the dress of the stewards  --  THERON : It 's the ordinary dress of table-stewards . The Stewards serve the bouillon to the passengers . Muriel takes a cup from a tray , and hands it to the Princess . MURIEL : Will your fairies have bouillon , or some of the chocolate-creams and chewing-gum ? THE ICE PRINCESS : Oh ! chewing-gum , please . They were all salesladies once ; and they 're very nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It does n't seem to be going off very well , Theron . Do n't they generally sing at a banquet ? It seems to me that they ought to clink their cups of bouillon together , and sing . THERON : Yes : I do n't see why they do n't ! It 's very odd . CHORUS OF LADY AND GENTLEMEN PASSENGERS : We are keeping our breath to cool our broth . CHORUS OF FAIRIES AND SALESLADIES : How can we sing , with our mouths full of chewing-gum ? MURIEL , with pique : Oh , very well ! We ca n't oblige you to sing , of course ; though I think the effect would be better . THE CHORUS Clinking their cups , suddenly burst forth . A song , a song , For the brave bouillon , For the bouillon hot and steaming ! We sing its praise As our cups we raise , With bouillon sparkling and gleaming . Beef-tea , beef-tea , The champagne of the sea ! For every sort of weather , Or smooth or rough , This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MURIEL : Ah , I thought you would have to do it ! Thank you very much , indeed . ( To the Princess ) Well , I have been thinking it over too ; and I do n't wish you to marry Theron . I wish you merely to transport him to the nearest point on the American coast , and  --  drop him . MRS . VANE , severely : That is all you are expected to do ; and perhaps if you had been as sensitive in regard to others as you profess to be in regard to yourself it would n't be necessary to call your attention to a very well-known fact . And , oh ! if I had the trump of doom  --  STEWARD , appearing with a banjo in his hand : The captain 's mislaid the trump of doom , ma'am ; but ' ere 's the cook 's banjo . MRS . VANE , examining it : Well , the banjo will do very nicely , Robert . Now , then ! Con espressione , please . ( The Steward strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two lines . ) An Observation Oh ! never yet in castle-hall or bower Was high-born dame , or simple damozel , That dreamt the banished victim of her power Might find another he could love as well . She ever saw him wandering unconsoled , Alike in throngd streets and deserts dim : She never thought that there could be so bold A woman as to wish to comfort him . If she could have imagined such a thing , So very unexpected , mean , and low , That should with shame her sex 's bosom wring , She had thought twice before she let him go . THE ICE PRINCESS : I am very sorry , but the only arrangement I can make with regard to Theron is to marry him . I should be compromised by any other . Mamma would not hear of it . They move toward the iceberg . MURIEL , decisively : Very well , then , Theron can not go with you . THERON , advancing : Yes , Muriel , I must go . I have always loved the princess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and Liverpool in competition with the refrigerator-steamships for the transportation of Chicago beef . Now that I am engaged , my sole thought is to provide for my family ; and in this I am sure all the gentlemen present will sympathize with me . I understand that the Ice Princess is an American fairy . THE ICE PRINCESS : I am . I was born in St. Louis . THERON : I thought I could not be mistaken in the accent . She will , therefore , be expensive . CHORUS OF GENTLEMEN : She will ! THERON : But she will be worth the money . CHORUS OF GENTLEMEN : She Will ! THERON : Precisely . And for this reason I will explain my new departure . A New Departure I am a family-man ,  --  A provident family-man ! And as a member of that great plutocracy , Sprung from the heart of our New-World Democracy I get all the money I can ! Formerly I was a youth , Dreaming of Beauty and Truth , Tender and hopeful , and somewhat sthetical , With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too high in sooth ! ) Now a more practical aim I loudly and proudly proclaim ; And whether the prize you have drawn in love 's lottery Be of an origin earthly or watery , Yours I imagine the same .

VANE : Excuse me , Mr. Gay , but is n't this last song of yours rather too much like some of Gilbert and Sullivan 's things ? THERON : There is a slight resemblance . But , if the Princess intends to have me , she must have " Patience " with me . CHORUS , in great anguish : Oh ! STEWARD , holding out his hand , still more enlarged ! Do n't forget the steward , sir ! THERON : Have you change for a hundred-dollar bill ? STEWARD : I could keep the change , sir ! THERON : On second thoughts , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation Company . Well , Muriel , my former love , I must say adieu , I suppose . The princess is getting impatient . Good-morning .

THE ICE PRINCESS : Into your arms , sweet ! THERON , extending his arms : Well , then , darling ! One , two , three ! And here you are ! She leaps , and he catches her in his arms . The fairies follow . MURIEL , hiding her face in her hands : Oh  --  h  --  h  --  h ! CHORUS OF ICE FAIRIES We who , till now , scarce knew that we were women , Perceive , each one , we always did adore Some one among the passengers or seamen , And shall forevermore .

They cross the deck , as if to follow the fairies , while the Steward tries to collect his fees from them . STEWARD : Do n't forget the steward , gentlemen ! MRS . VANE , detaining Mr. Vane : Matthew , do n't you dare to speak to that nasty queen of theirs ! MR . VANE , freeing himself : My dear , the queen is ill , and in low spirits . Besides , I have loved her from childhood . A Discovery Ah , yes ! unknown , unseen , And wholly unsuspected , She was my bosom 's queen , Adored , though undetected ,  --  Unknown , unseen , And wholly unsuspected !

We do not blame our lot , Though we leave you on the ship : With these hearts that love us , we , Safe and merry all will be ! MURIEL : And do I understand that you are really going off with that creature , Theron ? THERON : Yes , Muriel , I am perfectly serious about it ; that is , as serious as I can be under the circumstances . Of course I ca n't help smiling . I am very happy , but I am serious .

THERON A Regret O loved and lost ! to whom I look and long , The deep yawns at our feet : Wild memories throng , and tremble into song , On lips where once your kiss had been so sweet . But never , never , never may I know Bliss once my soul 's desire : The flame sinks low that filled me with its glow , And nothing may revive the dying fire . In vain you send your cry across the sea : For , if I would be true , It is , you see , impossible for me ; For her Imperial Highness loves me too !

THERON AND MURIEL A Conclusion THERON The breakfast-bell ! The breakfast-bell ! It is the happy , happy sound , That , at the hour which each knows well , The whole huge hungry world goes round . In keep and tower , In hut and bower , In street and wood , in field and fell , We list the merry breakfast-bell . CHORUS We list the merry breakfast-bell ! MURIEL The breakfast-bell ! The breakfast-bell ! It rings for one , it rings for all . On land or sea , if human , we Obey its merry , merry call . Fond love may burn , And o'er her urn The tears of sorrow rise and fall : The breakfast-bell rings for us all ! CHORUS The breakfast-bell rings for us all ! They go out dancing ,  --  Muriel and Theron together , Mr. and Mrs. Vane , two maids , the Captain and Steward , and the Chorus of Passengers , in couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sing . If I had a sweetheart , and she was a rover , Haul away , boys , haul away ! I 'd follow her all the wide world over , Haul away , boys , haul away ! If she said yes , I never would leave her , Haul away , boys , haul away ! If she said no , I would go and grieve her , Haul away , boys , haul away ! For the will of a girl there is never any knowing , Haul away , boys , haul away ! She would want me to stay if she saw me going , Haul away , boys , haul away ! Then , never say die ; keep a stiff upper lip , boys ; Haul away , haul , haul away ! The wind is fair , and we 've got a good ship , boys , Haul away , haul , haul away !
