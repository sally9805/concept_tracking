txt Jesse Johnson of Brooklyn will probably be appointed a Supreme Court Justice by Gov . Black some day this week , to fill out the unexpired term of the late Justice William T. Osborne . Lieut . Gov . Woodruff made the announcement yesterday in this statement : " I am not now In a. position to say positively that Gov Black will select Mr. Johnson for the position , but I think you can safely state that he will be Judge Osborne 's successor . There are many aspirants for the vacancy , but so far my Brooklyn friend appears to have the best chance . " If Mr. Johnson receives the appointment , it will be regarded as another evidence of Senator Platt 's influence over Gov . Black . Mr. Johnson has been identified with the Platt faction in Brooklyn in its efforts to defeat Jacob Worth and contributed much toward that leader 's downfall . In Brooklyn Mr. Johnson 's appointment would be regarded much in the nature of a reward by Mr. Platt for recent services , notwithstanding She fact that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . Outside of the Woodruff faction in Brooklyn there are some doubts that the appointment will go to Mr. Johnson . The Worth people are fighting him , principally on factional lines , and are giving out that the appointee will be a man from one of the up-State counties in the district . How much influence , or how little , they have with Gov . Black remains to be seen . As a matter of recent history , it was recalled yesterday that Gov . Black owes his selection as the Republican nominee to Jacob Worth more than to Senator Platt or any other man in the machine . This has long been concfded by the State slatemakers , and now both sides are watching the Governor 's action with keen interest . It will be taken as a pretty sure evidence of Gov . Black 's attitude in the Worth-Platt feud , in which he was such an unwilling participant at the Oriental Hotel last Summer . Woodruff Makes Predictions . Lieut . Gov . Woodruff , in speaking yesterday of the relative strength in Brooklyn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather surprising statements . He said : " I have not much faith in the strength of independent movements . In 1885 John B. Woodward was the independent nominee for Mayor . Before his election every one believed that he would poll an immense vote . He was defeated , receiving only 15 , - 000 , when it was expected he would receive at least 40,000 votes . Two years ago Shepard came into the arena with a large flourish of trumpets . He polled 9,000 votes . I deduce from this that no independent movement can hope to win unless a combination is effected with one of the regular parties . In round numbers the greater city will poll 500,0 ( 10 votes . The Democratic majority is naturally 60,000 . Conceding that Tracy will lose 25 per cent , of the total Republican vote , which is , say , 220,000 , he will receive 165,000 votes and will be elected . Low may receive 145,000 votes , George and Gleason together may get possibly 50,000 votes , and Van Wyck the balance , or 140,000 votes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain . " Mr. Woodruff spoke with entire confidence and in such a way as to leave no doubt that he believed his figures correct . Committee of Fifty 's Slate . The leading members of the Brooklyn Committee of Fifty and representatives of the National Democracy were busy yesterday in making up a slate to be presented for nomination at the Shepardite Convention , which takes place in Apollo Hall this evening . Col. Willis L. Ogden of the Fifty , while practically admitting that the slate has been decided upon , refused to give out the names , on the ground that an authorized publication of the names this morning might tend to complicate the situation . Three Republicans were last night being Considered for the Presidency of the borough . It was reported last evening by a follower Of Henry George that Edward M. Grout , nominated Saturday night by the Democrats for Borough President , will be indorsed by the George people on their ticket . R. ROSS APPLETON UNEASY . Said to be Seeking the Indorsement of the Citizens ' Union . It was rumored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated by the Republican Party for President of the Council , has shown signs of great uncertainty as to the chances of his election . Mr. Appleton , it is said , paid a visit to Seth Low yesterday , and asked him to use his influence to secure the indorsement of his ( Mr. Appleton 's ) nomination , and that of Controller Fitch on the Citizens ' Union ticket . Mr. Appleton , in conversation with a reporter on Saturday night , expressed his strong hope of being elected . LOUIS STERN 'S CAREER . The Successful Merchant Nominated for President of the Borough . Louis Stern , who was nominated on Saturday night by the convention of the Republicans of the Borough of Manhattan for President of the Borough , has been active rather than prominent in politics . Although he is a successful business man , representing large interests , he has found time to make his influence strongly felt in the Republican Party of the Twenty-ninth Assembly District . He is a partner in the large dry goods house of Stern Brothers , in Twenty-third Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed to its present importance from a lace store which he opened when he first came to this city twenty-five years ago . He is a native of Albany , and is fifty years old . His partners are his two brothers , Isaac and Benjamin .
