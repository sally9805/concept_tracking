The destruction of the machinery will cause a shut-down in the works for some months to come . - The company maintains a fire department of its own , and this probably saved the entire plant from destruction . The blowing of the whistles of the starch company aroused the volunteer firemen of Glen Cove , and when they saw the size of the fire the church bells were rung and assistance from Sea Cliff was summoned . The volunteer firemen prevented the destruction of the lumber yard of E. Titus , near ' the factory . The fire is believed to have been caused by an electric light wire which was not properly insulated .
