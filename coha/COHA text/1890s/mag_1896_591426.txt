SOME MEMORIES OF HAWTHORNE . II . N Rockferry , my first remembered home , the personality of my father was the most cheerful element , and the one which we all needed , as the sunshine is needed by an English scene to make its happiiiess apparent . If he was at all " morbid , " my advice would be to adopt morbidness at once . Perhaps he would have been a sad man if he had been an ordinary one . Genius can make charming presences of characters that really are gloomy and savage , being so magical in its transmutation of dry fact . People were glad to be scolded by Carlyle , and shot down by Dr. Johnson . But I am persuaded by reason that those who called Hawthorne sad would have complained of the tears of Coriolanus or Othello ; and , with Coriolanus , he could say , " It is no little thing to make mine eyes so sweat compassion . " It was the presence of the sorrow of the world which made him silent . Who dares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , - naturally hopeful , gently merry , ever smiling , - who , while my father lived , was so glad a woman that her sparkling glance was never dimmed , and when I have to acknowledge that even she did not fill us children with the zest of con- // tent which he brought into the room for us , I must conclude that genius and cheer together made him life - giving ; and so lie was enchanting to those who were intimate with him , and to many who saw him for but a moment . Dora Golden , my brother 's old nurse , has said that when she first came to the family she feared my father was going to be severe , because he had a way of looking at strangers from under bent brows . But the moment he lifted his head his eyes flashed forth beautiful and kindly . She has told me that my mother and she used to think at dusk , when he entered the room before the lamps were lit , that the place was illuminated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed , and my mother simply called him " their sunlight . " My sister 's girlish letters are evidence of the enthusiasm of the family for my father 's companionship , and of our stanch hatred for the Consulate because it took him away from us so much . He read aloud , as he always had done , in the easiest , clearest , most genial way , as if he had been born only to let his voice enunciate an endless procession of words . He read The Lady of the Lake aloud about this time , and Una wrote expressing our delight in his personality over and above that in his usefulness : " Papa has gone to dine in Liverpool , so we shall not hear Don Quixote this evening , or have papa either . " Little references to him show how he was always weaving golden threads into the woof of daily humdrum . Julian , seven years old , writes to his grandfather , " Papa has taught Una and me to make paper boats , and the bureau in my room is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him folding them now , as if it were yesterday , and how intricate the newspapers became which he made into hulls , decks , and sails . At one time Una bursts out , in recognition of the unbroken peace and good will in the home , " It will certainly be my own fault if I am not pretty good when I grow up , for I have had both example and precept . " The nurse to whom I have just referred has said that when Jiilian was about four , sometimes he would annoy her while she was sewing ; and if his father was in the room , she would tell Julian to go to him and ask him to read about Robbie , who was Robinson Crusoe . He would sit quietly all the time his father read to him , no matter for how long . But her master finally told . Dora not to send Juhan to him in this way to hear Robinson Crusoe , because he was " tired of reading it to him . " The nurse was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not to be easily suppressed , and when her charge became fidget* , and she was in a hurry , she made one more experiment with Robbie . Her master turned round in his chair , and for the first time in four years she saw an angry look on his face , and he commanded her " never to do it again . " At three years of age Julian played pranks upon his father without trepidation . There was a " boudoir** in the house which had a large , pleasant window , and was therefore thought to be agreeable enough to be used as a prisonhouse for Una and Juhian when they were naughty . Julian conveyed his father into the boudoir , and shut the door on him adroitly . It had no handle on the inner side , purposely , and the astonished parent was caged . " You can not come out , " said Julian , " until you have promised to be a good boy . " Through the persistent dignity with which Hawthorne behaved , and with which he was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of playful love . Here are two letters written to me while I was in Portugal with my mother , in 1856 : - Mv DEAR LITTLE ROSEBUD , - I have put a kiss for you in this nice , clean piece of paper . I shall fold it up carefully , and I hope it will not drop out before it gets to Lisbon . If you can not // find it , you must ask Mamma to look for it . Perhaps you will find it on her lips . Give my best regards to your Uncle John and Aunt Sue , and to all your kind friends , not forgetting your Nurse . Your affectionate father , N. H. M* DEAR LITTLE RosEBuD , - It is a great while since I wrote to you ; and I am afraid this letter will be a great while in reaching you . I hope you are a very good little girl ; and I am sure you never get into a passion , and never scream , and never scratch and strike your dear Nurse or your dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never do such naughty things as those . It would grieve me very much if I were to hear of her doing such things . When you come back to England , I shall ask Mamma whether you have been a good little girl ; and Mamma ( I hope ) will say : " Yes ; our little Rosebud has been the best and sweetest little girl I ever knew in my life . She has never screamed nor uttered any but the softest and sweetest sounds . She has never struck Nurse nor Una nor dear Mamma with her little fist , nor scratched them with her sharp little nails ; and if ever there was a little angel on earth , it is our dear little Rosebud ! " And when Papa hears this , he will be very glad , and will take Rosebud up in his arms and kiss her over and over again . But if he were to hear that she had been naughty , Papa would feel it his duty to eat little Rosebud up ! Would not that be very terrible ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have put a kiss for you in this letter ; and if you do not find it , you may be sure that some naughty person has got it . Tell Nurse I want to see her very much . Kiss Una for me . Your loving PAPA . The next letter is of later date : - My DEAR LITTLE Pr*$sIMA , - I am very glad that Mamma is going to take you to see " Tom Thump ; " and I think it is much better to call him Thump than Thumb , and I always* mean to call him so from this time forward . It is a very nice name , is Tom Thump . I hope you will call him Tom Thump to his face when you see him , and thump him well if he finds fault with it . Do you still thump dear Mamma , and Fanny , and Una , and Julian , as you did when I saw you last ? If you do , I shall call you little Rose Thump ; and then people will think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall stop thumping on this subject . Your friend little Frank Hallet is at Mrs. Blodget 's . Do you remember how you used to play with him at Southport , and how he sometimes beat you ? He seems to be a better little boy than he was then , but still he is not so good as he might be . This morning he had some very nice breakfast in his plate , but he would not eat it because his mamma refused to give him something that was not good for him ; and so , all breakfasttime , this foolish little boy refused to eat a mouthful , though I could see that he was very hungry , and would have eaten it all up if he could have got it into his mouth without anybody seeing . Was not he a silly child ? Little Pessima never behaved so , - oh no ! There are two or three very nice little girls at Mrs. Blodget 's , and also a nice large dog , who is very kind and gentle , and never bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often comes to me and mews for something to eat . So you see we have a very pleasant family ; but , for all that , I would rather be at home . And now I have written you such a long letter that my head is quite tired out ; and so I shall leave off , and amuse myself with looking at some pages of figures . Be a good little girl , and do not tease Mamma , nor trouble Fanny , nor quarrel with Una and Julian ; and when I come // home I shall call you little Pessima ( because I am very sure you will deserve that tiame ) , and shall kiss you more than once . N. H. If he said a few kind words to me , my father gave me a sense of having a strong ally among the great ones of life ; and if I were ill , I was roused by his standing beside me to defy the illness . When I was seriously indisposed , at the age of three , he brought me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought would alarm me , as it was very ugly , and I had never seen a negro . I remember the much-knowing smile with which my father 's face was indefinitely lighted up , as he stood looking at me , while I , half unconscious to most of the things of this world , was nevertheless clutching his gift gladly to my heart . The hideous darky was soon converted by my nurse Fanny ( my mother called her Fancy , because of her rare skill with the needle and her rich decorations of all sorts of things ) into a beautifully dressed footman , who was a very large item in my existence for years . I thought my father an intensely clever man to have hit upon Pompey , and to have understood so well that he would make an angel . All his presents to us Old People , as he called us , were either unusual or of exquisite workmanship . The fairy quality was indispensable before he chose them . We children have clung to them even to our real old age . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight , with me , and in recognition of my keen delight of confidence in the small fry my father gave me little objects that were adapted to them : delicate bureaus with tiny mirrors that had reflected fairy faces a moment before , and little tops that opened by unscrewing them in an unthought-of way and held minute silver spoons . Once he brought home to Julian a china donkey 's head in a tall gray hat such as negroes and politicians elect to wear , and its brains were com posed entirely of borrowed brilliancy in the shape of matches . We love the donkey still , and it always occupies a place of honor . He brought me a little Bacchus in Parian marble , wearing a wreath of grapes , and holding a mug on his knee , and greeting his jolly stomach with one outspread hand , as if he were inwardly smiling as lie is outwardly . This is a vase for flowers , and the white smile of the god has gleamed through countless of my sweetest bouquets . My father 's enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of us to wildest comic opera . He had a delicate way of throwing himself into the scrimmage of laughter , and I do not for an instant attempt to explain +ow he managed it . I can say that lie lowered his eyelids when he laughed hardest , and drew in his breath half a dozen times with dulcet sounds and a murmur of mirth between . Before and after this performance he would look at you straight from under his black brows , and his eyes seemed dazzling . I think the hilarity was revealed in them , although his cheeks rounded in ecstasy . I was a little roguish child , but he was the youngest and merriest person in the . room when he was amused . Yet he was never far removed from his companion , a sort of Virgil , - his knowledge of sin and tragedy at our very hearthstones . It was with such a memory in the centre of home joys that the Pilgrim Fathers turned towards the door , ever and anon , to guard it from creeping Indian forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain had very likely dulled everybody 's sense of more moderate humor , the blue law of quietness was lifted from the atmosphere ; and between five and six o'clock we spread butterfly wings again , and had blind man 's buff . We ran around the large centre-table , and made this gambol most tempestuously merry . If anything had been left upon the table before we began , it was removed with rapidity before we finished . There // was a distinct understanding that our blindfolded father must not be permitted to touch any of us , or else we should be reduced forthwith to our original dust . The pulsing grasp of his great hands and heavy fingers , soft and springing in their manipulation of one 's shoulders as the touch of a wild thing , was amusingly harmless , considering the howls with which his onslaught was evaded as long as our flying legs were loyal to us . My father 's gentle laughter and happy-looking lips were a revelation during these bouts . But there were times when I used to stand at a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would ever open the floodgates of fun in a game of romp on any rainy Sunday of the future . If a traveler caught the Sphinx humming to herself , would he not be inclined to sit down and watch her till she did it again ? I have referred to his large hand . I shall never see a more reassuring one than his . It was broad , generous , supple . It had the little depressions and the smoothness to be noticed in the hands of truest charity ; yet it had the ample outlines of the vigorously imaginative temperament , so different from the hard plumpness of coarseness or brutality . At the point where the fingers joined the back of the hand were the roundings-in that are reminiscent of childhood 's simplicity , and are to be found in many philanthropic persons . His way of using his fingers was slow , well thought out , and gentle , though never lagging , that most unpleasant fault indicative of self - absorbed natures . When he did anything with his hands he seemed very active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in which he took hold of any material thing , for it proved his self-mastery . Strength of will joined to self-restraint is a combination always enjoyable to the onlooker ; but it is also evidence of discomfort and effort enough in the heroic character that has won the state which we contemplate with so much approval . I remember his standing once by the fire , leaning upon the mantelpiece , when a vase on the shelf toppled over in some way . It was a cheap lodging-house article , and yet my father tried to save it from falling to the floor as earnestly as he did anything which he set out to do . His hand almost seized the vase , but it rebounded ; and three times he half caught it . The fourth time he rescued it as it was near the floor , having become flushed and sparkling with the effort of will and deftness . For years that moment came back to me , because his determination had been so valiantly intense , and I was led to carry out determinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so small a matter . People of power care all the time . It is their life-blood to succeed ; they must encourage their precision of eye and thought by repeated triumphs , which so soothe and rejoice the nerves . He was very kind in amusing me by aid of my slate . That sort of pastime suited my hours of silence , which became less and less broken by the talkative vein . His forefinger rubbed away defects in the aspect of face*s or animals with a lionlike suppleness of sweep that seemed to me to wipe out the world . We also had a delicious game of a labyrinth of lines , which it was necessary to traverse with the pencil without touching the hedges , as I called the winding marks . We wandered in and around without a murmur , and I reveled in delight because he was near . Walking was always a great resource in the family , and it was a half-hearted matter for us unless we were at his side . His gait was one of long , easy steps which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look around , stopping if anything more lovely than usual was to be seen in sky or landscape . It is the people who love their race even better than themselves who can take into their thought an outdoor scene . In England // March , the outdoor life had many enchantments of velvet sward upon broad hills and flowers innumerable and fragrant . A little letter of Una 's not long after we arrived in iRockferry alludes to this element in our happiness - " We went to take a walk to-day , and I do not think I ever had such a beautiful walk before in all my life . Julian and I got some very pretty flowers , such as do not grow wild in America . I found some exquisite harebells by the roadside , and some very delicate little pink flowers . And I got some wild holly , which is very pretty indeed ; it has very glossy and prickery leaves . I have seen a great many hedges made of it since I have been here ; for nothing can get over it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Hawthorne the bush and the family name were always the same thing to us children , of which almost all the hedges in Liverpool , and everywhere I have been , are made ; and there it grows up into high trees , so that nothing in the world can look through it , or climb over it , or crawl through it ; and I am afraid our poor hedge in Concord will never look so well , because the earth round it is so sandy and dry , and here it is so very moist and rich . It ought to be moist , at any rate , for it rains enough . " But later she writes on " the eighteenth day of perfect weather , " and where can the weather seem so perfect as in England ? After breakfast on Christmas we always went to the places , in that parlor where Christmas found us ( nomads that we were ) , where our mother had set out our gifts . Sometimes they were on the large centre - table , sometimes on little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we studied the structure of each mound in fascinated delay , in order to guess what the humps and hubbles might indicate as to the nature of the objects of our treasure-trove . The happy-faced mother , who could be radiant and calm at once , small , but with a sphere that was not small , and blessed us grandly , - received gifts that had been arranged by Una and the nurse after all the other El Dorados were thoroughly veiled , and our hearts stood still to hear her musical cry of delight , when , having directed the rest of us to our presents , she at last uncovered her own . Our treasures always exceeded in number and charm our wildest hopes , although simplicity was the rule . " How easy it is , " my mother writes of a Christmas-tree for poor children , " with a small thing to cause a great joy , if there is only the will to do it ! " But most deeply did we delight in the presents given to our beloved parents , whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing which we ever perceived to make the supposition unreasonable . In one of Una 's girlish letters she declares : " I will tell you what has given me almost - nay , quite as great pleasure as any I have had in England that is , that Mamma has bought a gold watch-chain . She bought it yesterday at Douglas . " We had such thorough lessons in generosity that they sometimes took effect in a genuine self-effacement , like this . A letter from my mother joyfully records of my brother : - " Julian was asking Papa for a very expensive toy , and his father told him he was very poor this year , because the Consulate had not much business , and that it was impossible to buy him everything that struck his fancy . Julian said no more ; and when he went to bed he expressed great condolence , and said he would not ask his father for anything if he were so poor , but that he would give him all his own money ( amounting to fivepence halfpenny ) . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joy that he was able thus to make his father 's affairs assume a brighter aspect . This enormous sum of money which Juhan had he intended , at Christmas-time , to devote to buying a toy for baby or for IJna . He intended to give his all , and // he could no more . In the morning , he took an opportunity when I was not looking to go behind his father , and silently handed him the fivepence halfpenny over his shoulder . My attention was first attracted by hearing Mr. Hawthorne say , No , I thank you , my boy ; when lain starving , I will apply to you ! ' I turned round , and Julian 's face was deep red and his lips were quivering as he took back the money . I was sorry his father did not keep it , however . I have never allowed the children to hoard money . I think the flower of sentiment is bruised and crushed by a strong-box ; and they never yet have had any idea of money except to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advertisement in the street of the loss of a watch , and some guineas reward . Oh , ' said he , how gladly would I find that watch , and present it to the gentleman , and say , No reward , thank you , sir ! One Christmas my mother writes : " The children amused themselves with their presents all day . But first I took my new Milton and read aloud to them the Hymn of the Nativity , which I do every Christmas . " My sister , who was made quite delicate , at first , by the English climate , and acquired from this temporary check and the position of eldest child a pathetic nobility which struck the keynote of her character , writes from iRockferry : " This morning of the New Year was very pleasant . It was almost as good as any day in winter in America . I went out With Mamma and Sweet 0 Fern Julian . The snow is about half a foot deep . Julian is out , now , playing . I packed him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new snow very much . Julian is making a hollow house of snow by the rhododendron - tree . " What not to do we learned occasionally from the birds . " The little robins and a thrush and some little sparrows have been here this morning ; and the thrush was so large that she ate up the crumbs very fast , and the other poor little birds did not dare to come near her till she had done eating . " My father used to treat the Old and the New Year with the deepest respect . I never knew the moments to be so immense as when , with pitying gentleness , we silently attended the Old Year across the ghostly threshold of midnight , and my father at last rose reverently from his chair to open the window , through which , at that breath , the first peals would float with new promise and remembering toll . We children were expected to come into the presence of the grown people and enjoy the interesting guests whom we all loved . My father was skillful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he and they really met ; their loves and interests and his were stirred by the intercourse , as if unused muscles had been stretched . I could perceive that my father and his best cronies glowed with refreshment . Mr. Bennoch was a great favorite with us . He was short and fat , witty and jovial . He was so different in style . and finish from the tall , pale , spiritual Henry Bright ( whom my mother speaks of as " shining like a star " during an inspiring sermon ) that I almost went to sleep in the unending effort to understand why God made so sharp a variety in types . Mr. Bennoch wrote more poetry than Mr. Bright did , even , and he took delight in breathing the same air with writers . But he himself had no capacity more perfected than that of chuckling like a whole brood of chickens at his own jokes as well as those of others . The point of his joke might be obscure to us , but the chuckle never failed to satisfy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep-eyed thinker who smiled before hini . The only anecdote of Mr. Bennoch which I remember is of a Scotchman who , at an inn , was wandering disconsolately about the parlor while his dinner was being prepared . A distinguished traveler - Dickens , I think - was dashing off a letter at the centre-table , describing the // weather and some of the odd fellows he had observed in his travels . " And , " he wrote , " there is in the room at the present moment a long , lank , red-headed , empty-brained nincompoop , who looks as if he had not eaten a square meal for a month , and is stamping about for his dinner . Now he approaches me as I sit writing , and I hear his step pause behind my chair . The fool is actually looking over my shoulder , and reading these words " - A torrent of Scotch burst forth right here : " It s a lee , sir , - it s a lee ! I never read a worrd that yer wrort ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of dramatic rage was as suddenly dropped , and he blazed once more with broad smiles , chuckling . I will insert here a letter written by this dear friend in 1861 : - 80 Woox Sr. , LoNDoN . M* DEAR HAWTHORNE , - A few lines just received from Mr. Fields remind me of my too long silence . IRest assured that you and yours are never long out of our thoughts , and we only wish you were here in our peaceful country , far removed from the terrible anxieties caused by wicked and willful men on one side , and on the other permitted by the incompetents set over you . How little you thought , when you suggested to me the propriety of old soldiers only going into battle , that you should have been absolutely predicting the unhappy course of events ! Do you remember adding that " a premium should be offered for men of fourscore , as , with one foot in the grave , they would be less likely to run away " ? I observe that the Herald advises that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lot of the officers , beginning at the city of Washington , and so - make room for the young genius with which the whole republic palpitates . " Truly , my dear Hawthorne , it is a melancholy condition of things . Let us turn to a far more agreeable subject ! It is pleasant to learn that , amid all the other troubles , your domestic anxieties have passed away so far as the health of your family is concerned . The sturdy youth will be almost a man , and Una quite a woman , while Rosebud will be opening day by day in knowledge and deep interest . I hear that your pen is busy , and that from your tower you are looking upon old England and estimating her influ. ences and the character of her people . Recent experiences must modify your judgment in many ways . A romance laid in England , painted as you only can paint , must be a great success . I struggle on , and only wish I were worthy the respect my friends so foolishly exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , F. BENKOdH . On November 17 , 1854 , my mother writes to her father : - " Last evening a great package came from Mr. Milnes Lord Houghton , and it proved to be all his own works , and a splendid edition of Keats with a memoir by Mr. Milnes . This elegant gift was only a return of favors , as Mr. Hawthorne had just sent him some American books . He expended three notes upon my husband 's going to meet him at Crewe Hall , two of entreafy and one of regret ; but he declares he will have him at Yorkshire . Mrs. Milnes is Lord Crewe s sister . The last note says : The books arrived safely , and alas ! alone . When I get to Yorkshire , to my own home , I shall try again for you , as I may find you in a more ductile mood . For , seriously , it would b* a great injustice - not to yourself , but to us - if you went home without seeing something of our domestic country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our social system , and something which no other country has or ever will have . ' * Another note from Lord Houghton is extant , saying : - DEAR Mn . HAWTHORNE , - Why did // London ? You promised to do so , but we sought you in vain . I wanted to see you , mainly for your own sake , and also to ask you about an American book which has fallen into my hands . It is called Leaves of Grass , and the author calls himself Walt Whitman . Do you know anything about him ? I will not call it poetry , because I am unwilling to apply that word to a work totally destitute of art ; but , whatever we call it , it is a most notable and true book . It is not written virginibus puerisque ; but as I am neither the one nor the other , I may express my admiration of its vigorous virility and bold natural truth . There are things in it that read like the old Greek plays . It is of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you introduced me to , and which are so little known and valued here . Patmore has just published a continuation of The Angel in the House , which I recommend to your attention . I am quite annoyed at having been so long within the same four seas with you , and having seen you so little . Mrs. Mimes begs her best remembrances . I am yours very truly , RLCHD . MONCKTON MILNES. 10 UPPER BROOK ST. , June 30 . It is a perpetual marvel with some people why some others do not wish to be looked at and to be questioned . Dinner invitations were constantly coming in , and were very apt to be couched in tones of anxious surprise at the difficulty of securing my father . Au illustration may be found in this little note from Mr. Procter ( father of Adelaide Procter ) : - Tuesday morning , 32 WEYMOUTH ST . DEAR Mn . HAWTHORNE , - It seems almost like an idle ceremony to ask you and Mrs. Hawthorne to dine here on Friday ; but I can not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , and heard this morning that you were likely to leave London in a few days . Yours always sincerely , B. W. PROCTER . It was desirable to meet such people as Mr. Procter , and I have heard enthusiastic descriptions , with which later my mother amused our quiet days in Concord , of the intellectual pleasures that such friendships brought , and of the sounding titles and their magnificent accessories , with human beings involved , against whom my parents were now sometimes thrust by the rapid tide of celebrity . But my father was never to be found in the track of admiring social gatherings except by the deepest scheming . Iu her , first English letters my mother had written : " It is said that there is nothing in Liverpool but dinners . Alas for it ! " The buzz of greeting was constant . It must have been delightful in certain respects . She sent home one odd letter as a specimen of hundreds of similar oues which came to my father from admirers . Yet very soon individuals make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nearly suffocated than the rest quite realize . His attempts at self-preservation are not more than half understood , and , if successful , are remembered with a dash of bitterness by the onlookers . But my parents were now and then glad to be onlookers themselves , as is shown by the following-account : - OLD TRAFFORD , MANCHESTER . M* DEAR ELIZABETH , - We are now in Old Trafford , close by the Palace of Art treasures , which we have come here expressly to see . There is no confusion , no noise , no rudeness of any kind , though there are thousands of the second-class people there every day . If you shut your eyes , you only hear the low thunder of move ? nent . . . . Yesterday we were all there , and met - now whom do you think ? Even Tennyson . He // is the most picturesque of men , very handsome and careless - looking , with a wide-awake hat , a black beard , round shoulders , and slouching gait ; most romantic , poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient masters . Was not that rare luck for us ? Is it not a wonder that we should meet ? His voice is also deep and musical , his hair wild and stormy . He is clearly the " love of love and hate of hate , " and " in a golden clime was born . " He is the Morte d'Arthur , In Memoriam , and Maud . He is Mariana in the moated grange . He is the Lady Clara Vere de Vere and " rare , pale Margaret . " There is a fine bust of him in the exhibition , and a beautiful one of Wordsworth . . . . Ary Scheffer 's Magdalen , when Christ says , " Mary ! " is the greatest picture of his I have ever seen . Ary Scheffer himself was at the exhilition the other day . Again Mr. Hawthorne , Una , and I were at the Palace all day . We went up into the gallery of engraving to listen to the music ; and suddenly Una exclaimed , " Mamma ! there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the orchestra . He had a child with him , a little boy , in whose emotions and impressions he evidently had great interest ; and I presumed it was his son . I was soon convin*ced that I saw also his wife and another little son ,  --  and all this proved true . It was charming to watch the group . Mrs. Tennyson had a sweet face , and the ver.y sweetest smile I ever saw ; and when she spoke to her husband or listened to him , her face showered a tender , happy rain of light . She was graceful , too , and gentle , but at the same time had a slightly peasant air . The children were very pretty and picturesque , and Tennyson seemed to love them immensely . He devoted himself to them , and was absorbed in their interest . In him is a careless ease and a noble air which show him of the gentle blood he is . He is the most romanticlooking person . His complexion is brun , and he looks in ill health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Allingham , another English poet , told Mr. Hawthorne that his wife was an admirable one for him , - wise , tender , and of perfect temper ; and she looks all this ; and there is a kind of adoration in her expression when she addresses him . If he is moody and ill , I am sure she must be a blessed solace to him . When he moved to go , we also moved , and followed him and his family faithfully . By this means we saw him stop at his own photograph , to show it to his wife and children ; arid then I heard them exclaim in sweet voices , " That is papa ! " Passing a table where catalogues were sold , his youngest son stopped with the maid to buy one , while Tennyson and his wife went on and downstairs . So then I seized the youngest darling with gold hair , and kissed him to my heart 's content ; and he smiled and seemed well pleased . And I was well pleased to have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went on . . Of this glimpse of the great poet fortunately accorded to our family my father writes in the Note-Books " Gazing at him with all n*iy eyes , I liked him very well , and rejoiced more in him than in all the other wonders of the exhibition . " Again my mother refers to the interesting experience - Mv DEAR ELIZABETH , - My last letter I had not time to even double up myself , as Mr. Hawthorne was booted and spurred for Liverpool before I was aware , and everything was huddled up in a hasty manner . It was something about Tennyson 's family that I was saying . I wanted you to know how happy and loving they all seemed together . As Tennyson is in very ill health , very shy and moody , I had sometimes thought his wife might look worn and sad . I was delighted , therefore , to see her serene and sweet face . I can not say , however , that // there was no solicitude'in it ; but it was a solicitude entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your last long letter to me about slavery . . . . There is not a single person whom I know or ever talked with who advocates slavery . Your letters to me would be far more appropriate to a slaveholder . . . . I do not see how they apply to me at all . - I retain this closing paragraph because there has been the customary misinterpretation of calm justice in the case of my father 's moderation during the wild ardor of abolition . My mother often writes in eloquent exposition of her husband 's and her own loyalty to the highest views in regard to the relations of all members of the human family ; but she never convinced the hot fidelity of the correspondents of her own household . Here are some glimpses of the happy life that surrounded my father in 1854 : July 18 , DOUGLAS , MONA . M* DEAR FATHER , - I little dreamed that I should next address you from the Isle of Man ! Yet here we all are , with one grievous exception , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and staying the two next , went away to the tiresome old Consulate , so conscientious and devoted is he ; for his clerk assured him he might stay a little . Yet I know that there are reasons of state why he should not ; and therefore , though I am nothing less than infinitely desolate without him , and hate to look at anything new unless he is looking too , I can not complain . But is it not wonderful that I am here in this remote and interesting and storied spot ? - the last retreat of the little people called fairies , the lurking-place of giants and enchanters. . - . At Stonehenge we found a few rude stones for a temple . I could not gather into a small enough focus the wide glances of Julian 's great brown , searching eyes to make him see even what 383 there was ; and when finally he comprehended that the circle of stones once marked out a temple , and that the Druids really once stood there , he curled his lip , scornfully exclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pluck flowers . I think that , having heard of Stonehenge and a Druid temple which was built of stones so large that it was considered almost miraculous that they were moved to their places , he expected to see a temple touching the sky , perhaps . Mr. Hawthorne came back the next Friday , much to our joy , and on Saturday afternoon we walked to the Nunnery with him , which was founded by St. Bridget . A few ruins remain , overgrown with old ivy vines of such enormous size that I think they probably hold the walls together . . . . Juhian and Una were enchanted with the clear stream , and Juhian was wild for turtles ; but there are no reptiles in the Isle of Man . . . . I kept thinking , " And this is the rugged , bare , rocky isle which I dreaded to come to , - this soft , rich , verdant paradise ! " It really seems as if the giants had thrown aloft the bold , precipitous rocks and headlands round the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fairies , whose stronghold was the Isle of Man . I should not have been surprised at any time to have seen those small people peeping out of the wild foxgloves , which are their favorite hiding-places . So poetical is the air of these regions that mermaids , fairies , and giants seem quite natural to it . In the morning of the day we went to the Nunnery , Mr. Hawthorne took Julian and went to the Douglas market , which is held in the open air . . . . My husband said that living manners were so interesting and valuable that he would not miss the scene for even Peel Castle . One day , when Una and I went to shop in Douglas , we saw in the market square a second-hand bookstall . I had been trying in vain to get Peveril of the Peak at the library and bookstores , and hoped this person Some A'liemories of Hawthorne . // might have it . So I looked over his books , and what do you think I saw ? A well-read and soiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blithedale Romance ! Yes , even in Mona . We have heard of some families in England who keep in use two copies of The Scarlet Letter ; but I never dreamed of finding either of these books here . Sunday was the perfectest day in our remembrance . In the morning Mr. Hawthorne walked to Kirk Braddon , and the afternoon we spent on Douglas Head . It is quite impossible to put into words that afternoon . Such softness and splendor and freshness combined in the air ; such a clearest sunshine ; such a deep blue sea and cloudless blue heaven ; such fragrance and such repose . We looked from our great height upon all the beauty and grandeur , and in Mr. Hawthorne 's face was a reflection of the incredible loveliness and majesty of the scene . Una was a lily , and Julian a magnolia . I think that for once , at least , Mr. Hawthorne was satisfied with weather and circumstances . Towards sunset the mountains of Cumberland were visible , for the first time during our visit , on time horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that day . A pale purple outline of waving hills lay on the silvery sea , which , as it grew later , became opaline in hue . My mother gives , in a letter , a glimpse of the vicissitudes of the Consulate , - that precinct which I pictured as an ogre 's lair , though the ogre was temporarily absent , while my father , like a prince bewitched , had been compelled by a rash vow to languish in the man-eater 's place for a term * years - " In the evening Mr. Hawthorne told me that there were suddenly thrown upon his care two hundred soldiers who had been shipwrecked in the San Francisco , and that he must clothe and board them and send them home to the United States . They were picked up somewhere on the sea and brought to Liverpool . Mr. Hawthorne has no official authority to take care of any but sailors in distress . He invited the lieutenant to come and stay here , and he must take care of them the soldiers , even if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen since , in an American paper , a passage in which the writer undertakes to defend my husband from some dirty aspersions . It seems that some one had told the absolute falsehood that he had shirked all responsibility about the soldiers , and his defender stated the case just as it was , and that Mr. Buchanan declined having anything to do with the matter . The government will make the chartering of the steamer good to Mr. Hawthorne . He has been very busily occupied at the Consulate this winter and spring , - so many shipwrecks and disasters , and vagabonds asking for money . He has already lost more than a hundred pounds by these impostors . But he is very careful indeed , and those persons who have proved dishonest were gentlemen in their own esteem , and it was difficult to suspect them . But he is well on his guard now ; and he says the moment he sees a coat-tail he knows whether the man it belongs to is going to beg ! His life in the Comisulate is not charming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his toil . INot that he has any drudgery , but he is imprisoned and in harness . He will not let me take a pen in my hand when he is at home , because at any rate I see him so little . " Such paragraphs as the one I add , from a little letter of my sister 's , often appear ; but in this instance it was the glad exclamation of release , just before we removed to Italy : - " Papa will be with us on Monday , free from the terrors of the old Consulate . Perhaps you can imagine what infinitely joyful news that is to us ; and to him , too , as much , if not more so ; for he has had all the work , and we have only suffered from his absence . " // An interval of complete delight is thus described : - RHYL , NORTH WALES . M* DEAR FATHER , - Dr. Drysdale thought we needed another change of air , and so we came south this time . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea into living gold , and the heights into heaps of amethyst . On the right is only sea , sea , sea . - - I intended to go to the Queen 's Hotel , and knew nothing about the manner of living in the lodging fashion . So we have to submit to German silver and the most ordinary table service . . . . Ever since our marriage we have always eaten off the finest French china , and had all things pretty and tasteful ; because , you know , I would never have second-best services , considering my husband to be my most illustrious guest . But now ! It is really laughable to think of the appointments of the table at which the Ambassador to Lisbon and the American Consul sat down last Saturday , when they honored me with their presence . And we did laugh , for it was of no consequence , - and the great bow-window of our parlor looked out upon the sea . We did not come here to see French china and pure silver forks and spoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean , and drive to magnificent old castles , - and get rid of whooping-cough . I had the enterprise to take all the children and Mary , and come without Mr. Hawthorne ; for he was in a great hurry to get me off , fearing the good weather would not last . He followed on Saturday with Mr. O'Sullivan , who arrived from Lisbon just an hour before they both started for Rhyl . - . - Julian 's worship of nature and natural objects meets with satisfaction here . - The following was also written from Rhyl : - " While the carriage stopped I heard the rapturous warble of the skylark , and finally discovered him , mounting higher still and higher , pressing upwards , and pouring out such rich , delicious music that I wanted to close my eyes and shut out the world , and listen to nothing but that . Not evea Shelley 's or Wordsworth 's words can convey an adequate idea of this song . It seems as if its little throat were the outlet of all the joy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with all its power it were besieging heaven with gratitude and love for the infinite bliss of life . Life , joy , love . The blessed , darling little bird , quivering , warbling , urging its way farther and farther ; and finally swooning with excess of delight , and sinking back to earth ! You see I am vainly trying to help you to an idea of it , but I can not do it . I do not understand why the skylark should not rise from our meadows as well , and the nightingale sing to our roses . " Society and the sternness of life were , however , but a hair's-breadth away : - " Monday evening Mr. Hawthorne went to Richmond Hill to meet Mr. Buchanan . The service was entirely silver , plates and all , and in a high state of sheen . The Qneen 's autograph letter was spoken of ( which you will see in the Northern Times that goes with this ) and as it happens to be very clumsily expressed , Mr. Hawthorne was much perplexed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dinner , what he thought of the Queen 's letter . ' Mr. Hawthorne replied that it showed very kind feeling . No , ' persisted the wicked Ambassador ; but what do you think of the style ? ' Mr. Hawthorne was equal to him , or rather , conquered him , however , for he said , The Queen has a perfect right to do what she pleases with her own English . ' Mr. Hawthorne thought Miss Lane , Mr. Buchanan 's niece , a very elegant person , and far superior to any English lady present . The next evening Mr. Hawthorne went to another dinner at Everton ; so that on // Wednesday , when we again sat down together , I felt as if he had been gone a month . This second dinner was not remarkable in any way , except that when the ladies took leave they all went to him and requested to shake hands with him ! " No act of the British people in behalf of the soldiers has struck me as so noble and touching as that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to contribute something to the Patriotic Fund . The only way they could do it was by fasting . So from Sunday night till Tuesday morning they ate nothing , and the money saved ( three pounds and over ) was sent to the Fund ! Precious money is this . " There is an English region , stately , with a grand outline of sea and sandhills , of hard-bosomed endless beach and vast sky , where my father stands forth very distinctly in my memory . This is Redcar , to which we fared on our return from Italy . When he went out , at fixed hours of the day , between the hours for writing , he walked over the long , long beach , very often , with my brother and myself ; stopping now and then in his firm , regal tread to look at what nature could do in far-stretching color and beckoning horizon-line . Along the saud - hills , frolicking in the breeze or faithfully clinging in the strong wind to their native thimbleful of earth , hung the cerulean harebells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes . In the preface to Monte Beni , the compliment paid to Redcar is well hidden . My father speaks of reproducing the book ( sketched out among the dreamy interests of Florence ) " on the broad and dreary sands of Redcar , with the gray German Ocean tumbling in upon me , and the northern blast always howling in my ears . " Nothing could have pleased him better as an atmosphere for his work ; all that the atmosphere included he did not mean to admit , just then . And London was not so very far away . On September 9,1859 , my mother says in her diary , " My husband gave me his manuscript to read . " There are no other entries on that day or the next , except , " Reading manuscript . " On the 11th she says , " Reading manuscript for the second time . " The diary refers to reading the story on the next day , but on the two following days , in which she was to finish as much of the manuscript as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than words to me , who know so well how she never set aside daily rules , and how unbrokenly her little diaries flow on . In October , at Leamington , she mentions again " reading Monte Beni , " and a few days later says , " I read the manuscript of Monte Beni again ; " continuing for two days more . About a month later , on November 8 , is recorded , in very large script , " My husband to-day finished his book , The Romance of Monte Beni . " I thought that the petty lodging in which we were established was an odd nook for my father to be in . I liked to get out with him upon the martial plain of sand and tremendous waves , where folly was not , by law of wind and light of Titan power , and where the most insignificant ornament was far from insignificant : the whorl of an exquisite shell , beautiful and still , as if just dead ; or the seaweeds , that are so like pictures of other growths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kind but never familiar man who walked and reflected there . We enjoyed a constant outdoor life . But in those uninspired hours when there was no father in sight , and my mother was resting in seclusion , I played at grocer 's shop on the sands with a little girl called Hannah , whom I then despised for her name , her homely neat clothes , her sweetness and silence , and in retrospect learned to love . As we pounded brick , secured sugary-looking sands of different tints , and heaped up minute pebbles , a darkly clad , tastefully picturesque form would approach , - a // form to which I bowed down in spirit as , fortunately for me , my father . He would look askance at my utterly useless , time-frittering amusement , which I already knew was withering my brain and soul . In his tacit reproach my small intellect delighted , and loftier thoughts than those of the counter would refresh me for the rest of the day ; and I thankfully returned to the heights and lengths of wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
