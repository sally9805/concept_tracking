txt In The Evening Post of Saturday there appeared a communication treating of the law of the Maine case , of which we reprint the concluding paragraph : When the facts found , the inferences and conclusions drawn therefrom , by the naval experts shall have been officially announced , the attitude taken by Spain , if fault or neglect be imputed to her ( which is not to Le now assumed ) will naturally depend on the opinions of the Cabinets of Europe , which opinions will be influenced by the clearness and cogency with which the views of our Government shall be exhibited by the Department of State . For even in the present regime of armored battleships , torpedoes , torpedo boats , and explosive mines in the depths of the sea , it may be , as when But , - wan LYTTON wrote sixty years ago , that " Beneath the rule of men entirely great , The pen is mightier than the sword . " The greatest of our international triumphs since National independence was won have been achieved not by naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . S. W. To guess who might be the author of this letter would be a forbidden venture , though even without thy well-known initials over which it appears its tone and the knowledge and breadth with which Its subject is treated would suggest to the reader that it came from an authoritative source . But in the passage we quote there is a suggestion of such wisdom that if it came from an altogether anonymous pen it would arrest attention and be worth the heeding of those in high place at Washington . The policy of Spain will be largely influenced , the writer supposes , by " the opinions of the Cabinets of Europe , " which would naturally be consulted by a Weak nation confronted by a situation of extreme gravity and peril. - And the Cabinets of Europe , in their turn , are likely to be influenced in their opinions by " the clearness and cogency " with which the facts and the reasoning of the Maine case are presented by our Department of State . Mr. Joax SuERMAN is at the head of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose days of clearness and capacity for cogent statement have forever passed away . He retains office , though quite incapable of performing its duties , apparently because the President is too tender-hearted to ask for his resignation . Meanwhile , international affairs of most unwonted delicacy press upon the department for hourly decision . The highest interests of the Nation are imperiled for a sentiment of pity that would be weak in private life and is culpable in these great offices . A Hamilton Fish or a Richard Olney , with the statement of the Maine court of inquiry before him , might prepare a statement that would convince the world , compel the assent of Madrid , and avert war , if it should chance that the peril of war lay in the case . The Administration has neither an Olney nor a Fish  --  it has no Secretary of State at all . It has no trained international lawyer within its circle . In a period of special stress of weather it is taking its chances of making port with a palsied helmsman . This is not right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
