txt An important question for the Legislature to consider before this matter of protecting the Croton water supply is finally disposed of is whether the Department of Public Works of this city is authorized to spend money enough to clear away all the nuisances that are now polluting the water . As a safeguard against the spread of cholera everything should be done now to insure the purity of the water for the present season . The law only authorizes the expenditure of $500,000 a year for three years , and that is intended chiefly to pay for land . But the removal of actual causes of pollution now existing should be complete regardless of cost , and should be accomplished as speedily as possible . Will half a million dollars be enough for this year 's work ? Some trustworthy estimate should be made , and authority should be given for such expenditure as may be found necessary to make Mr. DALY 'S raid effectual . The abortive scheme of real estate speculation through which a new Custom House was to be located at the Bowling Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it is to acquire no property and derive no advantage from the proceedings taken to condemn land for a site . Yesterday the order for condemnation proceedings was vacated , and besides the costs and disbursements taxable against the Government an allowance of 5 per cent . upon the $2,000,000 of property appraised was granted to those who have been bothered with the proceedings . It will tql.ce a good while to clear up and get rid of the extravagances of the last four years . In the discussion of the recent change in our diplomatic customs , by which the title and . rank of Ambassador are given to our representatives at the chief capitals , there is one point very generally ignored . It may very well be that a Minister could , if he chose , enforce just as agreeable treatment as he would receive if he were an Ambassador . though we can see no harm in his securing that treatment without having to enforce it . But , so long as we did not give the higher rank to our own representatives , other Governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . The result was that Washington was not a post sought by foreign diplomatists of the first order , or , if sought , was sure to be abandoned when the incumbent secured promotion . It may be said that that was solely the concern of foreign Governments , but this is not quite true . Other things being equal , it is best for us to have the best men to deal with . The change insures substantial advantages . We have not yet seen any substantial disadvantages likely to accrue from it . The Grace Church chimes are perhaps the most sweet and melodious in the city . Yet poor old Mr. MORSELL shot himself dead rather than endure any longer the nervous shock and suffering caused by the ringing of the chimes . Stiff thousands of persons , well or ill , must put up every day with the brazen din of great bells , weighing a ton or two . harsh , nerve-tearing , and monstrous unpleasant . There was a time long ago when bells called the worshippers to church . They are supposed still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York City there are possibly three-quarters of a million watches , certainly a million clocks , and a few hundred public dials that tell the hour to every passer-by . If bells  --  the big , sky-filling bells , we mean  --  still give pleasure to anybody , the rights of those persons to a continuance of the same should be considered . If they give pain to many persons theirright to peace and quiet should . be considered , too . But clearly the time has long passed when anybody can claim that a bell is needful to him as a summons to public worship and so must be kept a-ringing . Mr. MORSELL 'S tragic protest la worth heeding . I The President of the French Republic is in the way very seriously to compromise his own position and to aggravate the dangers of the political situation . M. CONSTANS is undoubtedly the choice of the nation for the head of the Government , as the only strong , safe , and experienced Republican who is absolutely untouched by the Panama scandal . Such a demand must be heeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has often boon complied with by Queen VICTORIA , even in cases in which she has made no effort to conceal her personal antipathy to the selection made for her . M. CARNOT , however , as an elective Chief Magistrate goes further than a hereditary Chief Magistrate would venture to do , when he again postpones M. ** to a man like M. MELINE , whom it would not be fair to call a nonentity , but for whom there is no public demand . It seems plain that M. MELINE 'S Ministry will be quite as provisional as that which it succeeds , and it is likely to be even shorter lived . An organization is now forming in this city - which promises to be of great utility , and which may easily make some portions at least of the buildings and property of the municipality worthy of the respect of intelligent New-Yorkers . Its purpose is to secure an annual fund by the contributions ( small for each ) of its members , from which the society can offer to decorate , in an adequate fashion , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply a fountain or statue to some one of the squares or parks , or in like manner contribute to the beauty of the city and its attractiveness both to residents and visitors . A few thousand dollars expended each year in this way , under the direction of men of trained judgment and skill , would in no long time greatly change the appearance of the public buildings and places of the town . Much has been done in this direction within a few years , but a. systematic and intelligent organization of effort can not but be very fruitful .
