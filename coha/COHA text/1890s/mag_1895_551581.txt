THE ORDINANCE OF 1787 . OLD SOUTH PRIZE ESSAY , 1893 . By E/izabe//i LI . Te/low . T the close of the Revolutionary War , large tracts of land bordering on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers , which no longer belonged to the British crown , w e r e claimed by different states , chiefly Virginia , Connecticut , New York and Massachusetts . These states based their claims on the fact that they had won the land from the Indians , as in the case of Virginia through Colonel George Rogers Clark 's expedition , or that their charters embraced part of it . The other states , especially Maryland , complained at having no share in lands which they had helped to take from Great Britain . One by one , at the invitation of Congress , to which body the dissatisfied states had appealed , the claimants ceded the land to the United States , but in several instances with accompanying conditions which hindered legislation with regard to these vacant lands . It was through the hesitation of Congress to accept these unsatisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the territory , that the first two plans for western settlement failed . The first of these unsuccessful plans originated in Massachusetts in 1783 , its distinct purpose being the relief of the soldiers who were thrown out of occupation by the cessation of hostilities between the colonies and Great Britain and in vain demanded pay for past services . Rufus Putnam and Timothy Pickering , two Massachusetts army officers , were foremost in petitioning Congress for a grant of land between the Ohio River and Lake Erie , where the Qfficers of the Federal army who had 53 associated themselves for this purpose could build up a new state , in which there should be ample provision for education , and in which slavery should have no existence . The settlers were to organize their own government , and the new state was to enter the Union immediately on the same footing as the other states . Toward the end of this year , 1783 , another petition , presented to Congress by officers of the Federal army , through the influence of General Rufus Putnam , failed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under discussion . The second plan for western settlement was brought forward by Theodoric Bland , a member of Congress from Virginia , in the hope that by means of the sale of this western land the United States could pay part of the great war debt . All the soldiers were to receive land in payment of their dues ; but ten thousand acres out of every one hundred thousand were to be reserved for the use of the United States government , - the revenue derived from the land to be devoted to the founding of seminaries of learning , the erecting of frontier forts , and the payment of the civil list of the United States . This movement , having merely financial ends in view , would probably never have brought about any important results , even if it had proved successful . These early movements , however , resulted in the revision of Virginia 's act of cession in accordance with the desires of Congress , on March i , 1784 ; and on that very day a committee , having Thomas Jefferson for its chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western territory . According to the final report of this committee , as it // was amended in Congress and passed April 23 , all the territory " ceded or to be ceded " was to be divided into two rows of states from east to west , the states being bounded on the north and south by the odd parallels of latitude . Distinct provision was ma ( Ie for seven states lying wholly north of the Ohio River , where the territory had already been ceded , and for another state , more than half of which lay north of the Ohio River . This division also implied the formation of six or seven new states south of the Ohio , when the territory should be ceded . Each of these states was to adopt the constitution of one of the thirteen original states , until it contained twenty thousand inhabitants , when it could establish a permanent government of its own . As soon , moreover , as it had a number of inhabitants equal to the number in the least populous of the thirteen original states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean time could he represented in Congress by a delegate having the privilege of debating but not of voting . In the first draft of the report of Jefferson 's committee it had been provided that there should be no slavery in the territory after the year i8oo , except as a punishment for crime ; but when the ordinance was passed , April 23 , 1784 , in addition to several minor changes , this provision had been struck out . That Jefferson realized the incompleteness of his government ordinance , which failed to provide for a systematic settlement of the lands , is shown by the fact that on May 7 , with the help of four colleagues , among them Gerry of Massachusetts , he reported a supplementary ordinance providing for the disposal of the public lands . In March of the next year this ordinance was referred to a new committee , of which Rufus King , a Massachusetts representative , was a member ; and the report of this committee provided for the survey of five ranges , extending from the Ohio to Lake Erie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservation of two square miles in every township for the support of education and religion . The report was adopted May 20 , but without the reservation of land for the support of religion . In the year 1785 Rufus King , instigated by Timothy Pickering , proposed that the anti-slavery provision , changed so as to prohibit slavery immediately from the states described in the ordinance of 1784 , by which he meant the states north of the Ohio River , distinctly specified in the ordinance of 1784 , should be restored to this ordinance . The committee of three , to whom this proposition was referred , decided against this change , and added to the provision in its original form - except that their provision , too , was to apply not to all the territory " ceded or to be ceded , " but only to the states north of the Ohio - a clause providing for the return of fugitive slaves found within the territory ; butthe action of Congress on their report was postponed in favor of the land ordinance then in process of formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the summer of 1785 James Monroe of Virginia visited the West to be present at the formation of a treaty with the Indians at the mouth of the Great Miami , and returned with a strong sense of the imprudence of dividing the territory into so large a number of states as were l ) rovided for by Jefferson 's ordinance . The committee to which the matter had been referred recommended that Virginia and Massachusetts should revise their acts of cession so that Congress should be at liberty to divide the new territory into not more than five nor less than three states . Soon after this , on the motion of Nathan Dane of Massachusetts , a committee was appointed , of which Monroe was chairman and Rufus King a member , to draw up another ordinance for the government of this western territory ; and the report of this committee embodied a great change . Henceforth the new states , instead of adopting the constitutions of the original states for their temporary governments , were to be governed by a governor , council , judges and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached a certain population could they elect a legislature . No reference was made to the exclusion of slavery . In the summer of 1786 William Grayson of Virginia sought to modify Monroe 's // resolution with regard to the division of the western territory into states , by proposing that it should be divided into five states , one east , another west of Lake Michigan , and three south of the parallel passing through the southern extremity of this lake . At this time the Spaniards held the land at the mouth of the Mississippi River and refused to concede to the United States the free navigation of this important highway to the sea . The inhabitants of the western states were thus cut off from the easiest and most advantageous way of disposing of the abundant products of their soil ; and moreover there was danger that the southwestern states would abandon the confederacy and seek an alliance with Spain for the sake of being admitted to this privilege of navigation . The Spanish minister , in his treaty with the United States , offered the latter several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to gain ; and to bring about a speedy settlement of this favorable commercial treaty these states were willing to sacrifice the free navigation of the Mississippi River , in which they had no direct interest . Thus the southern states were eager to promote western settlement and thereby gain new advocates to oppose the northern states on the Mississippi question ; whereas the northern states , dreading this opposition , and fearing that western emigration would thin their own populations , to say nothing of the fact that some of them had lands in the East which they wished to sell , were rather jealous of the progress of the West and defeated Grayson 's motion for increasing the number of western states . In the autumn of 1786 Monroe 's ordinance was referred to a committee of which Johnson of Virginia was chairman and Nathan Dane of Massachusetts a prominent member . Dane introduced into this report a provision relating to the conveyance of property , borrowed with changes from the Massachusetts code of laws . Moreover , this ordinance guaranteed to the inhabitants the right of habeas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they are the first of the nature of a bill of rights to appear in any ordinance for the government of the western territory . On April 26 , 1787 , this same committee presented another report , which , when amended , provided that the territory north of the Ohio River , regarded as one district , should be governed by a governor and judges appointed by Congress , and a legislative body composed of the governor and judges , until it contained five thousand free male inhabitants of full age , when the people could elect a house of representatives . The provision relating to the habeas corpus act and trial by jury was retained , but Dane 's provision with regard to the conveyance of property was struck out . Action upon this report was delayed until July 9 , when it was referred to a new committee which drafted the great ordinance of July is , i787 . Meantime an important event helped to hasten this result . In the year 1786 a company called the Ohio Company had been organized in Massachusetts by General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of western land , having among its members many of the officers and soldiers whose petition to Congress in 1783 had been defeated ; and a year later Samuel Holden Parsons , one of the directors of this company , was sent to negotiate with Congress for the purchase of a million acres of land bordering on the Ohio and Muskingum Rivers . His views , however , proved to be at variance with those of the company ; and July 5 , i787 , Manasseh Cutler , another agent , arrived in New York , where Congress was in session , for the same purpose . Stimulated by the prospect of so extensive a purchase to hasten in devising a better form of government for the western territory , Congress appointed a new committee , of which Edward Carrington of Virginia was chairman ; and the report of this committee , drawn up by Nathan Dane , and presented July i i , passed in Congress with only one negative vote , which was cast by Mr. Yates of New York . Soon after this Manasseh Cutler completed his negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final ordinance , already referred to , regarded the territory northwest of the // Ohio as one district , and provided for it *n elaborate temporary government , to consist of a governor and judges appointed by Congress and certain officers appointed by the governor , until the district should contain five thousand free male inhabitants , when it could have a general assembly and a representative in Congress with the right to debate but not to vote . It was provided that the district should be subsequently divided into not more than five nor less than three states ; and when one of these states , their boundaries having been specified in the ordinance , should contain sixty thousand inhabitants , it could be admitted to the confederacy . Dane 's provision with regard to the conveyance of property was revived . Articles of compact were added providing for the freedom of religious worship , the spread of education , kind treatment of the Indians , the maintenance of justice , freedom of navigation , the republican character of the government , just administration of taxes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the government of the western territory , except the committee of which Jefferson was chairman in i 784 , Massachusetts was represented , - once by Elbridge Gerry , twice by Rufus King and twice by Nathan Dane . The influence of these men and of other Massachusetts men whose interest in western settlement enlisted their aid in the development of the ordinance of i 787 , was brought to bear principally on the second provision of the ordinance and on the first , second , third and sixth articles of compact and the last provision of the fourth article of compact , and here we can distinguish their influence from the influence exerted by men of other states . The second provision of the ordinance concerns the conveyance of property , and is important because it guards against the inequalities in the inheritance of property , which are fatal to republican institutions . Nathan Dane states , in a letter to Daniel Webster in 1830 , and in his " Abridgment and Digest of American Law , " that he copied this provision from the Massachusetts law ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Massachusetts law , however , an exception is made in favor of the eldest son , who is to receive two shares of the property , while each of the other children receives only one ; but Nathan Dane provided that the estate should be divided among the sons and daughters in equal parts . This subject of the conveyance of property had been touched upon in the land ordinance framed by Jefferson just after the passage of his government ordinance , and never voted upon ; but by Jefferson 's ordinance the daughters were not to have equal shares with the sons . Nathan Dane deserves credit not only for reviving this important provision , but for changing it so as to make these titles to property " more purely republican , " as he says in his " Abridgment of American Law , " " and more completely divested of feudality than any other titles in the Union were in July , i787 . " The first article of compact of the ordinance provides for freedom of religious worship ; the second guarantees to the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury , a proportionate representation of the people in the legislature , and judicial procedure according to the course of the common law , and provides for the limitations of fines and punishments and for the protection of property and of private contracts ; the third provides for the . , encouragement of education , including in the term moral and religious training , and for just treatment of the Indians ; the sixth for the immediate as well as permanent exclusion of slavery , modified by the addition of the fugitive slave law ; and the last provision of the fourth for free navigation on the tributaries of the Mississippi and St. Lawrence Rivers . None of these ideas was new , but this was the first time they had been brought together in a complete bill of rights . If we trace first the history of article six and of the first provision of article three , we shall be able to study articles one and two , the last provision of article three , and the last provision of article four , in the light of certain outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which helped to bring about , in the ordinance of i " 8 ' 7- this // important addition to Johnson 's meagre plan for the government of the western territory . In the first document providing for the government of a new western state , drawn up by Timothy Pickering and presented to Congress by Rufus Putnam in behalf of the officers of the Federal army , there is a clause providing ' irrevocably for the total exclusion of slavery , a prohibition which , though it never gained legal force , set the example of anti-slavery sentiment , not tim idly , but with unmistakable strength . Moreover , in this same petiti()n to Congress it was provided that all land remaining after individuals had received their shares should be disposed of for the public good , - among other things , for establishing schools and academies . The letters written by Putnam and Pickering on the subject of western settlement show that they entertained these ideas . Putnam , in a letter to Washington in 1783 , explaining the expectations of the petitioners , speaks of an allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in a letter to Rufus King in 1785 Pickering speaks* with regret of the absence , in the ordinance of 784 , of any provision for schools and academies , and with indignation of the omission of an anti-slavery clause , calling the latter a terrible calamity which he solemnly urges King to prevent . It may be that this letter of Pickering 's had some indirect influence in bringing about the provision in the land ordinance of May 20 , 1785 , that two sections in every township should be set apart for purposes of education and religion , for King was a member of the committee which prepared this ordinance . Certain it is that it was through the influence of this letter that King , in 1785 , proposed that the anti-slavery provision which had been struck out of the first draft of Jefferson 's ordinance should be restored in a form which would prohibit slavery immediately from the western territory . It is fortunate for the West that this proposition was not adopted in the form in which it was finally reported by the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since in this form it granted to slavery fifteen years in which to gain a firm foothold on the soil . When the Ohio Company was formed in 1786 , its members probably shared the views of Putnam and Pickering , who were the chief originators of the company ; and we find them selecting for their agent Manasseh Cutler , a Massachusetts clergyman of wide education , high principles and keen practical sagacity , who shows , in a sermon which he preached at Marietta in 1788 , his sense of the importance of educational and religious institutions in the new country . The fact that he was empowered to make this extensive purchase , which afforded to Congress an opportunity of paying part of the national war debt and provided for the immediate settlement of the western territory by earnest , persevering men , who would protect the frontiers and promote the commercial interests of the country , gave Manasseh Cutler great influence over this body . Moreover , Washington , who was the most influential man in the country , and who was interested in the advancement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned in the West , sympathized heartily with the undertaking of the Ohio Company , whose members had suffered with him the hardships of war , and are said to have looked to the West for their future homes at his suggestion . This sympathy is shown in his cordial wish that he could hasten the action of Congress with regard to the officers ' petition for lands in the West , a wish expressed in a letter to Rufus Putnam in 1784 . It was he who had forwarded Putnam 's memorial to Congress in 1783 ; and now , in 1787 , his friendship was a bond of union between these Massachusetts soldiers and his Virginia brethren , Lee , Carrington and Grayson , the most influential men left in Congress after it had been thinned by the departure of many of its members to the Philadelphia convention . Dr. Cutler arrived in New York , where Congress was in session , July 5 , 1787. and his memorial was referred to a conimittee in which Massachusetts was represented by Nathan Dane and Rufus King , Edward Carrington of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to seek a better // government for the western territory ; and five days after Cutler 's arrival Johnson 's ordinance , which had failed to be called up May io , was referred to a new committee , in which Edward Carrington , the chairman , and Richard Henry Lee represented Virginia ; John Kean , South Carolina ; and in which Nathan Dane and Melancthon Smith , the former scribe , represented the two northern states , Massachusetts and New York . The fact that Carrington and Dane were members of both committees established a connecting link between this committee and the committee appointed to consider the purchase . It was a long time before Dr. Cutler could obtain from Congress the terms of purchase which he had settled upon with Rufus Putnam and Samuel Parsons , his fellow directors , especially the grant of lands for the establishment of schools and an academy and the lot in each township for the support of religion , each of which he was determined not to give up ; and during this interval he became acquainted with several mem hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged ideas on the subject of a new settlement . In his diary for July io Dr. Cutler tells us that a copy of the ordinance was submitted to him with a request that he would make any suggestions he chose to make ; that he proposed several amendments , and that when he returned from Philadelphia , where he spent the next seven days from July io to July 17 , he received a copy of the ordinance as it was finally passed , and found that all but one of the amendments which he had suggested had been made . He had proposed that the new states should not be liable to continental taxation until they were entitled to full representation in Congress ; but Congress , arguing that this would unduly stimulate emigration , granted instead to the new states representation with the right of debating but not of voting . There has been found , too , among the papers of the Ohio Company , a copy of the ordinance of 1787 , with a pencil note in the margin to the effect that the provisions relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manasseh Cutler ; and his son remembers to have heard his father say , a year after the passage of this ordinance , that he was the author of these provisions . William Parker Cutler , William F. Poole , George F. Hoar , Edward Everett Hale and others , taking into consideration the precedent supplied to Manasseh Cutler by Pickering and Putnam , the anti-slavery principles , the devotion to education , and the love of justice and free inquiry of Massachusetts men of whom the Ohio Company was largely composed , the power possessed by Cutler over Congress by virtue of the advantageous purchase he was authorized to make , the statement in Dr. Cutler 's diary , and the astonishing fact that the antislavery provision , till now strenuously opposed by the southern states , was passed in a Congress where these states were in the majority , have thought that- this Massachusetts clergyman set out from Boston with the intention not only of obtaining favorable terms for the purchase of western land , but of forcing Congress to make the ordinance for the government of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were going to settle there . Some go so far as to think that he prepared an ordinance of his own and submitted it for approval to his two colleagues , Putnam and Parsons , in the flying visits which he paid them on his way to New York . There is absolutely no proof that Manasseh Cutler forced Congress to add to or subtract from the ordinance of 1787 one single clause . July io he took the liberty , as he modestly expressed it , to suggest certain amendments to the draft which Nathan Dane submitted to him , and as soon as he had returned it he set out for Philadelphia . From July i i to July 13 , while he was away , the ordinance of 1787 was discussed , amended and passed by Congress , and when he returned , July 17 , it was a law . The articles of compact at least could not be changed except by the common consent of the states . If Manasseh Cutler had , before July io , laid hIs demands with regard to the ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had so thoroughly persuaded them of the // advantages of yielding to these demands rather than sacrifice the opportunities afforded by the purchase , as to feel sure that they would adopt his amendments , and to have no hesitation in going away at the critical moment , we have no proof of it . But he not only felt no hesitation in going away . " I thought this the most favorable time to go on to Philadelphia , " he wrote in his diary , just after mentioning that he had returned , with suggested amendments , the copy of the ordinance submitted to him by Nathan Dane . Now , when the Ohio Company was formed , in 1786 , its members proposed to purchase western land in accordance with the land ordinance of May 20 , 1786 , and this land ordinance was supplementary to the government ordin'ance of 1784 , which contained no prohibition of slavery . This does not favor the inference that they considered the abolition of slavery a necessary condition of their settling there . Moreover , if Dr. Cutler had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government of the territory a sine qua non with reference to the purchase , he would doubtless have made some statement to this effect in his memorial . The probability is that Nathan Dane consulted Manasseh Cutler out of respect for the interests of the men whom he represented , who had the best right to have their ideas considered in the matter of a government for land which they were about to settle on ; that Dr. Cutler suggested the revival of certain principles which had long been in the minds of other men , and that Nathan Dane , appreciating their importance , embodied them in the ordinance in the form in which they appear there . We can not be sure just which these provisions were . Nathan Dane claims that he took the clause relating to the encouragement of education from the Massachusetts code of laws . But the sentiments of the Ohio Company with regard to the advancement of education , which are expressed in a vote passed at the second meeting of the company , March 5 , 1788 , " That the directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education of youth , " the untiring efforts made by Manasseh Cutler to obtain grants of land for purposes of education , and his labor in behalf of the Ohio University in later years , give weight to the evidence afforded by the pencilled note in the copy of the ordinance found among the Ohio papers , stating that he furnished the provision for the encouragement of education . He probably suggested it and Nathan Dane embodied it in the ordinance in the language of a provision of the Massachusetts law . In a letter to Daniel Webster in 1830 , and also in the appendix to his " Abridgment of American Law , " Dane traces the history of the anti-slavery provision , giving credit to Jefferson and King , but claiming for himself the credit of its appearance in the ordinance of 1787 , where it prohibited slavery immediately from all the territory northwest of the Ohio River . In a letter to Rufus King three days after the ordinance was passed , he says that he omitted this clause in the final draft , feeling sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only eastern state , but that when he found the house favorable he proposed this amendment , which passed with a unanimous vote . This statement is upheld by the discovery in 1820 of a printed copy of the ordinance with the slavery article at the end in Nathan Dane 's handwriting . Probably to Dr. Cutler belongs the credit of the suggestion of this provision , which was discussed and left undecided by the committee , and to Nathan Dane the credit of its introduction on his own responsibility as an amendment . There are two reasons why the southern states should suddenly agree to an anti-slavery provision in the ordinance of 1787 , when they had opposed a similar provision in Jefferson 's draft only three years before . In Jefferson 's ordinance the anti-slavery provision was to have force in all the territory " ceded or to be ceded , " - which would in time embrace several new southern states ; but the ordinance of 1787 prohibits slavery only from the territory northwest of the Ohio River , - and , moreover , this clause is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it seems probable , judging from a letter written by Charles Thomson , the // secretary of Congress , that the southern states would have opposed Rufus King 's motion in 1785 , although in its final form it contained the fugitive slave law and was to have force only in the states distinctly provided for in the ordinance of 1784 , all of which lay north of the Ohio . The eagerness of the southern states to promote western settlement , in order to gain new advocates for opposing the Spanish monopoly of the navigation of the Mississippi River , has already been mentioned ; and they were also influenced by the fact that western settlement would increase the value of their back lands by creating commercial traffic and affording protection to the frontiers . It is not strange , therefore , that in this matter of an anti-slavery provision they should be willing to yield to the northern states , in order to gain their ready co-operation in making possible immediate western settlement . Ivloreover , William Grayson states , in a letter written in August , 1787 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indigo and tobacco , and were quite willing that the new western states , through not having slaves to work on their pkintations , should be cut off from the possibility of cultivating these staples . Professor Barrett , in his pamphlet , speaks of the great influence exerted in Congress by Grayson , its president , Lee and Carrington at the time when the ordinance was passed , when many prominent congressmen who would not easily have followed their lead were away at Philadelphia . In 1785 William Grayson was the only Virginia member to vote that Rufus King 's anti-slavery proposition should be referred to a committee ; and a letter of his to Timothy Pickering in this same year shows his warm friendship for the man and his sympathy with his views , which we know were anti-slavery in the extreme . These men , whose principles could not be stifled by party jealousies , saw in this settlement the means , as Carrington expressed it , " of introducing into the country , in the first instance , a description of men who will fix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably endure to the latest period of time ; " and they were willing to do everything in their power to promote the interests of these pioneers . Manasseh Cutler says in his diary for July 19 " Grayson , R. H. Lee and Carrington are certainly my warm advocates . " But our ability to account for the passage of the anti-slavery clause in the ordinance of 1787 , without believing that Manasseh Cutler made it a condition of the Ohio Company 's purchase , ought not to lead us to undervalue Dr. Cutler 's services in connection with this and other provisions of the ordinance . He had infinite tact and wonderful powers of persuasion ; and all the time he was in New York he was exerting over the members of Congress with whom he came in contact a quiet but powerful influence toward the promotion of education and religion and the establishment of a government based upon high principles in the western territory . When the opportunity came for following up this influence by practical suggestions with regard to the ordinance for the government of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed ; and it was probably due to his influence and the circumstance of the purchase that the necessity of embodying in their report a bill of rights , without which Johnson 's ordinance would have been incomplete , became impressed on the minds of the new committee . This seems likely from a letter written by Nathan Dane to Rufus King three days after the ordinance was passed , in which he says : " We tried one day to patch up M. 's p. system of W. government , started new ideas , and committed the whole to Carrington , Dane , R. H. Lee , Smith and Kean . We met several times , and at last agreed on some principles , - at least Lee , Smith and myself . We found ourselves rather pressed . The Ohio Company appeared to purchase a large tract of the federal lands , - about six or seven millions of acres , - and we wanted to abolish the old system and get a better one for the government of the country , and we finally found it necessary to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Nathan Dane and Melancthon Smith , only a month and a half later than April 26 , when they had voted for Johnson 's ordinance , which // contained only two provisions of the nature of a bill of rights , the two relating to the habeas corpus act and trial by jury , should help to frame , in less than five days , a new ordinance which is famous for the principles of toleration , justice and freedom embodied in its six articles of compact . The last part of the third article in the ordinance provides for just treatment of the Indians . General Rufus Putnam , later one of the directors of the Ohio Company , probably expressed the sentiments of his fellow petitioners in his letter to General Washington in 1783 , in which he represented the advantages to be gained by securing the friendship of the Indians through trade . In another letter , written in 1788 to a missionary living among the Indians , he states the intention of his fellow settlers to preserve good faith toward the Indians and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it unjustly ; and he mentions the peculiar advantage which New England men have in dealing with the Indians , because the latter have no cause on account of previous injuries to be prejudiced against them , and because their farming and manufacturing interests do not conflict with the pursuits of the Indians . The fact that such sentiments as these were entertained by one of Manasseh Cutler 's fellow directors might lead us to believe that the closing provision of the third article was one of those which he suggested , were it not that Nathan Dane claims originality in regard to this provision in his letter to Daniel Webster in 1830 and in his " Abridgment of American Law . " He certainly did not originate an idea which had been expressed , not only by Pickering and Putnam , but by Palatiah Webster , XVilliam Penn , Roger Williams and many others ; but he may have embodied it in the ordinance of his own accord and without copying it from any existing document , - and called that originality . Article four provides , among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi and St. Lawrence Rivers ; and we find that Timothy Pickering and Rufus Putnam , with their usual foresight , had taken into considera tion the necessity for the protection of navigation in the western territory . In a letter to General Washington in 1783 General Putman describes at length the advantage of communication between the Ohio and Scioto Rivers and Lake Erie , and recommends the establishment of a chain of forts to facilitate this end ; and in a letter to Rufus King in 1785 , Timothy Pickering dwells on the importance of free water communication in the western territory , and suggests natural boundaries for the states to bring about this result , - adding , however , that he thinks this method of boundary impracticable . Dr. Cutler , in a pamphlet which he published describing the western territory , traced four water routes of communication , one ending with the Hudson , another with the Potomac , another with the James River , and the fourth with the Ohio River , each being intercepted at least once by xvhat he calls portages , corresponding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 787 . These ideas on the part of Putnam , Pickering and Cutler are the basis for the inference of Dr. William Cutler , in his life of Manasseh Cutler , that the latter was responsible for the revival in the ordinance of 1787 of Grayson 's provision for the free navigation of the tributaries of the Mississippi and St. Lawrence Rivers . It is quite as likely , however , that this provision was suggested by one of the committee , two of whom , Carrington and Lee , were close sympathizers with Grayson , or that it presented itself to the far-seeing mind of Nathan Dane as a provision which it would be wise to perpetuate . Article one and the first six clauses of article two correspond closely to passages in the bills of rights of the different states , and were probably copied from the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights ; for Nathan Dane , who was at this time preparing an " Abridgment of American Law , " and was very familiar with the subject , especially with Massachusetts law , drafted the ordinance of 1787 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first appearance as provisions for the government of the western territory . He also , with trifling help from // Charles Pinckney , drafted Johnson 's ordinance , in which these two clauses just referred to , that relating to the habeas corpus act and that relating to trial by jury , are found for the first time in any ordinance for the government of the western territory . Moreover , Nathan Dane says , in his letter to Daniel Webster : " The other description " ( which includes this part of the ordinance ) " was selected mainly from the constitution and laws of Massachusetts , as any one may see who knows what American law was in 87 ; " and he makes a similar assertion in the appendix to his " Abridgment of American Law* " With regard to the authorship of the last clause of article two , providing for the protection of private contracts , there have been three theories . Dane claims originality with regard to this provision , stating vaguely in his " Abridgment of American Law " that it was " made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some have thought that the idea was suggested to him by the occurrence of Shays 's rebellion , in which a body of men in the western part of Massachusetts tried to prevent the courts from interfering in behalf of creditors , - which would be a silent acquiescence on the part of the state in the violation of private contracts between debtor and creditor . Dr. William Cutler asserts that this provision was inserted in the ordinance through the influence of Manasseh Cutler , as a safeguard against any attempts in the future to invalidate the title of the Ohio Company to their lands on the Muskingum , which they were forced to purchase by a private contract without any charter . George Bancroft , citing a letter written by the French ambassador in New York in 1787 , and a letter written by Lee himself , in which he claims the authorship of this provision and says that it is a proposition which he has not heard mentioned , urges that it originated with Richard Henry Lee and was intended to prevent the state from interfering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuing paper money which would soon depreciate . Bancroft 's interpretation is probably the true one , particularly as he does not award todLee all the credit of this provision , but takes into consideration Nathan Dane 's claim to a share of it . For a long time after the ordinance of i787 was passed , few people thought of disputing Nathan Dane 's claim to its authorship ; but William F. Poole 's article in the North American Review for April , i886 , bringing before the public Manasseh Cutler 's claims to a share in the honor , gave rise to a spirited discussion , which ended in an exaggerated belief on the part of a great many thoughtful men in Dr. Cutler 's influence upon the ordinance of 1787 . Rufus King , with dry humor , speaks of the subject as having " fallen under that morbid infirmity in literature which delights in denying Homer and Shakespeare their works , and sometimes has not spared even Holy Writ from its rage . ' ' Of late years there has been a revulsion of feeling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand Nathan Dane 's inconsistencies , and on the other the absence of any real evidence to prove many of the theories of those who award so large a share of the honor to Manasseh Cutler , have decided to adopt an intermediate belief between these two extremes . One thing is certain - that a political masterpiece like the ordinance of 1787 is never the product of one man 's brain , but develops gradually , absorbing the best thought and experience of many years . No one can fail to notice in a study of the ordinance of 1787 that the provisions which were developed largely by the action of Massachusetts men are the very ones which make the ordinance famous to-day and will preserve its fame in future generations . We may say of Massachusetts in the words of Henry Cabot Lodge : " She has fought for liberty ; she has done justice between man and man ; she has been the fruitful mother of ideas as of men ; her thought has followed the sun throughout the length of the country .
