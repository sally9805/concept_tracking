txt Never has a private citizen received at the hands of an admiring people a heartier or more spontaneous ' demonstration than was that given Grover Cleveland in Atlanta to-day . It was a reception that speaks volumes for tho popularity and strength Of the Democratic leader , for it came from the people of a City which has been widely and vigorously claimed as a Hill stronghold . The news of his coming through Atlanta was received only ' a few hours before the time of his arrival , and all the preparations had therefore to be prompt . As soon as the train . In the rear car of which the ex-President sat , reaohed the suburbs , there were evidences of what was in store . The manufacturing establishmeits and shops had suspended ' work and the whistles were being blown most vigorously and cannons boomed , and the employes , with heads uncovered , lined the tracks . As the train neared the Central Station , it was found almost impossible to proceed , so thick was the crowd of people on the tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many-throated crowd . One of the first to mount the ear was Gov . Northen , who gave Mr. Cleveland a hearty welcome and a pressing invitation to remain over a few hours as his guest . Mr. Cleveland could not do this . but in response to the Governor 's invitation and the repeated calls from the crowd outside , he went to the platform and for fifteen minutes was kept busy shaking the hands of admirers . There were cries for a speech , but for a long time Mr. Cleveland declined to respond . Finally he said : " I have refused your.Governor 's and every other application that has been made to Me to speak , but It takes a man with more backbone than I am said to possess to withstand your demands . I started on this trip for pleasure , and my movements have been as private as possible . Your abundant expressions of cordiality surprise me , and I shall go back to my Northern home more than ever impressed with the knowledge that you indorse such of my public acts as affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our next President ! ' and the cheering was so great that lie could proceed DO further . He lifted his hat in response to the compliment , and then the train uulled out ..
