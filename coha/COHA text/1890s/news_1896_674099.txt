The experiment of an American millionaire with a London newspaper has been a curious one from its very inception .

They swaggered through journalism , mocking here , bullying there , treading on all the toes within reach , like undergraduates on a spree at a country fair . They screamed with laughter at their own puns , they uttered deliberate gibberish for the sake of seeing their elders stare . It wz-. ? - ; all amazing sport  --  while it lasted .
