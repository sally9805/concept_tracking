txt This community has experienced a noteworthy loss in the death of WILLIAM A. STILES . Until three years ago Mr. STILES was scarcely known at all to the general public . To the special public which is interested in horticulture and arboriculture he was known as the editor of Garden and Forest . the most influential and authoritative periodical in those specialties that has been established in this country . The paper has been from its foundation of great interest and assistance to those who found in gardening , what BACON declares it to be , " the purest of human pleasures . " To his acquaintances its editor was known as a man of transparent honesty , of an active mind with an unusually wide range of interests , of quiet courage and of unaffected and instinctive public spirit , and of singular social charm . These mental and moral qualities of Mr. STILES , not less than the nature of his special studies , signalized him to those who knew him as a most fit man for the office of Park Commissioner when all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Autumn of 1895 . The Mayor , who was himself not insensible to the desirableness in at least one member of the board of those special qualifications which Mr. STILES possessed , appointed him accordingly , and from the date of his appointment to that of his disability from the illness that has proved fatal , Commis ' sioner STILES has continuously vindicated the wisdom of his selection . In so busy and money-hunting a community as New York , it seems unreasonable to expect that specially qualified men shall give their services to the public without reward . It is the theory of the existing Park Commission , in which only the executive officer of the board receives a salary , that they shall do so . I In practice it is naturally found that the majority of those who seek or are willing to accept these unpaid places have byends of their own . Either they hail the opportunity to build up a political machine of their own by the use of such patronage as the appointment carries , or else they are property owners the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of which they are members . No doubt in most cases they are persuaded that the policy which is for their private benefit is also for the public benefit , though upon such a point it is only human nature that they should find themselves very easy of persuasion . But if this facility of persuasion be not very creditable to human nature , it is very creditable to human nature that there should commonly be found citizens who are willing to undertake this unpaid work for pure love of it . It may be said that they have never failed to be found by a Mayor who really looked for them . Very seldom has there been lacking to the Park Board some one member who , having reflected more than his colleagues upon the true uses of the public parks , was apt to differ from them concerning tliv uses to ' which they intended to put them . Such a representative of the best judgment and culture of the community upon the true treatment of parks may be able to convince his colleagues that they are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are open to conviction . He can not outvote them , but he can often call a halt by invoking the judgment of that part of . the public which knows and cares most about parks . If the case is gross he can often prevent the consummation of some piece of vandalism , and If his objections are habitually well'and carefully taken , he comes to have an authority with , the public which his colleagues are forced to respect . This has been a frequent experience with the Park Board . But no member of it has ever filled this capacity of monitor more effectively than Mr. STILES , or with more usefulness to the public . Without being either contentious or conceited , he was a man , after the Horatian model , not only " Justus , " but " tenax ' propositi , " while even those who differed with him were always compelled to perceive and admit that he had nothing else in mind but the public interest . The city of which he was a faithful servant owes gratitude to his memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
