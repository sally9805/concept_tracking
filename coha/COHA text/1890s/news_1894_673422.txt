When Superintendent Raymond made his a.ppearance he said : For ti last three months we have given away to the destitute of the city $500 a day . Now our treasury is empty and I do not know when it will be replenished . There is money at the City Hall  --  there is work there  --  and I advise you to go to Director Farley and request employment " Almost immediately the crowd became active , and cries of " We will have work or tear down the City Hall ! " emanated from some quarters . The men started , and the women , some of them carrying children in their arms , followed . Instead of diminishing in numbers and strength , the crowd grew larger . The men said that their demands would be complied with or they would know the reason why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in , and Assistant Director Thompson was also absent .

Director Farley had been notified , and when he entered the office at 9:15 he made his way to a private office in the rear of the building and there he remained . Policemen were summoned , and after they had announced that there was no work to be had the office was cleared . The crowd gathered outside and held an indignation meeting , at which the City Government was denounced in unmeasured terms . A committee was appointed to wait on Director Farley and lay their complaint before him , and another was sent to the newspaper offices with the message that the working-men must have work or something to eat at once James Cooney . spokesman of the committee that waited on Farley , said he had a wife and three children , and his baby was dying for lack of food .
