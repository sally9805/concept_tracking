txt THE bill creating the United States non-partizan Industrial Commission was many years pending in Congress , was once vetoed by President Cleveland , and was signed by President McKinley , *June 18 , 1898 . It took on divers forms at different stages of its incubation , and as finally passed authorized a commission of nineteen members , nine of whom were appointed by the President from civil life , the other ten being members of Congress ,  --  five Senators appointed by the Vice-President , and five Representatives appointed by the Speaker . In making their appointments , the latter chose largely from the membership of the Labor Committees of the two houses . The President went into all walks of business life , and three of his nine appointees are recognized as representatives of organized labor . There is no precedent in the United States for a body so incongruously made up . The injection of the Congressional element into the Commission is due to the reluctance of Congress to delegate its own functions . By claiming a majority of the Industrial Commission , Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Commission must rely almost wholly upon the presidential members for the routine work . The claims upon a Congressman 's time are so absorbing , that absenteeism has chiefly distinguished their connection with the Commission thus far . But the membership from Congress has already proved itself valuable in an advisory way , and this service will increase in importance as the Commission approaches the formulation of results . The mixed organization has its precedent in several of the English Royal Commissions , and it will keep this body closely in touch with Congress . // The object of the Industrial Commission , as broadly stated in the act creating it , is " to investigate questions pertaining to immigration , to labor , to agriculture , to manufacturing and to business , " and , as a result of its investigations , " to suggest such laws as may be made the basis of uniform legislation by the various States of the Union , in order to harmonize conflicting interests and be equitable to the laborer , the employer , the producer and the consumer . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to invent the missing panacea for the ills that afflict mankind , to point out the royal road to universal contentment and prosperity which the world has sought in vain since the days when " Adam dolve and Eve span . " But that is the superficial view of the matter . IRecognizing the obvious and impassable limitations upon the work of the Commission , there remains a field of effort which is not merely important , but may be said to have become imperative . rl7here come times in the onward march of industrial civilization , when it is necessary-if one may be pardoned a wholesale mixing of metaphors  --  to pause and take account of stock ; to strike a balance between conflicting interests ; to take an observation by the sun , and determine with accuracy the direction in which the craft is sailing . The most famous precedents for the establishment of such a commission of inquiry are those furnished by Great Britain . At least three Royal Commissions on labor , the last one appointed in 1891 , have been put " to inquire into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . and to report whether legislation can with advantage be directed to the remedy of any evils which may be disclosed , and if so , in what manner . " The reports of these bodies , apart from any remedial legislation which may have sprung from them , accomplished a tremendous service to industrialism , in clarifying the situation and teaching both employer and employee how far the world had advanced beyond the conditions which prevailed in industry at the opening of the century , when the factory system was young and perfected machinery had not yet worked its magic transformation . The report of the Commission of 1891 , in particular , may be described as the most important publication on the labor question that has yet been written . Its effect upon the economic literature and thinking of the day is beyond measurement . // It is doubtful if the United States Industrial Commission can produce a report at all comparable to this in character and importance . But it has an opportunity at once splendid and unique . It has a field of investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that Congressional Committees have constantly entered upon it , as in the case of the Abnun S. Hewitt Committee and the so-called Blair Senate Committee , both of which printed great volumes of testimony , but neither ever made any report . These Congressional investigations have been haphazard and incomplete , for the reason that the time of Congress is engrossed in other matters , and politics has been inseparable from the work , in the nature of things . From whatever cause , it remains the fact that there has never yet been any systematic attempt to officially investigate and report upon the changed relations of capital and labor in the United States , and the adaptability of our national and State laws to the new industrial conditions which have arisen in consequence . Moreover , the time appears to be peculiarly opportune . We are not simply on the turn of the century , but at a point of new departure in American industry . Emerging from a long period of depression , victorious in a brief but glorious foreign war , we are apparently entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annals . We are forcing our manufactured goods into the world 's markets with a sudden success that surprises ourselves , and startles our foreign competitors . We have long been in the habit of manufacturing on a larger scale than commonly prevails elsewhere , as M. Emile Lavasseur has pointed out in detail ; but we are entering now upon an era of combination and consolidation , involving a revolution in the economic conditions of production , the far-reaching effects of which can neither be seen nor imagined . We have reached a point of perfection , in the organization and solidarity of the labor of the country , which is fast substituting collective bargaining for the individual contract in our great industries . Labor saving machinery is becoming more perfect and more omnipotent every day , and electricity is creating a new mechanical revolution no less portentous than that which came with the introduction of steam . Causes and effects are everywhere visible undreamed of ten and twenty years ago . It is this new and strange industrialism that the Commission is called upon to study , to analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom it can gather from those who are participating in it . The study takes on two phases , distinct and yet so closely associated and interwoven , that at many points they are inseparable . One is the legal , the other the sociological phase . The act commands the Commission to inquire into and report upon the status of industry before the law in the several States of the Union . Here is a phase of industrialism to which Congress has never paid any attention , and which is unique in the United States . In Great Britain , where Parliament legislates in both large and small affairs for the whole kingdom , the same factory laws apply equally in all parts of the country , and one manufacturer can get no advantage over another by changing the location of his mill . The same is true of France and Germany . But in this country , there has been growing up very rapidly during the last twenty-five years , in our great manufacturing States , a heterogeneous body of labor laws , so called , which aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employer and employee Under the operation of these laws the conditions governing manufacturing enterprise have been profoundly modified . Competition in industry has grown so close , that the economic effects of this legislation are now recognized as an important factor in production . The diversity of the labor legislation of the several States is almost startling . There are no two States of the forty-five , in which the conditions governing industry , so far as they are regulated by the State itself , can be described as at all similar . Examining all these laws , in all these States , noting their points of variation and contradiction , they impress us as a legal farrago , lacking the most rudimentary elements of a uniform system , such as should prevail in a country which boasts equality of rights to all its citizens . To illustrate by obvious instances , the laws fixing the hours of labor for women and children in manufacturing establishments , vary from fifty-six in New Jersey , fifty-eight in Massachusetts , sixty in other New England States , in New York and Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age limit at which children can be employed in these establishments varies from fourteen to thirteen , twelve and eleven , until it strikes certain States where there is no legal limit whatever . The employers ' liability laws are as wide in their provisions // as the continent itself . Factory inspection is enforced with varying stringency in half a dozen States , and entirely omitted in the rest . Such instances of discriminating legislation are beginning to tell in the reinvestments of capital and the relocation of industries . They reveal an unequal development which demands an intelligent effort in the direction of unification . In one sense it is a situation beyond the power of regulation . Congress can not interfere , for these are matters that appertain strictly to the States . The most the Industrial Commission can do is to supply an analysis of these conflicting statutory provisions and a report of the actual operation of the various labor laws , upon which it can base recommendations showing which of them can be adopted with advantage by such States as do not now possess them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus have been taken . The rest must be left to time and public opinion . The current will at least have been set in the right direction , and we may hope for the ultimate upbuilding of the semblance of a national code of labor laws , under which the working classes can be assured that they are receiving , so far as the State can determine it , the same treatment and consideration , whether they live and work in an Eastern State or a Western State , and the employer can feel sure that the laws which regulate his business are sufficiently alike to give no legal advantage to any competitor anywhere in the Union . The work of the Industrial Commission , so far as I have above outlined it , may be compared to that of the Statutory Revision Commission of the United States , a body consisting of commissioners from the several States of the Union , which aims to bring about a like uniformity in the general statutes of these States , and which has accomplished some tangible results since it was first organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general co-operation in the work of the two bodies , by securing as its advisory counsel Mr. F. J. Stimson , of Boston , who is the secretary of the Statutory Revision Commission , and who is well known besides as a student of labor legislation and the author of text books on the subject . I do not wish to be understood as being over-sanguine of the results that are likely to follow the work of the Commission in the field of uniform labor legislation among the States . That the work it has been set to do in this field is necessary and im // portant can not be intelligently questioned . But the obstacles that oppose any immediate results , except of an educational character , are formidable almost beyond the point of exaggeration . Foremost among them may be stated the essentially different civilizations which prevail in the United States . The conditions of life and of labor are not the same in Massachusetts and in South Carolina , and can not be made the same by any laws which human ingenuity can devise . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads her capitalists to cry out that they are being smothered to death under restrictive legislation ; the statute books of the other commonwealth are practically free from all such laws . The difference is due to scores of causes operating divergently through a century , and it may be that another century will pass before co-equal conditions assert themselves . A single potent cause largely controls the economic conditions of the problem as between the two communities . In one State the factory windows are open the year round ; in the other artificial heat must regulate the temperature of the miii more than half the time . The influence of climate extends to the quality and quantity of food the operatives must eat , to the clothing they must wear , and thus to the wages they must earn . It even affects the age of puberty , and creates a different standard for the age limit in child labor . It would be absurd to say that one Procrustean system of labor legislation is or can be equally applicable , in all its details , to the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the valid argument against uniformity which climatic conditions present , will be effectively utilized to resist legal enactments looking toward uniformity , from selfish considerations of a local character . So long as freedom from restrictive legislation , coupled with certain other advantages , tempts Northern capital into South Carolina , for investment in cotton manufacture , there is an influence at work more potent than the pressure of public opinion from other parts of the Union . So long as localities can successfully tempt manufacturing establishments into their midst , by offering bounties in the form of exemption from taxation , they are likely to continue to extend these bribes , however desirable they may admit it to be , as an abstract proposition , that taxation shall be uniform throughout the United States . When we take cognizance of the differences in taxation which exist to-day be- // tween nearby States and localities , and their causes , we best understand the hopelessness of any movement which aims at establishing cxact equality of condition in this country . In the matter of the hours of labor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question which , more than any other , is just now close to the heart of organized labor in the United States . The sociological argument upon which the trades-unionist bases his demand for an eight-hour day is tremendously reinforced by the demonstrated fact that improved machinery is capable of producing in all staple lines of goods faster than the consumption of the world can dispose of the product . Equally true is it that the argument for a shorter working day is stronger in a hot and debilitating climate than in the North ; as a matter of fact , it is only in the Northern States that the movement has made any headway . Again , the presence of great masses of colored labor in the South presents another phase of the problem which is certain to grow more troublesome and more insistent as time passes . It is a body of labor which accepts lower wages than white labor , and is constantly pushing itself into new fields of competition with white labor . The negro problem , in its political phase , is the perplexity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexity of the next . And so we say that each great section of our great country must be left to work out its own problems in its own way , and in keeping with the peculiar environment of each . The country is too big for a strait-jacket . But all parts of it can learn from the experience of other parts , and the Industrial Commission can bc of service by increasing the general knowledge of the industrial methods which prevail under such diverse conditions . Growing directly out of this phase of the work is the study of the relations at present existing between capital and labor ,  --  the sociological side of the question , as contrasted with its legal side . Here the Commission already finds itself enveloped in a cloud of conflicting theories , of ill-digested facts , and of antagonistic interests . The Commission is not likely to forget that it does not possess the philosopher 's stone , and has no insight into this insoluble world problem , which has been denied to other and wiser students . Nevertheless , it sees certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . // In the first place , it recognizes in itself a sort of safety valve f or the country . People who suffer wrongs , whether real or imaginary , always feel better when they are allowed an opportunity to ventilate them before some recognized governmental authority where they are insured a respectful hearing and a certain degree of consideration . It was a large part of the purpose of Congress , in creating this Commission , to establish a quasi-tribunal , or national forum , if you please , before which anybody and everybody who thinks he has a wrong to expose or a panacea for existing social or economic evils , can appear and state his case . Congress has little time and less taste for such things . It is the chronic complaint of social reformers and professional agitators , that they can get no hearing at the hands of the Government . Nothing helps toward the evaporation of discontent so much as an opportunity to give utterance to it . iRecognizing this trait in human nature , the Commission is prepared to listen to everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , for the purpose of exposing evils or suggesting remedies . Later on , it will probably send sub-commissions to the chief cities to give a wider opportunity to be heard . In the meanwhile , its mail is already loaded with communications from all parts of the country , in which the writers propound their views with freedom and fullness . An expert will digest this material , and separate the wheat from the chaff . On its own initiative , the Commission will summon comparatively few witnesses , confining its invitations to persons who can shed some valuable light , through study and experience , upon the conditions of our industrial life . One hundred such picked witnesses can furnish more material for its reports than a thousand men drawn at random from the ranks . Organized labor will be represented before the Commission by the chiefs of its great representative bodies ,  --  the flower of the workinh class ,  --  the leaders who have been studying conditions and moulding the opinions of their unions for the better part of their lives . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employers ' side , men will be chosen who , by the immensity of their enterprises , the length of their experience , or the peculiar success which has attended their relations with their employees , may be assumed to know something which ought to be generally known . Out of such a crucible should come a consensus of judgment similar to that of the British I*oyal Commission , // which was remarkable as an exact statement of the points at issue between the two forces of industrialism , of the arguments by which each side reinforced its contentions , and of the points at which agreement had been reached , or seemed to be gradually coming within reach . A similar statement based upon ascertained facts , is much to be desired in the United States . It will certainly show that immense progress has already been made in certain sections of this country , and in certain of its great industries , toward the peaceable adjudication of the chronic dispute about wages and the conditions of employment . It will show that the situation , however hopelessly pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and capital , instead of drifting farther and farther apart , are gradually learning not only the necessity , but the methods , of keeping together . The country as a whole is only dimly cognizant of the progress that has been made , in many industries , in the matter of collective bargaining , in the adjustment of wages on the basis of sliding scales , determined after the fulle*t interchange of definite information as to costs , profits , and genoral industrial conditions . The upshot of the whole matter is , in its last analysis , that the great underlying cause of strikes , lockouts , boycotts , and the great bulk of recurring labor disputes , is ignorance ,  --  ignorance on the part of both employer and employed , as to the exact status which must always determine whether wages are properly adjusted . If the Commission can make this fact appear , if it can bring it effectively to the attention of those who chiefly suffer in consequence of it , it will have performed a service to the country worth a million times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a word , is the chief function of the Commission . It is in its capacity as a great educational machine that its best results are to be anticipated . I have indicated above some of the chief problems with which the Industrial Commission has been called upon by Congress to deal . In truth , the whole gamut of modern ills is embraced in the single sentence of the law which we have quoted above . When it was first brought face to face with . the shoreless sea of inquiry upon which the Commission was launched , some of its members were tempted to think that Congress might have been perpetrating a gigantic joke , in proposing that nineteen men , chosen at haphazard from our seventy millions , should sit down together // and mark out a short cut to the millenium . But they went to work in good faith to see how these matters might be segregated . Their first discovery was that they naturally divided themselves into four grand groups , and , accordingly , the Commission separated itself into four sub-divisions of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar to Agriculture , to Manufacturing and General Business , to Mining , and to Transportation . Composed of members of each of these subcommissions , they made a fifth , called the sub-commission on statistics , to which they intrusted the important task of collecting and classifying the mass of material already at hand , in the shape of government and other statistics , reports , etc. , relating to these various questions . The Commission does not propose to duplicate any of the official statistical and other information already available for its use . Literally , millions of dollars have been expended in the collection and publication of these data . Having thus segregated its work into four groups , the Commission has further defined it by putting out , for each sub-commission , a typical plan of inquiry , patterned somewhat after the syllabus of the British Royal Commission , and suggesting in outline the topics with which the several investigations may concern themselves . These topics run in number from fifty up to a hundred or more , many , however , being duplicates of each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields of inquiry , as trades-unionism , immigration , education , etc . A dozen or less of these topics are big and portentous enough to occupy the entire time of the Commission for the two years to which its life is limited . Take , for example , the non-competitive employment of convict labor , options in grain and produce selling , sweat shops and their regulation , not to mention the larger questions to which reference has already been made . As its work develops , the Commission will find these big topics crowding the minor ones to the rear , and it will avoid the danger which comes from attempting to cover so much ground that none of it can be covered thoroughly . As a case in point , the creation of the Commission was contemporaneous with the epidemic of industrial reorganization and consolidation now sweeping over the country . The manner in which it deals with this question will determine the country 's judgment upon the entire work of the Commission . It understands that it must handle it fearlessly , intelligently and ex // haustively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner quite different from the haphazard treatment it has thus far received at the hands of Congressional and Legislative Committees . It has appointed Professor Jeremiah W. Jenks , of Cornell University , as its expert agent to study the question of industrial combination and consolidation from the economic point of view , and to collate and analyze the facts in their bearing upon prices , upon the wage earning class , upon production , and upon the community as a whole . Professor Jenks enters upon the work with the advantage of many years of special study of the question , in connection with his economic teaching . Under his guidance , the Commission will seek to present a definite summary of the causes , methods and results of this industrial phenomenon . Certainly there is no information of which the country is quite so much in need . Almost before we have been able to realize what was going on , the manufacturing industry of the United States has been transformed from the competitive to the monopolistic or quasimonopolistic basis . We are to-day face to face with conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timehonored maxims of political economy . It is impossible to exaggerate the effect upon the future life of our people , and upon our social and political institutions . Neither is it possible to reverse or to suspend the experiment . In defiance of the frantic efforts of Legislatures to check their progress or to embarrass their operations , these Goliath combinations have already seized upon the great staple industries of the country ; they represent to-day a capitalization ,  --  including the water injected ,  --  nearly equal to the whole amount of capital reported to the Eleventh Federal Census as employed to carry on all the big and little industries existing in 1890 . What has been done can not be undone ,  --  until such time at least as it shall undo itself in what now appears to be the inevitable reaction . But it is plain that a definite governmental attitude toward them must be formulated . A mass of abortive laws encumbering the statute books of many States has Thiled to stop the consolidation of industrial plants . The time has come when some method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission has here a rare opportunity to render a service vital to the future welfare of the country . It may fail utterly to meet the situation . It will not be surprising if it does , because it now seems one that can only be left to its own // solution . On the other hand , if it shall be able to work out some definite and effective method of dealing with this modern force of non-competitive capitalization , it will have justified its creation , though it should accomplish nothing else . I have endeavored to give some hint of the modern Pandora 's box from which the Industrial Commission is expected to lift the cover , and some ground for belief that the hope it seeks to find at the bottom of the box will not prove altogether elusive . I accept its existence as a recognition of the fact that the well-being of the humblest citizen of the Republic is the first concern of the government . Much remains to be done in fulfilment of the promise upon which this great nation was founded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , . . . promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . " Summing up our experience , we must all agree that while these great blessings have abided with us , as with no other people on the globe , yet there is always opportunity for the more complete realization of each of them . We can not too often or too strenuously try , by too many expedients , to remedy even those ills inherited from the ages , which most persistently defy the humanitarianism of civilization . We may easily make the mistake of assuming that legislation is the cure-all for each and every social evil . A wise old saw says that " that country is the happiest which is governed the least . " But wiser still is the remark of Sir Arthur Helps , that as civilization grows more complex , the necessity for governmental regulation of the relations of men increases correspondingly . Paternalism in government is a term many of us have been brought up to abhor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as represented in the Government , acquires new responsibilities with every new advance in civilization . First among these responsibilities is a knowledge of the facts of every day life among the masses of our people . No price can be too high to pay for it . And if the Industrial Commission can add to the general knowledge we have of these conditions , and thus prepare the way for some improvement in them , however slight , it will have justified its existence.
