txt In the platform an income tax is demanded , notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court . It is not to be a just income tax , equal upon all property , except as to slight exemptions to help citizens to obtain the necessaries of life before paying a tax , but it is to be a graduated income tax , adopted with the unconcealed purpose of taxing great fortunes out of existence . If the Supreme Court continues to stand in the way , it is to be reconstructed by new laws and new appointments by President Bryan . Where so much is expressed the wild men of society will believe that much more is meant . Therefore , apart from the language of the platform and the letters of acceptance of the candidates , the issue has inevitably made itself . It is between security to property and personal rights , and peaceful prosperity maintained by the friends ot law and order , on the one side , and , on the other , Anarchy and Socialisin , promoted by the advocates of public disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who propose to convert our free , intelligent republic into a form of government as little swayed by reason and virtue as was the late Chicago mob , misnamed a Democratic Convention , which deliberately , in the year 1896 , undertook to organize the solid South , with a few States of the West , to menace the property and proslerity of the North and East , by as wicked a movement as that after which it was deliberately patterned , the Southern rebellion of 1861 . The time of trial to the Republican party will come after its approaching victory . It will then be in order to determine whether it is the slave of the rich capitalists , of the promoters of trusts and monopolies , and of the bloated bondholders , as the Bryan Democrats ( not the Sewall Democrats ) and the Populists will contend . Its mission just now is to prevent repudiators , Anarchists , Socialists , and other enemies of organized society from achieving the first success in the work of tearing down the whole social fabric upon which rest the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . II . An Eastern Democrat , returning from witnessing the revolutionizing of the principles and of the control of his party at the Chicago Convention , unable to transform himself into an advo // cate either of the free coinage of silver or of populism , and yet equally unable to give his support to Mr. McKinley and the Republican party , finds himself in a puzzling political predicament ; if unwilling to bolt his party ticket , he yet can not conscientiously advise others that the good of the country requires them to give their support to the principles embodied in his party platform . Standing in this attitude , the present writer will attempt in this article briefly to analyze the political causes of the extraordinary conditions within the Democratic partv , and affecting it from the outside , which have now culmiiiated in the Chicago platform and in the nomination of Mr. Bryan ; and the prospects of the political success of the new departure . Of course the situation as it appears now , immediately after the adjournment of the Convention , may be modified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be entirely changed either way within the course of the next few months . No one can prophesy with any certainty the direction the popular mind will take in a political crisis such as is now upon the country . The most careful forecast of political probabilities may be entirely upset by a pronounced movement of public sentiment ,  --  if it occurs not in the East only hut throughout the country ,  --  iu one direction or the other . A strong and general movement in behalf of a bolting Democratic ticliet , if a leader of standing accepted a position at its head , might , for instance , destroy Mr. Bryan 's chances . All that will here be attempted , therefore , is some estimate of the case as it stands at the present moment . The great question is , what does this political revolution in the Democratic party signify ? Whence has it come ? Having swept that party off its feet in the nominating convention , is it going to revolutionize the political control of the country also at the polls ? One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political movement for monetary reform , which has now expressed itself in the demand of the Chicago platform for the free , independent , and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 , can be laughed out of court with mere ridicule , or killed by mere denunciation . Nothing is to be gained by simply shrieking " Populists , repudiators , and Anarchists " at those who have proved themselves numerous enough to exercise complete control over the present course of one of the great political parties * // of the country . It is the duty of conservative men , even though they have shrunk from the idea of assuming any share of the responsibility for the Chicago platform , with its possibilities , at least , of immense disaster to the country , to endeavor to understand the spirit and purpose behind the radical political pro- gramme which has now been put forward , to appreciate the strength of the forces back of it , and especially to do whatever may be possible during the coming campaign to prevent political division from running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to the presidential candidate of the Chicago Convention . However weak the nomination of Mr. Bryan might be under other conditions , or upon a different platform , there is every reason to believe that he is the best possible nominee for the Democratic party in its present situation , from the mere standpoint of success at the coming election . Candidate and platform are in complete accord . On such a radical platform there would have been no appreciable advantage in nominating a man of more conservative views and instincts . If success with such a programme be possible , it needs a man with the enthusiasm and audacity of youth to achieve it . Ordinarily , it would not be good policy for a great political party to nominate for the presidency , chiefly upon his ability as an orator , a man of Mr. Bryan 's youth , comparative lack of experience in public affairs , an*i radicalism of views . But in the face of the present situation , the very boldness of the nomination gives it a certain strellgth . The exigency called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent expression before a popular audience to the sentiments underlying the movement . The sort of warfare which may be expected from him may prove more effective than is now anticipated in some quarters . The instinct of the Convention in selecting the presidential nominee , for the first time in the history of American politics , from a State west of the Mississippi , was a sound one from the standpoint of political expediency . A Western candidate will win far more support in that section of the country than a Southern candidate could do , while he will probably hold the South about as well as a Southern man . Upon the platform adopted , the obvious policy of the party was to play for the Populist vote ; to make an entirely new departure , creating a new party under an old name . The nomination of Mr. Bryan is more consistent with this policy than any // other which could have been made , unless indeed Senator Teller could have been taken up , and the unwisdom of nominating him was recognized by nearly everybody in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at least as much to Populists as to Democrats . Before these lines cart be read the action of the Populist Convention at St. Louis will have been taken ; the writer thinks it safe to assume that either Mr. Bryan will be endorsed , or that some arrangement will be made , then or later , by which he can secure the Populist votes . The nomination of Mr. Sewall , of Maine , for Vice-President , while made in the Convention upon the spur of the moment , and chiefly for the purpose of avoiding possible mistakes in other directions , is mainly significant as indicating a desire to refute the idea that the new movement is a sectional one of the South and the farther West against the East ; probably it was also intended to afford a conspicuous demonstration of the fact that every successful business man will not necessarily be opposed to the iDemocratic party in its new policy . Looking first at the coming presidential contest merely from the standpoint of the popular vote , the one fact of prime , significance , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast in 1892 for Weaver , the Populist candidate for President , or nearly nineteen per cent . as many votes as were given to Cleveland . To be sure , this vote practically includes the whole Democratic vote in the States of Colorado , Idaho , Kansas , North Dakota , and Wyoming , where no Democratic electors were placed in nomination . Deducting a fair estimate of the Democratic vote in these States , the straight Populist vote still amounts to over 900,000 , or over one-sixth of the vote cast for Cleveland . Nor should it be forgotteh , if we try to do justice to the political acumen of the new leaders , that owing to the irreconcilable conflict of opinion existing within the ranks of the Democratic party upon the money question , they were obliged to take one horn or the other of a dilemma . While free-silver coinage at 1* to 1 invited a formidable bolt on the part of Eastern Democrats , a great body of Democratic voters in the South and West were no longer willing to give their support to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free silver , or at least giving the certain assurance of financial legislation securing // an enlargement of the circulating medium of the country . The South had accepted the platform of 1892 partly because of the pronounced views of the candidate who was to staud upon it , partly because it specifically promised the repeal of the tax on state bank issues , partly because the currency plank could easily be construed to favor the free coinage of silver at a new ratio , in accordance with its market price . The failure of the Democratic party to support in Congress the repeal of the state bank tax , the construction placed by the administration upon the plank relating to silver , the repeal of the Sherman law without the enactment of any legislation in its place , and finally the issu* of *262 ,  - -  000,000 of bonds , primarily and ostensibly for the purpose of purchasing gold to maintain the reserve of that metal , however commendable from the standpoint of Eastern sound-money m*n this course of action may have been , nevertheless led naturally and inevitably to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Chicago . Their attitude there should have occasioned no surprise to any close observer of recent political tendencies . In considering the readiness which the Southern Democrats have shown to accept the programme of a union with the Populists , with Mr. Bryan for the common candidate , it should he noted that the Populist party has shown strength enough to make it a factor in politics , on account of the size of its vote or of the closeness of the contest between the two old parties , in almost every State of the South . The Populist vote in Kentucky and Tennessee is so large that both of these States would probably be in doubt at the coming election upon a platform not in sympathy with Populist views . In Arkansas the Populist vote increased from 11,000 in 1892 to 24,000 in 1894 ; in Georgia , from 42,000 in the former year to 96,000 , by means of fusion with the Republicans , in the latter . In North Carolina , Weaver 's vote of 44,000 in 1892 became , through fusion with the Republicans , 148,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Populist vote grew from 99,000 in 1892 to 159,000 in 1894 ; in Virginia , from 12,000 in the former year to 81,000 in 1893 . In 1892 Weaver received 13,000 votes in Louisiana and 10,000 in Mississippi . At the State elections of 1894 , the Populist vote in Alabama was 83,000 , and in Missouri 42,000 . A little consideration of these figures may enable Eastern men to // understand better the desire even of the leading politicians of the South to commit the Democratic party to a close alliance with Populism . The plain fact is that the South is honeycombed with Populism , and has been ready for a number of years for the formal alliance with the Populists beyond the Mississippi which has now been consummated at Chicago . The South has given up , deliberately and probably for an indefinite period of time , its old political alliance in the Northeast , and has entered into a new alliance with the States beyond the Mississippi ; it has exchanged the States of New York , New Jer* sey , and Connecticut , with their 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes of the farther West , or such of them as it may be able to secure . Indiana , lying half way between the old political allies and the new ones , is doubt-b less expected by the South to enter into the new combination ; but the chances that this State will remain Democratic on the new basis are hardly as good as was the prospect that she would continue Democratic in association with the Eastern States . The new lines of alliance also seek to inzlude the great State of Illinois , and it now seems probable that the chances of placing her in the Democratic column as newly formed are better than the chances that she would have joined Indiana in her political course upon the old basis . In the South itself the new alliance with Western Populism probably tends to hold Kentucky and Tennessee , which have been becoming doubtful States , more firmly in the Democratic column , to bring North Carolina back into the fold of Democracy , and to hold South Carolina within it , thus tending to make 43 electoral votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that this alliance will , on the other hand , tend to throw Delaware , Maryland , and probably West Virginia also , with their 17 electoral votes , into political affiliation with the North Atlantic States . However unwise future events may show this policy to be from a political standpoint , or however serious may be the results which the success of the new combination may bring to the country , there is certainly no great , cause for surprise in the fact that it has commended itself from the standpoint of political expediency , or even necessity , to the judgment of old and tried Southern leaders , such as Senator Jones , of Arkansas . // The Chicago Convention furnished a striking demonstration of the fact that the centre of political power in this country has passed away from the East . The new conditions have already clearly manifested themselves in the Senate , though few have awakened to the permanent character of the change , or to the far-reaching influence upon the policies of the country which will inevitably result from it . The majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only exert a considerable influence by its example over the House of RePresentatives , and through its power of confirmation of appointments over the President himself , but it has an absolute veto power over all legislation . However necessary financial legislation of some sort may be to secure the redeemability of all forms of our currency in gold , or even to protect the very solvency * the Treasury , no measure in this direction can become a law without the consent of a majority of the States of the Union , as represented in the Senate . One of the cardinal points of the present political situation is that the section of the country west of the Mississippi River , which for convenience will hereafter be referred to in this article as the West , has in recent years made an immense gain in votes in the Senate . By the admission since 1889 of the seven new States of North Dakota , South Dakota , Montana , Washington , Idaho , Wyoming , and Utah , having together fourteen votes , the sixteen votes which the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transMississippi section now has just one-third of the total votes in the Senate ; and even this representation will doubtless be increased in the near future by the admission of New Mexico and Arizona into the Union . The sixteen Southern States are represented by thirty-two Senators , so that the South and West together have to-day more than a two-thirds vote in the Senate . With the admission of two new Western States , the South could lose the political control entirely , as it has already lost it partly , of the three States of Delaware , Maryland , and West Virginia ; and yet , with the West , control just two-thirds of the Senate . It is , therefore , obvious that with any reasonable concert of action between the South and the West , these two sections of the country together can control the action of the Senate , and can thereby at least prevent ' the passage of any legislation not in harmony with the views of their people . // Nor can it be denied that this alliance has already plainly mauifested itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention in coming out openly for the free coinage of silver , in espousing other political views of a Populistic character which are well regarded in the West , and finally in taking its Presidential nominee from a far Western State , has immensely strengthened the forces which tend to make the connection closer and more permanent . If we turn to the votes in the Electoral College we find that the South , including Delaware with this section , has 159 votes , and the section west of the Mississippi 83 , making a total of 242 votes , or 18 more than the 224 required to elect . Even though the States of Delaware , Maryland , and West Virginia leave thee Democratic column with their 17 electoral votes , as they are quite likely to do , a majority still remains ; or if the South remains solid , Iowa and any one of ten other Western States might be lost without destroying the majority . These figures are given not only on account of their bearing upon the coming political contest , but because they indicate also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now been formed within the Democratic party . They are presented with a view to emphasizing the fact that in a presidential contest running upon the general lines which have now been laid down , the Democratic party need not carry a Northern State east of the Mississippi , if it can hold its lines even fairly intact in the South , and can secure nearly the whole of the electoral vote between the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean . If the vote of either Illinois or Indiana can also be secured , to say nothing of Ohio , Michigan , or Wisconsin , it would make up for a very considerable defection in the far West or South . Let us now take up the coming contest in view of these figures , and consider what light the recent course of each of the Western States throws upon its probable action at the coming election . The whole theory upon which the Democratic campaign of this year is based is that it is possible to effect a close union of the Democratic and Populist voters , if not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be secured without a bolt in the Western States of sound-money Democrats of such dimensions that it can not be offset by the corresponding defec - tion of silver Republicans which is likely to take place , the figures // certainly indicate that the Democratic ticket is likely to carry every State west of the Mississippi , unless it be Iowa . Of these fifteen Western States , five , namely , Colorado , Idaho , Kansas , North Dakota , and Nevada , were carried for the Populist electoral ticket in 1892 , no Democratic electoral ticket being put in the field in the first four of these States . A union of the Democratic and Populist votes in the last presidential election would have carried seven more States , California by 25,000 , Minnesota by 7,000 , Montana by 6,000 , Nebraska by 20,000 , Oregon by 6,000 , South Dakota by 1,000 , Washington by 13,000 . This leaves only the three States of Iowa , Wyoming , and Utah ; Iowa was carried by the Republicans in 1892 over the combined vote of the Democrats and Populists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver by only 700 plurality . In 1895 the new State of Utah went Republican in a gubernatorial election by 2,000 plurality ; but the division of the Republican party in that State , as evidenced by the bolt of one of its Senators from the St. Louis Convention , and the strong silver sentiment prevailing there , will doubtless make it Democratic at the coming election . In view of these figures , and of the well-known and pronounced attitude of a majority of the people of the West not only upon silver , but upon other issues embodied in the Democratic platform of this year , there is certainly a strong basis for the assumption that all of the electoral votes of the West , except those of Iowa , will be cast for Bryan . Without obtaining the vote of any Northern State east of the Mississippi , he could afford to lose Iowa and Delaware , or if he could capture the votes of Iowa he could lose those of Delaware , Maryland , and West Virginia . But it will be claimed upon the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for McKinley , and thus make such a large breach in the vote of the solid South that it can not be compensated for in the West . It is doubtless true that the former , perhaps the latter also , of these States will be strongly contested by the Republican managers ; if the state of public opinion is such that either or both of them can be detached from the Democratic side , it will doubtless indicate the existence of conditions fatal to Bryan 's prospects of success . But let us look at the figures in these two States . It is true that sound-money Democrats are both numerous and influential in // Kentucky , and the government of the State is at present in the hands of the Republican party . Bat it is probable that the great body of sound-money Democrats who would be willing to go to the length of bolting their party ticket in a presidential election refrained from voting for the last Democratic candidate for Governor , and that this led to the election of the Republican candidate by the 9,000 plurality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 17,000 votes cast by the Populists at the last election for their nominee for Governor , leaving the Republican party 8,000 votes short of a majority . In 1892 the combined vote for Cleveland and for Weaver exceeded the vote for Harrison by 63,000 ; on this basis 30,000 sound-money Democrats could vote for Mr. McKinley without losing the State for * Bryan . Taking into account the strength of the Kentucky brand of Democracy in a presidential contest , it seems unlikely that the electoral vote of the State will go to McKinley , in spite of the attitude of leading Democratic papers . In Tennessee the case is very much the same , except that the Republican prospects are not so good . In 1892 the Democratic plurality was 38,000 , while the Populist ticket received 23,000 votes . On a total vote for Governor in 1894 considerably less than that of 1892 , the State was , to be sure , evenly divided ; but if the Populists had voted for the Democratic candidate instead of for their own , the former would have had a plurality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West Virginia , the recent political course of these States , and the strength in all of them of the commercial interests which will be strongly enlisted on the Republican side , together with the strength of the soundmoney Democrats in the first two of them , makes it likely that their votes will be found in the Republican column . The Democratic party of Maryland is bady divided by internal dissensions , and the fact that the Republicans carried the State in 1895 by a majority of 18,000 , on a total vote 27,000 larger than the presidential vote of 1892 , would seem to indicate that the McKinley managers may reasonably hope to secure its electoral vote . Delaware only went for Cleveland by 500 plurality in 1892 , and elected a Republican Governor in 1894 . Unless the factional quarrel in the Republican party prevents that result , the vote of the State will doubtless be given to McKinley . West Virginia is normally * very close State , and the fact that her vote has been decidedly // Republican of late , taken in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well carry the State for him . Before passing from the South a word should be said as to North Carolina . The Populists have recently outnumbered either the Democrats or the Republicans in this State , and it has recently been controlled by a Republican-Populist fusion . Under other conditions the vote of the State would have been uncertain ; but it is doubtless safe for Mr. Bryan on a free-coinage platform . Let us now consider the possibility of votes for the Democratic ticket in the central section of the country east of the Mississippi . Here we find the doubtful State of Indiana , whose vote has been given to the Democratic party in three of the five last presi*entiai elections , and the State of Illinois , formerly safely Republican , but now placed by her recent political action in the list of uncertain States . These two States will be the real pivotal ones in the coming campaign . If Bryan can carry either of them , the figures above given would seem to indicate that he will in all probability be elected ; if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinley , the chances would seem to be against Bryan 's success , although , as above indicated , he might possibly still succeed in securing an election by receiving the nearly solid electoral votes of the South , and of the farther West . If the Democratic candidate can carry the 24 electoral votes of Illinois , he can lose Delaware , Maryland , and West Virginia in the South , and Iowa and any other single State in the West , or three or four of those with the smallest population , and still carry the election . If he can secure the 15 electoral votes of Indiana , without Illinois , he can afford to lose the three first-named States , together with Iowa and any one of the six Western States having threb electoral votes each . In 1892 Illinois went for Cleveland by 27,000 , and the vote for Weaver was 22,000 . In 1894 the Populist vote for Treasurer had risen to 60,000 . Political conditions in this State are in a chaotic condition , and the only thing that can be said at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be uncertain if the election were held to-morro*v , according to the best information obtainable . It is ati open question whether Gov . Altgeld 's interest in the national campaign will not be a source of strength rather than of weakness on the Democratic // side . Nearly all of the men of conservative opinions who would be repelled from the national ticket by his active support of it are opposed to it in any case on account of the platform . It must be admitted , upon the other hand , however much people in the East may dislike Gov . Altgeld 's opinions and actions , that he has shown no mean powers as a political leader , and that he has a large following outside of party lines among the laboring men of the State . He is thoroughly familiar with the politics of the State , and with the methods of campaigning likely to prove most effective ; and if he throws himself heartily into the fight for Bryan , as he will doubtless do , particularly as his own re-election is at stake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that the Republican nominee for Governor is admitted b ; his own party friends to be a very weak candidate , the strength which free silver has had for many years in the country district8 of the State , and the great size of the agricultural vote , Illinois having no less than 240,000 farms , further tend to make the result uncertain . The bolt of the sound-money Democrats , either to McKinley or to a third candidate , will of course be a large one , but other factors in the situation may overcome even this defection . Chicago in the coming contest , even if the Democratic national headquarters are not located in that city , as they logically should be , will hold exactly the same position as the centre of the fight which New York city has occupied in so many past elections , and Illinois , the Empire State of the Middle West , will take the place so long occupied by the State of New York as the pivot upon which the contest will turn . The chances that Indiana will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of the fact that this State has a much longer Democratic record than Illinois . If the tide sets strongly among the farmers in favor of free silver , Indiana may easily be carried by him , but if the coming campaign resembles those of the past in this State , the amount of money which the Republicans can and will spend to carry it for McKinley , with the moderate supply of campaign funds likely to be found on the Democratic side , may reasonably be expected to result in Republican success . In the foregoing article , the writer has endeavored briefly to indicate a few of the reasons which seem to him to render the success of the Chicago ticket at least neither impossible nor // highly improbable . The average business man of the East is too likely to argue that no programme such as that which has now been adopted by the Democratic party , can possibly receive the endorsement of the people at the polls . If the sound-money sentiment of the whole country is as strong as he assumes it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it should be remembered that there are a large number of voters who are thoroughly tired of the old political parties and of the leadership which has controlled them , and that before the campaign is over they may be strongly attracted by the prospect of bringing about poliuieal disruption through the election of Mr. Bryan . A few months ago , the voters whose first desire was to bring about a change in the policies of the Federal Government were nearly all drifting to the Republican side ; but the Democratic art as now cut itself loose so entirely from the present administration and from existing political conditions , that it offers to the country a much more pronounced change than the Republican party . The latter now stands as the champion of the " existing gold standard " and the present financial order , while the former offers a programme of radical and far-reaching change . With the old political fences so completely down , and in the face of conditions so chaotic , there is no warrant for any assurance as to the result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
