Clay &; Co. of Winchester started for the lumber regions of Michigan on a business trip , and for more than a week nothing has been heard of him , and his wife is broken down - with grief over the continued absence of her husband . He was sick when he left home . but as business demanded his departure he went . On reaching Chicago he wrote to his wife that he was much worse than when he left home , and felt like returning , but thought best to go on . Since- that time nothing has been heard of him . Telegrams have been sent to several places ' where he was to have stopped , and the answer came bank that he had n't been heard of . Mr. Clay is a son of John C. Clay , one of the most highly-respected farmers of Bourbon County , and he himself has always borne the reputation of a model young man . In 1886 he married Mary , daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one child . W. R. and Robert S. Thomas , brothers-in-law of Mr. Clay , and his brother Frank Clay are in Chicago to see if they can find any trace of him , but so far have not been successful .
