txt Nashville , Tenn. , April 24 , 1898 . Thomas Sebastian Byrne , by the grace of God and the favor of the Apostolic See , Bishop of Nashville , to the clergy and laity of this diocese , greeting : The events that have succeeded the blowing up of the warship Maine and the sacrifice of 2613 innocent victims and patriotic seamen of the United States Navy have culminated in war between Spain and our beloved country . Whatever may have been the individual judgment of Americans prior to the moment when war broke out as to its wisdom or the adequacy of the reasons advanced in its justification , there can be now no two opinions as to the duty of every loyal American citizen . A resort to arms was determined upon by the Chief Executive of the Nation . with the advice of both branches of Congress , and after consultation with his Cabinet , but not until he had exhausted all other honorable means to bring about a peaceable settlement of the difficulties between this country and Spain . The patient calmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotic and forbearing attitude of President during the trying days that intervened between the blowing up of the Maine and the actual breaking out of war are beyond all praise , and should be the admiration of every American . We are all true Americans , and as such loyal to our country and to its flag , and obedient to the highest decrees and the supreme authority of our Nation . We are not now engaged in a war of section against section or State against State , but we are united as one man , and we have our faces set as flint against a foreign enemy and a common foe . If , as we are told , love of our country , or patriotism . is next to the love of God , and is imposed upon us by all law , human and divine , then it is not only lawful , but laudable , to pray for the temporal and spiritual well-being of the brave soldiers who are battling in the defense of their country and ours , and to beg the God of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory and triumph ; to stay the unnecessary effusion of blood and to speedily restore peace to our beloved land and people . To this end we direct that on and after the receipt of this circular and until the close of the war every priest of this diocese will say in his daily mass , when the rubrics permit , the Oratlo , Secreta , and Post Communion of the " Missa Pro Pace , " and for the same purpose , as well as for the souls of those who die in battle , he will say with the people after every mass one Our Father , one Hail Mary , and once the " De Profundis " with the prayer , announcing beforehand the intention for which the prayers are said . Praying that God may bless and preserve our country in this crisis and speedily bring victory , honor , and peace to all our people , I am faithfully yours in Christ , THOMAS SEBASTIAN , Bishop of Nashville .                 @ @ @ @
