txt Army oflicerS who ? have been looking forward to the campaign against Havana to furnish real tests of modern arms and methods of warfare do not conceal their disarrpoirrtment from a professional point of view at the prospect of peace being concluded before that campaign is ever begun . In the opinion of military experts , there has been no real test of these things in the fighting that has taken place so far in Cuba , and there , is not likely to be at Puerto Rico . At Santiago , it is pointed out , there were magnificent exhibitions of pluck and endurance and spirit , but the fighting was of such a nature as not to allow of any deliberate or scientific movements . It was a , dash , a rush , a charge . The much-talked-of three-battalion formation did not figure , nor was there any opportunity to use any of the modern movements which theory has evolved , but which have never been put into practice . At Puerto Rico there may be some chance for the test of tactics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Juan , but the force on the American side will be so overwhelming that the test will hardly be conclusive . It is to the Havana campaign that the military experts have looked for really fine military , displays . " It is a pity that the campaign must be abandoned , " said an enthusiastic student of the art of war who holds an Important place in the War Department . " It would be a beautiful military movement , and it would afford the first real test in actual warfare of modern guns and modern methods . " According to this officer , who has access to the best possible sources of information , there are not less than 200,000 soldiers in and about Havana , all of whom would be called into the city in case of its being attacked . The supply of ammunition , instead of being short , as sometimes said , is , according to figures in the possesp , ion of the Bureau of Information , practically unlimited . The batteries commanding the sea are composed of modern guns , and manned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mako it impossible for the fleet to do anything more than shell the city . The land defenses have been perfected , until they are believed to be most formidable . Those hastily thrown up at Santiago were found by Gen. Shatter to be almost impregnable , and it is not doubted that the work has been done far better at Havana , where Blanco has been working night and day for three months building trenches , digging rifle pits , throwing up redoubts , and generally strengthening the fortifications of the land side . To take the city now , it is calculated that an army of not less than 200,000 men , all the fleet , and all the land artillery that could be gotten together , would be needed . The best officers in the Spanish Army are la Havana . There are many foreign engineers and artillerists there , it is said , and the assault on the place would pit the American forces against an enemy as strong and as well armed as themselves . The result , in the eyes of the students of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world would look upon with awe , and t ; lus now-disputed problems of strategy and tactics .
