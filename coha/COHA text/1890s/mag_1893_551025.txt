By Raymond L. Brzdgma ii . UCH interest is felt in Massachusetts and i n other states in the question of biennial state elections and biennial sessions of the legislature . Many people would have both kinds of biennials . Others would have biennial state elections , but do not think it would be wise to hold a legislative session as infrequently as once in two years . I believe that both of the proposed changes - in many states they are of course effected changes - would be unwise and would work to the serious injury of the state . Having once thought otherwise , and having been compelled , in candor , to change my view because of increased familiarity with facts as they are to be observed at the state house and in state politics , having also had better facilities for observation than most people , it may be pertinent to set forth the reasons for my conclusions . It will help to a clear idea of the situation to take up first the question of biennial sessions of the legislature . The demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the legislature spends much time foolishly , that the sessions are needlessly long and expensive , that it is unwise to keep up a constant tinkering of the laws , that the business people do not want the laws disturbed so often , that the lawyers protest against the constant revision , and the common people can not keep up with the new legislation , that many " cranky " matters are introduced , and , in short , that the needs of the state for new laws would be amply served by a session once in two years , to the great relief of the popular mind from apprehension of the evil which an ignorant and shameless legislature may do and to the saving of the popular pocket of the large expense of their objectionable proceedings . Beyond dispute there is need of reform in legislative methods . Some of the popular criticism is richly deserved . But to attempt reform by introducing biennial sessions would only aggravate directly some of the evils whose remedy is sought , and would , as I think can be conclusively shown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered by the reformers that in a government by the people the ideal of excellence which the critics can see in contrast to reality can never be attained till the people are in a higher stage of development than at present . Popular government must ever reflect popular life and the morals and customs of the times . If there is a popular eagerness for wealth , the public treasury is sure to be exposed to the plunderings of dishonest contractors , and the halls of legislation are certain to be infested by men who procure their elections for the sake of increasing their material substance by selling their votes . If ambition for office at the hands of the people be prevalent , then men are always to be found in the legislature whose qualification is their anxiety to seem distinguished among their fellows , not their fitness to make laws for the people . Ambition and desire of wealth are strong and almost universal motives in men of this generation , and so the legislature will be under their curse . It is not for the legislative reformers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up continually , nor to cease their efforts , nor to imagine that it will be any remedy to reduce the legitimate demand of the people for legislation . It is natural that most people should believe that there is too much legislation . Each individual has few needs in this respect . He seldom goes to the legislature for its aid . In fact , most of the people never go at all . To them it is a waste of time and of money to hold annual sessions . Especially is this true of the rural districts . The majority of the country people would probably be perfectly reconciled to sessions less frequent // than once in two years . They are not constantly in large cities . They do not feel the force of the current of the times . But the most active life of the people is where the population is most dense , where there are the greatest accumulations of property , where there are many interests to be affected by legislation , where enterprise is most vigorous , where thought is the most active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the unseen but supposedly profitable future . It is a fact , that the cities and large towns bring more and more legislation to the state house every year . Their wants are more complex than those of the small towns . The issues which have not been foreseen by the legislators of the past are more numerous . It is every year more evident that the safe rule for the growth of the state is to have frequent opportunities for adjustment , for frequent adaptation of the laws to the rapidly developing needs of the times . If there were soundness in the argument for biennial sessions on the ground of too much legislation , then the tendency of the times would b* in that direction . But the history of Massachusetts at least in recent years proves beyond question that the necessary course is not in less frequent attention to the needs of the state , but rather in more faithful watchfulness over them It must be remembered that legislation is not an en*ertainment , nor a diversion , nor a free treat , nor anything but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save for some few professional agitators , and even they have their standing only because there are serious evils to the people they represent which need legislative action for their reform . These people who come to the state house on serious business do not come with any more alacrity than people go to law about other matters . Their attendance at the legislature takes them from their usual business , which is a money loss to them . Expenses of time , hotels , railroad travel , printing , lawyers ' fees and so on must be incurred , which are often large , and which are always an obstacle to seeking legislation . If it were not for the expense of getting laws passed , many more people would doubtless be at the state house for new changes and adjustments in the social and business order . Circumstances conspire to prevent people from petitioning for desired legislation . There is the uncertainty of favorable action , which is in itself a deterrent from agitation . There is the mysterious lobby to be dealt with , to encounter which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to pay . There is the inherent disposition to bear the ills we have rather than to fly to those we know not of . So nothing but the urgency of his needs will bring the average petitioner to the state house . Yet , in the face of this fact , and in spite of the prolonged and active effort for biennials by leading men of both parties and by many of the rank and file , by the leading republican press , by the ablest representatives of the independent press and by the country press generally , the demand for legislation in Massachusetts constantly increases . No one would have it if he could help it . Every one , as a rule , shrinks from it . Popular demand is asserted to be on the side of less frequent sessions . As far as can be judged , the result of the will of man would be to reduce the number of sessions and the quantity of legislation . Yet , in the face of this fact , I say , legislation grows in quantity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else than the demonstration , by the vital force of the community itself , that the demand for biennial sessions is an error . It is philosophically wrong , because it would cramp and retard the well rounded development of the state . It would continue present inequalities in the relation of different classes to each other . It would tend to pull back the Commonwealth from its preÃ«minence among the states , and it would nullify in part the promise it has in its frequent attention to matters of popular concern that it will lead the nation in the speedy establishment of justice and in the well-proportioned development of all classes of society . Advocates of biennials can not deny the fact ( for it has actually occurred during their agita // tion ) that the more they have talked and written for biennials , the stronger has been the demonstration in the very organic life of the people that there is urgent necessity for frequent legislation for the well being of the state , and that anything which interrupts it is an obstacle in the normal progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can they justify their position and assert that to be a benefit and a necessity which the Commonwealth as a whole continually pronounces an injury and a menace to her harmonious and natural growth ? The acts of the legislature themselves are witness to the need of legislation , unless it be maintained that our government itself is largely foolishness . In recent years the Blue Book has grown rapidly in volume . For a long time its pages have been of the same size , and hence comparisons of years by pages are just . In 1859 there was an unusually large amount of legislation for the ante-bellum period . The laws and resolves in the Blue Book edition filled 472 pages . Then they fell in amount for several years ; then rose and fell and rose again till the six months ' session of 1874 , with its laborious and voluminous enlargement and codification of the railroad law , resulted in a Blue Book of 493 pages . Then the volume of legislation , in the stagnation and severe business distress which followed the greenback catastrophe of 1874 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 320 in number ; in 1879 , the retrenchment year , 277 ; in i88o , 262 ; in i88r , 328 ; in 1882 , 258 ; in 1883 , 298 ; in 1884 , 4oo ; in 1885 , 434 ; in i886 , 396 ; in 1887 , 603 ; in i888 , 572 ; in 1889 , 497 ; in 1890 , 570 ; in 1891 , 463 ; in 1892 , 592 . Here is a vast increase in business in recent years . It is a proof that legislation was demanded by the people , and that the work of the legislature was essential to the safe and rapid development of the state , unless the champion of biennial sessions is ready to argue that the people would incur all the expense it involved solely from an unreasonable itching for unnecessary legislation ; that they would put themselves foolishly to the exertion which is unavoidable in the preparation *nd prosecution of cases before the legislature , that they would incur the expense of repeated travel and hotel bills in going to Boston , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the much-advertised lobby to watch their matters for them , and they would pay money to lawyers to fight their cases for them and that they would lose their time from their business , all for the sake of passing some whimsical bill through the legislature . When men put out time , . money and strength for no apparent object , when this outlay is made carelessly , when it is not a very serious business which is taken up only with reluctance and because they are forced into it , then and not until then will there he any soundness in the argument for biennial sessions that most of the legislation enacted is unnecessary . The truth is , that the people would keep away from the state house if they could . The fact that people talk for biennials shows what they would do , if they had the power , when their personal interests are not involved . The other fact , that people bring enough business to the legislature for a long annual session , shows how they practice their theories . They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge is that the subjects of legislation are the same old questions over and over again , that they are ridiculous in idea , that they are nothing but a tinkering of old laws , and that they are special matters which ought to be treated under general laws . But these objections can not have weight with those who understand the facts ; they have no sufficient basis of fact to rest upon , and they would not be advanced if the objectors would be at the trouble to inform themselves . upon the facts . The impression that old questions form the main business of the legislature year after year , rests on the very narrow basis of a few such matters as woman suffrage and biennials . Taking out these and the questions which require an agitation of two or three years for their settlement , but which mark a real development , there is nothing of consequence left as a basis for the charge that each legislature merely works over the 01 ( 1 business of its predecessor . There is. // now only one " hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is woman suffrage . Weekly payments , shorter hours of labor , employers ' liability , state arbitration , schoo4 superintendence by districts , free text-books , the abolition of the poll tax as a suffrage qualification , and other advance movements which have encountered serious obstacles have finally achieved success . Woman suffrage only stands just where it did twenty years ago . It is worth while to notice for a moment the belief of the opponents of annual sessions , that much of the legislative business is mere " rubbish . " In the first place , there is the interesting fact to notice , that this " rubbish , " - to include under that head matters which do not commend themselves to the judgment of the legislature as a whole , - is just as likely to come from the supposedly more intelligent classes of the community as from the less intelligent . Conspicuous as a matter which struggles yearly for recognition , yet which the legislature continues to reject by large majorities , and which many members are impatient with as the merest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbish " has the support of Henry L. Dawes , George F. Hoar , and distinguished men and women of the state in number sufficient to prove that the success of a petition before the legislature is not the only indication of the intellectual calibre or general good sense of the petitioners . For years , until discouraged by the hopelessness of the task , did Thomas Wentworth Higginson and others of his way of thinking try in vain to procure a repeal of the law which establishes a presumption against an atheist as a witness in court . Newspaper publishers have tried to secure a change in the law of libel , but in vain . Yet the late Col. XV . W. Clapp , John H. Holmes , Samuel Bowles , John S. Baldwin , John C. Mime and others do not believe that their petition was " rubbish " because they could not convince the judiciary committee of the soundness of their views . They abandoned their reform early . Had they pressed it in earnest , it might have become law , and thus their " rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people into that good sense which they had no doubt it was in fact . In the esteem of the great corporations , the demands for an employers ' liability law and for weekly payments of wages were at first * and as " rubbish they were treated by successive legislatures . Years of earnest agitation were needed to give them standing in the Great and ( ; eneral Court . Yet those years were a period of growth , of natural development in the state , and what was at first believed to be " rubbish " was found to be not only good sense , but a positive benefit to a large class of people . It is generally supposed that the farmers , as a class , have as much solid sense as any people in the state ; but what sometimes seems good sense to them seems ridiculous to people of other professions . The farmers would legislate against woodchucks , but the lawyers laugh them out of the house . It may be granted that some ideas presented are ridiculous to all members except to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really too small for serious consideration compared with the genuine interests involved . The charge of " rubbish " can not lie against legislative business to any material extent . Proposals which would be reasonable if adopted only where the petitioners live can not be applied everywhere . Such proposals are l ) resented from local interests all over the state , but fail to commend themselves to the judgment of the legislature as a whole , representing the general interest . That it is inexpedient to legislate upon many matters presented is no proof that the idea is not sensible , nor that it would be inexpedient were the conditions general which caused the presentation of the idea . These matters usually take but little time , and the argument for biennials can get no material strength from them . The more extreme proposals which are generally pronounced ridiculous are too few and take too little time to be worthy of notice . It is urged that there is too much special legislation ; that general laws ought to be passed which would obviate the need of special laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact that the rules of the legislature require a // general bill to be reported on any petition for a special act where it is possible to apply a general one . It is a fact that this rule is observed as closely as possible . But the criticism fails to perceive that special acts must often precede general acts . For a long time there was a fruitless , but honest and persistent , endeavor to draft a general water-supply act which should remove the need of a charter for every new company . It was years , in spite of repeated efforts , before a general law could be passed for safe depo*it , loan and trust companies , and in these years many special charters were issued . City charters were of necessity at first special , in the divergence of local circumstances and in the lack of experience in city administration . These are illustrations of many facts . Special acts are the pioneers in the growth of the state . They are inevitable in the advance into a new field or upon a higher plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different experiences , and so general laws become possible . But until a new race of statesmen is bred , special acts will as a rule precede general . As fast as possible special acts are made general , and to clamor for the latter before their time is useless . It is only when the generalization from special acts is not prOml ) t that there is good ground for complaint . But special acts which work a state-growth in a new line require time for discussion , both to be wise in themselves , and to set a wise precedent for coming general acts . This time is found much better in annual sessions than would be possible in biennials . Much help in considering the business of the Great and General Court can be obtained from a study of the business of other courts in the state . If we begin in *866 , with the epoch following the civil war , we find that constant growth has marked the history of our system of courts . Enlargement , not contraction , is the rule , as would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is increasing rapidly . The index of the Blue Book shows that changes have occurred in the courts by legislative action every year since 1866 . Something new has been required every year to enable the system to meet the demands upon it . Now people do not go to law for the pleasure of it . Payment of lawyers ' feea and court expenses is not an enticement to engage in litigation . Yet the people have every year put more and more business upon all their courts . The lower courts have been multiplied , the upper courts have been relieved from entire classes of business , and the number of their judges has been increased . All this has been necessary in the normal growth of the Commonwealth and of the people 's business before the courts . Six sessions of the superior court sit at the same time for Suffolk County alone , a result of the rapid growth of business in recent years . Passing over the creation of district courts ( which is not yet ended ) , and the enlargement of their jurisdiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their multiplication of cases , we find that in the superior and supreme courts changes have occurred due solely to the increase of business . All the tendency of the times has been to throw more work upon the courts . In 1873 the number of associate justices of the supreme judicial court was raised from five to six . In 1875 the associate justices of the superior court were made to number ten , instead of nine . Jn i886 the number was raised to eleven , and so inadequate was this advance that in i888 two more were added , making thirteen ; and in 1892 the number was made fifteen . In 1883 jurisdiction in equity cases was given to the superior court for the sake of relieving the supreme court . In r88* , in order to spare the justices of the supreme court from hard labor in their old age , and in order to permit them to retire to make room for younger men who could more rapidly dispatch their accumulated business , the law was passed for the retirement of the justices upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the law was passed to give the superior court jurisdiction in divorce cases . This was solely for the relief of the overworked supreme court , though the argument that the sanctity of the marriage tie demanded that all such // cases be considered by the highest court in the state had hitherto prevented the change . The practice of retiring judges upon pensions was applied to the superior court also in the same year . In 1891 the further pressure of business upon the supreme court overpowered the hitherto potent argument that cases involving human life should be tried by the highest court of the state , and the superior court was given exclusive jurisdiction in capital cases . New necessities have broken down old practices , as the swelling trunk of a vigorous tree breaks the old bark and enlarges itself to true proportions for its own life . All through the system of courts is evident this enlargement of business , which necessitates increased time and expense , yet which is inevitable in the growth of the Commonwealth . As it is with the courts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it is with the Great and General Court . The pressure which is felt at every county seat is felt most of all at the state house . Viewed in its true light , this one aspect of the case is conclusive against biennial sessions of the legislature . In its normal growth the Commonwealth shows us courts multiplying , business increasing , . justices made more numerous , salaries raised with enlarged business , more assistants provided , - and all this in a healthful condition of the body politic . Yet in the case of the people 's court , the one place where they can come for redress of grievances , the sole opportunity they have for bettering their legal standing in relation to their fellows , the court which must adjust business methods to modern facts , the court which must find a place for numerous inventions which continually change the relations of property to itself and of persons to it , the court which makes the laws which control the other courts which try these constantly multiplying cases , it *s proposed to cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crowd the accumulations of two years and to tell the people to make the best of it they can . The proposition is ridiculous , and it only needs this comparison with the other court business to show how little real attention can have been given to the matter by the friends of biennial sessions . The opponents of biennials , presenting their argument on this one ground and making it clear to the people , might afford to rest their case with it alone , for no population of intelligence could see clearly the facts and then vote to reduce to biennial sessions its opportunities for prompt and proper transaction of its business . Further light on this phase of the question is given by the course of business in city councils , where the people are governed by representatives , as they are in the state government . It is the custom in all the cities of the state for the aldermen and common council to meet freque ntly . Their sessions are not continuous , as are the sessions of the legislature , day after day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any considerable time except during the heat of summer , when many of the people served are away . That is , there is so much public business arising in every city , that meetines of the city government must be held frequently in order that it may be acted upon promptly and when the interests concerned demand it . One would be foolish who should say that even once in six months was often enough for a city council to meet . Yet the legislature must do the business of the twenty-eight cities of the Commonwealth in their relations with the enlarging circle of development which requires constant readjustment , and must act also for the 324 towns . Because there is need of frequent legislation , it is not necessary to show that it is of exciting constitutional or historical iml ) Ortance . Neither states nor men grow by leaps and bounds . The boy who is on his way to robust manhood is not appreciably taller to-day than he was yesterday , but he is hungry for three meals a day ; it would inconvenience him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one has yet proposed a biennial plan for boys , and advised that they eat only once in two days . Uniform and healthy growth is promoted by that legislation which satisfies the seemingly commouplace needs of the people , just as it // is a commonplace matter to provide daily meals ; but the aggregate of the growth is not commonplace , and the highest aggregate is reached by preventing any loss of growth . Because some legislation does not appear to be critical , it does not follow that it is not important , nor that the state would be just as well off without it . A fact which may be briefly stated should not be overlooked in the proofs that annual sessions are for the good of the people . It is that in every year cases arise frequently in which the legislative rules are suspended in order that a bill may be put at once upon its passage . Even granting that this may be needless in some instances when it occurs , the fact remains that there is often occasion , even while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some interest which can not wait without injury for the ordinary course of legislation . That is , the current of human affairs is flowing ceaselessly on , and , as would be expected in a natural course , cases of immediate need are frequently occurring . No consideration of biennials would be complete without attention to the vastness and diversity of the interests involved . Probably no one comprehends , as to quantity alone , the work of the legislature at one session . The clerks know that the mere record of matters entered by title is voluminous . The members of the several committees know something of what is before them , but they have little idea of what is before other committees . The Blue Book at the end of the session shows what has been enacted , but it has no hint of what has been rejected ; and the Blue Book alone is proof of much work done . Great and complex interests are under treatment at the same time . Matters are under hearing before committees which , if brought forward under other circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers and in popular thought ; but as it is , they must be dismissed with brief mention or none at all . Only a small part of the significance of bills is revealed in the Senate and House . If there is opposition , then the facts are brought out to a greater or less degree . But if there is not , the members trust the committee 's judgment and their reports usually pass unchallenged . The legislative machine is too complex and the mass of business is too great for any one member to know thoroughly about more than a very small part of it . It is easy to sneer at the mass , but sneers are based upon ignorance . Really , only a small proportion of the petitions and orders are offered by persons whose good sense would be questioned , or who can be suspected of attempting blackmail upon wealthy persons or corporations . To certain persons of good sense nearly every matter of proposed legislation seems advisable . As long as we have government by the people , it is inevitable that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of a committee , or to a broader information , seem inexpedient . But it is no remedy for this fact in legislation to throw all such schemes upon an inexperienced legislature in twice the mass of the present . It is inevitable in a popular government of a thinking people , as the people of Massachusetts proudly suppose themselves to be , that a great many matters of legislation should be offered . How can government by the people be realized , and how can the body politic get the benefit of the wisdom and patriotism of its several members , unless fair consideration is accorded to the suggestions which those members offer for the betterment of their condition or for the improvement of the public administration ? A weighty reason for annual sessions is that the people should keep nearer their representatives than is possible by a biennial system . The quality of legislation is affected by the sense of nearness and annual accountability . Men who know that they are in their last term are more likely to disregard the voice of the people than if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected only once in two years , each year of their service would have its distinct evil . The first year would see much bungling legislation due to the inexperience of the members ; the second would be exposed to the selfish and mercenary acts of men who had little fear of accountability to // their constituents . In the first year the evil would affect nearly all the members ; in the second , the proportion would certainly be material and would probably be decisive on the fate of important measures . Representatives are prone to look out for themselves rather than for the public ; and , unfortunately , there is too much reason to believe that there are mercenary men in every legislature who are open to improper influences . Perhaps they are a small proportion of the legislature numerically , but they are sufficient to tarnish the reputation of every House and to be a standing disgrace to the commonwealth . With a legislative session only once in two years , these men would have more disposition than now to take advantage of the confusion and inexperience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not again be candidates . Those who would resist corruption in one ase might yield in another . With biennials the proportion of members exposed to this temptation would be much greater than now . Not only would there be a higher plane of legislative morality in a body elected every year , but the needs of the people would receive more prompt and efficient attention . In each year members are now elected with some reference to local and current issues . National politics intervene to obscure these issues more or less , but local needs still have an effect , and the laws which are enacted have a reasonably close connection with the popular demand . But if the legislature were elected only once in two years , the people would lose half their present opportunity to exert an influence upon the law-making body . The current of organic vitality in the community , as it reveals itself in the change of laws at the demand of the people , would become less active . Its service to the growth of the community would be impeded . The popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being prevented , thought upon the problems of the times would become correspondingly useless , and the result as a whole could not be therwise than a hindrance to the natural development of the body politic and a check to that alleviation of the ills of its poorer and weaker members which is always in progress with the growth of Christian civilization . One objection to annual sessions is the expense ; but this is not to be considered a moment compared with the good to be obtained by prompt attention to the wants of the people . The entire state tax in recent years has been but about 6o to 70 cents on $r , ooo , while the remainder of the taxpayer 's contribution to the public treasury for most of the cities and towns is from $12 to $15 on $I , ooo . The saving in popular burdens by omitting one session of the legislature would be too infinitesimal to consider ; for if the entire tax is so small , how much smaller would be the saving of the cost of a session once in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session One of the retorts to the plea for annual sessions is that if the argument proves anything , it proves that semiannual sessions would be best7 and so on to continuous sessions . This is advanced seriously by some . Perhaps it is reasonable ; perhaps , as the waste of the human body goes on all the time , it would be reasonable for all persons to be nibbling all the time . There is reason in all things , or should be , - and this is a sufficient answer to that retort . Unquestionably one of the strongest props of the biennial theory is the dislike of people to agitation and change . It is hard to keep up with the current of events and with the thought of the times . In fact , the average citizen can not do it . All he can hope to do is to watch his own profession or business and not its progress . Business methods and ways of living and thinking get away from him unless he hurries to keep up . The laws , he feels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects every profession and makes antiquated every one who is out of the current of thought for a few years operates no less actively in the communitylife itself . It is the fact in the business world , that machinery not half worn out must be replaced by new because recent inventions make it unprofitable to use the old . Buildings in good repair and capable of rendering many years of service // must be torn down , as is seen in Boston , to make room for the latest improvements in offices and in methods of construction . Besides this growth in the separate lines , there is a growth of the community as a whole , which it would be folly to check . Lawyers hate to see a new Blue Book every year . Men object to new business methods where they do not see a direct personal advantage . Every one rebels at the thought of new laws to obey , new regulations to learn and observe . Yet this is the way the community grows , and the healthiest and most rapid growth is where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we understand hurry us on , both in our private business methods and in our public relations . We can not master them if we would . They are for the well-being of the state and of the nation . It is our duty to give them every opportunity for free action . We check and divert them to our injury only . We recognize them and promote them for our good . To sum up , the objections to annual sessions are founded upon mistaken beliefs as to facts and upon a conservatism which fails to recognize the growth of the community . These objections are of little weight compared with the reasons why there should be frequent opportunity for the popular will to assert itself in the forms of law , and for the popular intelligence to do its best toward the improvement of the state . It is not too much to say that the advance of Massachusetts - and the present argument is not for Massachusetts alone - is due in part to the frequency with which the popular will expresses itself for the betterment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she will not make the mistake of adopting biennial lagislative sessions . The other phase of the biennial problem is that of biennial state elections . At the outset the truth should be recognized that the legislature is nearer to the people than either of the other branches of the government . It is not necessary in this stage of development and of study of community-growth to insist that there is a steady progress , that the times are changing , that the ideals of the people are undergoing constant alterations ( for the better as we optimistically believe ) , that there are higher ideals of personal action , that business methods are more expeditious and efficient , that the body politic is raising up its lowliest members , and that the entire mass of our people is surely and steadily advancing to a higher type of civilization , whose realization many workers find in the full meaning of the word Christian , to which the state as a body politic has not yet nearly attained . Unless this growth toward an unrealized ideal is admitted , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded . But assuming that this fact will not be denied , then the first pertinent consideration is that the legislatufe is the closest to the people of all the departments of our government . Its members are fresh from the elections , where they have been chosen to represent the people . They have been chosen upon issues . The voice of the majority , which is our practical criterion of what is for the greatest benefit to the people , has selected the men who sit under the gilded dome , while the representatives of opposing views , each for his own locality , have been left at home . The growth of the community as a body politic is fostered by and finds its expression in its laws . Hence the question of the desirability of biennial state elections must be discussed first of all in its relation to the legislature . What effect will biennial elections have upon the enactment of the laws which promote the development of the state toward the unattained Christian ideal and which are the expression of the collective intelligence and will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be noticed under biennial state elections , is that the members would sit for two sessions without re-election , instead of one , supposing that the common sense of the people accepted the conclusion that annual sessions are essential to the growth of the state , as against biennials . This arrangement has been advocated by some writers on this subject . Governor Brackett , in his inaugural address in 1890 , recommended that there be a legislature chosen once in two years to hold an annual session , saying that " a // legislature elected for two years and meeting annually would at its second session be composed wholly of experienced members . " But the reverse of the proposition is true , - that at its first session the legislature would b* practically composed wholly of inexperienced members . More than this , the experience which it would have in its second session would be only that learned by observation of the errors of its own inexperience ; whereas , by the present system of annual elections , the experience gained is by observation of the traditions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement , from year to year , and which are the result of the accumulated trials and wisdom of a century . These methods are easily followed , in the main , for in every house about one-third of the members have seen service before , while every senate is composed , by a large majority , of men who have served in the house . The strong probability is that the inexperience in the first session of a legislature elected under the biennial system would far more than offset the questionable experience which would be their supposed leading qualification in the second session . The members in the first session would be ignorant of their duties . They would be totally unfamiliar with legislative methods . The rules of procedure which are of constant application every hour of the sesson would have little place in their minds . Yet those rules , the growth of centuries of parliamentary practice , are indispensable to the prompt and correct dispatch of business . The members would not know the history of matters presented . They would not be able to exercise proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without that acquaintance which discerns the mere idle talker from the business man a few of whose sensible words are worth hours of advice from the other . With an honest attempt to satisfy the wants of the people in legislation , it can not be questioned , it seems to me , that business would be greatly delayed and poorly done , and that there would be confusion , omissions and blunders more than now in the Public Statutes . In their second session these legislators would have only themselves to learn from . What hope , then , of better legislation than we have now , when there are always experienced men enough to conduct the business of the two branches , to serve as chairmen of committees , and to take the brunt of the labors , leaving the new men free to learn in a better way than by their own mis-takes ? This is not saying , by any means , that the present system is perfect . It is not . But th' present system is the result of many years of experience on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people has sent to the legislature , men who have been spurred on to do their best by their own conscience , intelligence and ambition , by the pressure of public sentiment upon them , and by the constant upbraidings and lashings of nearly all the press of the state . The system can be improved , but there would be little hope of better things from a bienniallyelected legislature with annual sessions . The weight of this consideration , it will at once be urged , turns upon the question whether the people would or would not elect members to more than one term of service . If members were re-elected for second terms , as now , or even approximately as now , then the objection would fall and the argument from experience alone would favor the change . But no one who has watched the course of legislative nominations for years can have the slightest hesitation in saying that members who had served two years would not be re-elected . Ample demonstration is found in our present practice . In the city.districts it is the custom to re-elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively rare . But in the country districts the practice is general of electing the members for only one year , no matter how meritorious the service has been . This is due to local jealousy and ambition in part , and in part to personal ambition . After every decennial redistricting , it occurs in many districts that representatives of the towns thus newly thrown together meet and apportion the number of years in the coming ten for which each town shall have the representative , and establish the order in // which the rotation shall be followed . This plan is adhered to as closely as the exigencies and casualties of politics permit , to the loss of the district in the efficiency of its representatives and to the injury of the state in not having experienced legislative ability at its command , but to the aggrandizement of the local lawyer or manufacturer and to the vindication of the right of the town to take its " turn " in representation in the Great *nd General Court . Though the cities now often give their representatives two terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two years the personal ambition of waiting aspirants would doubtless prevent a re-election in most cases for two years more . That members would not be re-elected to any material extent under this biennial system is practically settled beforehand . Another consideration relative to annual sessions of a biennially-elected legislature is that in the second session , at which the members would have the benefit of the poor experience of their first session , they would be required to act upon many *uestions upon which they would not have the voice of the people . More than a year would have elapsed since their election . The phases of existing issues would certainly have changed somewhat during the interval . Some wholly new questions would have sprung up . Each member desires to represent his constituents . As a rule , he is a member because he represents their opinions on broad questions . On local matters he may represent one of two sharply opposed courses . He aims , as a rule , to follow the voice of the people . It is the majority , speaking through him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of a biennially-elected legislature there would have been ho opportunity for the popular voice to be heard , and to that extent laws would be enacted upon which there had been no popular expression , either as regards state policy or neighborhood dissension . Such legislation would involve the probability of further agitation , either for amendment or repeal . It would be complicated with other pending issues which had arisen in their turn , and a settlement would imply compromises or injustice . The correct course in disposing of public issues , is to settle them one at a time , each on its own merits , and then let every new question be discussed as it deserves , so that new divisions and new party alignments can be made . This is a sure way to prevent corrupt log-rolling . It expedites the settlement of popular issues and promotes the development of the state . To summarize , - with a legislature of the type proposed , the first session would be seriously affected by the inexperience of the members , by the mistakes they would certainly make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waste of time inevitable with so many new men , while the second session , which could have the benefit of only inferior experience , would have to remedy the defects of the first , would be more liable to corrupt influence , and would be at the disadvantage of a year 's further remove from the people , who are the true source of legislation and whose voice must ultimately be regarded . We now come to the relation of biennial state elections to the chief executive of the state . Here is where the proposed change has one of its strongest roots , apparently , in the minds of its advocates . The governor , it is said , does not have time enough in one year to develop any policy ; he is no more than seated before politicians are planning about his successor ; desire of a second term controls his course in his first , and the people do not have the benefit of his independent action ; if the term were two years , he would have opportunity to formulate and to develop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination . Higher than the governor are the people , and they are represented in the legislature . If biennial elections are , on the whole , injurious to the legislature and to the proper care of the people 's interests , that superior consideration should settle the matter , even if the argument for a two-years ' term for the governor were as sound as it is plausible . But it is not . Much has been said recently in favor of strengthening the governor . Attention has been called to the constant encroachment of the legislative departrnent // upon the executive , and there is no doubt of the fact that the governorship tends to become a less important office , no matter what exceptions there may be in the cases of brilliant individual incumbents . This tendency is inevitable and it is right . The executive carries out the will of the people . He is their servant . Their collective intelligence is better than his individual judgment . Their decision is conclusive . Their will is supreme . To meet emergencies the governor has a veto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . He is made governor to execute that will ; that is his policy , and his plans must be made within existing laws . It is for the people to change the laws , not for the governor . Reforms come from the people , not , as a rule , from our governors . It is for the governor , as head of the administration of the laws which are made by the people , to point out how that administration may be improved . Such recommendations come within his province , but anything which he may offer further is an impertinence , and worth only what it would be worth as coming from a private citizen . His function is far inferior to that of the legislator . Development of the stat , e as an organism inevitably comes from the mass of the people , and wherever existing law operates to restrain any in the pursuit of liberty and property not at the injury of his fellows , there is a point where legislative action is needed to break the old bark of the tree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner life . No governor within my recollection has been elected because he was the agitator and inaugurator of a positive reform , but at most only because he has been a representative of a reform for which there was a demand which he did not create . Our governors are not elected because they are leaders whom the mass of the people follow . No such men have existed in this generation ; and as the education and independence of our people advance , there is small prospect that such will be found hereafter . At most , they will be exceptions to the rule , and it is undesirable to legislate for exceptions . Any governor 's policy must be within certain narrow limits ; and as it is to be supposed , judging from the past and relying upon the common sense of the people , that the people will choose their governors from men who have had experience in state matters or in governmental administration of some sort , it is not necessary that they should have a year in which to become accustomed to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be greater familiarity with office in the second year , . wider experience in the management of public institutions , and acquaintance with a larger circle of aspirants to office . These considerations have some weight , . but not much if the governor is fit for his first year , and especially not much in comparison with other interests . If the governor so acts in his first term as to secure a re-election , he is in the main only doing as well as he can , which he is. bound to do in any event . Such a consideration is in favor of frequent returns to the people . But there is a sufficient reply to the objection that the governor has not in one year a sufficient opportunity to develop his policy . It is the strong probability ( which has been a fact in recent years ) that if the governor fills his office well he will be re-elected . Massachusetts practically illustrates this . On the other hand , if the term of the governor were two years , the people would lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us take a recent case for illustration . A material factor in the defeat of Governor Brackett in his candidacy for a second term was unquestionably his failure to veto the West End charter for a street railway in Boston after a legislative investigation had proved that the bill was passed by means of a profuse use of money , by the extensive employment of lobbyists , and by the exertion of improper influence upon the members of the legislature . The judgment of the people , powerless to defeat or annulthe act , found expression in the rejection of the governor who failed to satisfy the popular demand for action in this emergency . By the annual election this popular judgment was emphasized . Under a biennial system , later events would have removed the impression or have confused the // issues , and the lesson would have been lost . The effect of biennial elections upon the judiciary of the state does not seem to be an important consideration , compared with the effect upon other departments of the government . As far as a biennially-elected legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obscure or contradictory , so far the duties of the judges would be increased and their discharge would be unsatisfactory . But biennial elections would not touch this department closely . One reason for annual elections which is emphasized by their friends , but is made of no account by their opponents , is that such elections exert an indispensable educational effect upon the people . Doubtless such an effect is worth a heavy cost , and the appreciation of such education is most proper . But it seems unnecessary to rely much upon that argument for annual elections because the education is secured in obtaining the more direct objects of elections . The workingman has no need of physical exercise for its own sake , because he gets enough of it in his work . If a man gets no such exercise in his usual work , then he must make physical exertion solely for the sake of the exercise . If the education of the people in self government could be secured only by annual elections , then that end would amply justify such means ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political work which must be done , the political body gets its needed exercise or education . The objections to annual elections will be found summarized as follows by the Hon. Henry L. Pierce in his argument of March 20 , 1890 , in favor of biennial elections and legislative sessions , made before the legislative committee on constitutional amendments . He said : " The admitted evils of the present system , concisely stated , are , first , incessant political agitation ; second , overmuch legislation ; third , instability and uncertainty in the laws ; fourth , unnecessary and wasteful expenditure of money . " The second of these objections is met by the considerations in the article on biennial legislative sessions . Some of our legislation is remedial of errors due to carelessness and ignorance , part of which might be avoided and part of which is inevitable with the limitations of a popular government and never can be reformed away , except in a degree . The remainder of legislation is due to the legitimate growth of the state and , as already said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort is in conflict with the demands of the people for more legislation , demands which are imperative and loudly heard at the state house in spite of the interests of all petitioners to keep away from the legislature otherwise . The third objection is sound as far as it goes , but instability and uncertainty are inevitable in a state whose wants are growing rapidly , whose inventions are constantly shifting the relations of business men to each other , and whose people are continually moving away from the customs of their fathers . It is an evil that children should grow , because they outgrow their clothes before they are worn out ; it increases the expense and the inconvenience of providing for them . But the evils of changing clothes and of changing laws must be borne with as much economy and philosophy as possible , remembering that to check the growth which necessitates the changes would be folly . The fourth objection of " unnecessary and wasteful expenditure of money " is also true in a sense . Certainly money will be spent unnecessarily and wastefully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or quadrennials . But the pertinent question is , is the election worth the expense ? On one side the weight of the argument can be measured with some approach to exactness , especially since the passage of the act to prevent corrupt practices in elections . It is so many dollars and cents . Allowing more for the time lost in political agitation , and more yet for the sum not reported under the corrupt practices act , which every reader may estimate to suit himself , the question still remains , does the good of the state demand this expense ? My answer is without hesitation that it does , and would warrant a much larger expense if the end // were not to be gained otherwise . In the unfolding of the reasons for this will come the answer to the first objection to annual elections named above , - " incessant political agitation . " We are to-day more than ever face to face with the fact that we do not know what there is in the organization of sockety as a whole . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us do not , whatever may be true of prophetic statesmen ) toward which the organic unity of the human race is tending . We look back and see a marvellous development in the forms of government , almost invariably connected with the overthrow of human despotism , with the struggle of tyrants for their individual power , with the manifestation of patriotic heroism and with the sacrifice of countless lives whose dying energy has been perpetuated in the institutions they have founded . We have reached to-day the point of a representative republic whose ultimate atoms are local democracies . Under the despots of the overthrown governments elections have been unknown . Neither annual nor biennial legislatures were wanted or had , nor did the people have anything to say regarding their political status . Step by step with " the protest of corpses " at every point against the old regime , the worth of the judgment of the many against the few has asserted itself ; the right of the many against the privilege of the few has won its bloody victories . Now , with the collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominal guide , we stand at the point in our growth where this will is more active than ever and where this wisdom finds more problems before it than were dreamed of in the days when our present form of government rose triumphant over the inferior monarchy . Our political thought is more active than ever . Our business interests are more complicated , divergent and enormous . The accumulation of wealth is more rapid . The elevation of the lowly in material prosperity is higher than the past ever knew . Our growth is from a center outward , as it were of a sphere , not in one contracted line . Every enlargement brings new problems . These problems are forced upon us . We can not help ourselves , save by denying our existence as rational and progressive beings and by refusing to go forward . We are in the grasp of forces which go back through recorded history beyond the mists of tradition , forces too mighty and comprehensive for us , which are sweeping us on , willing or unwilling , knowing or unknowing , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governmental problems which we can not solve , but whose solution will doubtless come with the progress of the state in the science of government . Yet that progress is an organic growth . What extent of growth and what fulness of prosperity are bound up in the future for organized humanity , we can only surmise . One day we establish governmental control of the post-offices ; on another the state puts highways under the authority of the towns , instead of in the care of turnpike companies ; on another we assert organic control of our water supplies , instead of leaving them the property of private persons . Shall we go on to take the railroads next , and the express business ( much of which is even now creeping into the mail-bags away from corporate operation ) , the gas , the telegraph and telephone , and so on ? Shall the state thus solve the problems which are involved in the community 's serving itself as an organism , instead of being served by its private constituent members ? Shall the organized community extend its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , as it is tentatively doing with its manual and industrial training ? Shall it care for its poor beyond the present system of pauper relief and prevent them from becoming paupers ? Whither are the forces of organized humanity sweeping us ? Tribes have advanced in civilization . Small communities have grown to local states , states to nations , and nations to alliances and to a recognized international law , their growth being in every case from an inner law , which may or may not have been expressed in a written constitution . This growth has been constant and seems to be advancing to-day more rapidly than ever . But the community finds its voice only // in elections . Legislatures are its only representatives . Laws are its only expression . Whatever may have been true of the slower times of the past , to-day the agitation in the realm of organic community-action is greater than then . The will of the community is more and more finding expression in its natural way - in its laws . Writers in Massachusetts protest against state commissions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the number of commissions is constantly growing in the very teeth of the protest . The outlook is for the extension of government into the realm of highways this year , into something else next year , and so on , with no end in sight . In the nation the growth of departments is steady . The original cabinet has been enlarged by taking in new officers the department of agriculture has been added recently ; the merchants and business men now show strong reasons for a new cabinet officer for a department of commerce ; other nations have still other departments represented in their cabinets , hinting at what may be needed by ourselves . At all points the government is enlarging its contact with the affairs of the people . That is , the people , as an organic whole , are doing more and more for themselves that which is for their comfort and prosperity . We seem to have barely entered upon this career , so numerous are the avenues for governmental action compared with the field of governmental exercise in the past . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bring triumph , because in some matters , years are needed for the education of the popular intelligence , for organizing and compacting into an effective body the friends of a particular reform ; but it does bring growth . The time and the agitation are not wasted , and they have their fruition in the larger rights and comforts for many people who would have had to wait longer if frequent elections had not favored their cause . This truth is seen in the ten-hour law , in the body of factory and sanitary legislation , in the weekly-payments law , in the state board of arbitration and conciliation , in the employers ' liability act , in the protection to women and minors , in the closer restriction of the sale of liquor , iu the development of the school system of the state , in the regulation of the use of electrical inventions , in the encouragement of business enterprises , in the improvement of our voting system , in the restriction of corrupt election practices . and so on through a long list . These gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a biennial system . They are of incalculable worth , but the objection to their cost can be measured in dollars and cents . Such an objection can not be sound . Every step of progress by the state is an advance over some obstacle , a throwing off of some weight , an attainment of a larger sense of what is involved in the relations of men to each other in an organic whole . These weights which the state is throwing off are so many hindrances to the well-being of every individual in the state . How much more rapid will be the community-development when the level already in sight shall have been attained ? But who can tell whether an end will ever be reached to the solution of state problems ? To-day it is the cry of the poor which is heai*d . To-day the effort is to raise the great mass of the people to the wealth and comfort of the more favored few . The current of progress does not turn backward . When this problem is solved , if ever , will anyone predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The occasions of organic action now could not have been predicted by the men who made the constitution . Why should any one now undertake to say that there will be a stoppage of state development , so that the body politic will have fewer wants than now ? The state , humanity in its organic capacity , is well represented by the Sphinx . It is in part composed of the animal nature , but its head is human and erect . Humanity is beginning to realize its oneness . It is asserting its right to act as a whole , and to interfere for the protection of its constituent individuals . In the face of all the talk against too much government , the unfoldings of the times show larger and larger interventions of the state as a whole in the social and business affairs of // its people . To-day the outlook for the continuance of such interventions is wider and clearer than ever . In proportion as these interventions extend , so must there be frequent and intelligent exercise of the knowledge and the will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obeying , which are the laws of God . If ever the future brings a solution of all the problems in sight , if the race seems to have reached its goal , then will he time for it to enjoy in ease the fruits of its growth ; but in this era , with the unsolved questions of state life more numerous than ever , and with the true nature of organized humanity becoming more clearly seen , it is the worst time to think of adopting a policy which shall in any way restrict the growth of the human organism to its Christian ideal , which is bringing larger good to every citizen .
