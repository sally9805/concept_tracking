txt The Legislative session is practically ended . The lobby , which has controlled the session , left the capital on the late trains last night , and at the final sessions to-morrow there will be but a slim attendance . A curious feature about this session is that , when it met , a great noise was made about its being a farmer Legislature , and prophecies of great things to be accomplished were plentiful . These have all proved sounda.nd fury , signifying only humbug for the people . A lobby in the hire of corporations who feared legislation has had full possession of the Capitol during the entire session , and has direoted legislation , or rather prevented it . In the House 723 bills were introduced , and only sixty of them have been passed . The railroad companies , the express companies , the telegraph companies , the telephone companies , and all the rest have been left alone . The two-cent-amile passenger rate , the two-and-a-half-cent bill , the freight hill , and all other railroad legislation objectionable to the railroad lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly , but then it has been very easy to kill any bill this session . The constitutional provisions in regard to legislation were drawn with special regard to the lobby . With a law requiring a bill to be . read upon three separate days in each house , and twice referred to committees , and to receive a constitutional majority in both houses , it is an easy matter to kill anything .
