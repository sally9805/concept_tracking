txt Prendergast , who was sentenced to be hanged to-morrow for the murder of Mayor Harrison , has been respited , by an order of the court , until April 6 . Judges Jenkins , Wood , Bunn , and Seaman , constituting the United States Circuit Court , refused this morning to interfere in the case . They decided that they had no jurisdiction in the matter . The arguments of Prendergast 's attorneys would hold good in support of a legal error , they said , but were of no avail in a petition for habeas corpus . It is provided by the Revised Statutes that a court may impanel a jury to hold a hearing to determine the sanity or insanity of a defendant at any time before execution and after sentence . In the event of the convicted man being found insane by the jury , the law provides that execution shall be staid until the person recovers his reason . Under this law , Attorneys Gregory and Harlan procured from John Prendergast , the prisoner 's brother , an affidavit , based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which declared him insane . After a canvass of the Judges , Judge Chetlain was selected to hear the motion . A special court was opened at 4 o'clock . and at 11 . It was still in session . The defense opened the proceedings with a formal motion for the empaneling of a jury . This was resisted by counsel for the State , and a prolonged argument followed . The venerable mother of the murderer , escorted by her eldest son , was admitted to the courtroom , and the two were given seats before the bar . The mother bore herself a ith composure , keeping her eyes fixed upon the ground , but the brother was nervous and agitated . When the arguments were concluded at 8 o'clock , Judge Chetlain announced that he was not entirely satisfied w ith the showing that had been made , and that it was necessary to show that the condemned man had become insane and a lunatic since judgment had been pronounced . Counsel expressed itself prepared to make such a showing , and the court ordered Prendergast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . and then the prisoner , escorted by six bailiffs , Caine into the courtroom . He had been shaved a little while before , and his hair was clipped close to the skull . The effect was to give his face a ghastly appearance . " lie has the death pallor already , " said one of the doctors , as the man came into full view under the electric lights . Prendergast came through the door v ? with a shuttling step , but , when his eyes took in the crowded courtroom and the Judge on the bench , his nerve failed him , and he fell into his chair in a state of semicollapse . He paid close attention , however , to the proceedings , and at one stage asked one of the Deputy Sheriffs for a pencil and seine paper . The request , however , was not complied with . A Deputy Sheriff stood before him , so that he might be shielded from his mother 's sight , and a possible scene was thus prevented . Dr. Bahl , the first witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours before , and that Prendergast discussed track elevation and other matters . He had also referred to the fact that to-morrow was Good Friday . and spoke of the number of cuts the Saviour had received and of the quantity of blood that was shed at Calvary . The witness believed that Prendergast was insane . Counsel for the State asked that the evidence be excluded , because the witness had testified to the same effect at the trial proper , but the court overruled the motion . Another young doctor , Tracey by name , who said that he had had six months ' experience with the insane at the County Insane Asylum at Albany . N. Y. , also narrated a conversation he had with Prendergast in the course of the day , in which the latter had said that he was justified in killing the ex-Mayor. that he had done the right thing , and that he was sure lie could meet his Maker without receiving judgment for the crime . Both witnesses were put through a searching and technical cross-examination by State Attorneys Bottum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they left the witness stand . Shortly before midnight , after a hearing that had lasted nearly eight hours , Judge Chetlain decided that , both under the common law and the revised statutes , the court had inherent power to prolong the date of execution of Prendergast . The evidence , the Court said , made out a prima facie ea q.c . of insanity . It was apparent that , as midnight had been reached and the day of execution was already there , the trial on the question of the insanity could not be complete even if a jury was impaneled before the hour appointed for the hanging . It was due the criminal jurisprudeneeeof the State that this matter should hav6 calm , deliberate , clear , and fully consideration . The law plainly laid down the fact that the court might prolong the time in a case of this kind . And it should not be said that a court was left powerless to act simply because the hour of execution had almost arrived . He would , therefore , grant a stay of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prisoner would be carefully tried by a jury . When the Judge announced his decision a grin took possession of Prendergast 's countenance , and he turned front one face to another with a leer of satisfaction . He was quickly ushered out of the courtroom and returned to jail . SPRINGFIELD , Ill. , March 22 . ? Lawyer Darrow , of the defense for Prendergast , arrived in the city from Chicago this morning to ask for executive clemency in Prendergast 's behalf . Acting Gov . Gill , after hearing the arguments , said that from what he could gather the defense was that Prendergast was insane , but he had had a fair and impartial trial by a jury of his peers , and they had declared that he was sane and guilty of murder in the first degree and should be hanged . In concluding , the Acting Crovernor said : " I feel that he has had a. fair trial , and I can not and will not interfere . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
