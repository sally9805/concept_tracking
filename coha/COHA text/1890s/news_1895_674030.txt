txt Andrew Carnegie . who came to Cleveland with several members of his iron company to attend the St. Andrew 's Society benefit last night , was received by the members of the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce this afternoon . The rooms of the Chamber were crowded with representative business men when President Day introduced Mr. Carnegie , who delivered an address of half an hour 's duration , in the course of which he said : I compliment the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce for being the first to state to the Nation , to the politicians , the leaders of both parties , that the best interests of our country are sub-served by making the campaign for the Presidency as short as possible . That pronouncement of yours , as you well know , has gone through this country . I am not without hope that Its influence will be felt when the two great parties place before this country the representatives of two conflicting politics for the sovereign people to judge which is the better . There another great question upon which the Chambers of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest money . We have to-day another question , and if business men would only speak when patriotism en ' ters into the question , and when it stands for the honor and dignity of our Republic , I for one am not afraid that we could not call to that standard , aid and sufficient members from both parties to make our decision final and conclusive . This Government stands to-day in a most humiliating position . A scheming , shifting speculator does not occupy a position more humiliating than the richest Government on the face of the earth . I say to Democrats and I say to Republicans , none of your Republicanism , none of your Democracy ; stand as Americans . What is our first duty ? Our first duty is to provide sufficient revenues for the best Government that ever blessed man . The ' United States Government to-day is being defrauded of one-third of its revenue . You have plenty of importations , but you do not receive the duties which you have levied upon them . We have made a mistake , We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could return to specific duties to-day , there would be no difficulty in the revenue . Whether we may venture to recommend that to the parties , I do not know . This I do believe , that President Cleveland is so honest a man and so anxious to do his duty as he sees it , that he would not exercise the veto over a measure such as I indicate , nor over any measure which c ? - .. /1.3 fairly be intended only t .. provide sufficient revenue , and not passed as party purposes . Regarding waterways , he said : Chicago is having the waters of Lake Michigan unite with the waters of the Mississippi . This union of the waters would benefit no particular part of this central zone more than any other part . If we had the waters of Lake Erie flowing into the Ohio River , this region would have 14.000 miles of navigable waterways . If we received your ore , you would in turn receive our &al; and coke . I am looking to a condition of affairs by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , and south , because you can manufacture here cheaper than you now do , and have access to the markets , with cheaper rates of transportation . Mr. Carnegie said further that he believed the zone of which Cleveland is the metropolis is destined to furnish the iron and steel products for universal use in the United States .
