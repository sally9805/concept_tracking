A few of those who were with us on the local issues of a State campaign have gone back to the Republicans , but they are , at least , fully offset by accessions we have made from the Republican ranks on tariff reform and other national issues . " There is great confidence among IowaDemocrate , and I bogeys we shall carry the State for Cleveland and Stevenson . " " What about the other States In the NorthTreat I " " I feel quite sanguine about Wisconsin . I have been in the State myself and have talked with the managers who are conducting the campaign there . They express no doubt whatever as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory in that State . The Repub . Roans themselves are not hopefut . " As regards Illinois . Judge Altegolt is practically sure of election , and vigorous and Intelligent work on the part of Democrats ought to secure the Electoral vote also . The campaign seems to be less advanced in Illinois than in some other States , and a great deal depends on what is done between now and election day . " " What about the People 's Party chances in the Northwest 3 " " I see no reason to doubt that Kansas will be carried for the People 's Party ticket by a considerable majority . Their prospects are almost equally good in Nebraska and Nevada , and the fusionists are very likely to carry Wyoming and Idaho . I do not believe the Republicans will get a vote in any of these States I should not be surprised , " Mr. Richardson continued , at a landslide that would carry the whole Northwest out of the Republican column . I do not say I expeot this , but there are indieations that the sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country as a whole , I have no doubt of Cleveland 's election . "
