I many a crew are greeted by the New London urchin , as , with bags in hand , they step from the New York train and group themselves together , waiting for the train to pull out from the station and allow them to cross to the wharf and board the cranky launch which , with steam up , is waiting to convey them to their quarters , four miles up the Thames . Some of them perchance have been there VOL . LXXXIX. - No. 530-19 ( &amp;* before , and to them the scenes are not new ; but , neverthele*s , they gaze about them , and over their faces comes a pained expression as they remember how Eli 's band led them down the course a little less than a year ago . When all are on board , the needleshaped launch backs away out into the stream , and then turns her bow up river towards the massive piers which support that triumph of human ingenuity over THE COACH . THE HARVARD AND YALE BOAT-RACE . OBSERVATIONS OF A HARVARD MAN . BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge , the connecting link between the Groton and New London shores . In a few moments the launch reaches the bridge , and as she pokes her nose by the piers , all those on board instinctively turn their eyes to the little point of land on the left shore , and tell each other that " there is the finish . " And then all eyes are turned up the river , and as they rest upon a gravel bank , way off in the distance , it hardly seems possible that the man who measured that course was accurate . Certainly there are no four miles in the country that are longer , or look longer . Soon the Navy-yard , one of the decaying relics of warlike times , is reached , and with a wide sweep to the left the launch makes for deeper water near the New London shore . The banks of the river are now rocky and wild . Occasionally a white painted cottage stands out from its green background of trees , but were it not for the railroad tracks which mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was about to steam into an unexplored channel . While beauty of nature is appreciated , it does not appeal , however , to those halfbrowned boys , who are looking but for one object , " Red Top , " their home for the next two weeks . In a short space of time the launch takes a swing to the right , and there , straight ahead , with its red roof flashing crimson rays against the bine sky , is Harvard 's boating home . Even in its loneliness there is a homelike air about the place . Closely sunggled against a rugged cliff , whose sides have been cruelly gnawed by the avaricious bridge-builder , it nevertheless has the dignity of being perched on a small bluff , and though it shares the limited space with a four-stoned cemetery , its broad welcoming piazza and wide open door completely take away the chilly sensation which the graveyard gives . With a bell to stop and two bells to GOING TO THE RACE . // back her , the embryo pilot of the Harvard launch brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw a rope to the " heeler " who stands ready to catch it . Scarcely does she touch the float when , one after the other , the crew pile out and greet the " subs , " who have been sent down earlier to make things ready . Then each one makes for the quarters , eager to have his section of the common bedroom allotted . The captain , of course , takes the captain 's room in the corner . Then the " veterans , " if there are any , take their old rooms if they want them , and the remainder are distributed as the captain thinks best , the subs , of course , being looked out for last , and generally getting the two cots near the chimney . But scarcely have all had a chance to unpack their flannel suits and arrange their belongings before the order is given to get ready for their first practice row on the Thames . So down the little pathway which leads to the boat-house they go , and almost in less time than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taken their places by the shell . Together they lift it gently and carry it out on the float . Then , all together , they drop it into the water . When each man is in his place the cockswaia gives his orders to push off and get under way . With a long , steady swing they fall to their work , and having taken a dozen strokes or so , they " let her run , " and rest on their oars . Half a mile up the river , on the same side as Red Top , they see a small cluster of houses with a flag-staff in front . But , as the Yale crew have not arrived , no large blue flag with a white " Y " in the centre graces the top of the staff . They know , however , that they will be there in a day or two , and it is with reluctance that they obey the order , " Eyes in the boat ! " And now the launch comes up with the coach perched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he speaks to the crew , calls upon them for their best efforts from now on until the race , and then sends them off down the river . Somehow the sweeps feel differently than they did in the sluggish water of the Charles , and as the crew feel the shell shoot along , they gather renewed interest and enthusiasm from the change , and buckle down to their work with renewed zeal . But the coach is merciless . Fault after fault he brings to their notice . Stretch after stretch he makes them row , and not until the shadows have crept from the banks and almost covered the entire river in darkness does he g4e the signal to return to the boat-house . With weary backs they lift their shell and carry it up the float . But a bucket of cold water and a brisk rub bring back their spirits , and the crew appetite asserts itself in loud cries for supper . What a supper they eat ! Chops , steak , toast , and milk disappear as if by magic , and not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rise from the table . Once fed , like animals , they long for sleep , and in spite of songs , banjo - playing , and rowing incidents , they wait mipatiently for ten o'clock to come , and the order , " All to bed 1 " Then for a few moments pandemonium is let loose . Because they can sleep they do not want to . The mystic initiation of the new members is gone through , pillows and water are thrown , and the commotion increases until all are in such a state of hysterical excitement that it requires sharp words on the part of the captain to restore order . When all is quiet , the captain blows out the last candle , and tells the crew that not a man shall rise until called in the morning . Thus it is generally with a crew the first night at New London . Afterwards , as the day of the race approaches , and the men become more ne*vous and irritable , they allow no one to deprive them of even a second 's rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chance to think the race over quietly to themselves . They rise the following morning at seven , take a short walk , and then are ready for breakfast . From eight until eleven their time is their own , and they pass it in reading , playing quoits , lounging on the piazza , or taking rambling walks through the woods back of the quarters . At eleven , or thereabouts , just as the morning breeze , which generally springa up about that time , is beginning to roughen the surface of the river , they get into the shell and begin their day 's work . The hot June sun redden s and blisters their shoulders , and causes them to long for the morning row to end . But they are kept at their work , and after a series of short rows they gradually become ac // H H 0 H L*J H H // customed to the heat and more contented . After an hour or so they return to the float , and in a few moments dinner is served . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some another . Perhaps one or two of them will jump into the skiff , and spend an hour fishing in the shade of the old wharf which projects into the river from the point below the boat-house . At four o'clock they again assemble , and from four to six , or even later , they are sent for long stretches down the course . When they return they are tired and hungry , and it requires a good supper to bring up their spirits . The evening , as usual , is passed in singing and chaffing one another , but all are glad when bedtime comes . The first excitement in their daily routine is the arrival of the Yale crew . They have been there but a day or two when one afternoon they see coming up the river the Yale launch , loaded well down to her water-line with a living freight of Yale men and coaches . As they pass the quarters they cheer their rivals , and in return the Harvard men dip the faded crimson flag , which in a listles* way has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give three times three for Yale . From now on the blue flag with the white " Y " in its centre waves from its staff , and the work of the substitutes begins . For it is the duty of the substitutes of each crew to keep an eye on their opponents . Let a man get into a shell from either float , and the fact is inunediately noted at the other . Let a crew start out , and there is work for the substitutes immediately . Off they are sent in the pair oar or singles , and are not allowed to return until they have followed and observed the crew from the beginning until the end of their row . Perhaps , instead of taking to the water , they run up or down the banks , and from some elevated point closely observe the crews , and count the number of strokes they are rowing to the minute . Often it happens that the substitutes of both crews meet at the same point of observation , and talk and chat with each other , exchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarters they are besieged with questions , and given to understand that if they can not see any better they had better pack up and go home . Upon them is ventilated all the irritableness of the crew . If they come back bringing the report that the other crew are rowing well , they are told that they do not know what good rowing is . If they report faults , they are told that they must have been cross-eyed : " they were not rowing that way when they started . " After a time they learn how to properly construct their reports , and interweave facts and fancies in a manner more acceptable to the crew , so their life becomes easier . It is the incidents of the life at New London which in after-years come back to one , and the enjoyment of race-week is not limited to the chosen few who represent the blue and the crimson . With a room at the Pequot , Fort Griswold , or Crocker House , the last week in June can be pleasantly passed listening to crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail swiftly in and drop anchors in the wide harbor which forms the outlet for the beautiful river which is to be the scene of the great struggle to come . It is great fuii to follow the crews . You seldom see them together , for when one go up the river the other go down , and vice versa . Occasionally , however , by accident they meet , and then you are confronted by a cat-and-dog situation . Both crews cease rowing and rest on their oars . Neither will make the first move , and so they sit and glare at each other . In vain the safety-valves on the launches give warning of too much pressure . Neither crew propose to give points on their rowing , and so they do not row . When , however , patience is almost exhausted , by the aid of the tide , or by rowing by pairs and fours , they become sufficiently separated , and are once more off in opposite directions . It is a beautiful sight to see one of the crack crews dip their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing , and shoot them out quickly for a fresh hold and stroke . Scarcely a splash can be seen , and the shell travels as steadily as though driven by some unseen power entirely independent of the eight men . The Gabriel voice of the cockswain , however , reminds you that , beautiful as is the sight , there is tyranny in the government of those grand specimens of niuscular development , and that they are but human , after all . " Watch your time , six ! " " What 's the matter with you , five ? " " Eyes in the boat , four ! " " Up ! " // " Shoot ! " And long after you can not make out the faces of the men you bear the exasperating cry which gives the beat to the stroke : " Up ! " " Shoot ! " Having seen the crews row , you compare their good points , and try to settle in your mind which one will surely win . And in the evening , at the hotel , you compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until your judgment is so disturbed that you give up trying to reach a conclusion , and confine your statements to guessing . As the day of the race approaches , there slowly gather at the different hotels a crowd of enthusiasts , many of whom have come miles to see the race . At the Crocker House you find a small army of newspaper men , quick on the scent of every item of interest in regard to the crew , and with them is always a small contingent of graduates , who love to talk over the races of other years , and compare this year s crews with last . The evening before the race , in their quarters up the river , the well- trained oarsmen gather together after supper and talk over the coming race . Anxiety is betrayed in faces and actions , and only frequent changes in position enable them to endure the suspense between supper and bedtime . Perbaps they try to sing or joke , but the songs lack enthusiasm as they ring out in the night air , and the jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how rhuch depends on their twenty-odd minutes of work on the morrow , and how horrible it will be if they should lose the race . All day long they have noted the preparations . Old graduates have visited them , wished them luck , and tried to cheer them up . The passing yachts have saluted them , and the gay parties on board have awakened their enthusiasm by cheers . There was excitement in every breath of wind , and instinctively they have partaken of the excitement , until every nerve in their bodies tingles . When finally bedtime comes , with one last look at the heavens to try in vain to determine the weather for the morning , they turn to their cots and try to sleep . But to many of them . sleep comes slowly . Over and over again they mentally row the race , win it , lose it , get ahead , break something and fall behind , until exhausted nature rebels , and they fall into a troubled sleep , to awaken in the morning feeling tired and exhausted . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is silent and still , at the boat-house all is activity and life . The last touches are being given to the preparation of the shell , which , resting upon its wooden horses , and vibrating slightly with each touch of the polisher 's hand , has a personality which only an old oarsman can appreciate . Note how the polish glistens with each flash of the lantern 's rays . It has taken hours of work to get it , and the faithful attendant goes over it and over it , until from stem to stern it shines like a mirror , and feels to the hand like the surface of glass . When finished it is perfect , and stands silently ready to do its share of the work . At New London things are different ; the town is one blaze of light , crowds throng the streets , venders and hawkers fill the square , and eager hackmen beseech each passer-by with , " Ride to the Pequot Housel " In the harbor , lights twinkle from the mast-heads of many crafts , and ever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them to come this way or that . At the Crocker House , a crowd surges in and out . Rooms are in demand . Everybody is excited . Bets are made . Drinks are taken . Chaos reigns . Until , late in the evening , the crowds thin out , and only here and there can be seen small knots of men who discuss , argue , and reason over the chances . It is early in the morning before the electric lights fall sadly and refiect.ively upon the weary clerk at the desk as he gazes at the empty lobby , and tells the sleepy bell-boy to rearrange the chairs and pick up the loose papers . It has been a wild evening , yet fun and good frolic have predominated , and only occasionally has some misguided youth made notable exhibition of his animal nature by drunken speech and incoherent language . If one goes to the Pequot House , a barrack-shaped building with rickety walls and several annexes , situated just where the New London shore turns its front to the Sound , one finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poorly cared-for driveway , which joins the New London road at an acute angle . From the road to the hotel stretch beautiful green lawns . The whole scene is one of great natural beauty mingled with traces of the interference and neglect of man . But everything is full of life there . // ONE OF THE WINNING CHEW . // The broad piazza is alive with people . Pretty maidens , lovely women , jolly matroris , sit , walk , and chatter with men in full dress or yachting suits . Through the open windows come the strains of music , and the lights thrown out on the lawns show groups of fellows whose gay laughing conversation plainly tells of the good time they are having . The anchorage-ground off the wharf is well illuminated with myriads of lights from the yachts , and small boats are continually passing to and fro , bringing parties to the shore . Every once in a while the scene about the hotel is enlivened by the arrival of parties from New London . With a song or a cheer they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greet old friends almost the first question is , " Who 'll win ? " and then they say , " Let 's adjourn . " Bright and early the next morning everybody is up and on the move . Carriages are engaged , tickets are bought , and arrangements made to see the race . Either crimson or blue is in every buttonhole , and the wearers are eager for the fun to begin . The yachts in front of the Pequot House weigh anchor , and either steam up themselves toward the bridge , or else are towed up by some friendly tug . They have got to get their positions in the lines . Every one is hurrying towards New London as a centre . At the wharves launches are continually coming in and backing out , some for pleasure , some on business connected with the race . Above the bridge the yachts are being anchored in two long lines , forming a lane through which in a few hours the two crews will pass . From the bowsprits to mast-heads , and from mast-heads to sterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk the decks and level glasses at every passing boat . Once in a while a cheer is heard , and horns and whistles give evidence of the excitement and noise to come . Every ripple on the water is noticed and scowled at , for every one dreads a postponement . Four miles up the river , at the quarters , it is as still and quiet as a village Sunday . A few men in bright-colored blazers and white duck trousers are scattered about , some looking at books , some talking with each other , but all keeping one eye on the weather and the condition of the water . In the boat-house the last finishing touches voL . LXXXIX. - No. 530-20 are being given to the rigging of the shells . Straps are tested , nuts are tightened , and lastly the round leather buttons on the sweeps are given a coating of lard to make them turn easily . In front of the boathouse the captain and coaches are haying a final uiiderstanding , and as they see the referee 's boat approach and hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all disappear . While they dress , through the window and cracks in the side of the boat-house they see a small fleet of steam-craft of all sizes and shapes come slowly up the river , and restlessly change their positions in the deep water to the eastward of the start . Then the breeze brings to their ears the sound of faint cheering , and coming up the railroad track on the other side of the river they see the observation train , with its tiers of seats crowded with people , all framed in by canopies of crimson or blue . Cold chills creep up and down their spines as they realize that the long-expected hour has at last arrived . They are glad when the orders are given to pick up the shell , carry her out , and put her into the water . Then , when they find themselves in their places , and feel the rough handle of the sweep in their grasp , the greater part of their nervousness vanishes , and with a last tug at their toe-straps they are ready to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry their way across the river , stealing occasionally a glance at their opponents , who are slowly rowing down . Then an order is given to keep their eyes in the boat , and they know that they are dangerously near the start . They drift by the starting-boat , and feel the hands of the boatman as he grasps the stern and holds it in position . Above and about them they hear an indistinct buzz of cheers and shouts , but their hearts beat so quickly that their eyes are half blurred , and they can with difficulty hold their gaze on the back of the man in front . At the word they quickly peel off their jerseys and pass them to the boatman . Then comes a time which tries the patience of all . They back her up a little , pull the bow round , then go out to the full reach . A second ; it is a year to each man in the shells . There is a horrible silence , then the " Are you ready ? Go ! " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader has ever handled a sweep in a *varsity race he will know how each man feels while he waits for . the start . // There he is with his feet firmly pressed against the stretcher , his knees slightly bent , and the blade of his sweep just covered with water . At the " Go ! " like a spring he uncoils , gives a short swing with his shoulders , a shove with his legs , tears his blade from the water , rushes forward , and digs the water again . Three strokes and there is headway ; a fourth , and he can feel the need of slower work and longer pulls . He hears nothing ; he sees nothing . His mind is a blank . There are a great throbbing in his head , an uncomfortable feeling about his stomach . His breath does not seem to come , right . " Oh dear ! " he thinks to himself , " I can never stand this . " But as the stroke lengthens , and the recover becomes slower , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable feeling vanishes , and the true work of the race begins . He now sees the man in front of him , and gathering all his wits about him , he watches his time , tries to move with him , thinks of a thousand things in a second , but principally he is interested as to where the other crew is . He knows soon enough . As he comes forward for a stroke he catches a glimpse out of the corner of his eye of a moving mass beside him on the water . They are there . " But we 're holding them , " he says to himself , and he shuts his teeth hard and puts more drive into his legs . " Half a mile , " shouts the cockswain . " Only half a mile ! " It seems as though he had been rowing for hours . " Why do n't we gain ? " These thoughts flash through his mind . But he pulls with his might . If he gains there comes to him slowly the knowledge that his crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped astern , and now as he comes forward he can see his opponents as they struggle to regain the space they have lost . The sight gives him courage , and he feels as strong as an ox . The race becomes interesting . He never rowed so well in his life . Not a muscle becomes tired . " One mile ! " shouts the cockswain . " Only three more , " he thinks to himself , and the time passes quickly until the next mile flag is reached . Then something happens which brings his heart into his mouth . His oar , as he shoots it out on the recover , strikes a wave , the handle twists in his grasp , and before he can control it the blade is the wrong way . He stops rowing , and wrenches his oar out of the water . The delay has enabled his opponents to catch up , and as he sees them his spirits fall . But quickly getting into the stroke , he makes up for what he has lost by pulling all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he knows he is gaining . Another mile , and he hears about him the cheers of the spectators on the decks of the yachts . A half-mile farther and he feels sure of the race . " Now , boys , " shouts the cockswain , " only a halfmile more . " Jove ! how he pulls ! and as nearer and nearer he gets to the finish , the more he sees and the more he hears . Cannon crash in his ear . Whistles and yells of delight are heard on all sides . Pulling a strong steady stroke , his crew swing along , and just before they cross the line they spurt to show what they can do . " Let her run ! " shouts the cockswain , and the race is over . Perhaps there are artists who can picture on canvas a face expressive of perfect happiness , but they can not give to a face an expression of perfect delight unless they have seen how a man looks who has won a university race . Let us go back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gaining , he loses . He no longer catches a glimpse of the moving mass beside him . There is a strange silence all about him . Spurt after spurt is called for . His arms and legs begin to grow heavy . The mist is coming back before his eyes . His breath feels hot and his mouth gets dry . " One mile ! " shouts the cockswain . " Only one he thinks to himself . " Now pick it up ! " He tries for a few strokes , pushes a little harder on his stretcher , and then he falls back into the weary way he was going . Now a pain comes in his side , and he has hard work to breathe . He has to row easier for a stroke or two . " Two miles ! " " You 're gaining ! " He rouses again , and makes another gallant effort , but it 's useless . " Will the race never end ? " " Three miles ! " " Is that all ? " He now begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , and looming up over the cockswain s head he sees the referee 's boat , closely followed by a small fleet of steamers . Everything appears to haul him back . He has the sensation as though he was rowing up hill . A buzzing commences in his ears , his arms grow heavier , and when at length the finish-line is crossed he drops his sweep , and slipping back against the // knees of the man behind him , he rests his weary body , while sob after sob shakes his frame . In a few moments , however , severe as has been his struggle , he finds his strength coming back , and he wonders why he did not pull harder . But how does the race appear to the spectator ? Perhaps he is fortunate enough to have a chance to watch it from a launch . If he is , he finds himself at the start on the other side of the river from the crews for the water is too shallow the first halfmile of the course to allow a launch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching from a distance . He sees the Yale crew coming slowly down the river , then the Harvard crew leave the float and paddle across . Now the two crews are together near the bank . The referee 's boat gets as close as possible . After a little manceuvring he notices that the two crews are opposite each other , man for man . Then he sees their arms wave as they strip off the jerseys . There is a moment or two of delay . Then a shout is heard from the observation train , clouds of spray rise on both sides of the crews , and he knows they have started . How quickly the men move ! The shells fairly jump . In a few seconds , however , the splashing has stopped , and the blades begin to linger in the water . Long powerful strokes have taken the place of the short drives which were used at the start . As one crew come forward the other go back . The crews seesaw with each other , but the cockswains travel steadily along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exciting ? Just a trifle . The spectator feels as though he were rowing himself , and he inwardly wishes he was . Bow and bow the two crews pass the first half-mile flag . The launch approaches nearer , and crossing behind the crews , it follows the race a little in the rear , but just enough to one side to give a good view of the crews . Both crews have settled down to their best rowing . How grandly the men pull ! The brown backs rise and fall with clocklike precision . Even at a distance  --  the straining muscles can be seen to contract as the blades take the water . And when the drive with the legs puts still more of a strain upon those broad backs and strong arms , their muscles stand out like tightened whip-cords . Now slowly but surely one crew creep ahead . Gradually the cockswain in one shell gets opposite the stroke oar in the other . There he balances for a time , first a little ahead , then a little behind , then by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the next man-number seven . Here the same scene is repeated , and so on up the shell , until by good rowing his crew pull him clean ahead , and the observer can see the space between the crews grow wider and wider . But from the Nt*vy-yard the launch has to take a position more directly behind , and no longer can he see by just how much one crew lead . He gets a stern view of the crews , and can only observe the blades rise , skim the water , then disappear from sight . Now the men in the losing crew begin to get tired . The pace is too hot for them , and they slowly lose their form and move raggedly . The blades no longer take the water together ; they tumble in one after the other , and splashing commences . There are generally one or two men in the crew who stand out from the others , and call attention to themselves by their pallor , by the wabbly way in which they row . Every moment it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they keep on , and your heart goes out to them as you see them make effort after effort to sit up and pull harder . The losing shell is driven slower and slower . The referee 's boat and the steamers and launches find it difficult to keep from running it down . They slow up a little , and become so crowded together that collisions seem inevitable . Their occupants become alarmed , and to the excitement of the race is added the excitement of the actual danger . But the skilled pilots keep clear of each other , and steer on down the river . The two crews are now in the lane between the yachts . As they pass them , from the deck of each one a puff of smoke rises , a report is heard , and soon the smoky haze settles down over the struggling men , and the banks echo and re-echo with cheers whistles , and explosions . Under cover of the friendly smoke the last crew crosses the line and the race is finished .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
