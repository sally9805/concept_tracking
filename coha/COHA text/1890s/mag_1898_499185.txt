BY R. 0 . CROWLEY , Formerly Electrician of the Torpedo Division , C. S. N. ORGANIZATION AND FIRST EXPERIMENTS . the outbreak of the war , one of the most pressing needs of the Confederacywas some effective method of defending its water approaches , especially the James River , leading direct to Richmond , its capital city . The South had no ships of war , and the few old-fashioned brick-and-mortar forts located here and there were mostly armed with smooth-bore iron cannon , relics of a past age , and rusty from neglect . To look back now , it seems wonderful how very defenseless we were at the start , and how apparently easy it would have been for a single second-class war vessel to have steamed up to Richmond in the early days of the conflict . For the defense of the rivers men 's minds turned toward torpedoes , which were then but little known in the military world . Scores of plans were submitted to the War and Navy departments , some advocating mechanical torpedoes ,  --  - that is , those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuously urging electrical torpedoes . Those generally intended for use on land naturally fell into the hands of the War Department , while electrical torpedoes for use under water came within the province of the Navy Department . It is of the latter class that this article treats . The idea of using torpedoes on the Confederate side originated , I believe , with the Hon. S. R. Mallory , Secretary of the Navy ; and he directed the distinguished Captain M. F. Maury to make experiments , with a view to their general employment , if practicable . His work began in the spring of 1862 , and continued for a few months only with electrical torpedoes . He had arrived at no definite conclusion from his experiments when he was despatched on an important mission to Europe , where he continued to make experiments in electricity applicable to torpedo warfare , discovering an ingenious method of arranging and testing torpedo mines . The fact that there was no practical 290 result from his experiments in the South was due simply to the want of time to organize his forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no system of torpedoes ; indeed , they did not consider it " honorable warfare . " They had no necessity for submarine defenses , because early in the war we had no ships to attack them . Frequent reports reached us that they intended to hang or shoot any man they should capture who was engaged in the torpedo business . It was , therefore , a very risky business on our part , as we were constantly exposed to capture . As some slight security against being summarily executed by the Federals , in the event of my being captured , I was furnished with a document from our Navy Department , which read as follows , as near as I can remember : The bearer , R. 0 . Crowley , is in the service of the Confederate States Navy as electrician ; and in case of his capture by the United States forces , he will be exchanged for any general officer of their army who may be in our hands . ( Signed ) S. R. MALLORY , Approved . Secty. of the Navy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always carried on my person , although I had no great confidence in its efficacy . The experiments made under the supervision of Captain Maury consisted of placing a series of hollow spherical shells of iron , containing about fifty pounds of powder , and extending across the bottom of the river , and connecting them electrically by insulated copper wires leading to galvanic batteries on shore . Inside these shells fuses were placed , which were to be ignited by the passage of an electric current through a fine platinum wire . It was confidently expected that the simultaneous explosion of these shells under a passing vessel would instantaneously destroy the vessel and all on board . Experiments soon demonstrated , however , that fifty pounds of powder in from ten to fifteen feet of water would scarcely do any harm ; and very soon the whole plant was entirely disarranged , // the wires broken , and the shells lost , by a heavy freshet in the river . Captain Maury was succeeded by Lieutenant Hunter Davidson , and it was at this timethat the writer was appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board a small but swift steam-tug called the Torpedo , and two Parrott rifles were put aboard of her for emergencies . In the cabin of this little steamer we studied , planned , and experimented for months with various fuses , galvanic batteries , etc. , and finally we determined on a system . Our first object was to prepare a sensitive fuse of fulminate of mercury , to be exploded by the incandescence of fine platinum wire by means of a quantity current of electricity . We succeeded in this , and our fuses were made by taking a piece of quill , half an inch long , and filling it with fulminate of mercury . Each end of the quill was sealed with beeswax , after fixing a fine platinum wire through the center of the quill and connecting the protruding ends of the platinum wire with insulated copper wire . Enveloping the fuse was a red-flannel cartridge-bag stuffed with rifle-powder . The fuse , thus prepared , was ready to be placed in a torpedo-tank containing cannon-powder . I have been thus particular in describing the fuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our torpedo-tanks were made of half-inch boiler iron . There was an opening to pour in the powder and to receive the fuse . The opening was then fitted with a screw-plug , in which there were two holes for the passage of the wires , and packed with greased cotton waste to prevent leakage of water to the inside . There was a heavy ring by which the tank was slung into position , and through this ring was passed a heavy iron chain attached to a mushroom anchor about twenty feet distant . These tanks were generally manufactured at the rrredegar Ironworks , and subjected to a heavy hydraulic pressure to show any leaks or defects . Before we decided on the shape of the tank we prepared some ordinary copper soda-water tanks , capable of holding about one hundred to one hundred and fifty pounds of powder , and anchored them floating midway between the bottom of the river and the surface of the water . It was soon found , however , that , owing to their oscillating rotary motion , the electric wires became twisted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such floating tanks spent half their explosive force downward , and that copper was too soft to allow a fierce tearing power to the confined gases . We experimented a long time with tanks of various sizes , and at various depths of water , and finally decided that a tank containing two thousand pounds of cannonpowder was sure to destroy utterly a ship of any size at a depth of not more than thirty feet . To give some idea of the many difflcultiea we encountered , I will mention , first , the scarcity of cannon-powder ; secondly , we had only about four miles of insulated copper wire in the entire Confederacy ; thirdly , we could obtain only about four or five feet of fine-gage platinum wire . Battery material was very scarce , and acids could be purchased only from the small quantity remaining in the hands of druggists when the war broke out . In the autumn of 1862 we planted three of these copper torpedoes , each containing one hundred and fifty pounds of powder , in the Rappahannock River , below Port Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Our plans , however , were disclosed to the enemy by a negro , and no attempt was made to steam over the torpedoes . In December of that year , when Burnside was about to attack at Fredericksburg , it was deemed prudent to abandon our station near Port Royal , to avoid being cut off if the Federal army should succeed iii making Lee retreat . To this end , I was instructed to proceed without delay to Port Royal , to save all the wire possible , and bring off our galvanic batteries and other material . This was a hazardous undertaking , as our station wa* outside the Confederate lines , and the enemy was in strong force on the opposite bank of the Rappahannock . In pursuance of orders , I arrived at the station about sunset one evening , and after making due preparations for the transportation of our men and material , the galvanic battery was charged and the circuit closed , and a tremendous explosion took place , throwing up large ' columns of water , and arousing the inhabitants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not get inside our lines until near daybreak the next morning , being much delayed by the muddy roads.1 Such was the con 1 On arriving at Milford depot , on the Fredericksburg Railroad , next day , I found immense numbers of sick and wounded soldiers retreating from Fredericksburg toward Richmond . I boarded the ambulance-train myself , in company with a lieutenant of engineers belonging to General Lee 's staff , on his way to the War Department at Richmond , // sternation of the few inhabitants of Port Royal at hearing the explosion , that the town was immediately deserted , and I understood that about forty persons slept that night in a small log hut on a hill about two miles distant . OPERATIONS ON THE JAMES RIVER . HAVING our system now perfected , we established a torpedo station , some five or six miles below Richmond , by submerging two iron tanks , containing one thousand pounds of powder each , in twelve feet of water , leading the wires ashore , and connecting them with a galvanic battery concealed in a small hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were led to an elevated position near by , where the man in charge could keep a lookout for passing vessels . The position of the torpedoes in the water was indicated by two sticks , planted about ten feet apart on the bluff , and in a line with each other and the torpedoes ; and the watchman 's instructions were to explode them by contacting the wires as soon as an enemy 's vessel should be on a line with the two pointers . All this being prepared , we awaited the approach of a Federal gunboat . As was usually the case , one came when least expected , on a beautiful clear day , when our entire force except the man stationed as lookout was absent in Richmond , preparing other war material . We were apprised by telegraph of the rapid approach of the gunboat , and immediately hastened toward our first station ; but we arrived too late . The man in charge had not seen the United States flag for a long period , and never having previously seen a gunboat so near , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1000-pound powdertanks when the gunboat was at least twenty to thirty yards distant . A great explosion took place , throwing up a large column of water to a considerable height ; and the gunboat by her momentum plunged into the great trough , and caught the downward rush with plans of General Lee 's intended route in the event of his being forced from Fred&amp;ricksburg . When our train arrived at Ashland , we found the village in possession of Colonel Kilpatrick , of the Federal cavalry , who immediately summoned everybody to surrender and get off the train , which was then demolished and the engine run off the track . Here was a predicament , and I thought that the time had perhaps arrived when it would become necessary for me to show my document signed by Secretary Mallory . But , upon reflection , I concluded to keep as quiet as possible ; so I went up to Colonel Kilpatrick , and said : " Colonel , what shall you do with citizens ? " " Nothing , " said he ; " you may stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were broken away , half a dozen men were thrown overboard , and other damage to the gunboat was caused . The steamer then turned about as quickly as she could , and prepared to retrace her route down the river , after picking up the men who had been washed overboard . There was a brilliant opportunity to accomplish her total destruction by firing the remaining torpedo as she passed back over it . But alas ! the man had been so astounded at the first explosion that he had fled precipitately , without waiting to see what damage had been done , and the gunboat was thus enabled to return down the river in safety . The partial success of this attempt at exploding torpedoes by electricity immediately established the reputation of the Torpedo Division , and created great excitement all over the South , it being an undisputed fact that but for this explosion a Federal gunboat would have been moored at the wharf at Richmond that morning , and would have captured the city . A description of the defenses of the James River would be incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The river here is very narrow and deep . The right bank is a high , precipitous bluff , and the left low , flat land , so that the fort on the bluff commanded a wide sweep of country . The barricade was formed by driving piles , and then making square cribs of them , with the interior filled with broken granite , of which there were large quantities at Richmond . These cribs were stretched across the river in an irregular line , and were exposed a little at low tide . Between the cribs several steamboats and schooners were scuttled and sunk . No direct passage was left open , even for our own vessels , except a very labyrinthine route on the left bank , just large enough for small tugboats . When the time came for our own irondads to pass down the river , the Torpedo Division was sent to break up some of the cribs by exploding torpedoes on the top aside . " " All right , " I replied , and immediately vanished in the background . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my friend the lieutenant , and also the aide-de-camp of the Governor of Virginia , who happened to be on the train with a large amount of money belonging to the State , which he was taking to Richmond ! The next day I started for Richmond on foot , the railroad bridges and tracks having been destroyed by the Federals . We found their cavalry all along the route , even up to the very fortifications , which they could easily have entered , with scarcely any resistance . // of them . In this manner a passage sufficiently wide was effected without damage to the remaining cribs . The barricade was left in such a shape that it could thereafter be quickly reconstructed so as to close the passage entirely . Blowing up these cribs was great fun for our party , besides affording us practice in experiments . Numbers of fine fish were stunned by each explosion , and , floating to the surface , were speedily captured by us . There were no other barricades in the James River of any magnitude during the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels at Howlett 's Reach , but it was not considered effective . In fact , the main reliance on the barricades was that they would prevent a surprise movement by the enemy at night ; and it was not believed that the one at Drewry 's Bluff would do more than hold a determined enemy at bay for a few hours , while the shore batteries on the bluff could be pouring plunging shot on the decks of attacking vessels . Immediate steps were now taken to establish other torpedo stations at several points lower down the river , using in every instance 2000-pound torpedoes . At our lowest telegraph station , which was located on General Pickett 's Turkey Island plantation , opposite Presque Isle , we erected a lookout tower , about one hundred feet high , from which the Federal gunboats at City Point could be seen distinctly . At Presque Isle we stationed a scout whose duty it was to signal the man in the tower when anything suspicious occurred . Presque Isle is only a short distance from Bermuda Hundred , which is near City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Deep Bottom , about five miles above City Point by land , but more by water . As there were a good many free negroes in the vicinity of Deep Bottom , we had to do ocr work with great secrecy , generally planting the torpedoes at night , in a position previously surveyed by day . At Deep Bottom we located the galvanic battery on the right bank of the river , in a pit about four or five feet deep , the top covered over with twigs and brush , and in another pit , some distance off , a place was prepared for the lookout ; this pit was also concealed by twigs and brush . We were duly advised of the advance of General Butler 's army from Bermuda Hundred toward Drewry 's Bluff , the entire Federal fleet also advancing up the river , covering his right wing . The Federals had been told by the negroes that there were torpedoes at Deep Bottom , and used great caution in advancing . As soon as the fleet rounded the point below Presque Isle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolished ; but no one was hurt , as our men took away the telegraph instruments , and rapidly retreated up the river road . A force of marines was landed on both sides of the river , in order to discover the whereabouts of our batteries . A squadron of boats , heavily armed , went in advance of the fleet , dragging the river for wires and torpedoes . Their grapuels , however , passed over and over our wires , without producing any damage , our lookout , from his concealed station in the pit , noting all the movements of the men in the boats , and hearing every word of command . After a while the Federal commander , apparently satisfied that there were no torpedoes there , ordered the Commodore Jones , a double-ender gunboat carrying eight guns and manned by a force of two hundred men , to move up to Deep Bottom , make a landing , and report . This was done , the gunboat passing over our torpedoes ; but our man in the pit kept cool , and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to destroy the ironclad Atlanta , recently captured by the Federals from us near Savannah , Georgia . The Commodore Jones steamed up to the wharf at Deep Bottom , and found our quarters desert*d . This looked suspicious , and the order was then given for her to fall back . Our man now concluded that the entire fleet would retire , and he determined to destroy the Commodore Jones . As she retreated she passed immediately over one of the two torpedoes planted there . All at once a terrific explosion shattered her into fragments , some of the pieces going a hundred feet in the air . Men were thrown overboard and drowned , about forty being instantly killed . The whole Federal fleet then retreated some distance below . The Federal marines on shore continued their explorations , and our man in the battery-pit suddenly jumped out , and was as suddenly killed by a shot from the marines . The small boats again began dragging for our wires , and finally caught them , and by underrunning them to the shore at length discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken prisoner and carried on board one of the vessels composing the fleet . He was subsequently imprisoned at Fort Warren , but about a year afterward was exchanged . Both he and his assistant , when taken aboard the fleet , were securely // placed in a conspicuous position on the wheel-house of a double-ender gunboat , - the foremost vessel ,  --  in order , as they were told , that if any further explosion took place they should share the consequences . Thus was accomplished at one blow , and almost as quick as lightning , the complete destruction of a war steamer by submarine torpedoes . So far as I know , it was the first instance of the kind in the annals of war . Its effect astonished the world , and its immediate result was the safety of Richmond from a second peril . General Butler , finding his army completely uncovered on the right wing , was unable to accomplish anything by land , and retired to Bermuda Hundred . Shortly afterward the land forces again advanced , and compelled us to abandon all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busily engaged in perfecting our system of submarine defenses , making it necessary that we should have unobstructed navigation of the river , some mechanical torpedoes were planted , under the direction of army officers . As these were entirely unreliable as to certainty of explosion or contact , and were as dangerous to us as to the enemy , our chief , upon being advised of it , demanded their removal . The Secretary of War gave a reluctant assent to his demand that we should drag them up and put them out of harm 's way . There was not much accord between the army and the navy in those days , however ; and we were not fully advised in the premises , as will be shown herein . The steamer A. H. Schultz , formerly used as a passenger-steamer between Richmond and Norfolk , and commanded by Captain D. J. Hill , was at the outbreak of the war laid up as useless at the wharf in Richmond . Later she was taken possession of by the Confederate government for the purpose of transporting prisoners to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange . One day she started down the river , having on board four hundred and fifty Federal prisoners . She passed the barricades at Drewry 's Bluff safely , and landed her prisoners at Varina , where they were duly turned over to the Federal authorities , and it was expected that she would then bring back to Richmond a like number of exchanged Confederates ; but owing to some misunderstanding on the part of the commissioners of exchange , no Confederates were brought up by the Federals to Varina , so she was obliged to start on her return to Richmond . When she reached a point just below the barricades at the bluff , she came in contact with one of these mechanical torpedoes , placed there by army officers , and an explosion followed , killing two firemen and two Confederate soldiers . The steamer sank in five minutes , and was a total loss . On the downward trip the torpedo probably swung down-stream with the strong current , and for this reason the steamer did not come in contact with the percussion fuse ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current , offered a fair mark for the steamer 's hull coming up . It was a most fortunate thing for the South that the Schultz did not strike the torpedo on her downward trip , as the Federals , most of whom were just from the hospitals , and in a weak and sickly condition , would probably all have been drowned , and universal condemnation would have fallen upon the destruction of four hundred and fifty prisoners under a flag of truce . OPERATIONS NEAR WILMINGTON , NORTH CAROLINA . NOTHING more of consequence took place on the James River , and we were transferred to Wilmington , North Carolina , to defend Forts Fisher and Caswell , at the mouth of the Cape Fear River , from any attempt of the Federal fleet to pass the forts . Here we were confronted with a new difficulty-that of laying torpedoes in the sea , in a wide channel ; and our resources in the matter of copper wire and battery material were getting very scarce . We had plenty of cannonpowder only . The channel in front of Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bar , over which it was necessary for a vessel to pass to enter the channel , there was scarcely room for more than one or two ships to pass at a time . We first planted in the regular channel near the bar seven torpedo-tanks , each containing two thousand pounds of powder . It was thought that at least one of these would be covered by a vessel in passing ; and w* knew from experience that if one vessel was destroyed by the explosion of a torpedo , no other vessel would dare to renew the attempt . Of the electric wires , one from each torpedo connected it with a wire leading to one end of the battery , which was located in a bomb-proof comprising a part of the fortifications ; another wire led from each torpedo to the opposite end of the battery , and hung disconnected until desired to be exploded . All these wires were intrenched in the sand // from the shore-line to the battery . These latter wires were numbered from 1 to 7 , and sights were placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time we received a supply of wire , acids , battery , and electrical appliances through the blockade from Europe , and we intended to plant a torpedo right on the bar , the entrance there being very narrow . Everything was prepared for it ; but the appearance of the Federal fleet put an end to the attempt , so we had to rest contented with the seven already planted . Among the apparatus received from Europe was a lot of Wheatstone exploders and Abels fuses . With these we hastily prepared several copper tanks of a capacity of one hundred pounds of powder , and planted them about three feet deep in the sand on the land side of the fort , about three hundred yards in front , and led the wires in trenches to the traverses of the fort . This was done in expectation of an assault by the Federal land forces . The Federal fleet , however , proceeded to bombard that angle of the fort , and one by one our guns on that side were demolished . At the same time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in front , had utterly destroyed all our wires , so that the plan of exploding the 100-pound tanks on shore failed entirely . The result of the bombardment of Fort Fisher is well known . No attempt was made to pass our batteries until the fort was in the hands of the Federals . As in former instances , our plans were betrayed . One or two nights before the attack , the writer was up at a very late hour , talking to his assistant about our preparations , plans , etc. , in a room of a building occupied in part by the midshipmen and officers of the naval squadron doing land duty in Fort Buchanan , which commanded that part of the channel nearest the Cape Fear River . Our conversation was fully overheard by one of the ordinary seamen in the next room , who deserted in a boat that night , and went to the Federal fleet . But for the intelligence conveyed by this deserter , it is believed that the Federals would have made an attempt to pass our land batteries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two submarine batteries of one thousand pounds of powder each , connected by electric wires with a Wheatstone exploder located in an old earthwork on the bank of the river . During a heavy thunderstorm the wires were struck by lightning , and both tanks exploded simultaneously , damaging nothing , but frightening the fleet , and causing great watchfulness in their slow advance toward Wilmington . The Cape Fear River could be entered by two channels , one leading up to Fort Caswell , and thence via Fort Campbell into the river , and the other leading up to Fort Fisher and via Fort Buchanan into the river . The first-n*imed route , via Fort Caswell , or the " old inlet , " as it was called , was entirely undefended by submarine torpedoes , and probably would have been easy to turn with a small ironclad , as the two forts there were old brick-and-mortar constructions armed with old-fashioned smooth-bore guns ; but the channel-way was comparatively shallow and tortuous . The other route , via Fort Fisher , was more commonly used by the blockade-runners , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the fort . I have previously noted the great scarcity of materials . To get up a battery without glass tumblers to hold the acid , and without platinum strips to immerse in the nitric acid , was a great difficulty . There was no glass manufactory in the South . Platinum strips could not be obtained . The only platinum suitable for that purpose was being used in the batteries in the telegraph offices . I finally arranged a battery as follows : with the zinc plates formerly used in the Wollaston battery in our early experiments , I had a number of zinc cells cast in the shape of an ordinary glass tumbler , having a projecting arm for a handle as well as to connect it with the next adjoining cell in the series . The inside of these zinc tumblers was amalgamated with mercury , and a solution of sulphuric acid , composed of one part of acid and thirteen parts of water , was poured into each tumbler or cell . In this solution was placed a cylindrical porous cup , open at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitric acid was immersed a piece of castiron having four projecting leaves and a projecting handle connected with a corresponding handle of the adjoining zinc cell by an ordinary brass clamp . It would appear , at a casual glance , that the nitric acid would almost instantly consume this cast-iron strip ; but it did not , and we found that it would remain several hours without perceptible change , and then the nitric acid would become changed into probably a nitrous oxide gas , and effervesce suddenly . It was necessary , then , only to refill the porous cup with fresh , pure nitric acid . The composition of this battery had been suggested to the // writer 's mind from having seen , several years previously , a similar battery used by a Dr. Boynton , a public lecturer , to produce electrical phenomena . This battery , as will be observed from its construction , would stand a great deal of rough usage . Its electrical heating-power was great , but its electromotive force was not sufficient to produce heat at a greater distance than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torpedo Division proper were confined principally to the James and the Cape Fear rivers . Our force was small , though sufficiently elastic to have extended to other points if we had had the necessary materials . It comprised the officer in charge , the electrician and his assistant , two men at each station , two or three telegraph operators , one or two scouts , and the crew of a tugboat , commanded by an executive officer-in all , about fifty men . Of the men at the stations , one was usually either a boatswain or a master in the navy , and the other a young man as a relief , generally a man who was incapacitated from doing active duty as a soldier in the field . Submarine torpedoes containing powder could not be effectively used in the Mississippi River , principally on account of its great depth , varying from twenty to one hundred and fifty feet , the immense volume of water to be lifted offering too much resistance . It would not do to calculate the weight of a perpendicular column of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this connection , because powder , exploding equally in all directions , has a tendency to lift a column conically shaped-that is to say , with a lower diameter of about four or five feet and a diameter at the surface of from twenty to thirty feet . To lift a column sufficiently strong in its upward ascent to crush the hull of a passing vessel in water one hundred feet deep would require such an immense quantity of powder as to make it virtually impossible to handle it . Again , the bed of the Mississippi River is continually varying by the unceasing deposit of accumulations of soil caused by the caving in of its precipitous bluffs , so that a torpedo , when planted in some localities , would in a few months be covered by an immense sand-bar , and thus the effect of an explosion would be deadened . Submerged floating torpedoes , anchored in the channel of a swift current like the Mississippi , could not be depended on to maintain their position very long , and , as has already been ex plained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oscillating rotary motion . These objections-that is , the depth of the water and the difficulty of handling a large quantity of powder-do not , of course , apply in their entirety to guncotton torpedoes , which , being several times stronger than powder , and occupying much less space , could be used in many places to much more advantage . Guncotton is also much safer to manipulate than powder . One does not absolutely know when powder will explode accidentally , but guncotton can not possibly explode , if kept moist with water to a certain degree , except by means of a detonating fuse of fulminate or other quick-flame material . But I am wandering from the subject . Guncotton was not practically known as an explosive during the war . It is only the breaking or crushing of the hull of a vessel by the upheaving force of a column of water which makes torpedoes so destructive . It is not the flames of powder , or its suffocating or burning gases , which produce the awful death , in many instances , of all on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward by the weight of the water , crushing everybody between decks , and instantaneously sinking the craft , and drowning those who are carried down by the rapid sinking of the wreck . An ironclad is more quickly and easily destroyed than any other class of vessel , for the reason that such an immense weight of metal armor carries down to the bottom everybody between decks the instant the hull is shattered by a torpedo , th' heavy weight of the iron armor above causing the hull to oppose a more inert resistance to the upheaval of the water underneath , I believe several instances occurred in Southern rivers , during the war , where wooden vessels , coming in contact with mechanical torpedoes containing only a small quantity of powder , were simply lifted out of the water at the bows , without serious injury to the hull . A review of the facts and experience here stated shows that a system of *ubmarine defenses , to be effectual , should be protected by a small fortification and a land force sufficient to repel any attack by infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying the wires on shore , and , in addition to these , by a powerful electric-light reflector to light up the position at night ; and the defenses should have one or two small steam-launches with a Gatling gun on board , and apparatus for striking the enemy 's vessels with a spar torpedo while engaged in // an attempt to drag for the wires under the water . Since the late war science has developed many iruprovements in this direction , but none that will prevent the passage of a land fortification by a swift iron-clad man-ofwar except submarine torpedoes . OFFENSIVE TORPEDO WARFARE . So far we had been acting on the defensive , and the torpedoes described might be called defensive torpedoes . It was now determined to apply offensive torpedoes ; if the enemy would not come to us to be blown up , we would go to them . The first thing to be done was to prepare a fuse which was not dangerous to handle , and which would explode quickly on contact with any substance . To this end we made some sheet-lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the other part . These tubes were about three inches long and one inch in diameter . Into this tube was inserted a small glass tube , of similar shape , filled with sulphuric acid , and hermetically sealed . The vacant space about the glass tube was then tightly packed with a mixture of chlorate of potash and pulverized white sugar , and the mouth of the lead tube was closed by fastening a strip of muslin over it . Now , if the rounded end of the leaden tube is brought into contact with any hard substance , the thin lead will be mashed , the interior glass tube broken , and the sulphuric acid becoming mixed with the preparation of chlorate of potash and sugar , an immediate explosion is the result . We then prepared a copper cylinder capable of containing about fifty pounds of powder , and placed several of the leaden fuses in the head , so that no matter at what angle the butt struck the hull of a ship , one of the fuses would be smashed in , and flame from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the copper cylinder there was a socket made to fit on the end of a spar . We discussed the matter of exploding spar torpedoes by electricity , but the difficulty of arranging a contrivance to close the electric circuit when the torpedo came in contact with the hull of a ship , and want of conveniences for stowing a galvanic battery in the launch , induced us to adopt the fuses above mentioned instead . This was a formidable weapon , and one extremely dangerous to handle . We first experimented with an empty cylinder fitted with leaden fuses . The copper cylinder was fastened to a spar attached to the bow of a small steam-launch . Thus prepared , we " rammed " an old bulkhead , or wharf , at Rocketts , in the lower part of Richmond , at first unsuccessfully . We then tried it loaded with twenty-five pounds of powder , and , lowering the spar torpedo about two feet under water , again rammed the bulkhead . The effect of the explosion shattered the old wharf and threw up a column of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our steam-launch , or " torpedo launch , " as it was called , was prepared for an expedition against the enemy 's fleet snugly anchored off Newport News . Just at this time a new difficulty presented itself . The launch burned bituminous coal , the smoke from which could be discerned at a long distance , and the sparks from which at night would disclose its presence to an enemy . Some one suggested that we might obtain anthracite coal by dredging at the wharves and in the docks at Richmond . This was accordingly done , and we obtained a supply of the anthracite , for which an almost fabulous sum was paid . Our launch was about twenty feet long , about five feet beam , and drew three feet of water . She was fitted with a small double engine amidships , and there was sufficient space in her bow for three men , and aft for an engineer , who also acted as fireman . An iron shield was then fixed on her , completely covering the men from plunging rifle-shots . Thus equipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the James River , on a dark night , to a point about ten or fifteen miles below City Point , and then let her go on her dangerous mission . There were only four persons on board of her , namely , the commanding officer , a mate , a pilot , and an engineer . From reports afterward made , we learned that she steamed down toward Newport News until the approach of daylight , and then hid in a swamp until the next night , when the attempt was made to blow up the U. S. S. Minnesota , then the flag-ship of the Federal fleet , and the largest war vessel in the Union service . The launch steamed all through the fleet that night , being frequently challenged by the deck lookouts . Finally the Minnesota was seen looming up grimly in the darkness , and , letting down the spar torpedo in the water , the launch rammed the ship just below the water-line on her starboard quarter . The effect was terrific , the shock causing // the Minnesota to tremble from stem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big hole was opened in her side by the explosion of the 50-pound torpedo . Owing to the strong tide prevailing at the time , and the violence of the ramming , the launch perceptibly rebounded , so that at the instant of the explosion , which was not simultaneous with the blow , a cushion of water intervened between the torpedo and the hull of the Minnesota , thus weakening the effect and probably saving the ship . She was so thoroughly disabled , however , as we afterward understood , that she had to be towed off , and underwent repairs in the docks . Our men were greeted with showers of bullets from the deck of the ship , but they struck harmlessly against the iron shield of the launch , which quickly steamed away under cover of darkness , and escaped . This , I believe , was the first instance of successful ramming with torpedoes and the subsequent escape of the attacking crew , most other cases happening subsequently resulting in the death or capture of the attacking party . The effect of this daring attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was necessary to double the watches and exercise untiring vigilance against any further attempts . During the last year of the war.arrangements had been perfected to secure a large quantity of insulated wire , cables , acids , batteries , and telegraph apparatus , etc. , from England , an officer having been sent there for that purpose . Every material requisite for the extension of our torpedo system throughout the entire South was obtained , and a small advance shipment did actually reach us through the blockade at Wilmington . The remainder was put on board a swift steamer , with the intention of running the blockade and returning with a full cargo of cotton ; but from stress of weather , or other causes , the steamer put into the port of Fayal , and , as I understood , was wrecked in that port , either from the stupidity of the pilot or from treachery . The entire cargo was lost , and it was impossible to duplicate our material before the war ended . TORPEDO OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR . PERHAPS there is no harbor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries as that of Charleston . All the requisite accessories for a successful defense by this method exist in a remarkably favorable condition . The main ship-channel passes toward the city , between Morris Island on the one side , and Sullivan 's Island on the other , with Fort Sumter between the two islands . Each of these points offers sure protection to galvanic batteries , and each is capable of being made the central point of independent systems . The submerged battery wires radiating from each position could not be destroyed by dragging in the daytime without coming under fire of the land batteries , and with the aid of calcium lights thrown on the position at night , any attempt at dragging would be extremely hazardous . Besides these natural advantages , the depth of water is not too great for effective explosions . As previously stated in this paper , we were without the necessary material to extend our system to Charleston harbor ; besides , the exigencies of the situation at Richmond and Wilmington were too pressing to permit us to think of Charleston . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay torpedoes in the harbor , and a large one was planted in the main channel , the wires being led into Fort Sumter . On April 7 , 1863 , the Federal fleet commanded by Admiral Du Pont moved up the channel northward toward Sullivan 's Island , the frigate Ironsides in advance , followed by the ironclad Keokule and the wooden vessels . At a distance of about one thousand yards these powerful war-ships opened fire on Fort Sumter with terrific effect , and received , in return , a heavy fire from all the adjacent forts . The Ironsides passed over and over the torpedo before mentioned , and everybody awaited with intense anxiety the moment when it was expected she would be blown to pieces by its explosion . It failed to " go off , " however . Several reasons were assigned for the failure , but probably the true reason was wet powder and want of system in properly testing the wires and the torpedo-tank . The Federals believed that the harbor was thickly studded with explosives ; and although this belief exercised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from advancing bravely to attack powerful forts , not knowing at what moment their ships might be destroyed . THE " CIGAR-BOAT . " IN the " Southern History Society Papers , ** Colonel Olmstead gives the following account // of an interesting episode in the service which did not come under my eye : During the summer of 1863 there was brought to Charleston , South Carolina , by rail from Mobile , Alabama , a peculiarly shaped boat known as the " cigar-boat . " Its history is linked with deeds of the loftiest heroism . This boat was one day made fast to the wharf at Fort Johnson , opposite Fort Sumter , preparatory to an expedition against the Federal fleet . It was built of boiler-iron , about thirty feet in length , with a breadth of beam of four feet , and a vertical depth of six feet . Access to the interior was had by two man-holes in the upper part , covered by hinged caps into which were let bull's-eyes of heavy glass , and through these the steersman looked in guiding the motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised only a foot or so above the level of the water . The motive power was a propeller worked by the hands of the crew , cranks being provided in the shaft for that purpose . Upon each side of the exterior were horizontal vanes , or wings , which could be adjusted to any required angle from the interior . When it was desired that the boat should go on an even keel , whether on the surface or under the water , these vanes were kept level . If it was desired to go under the water , - say , for instance , at an angle of ten degrees , - the vanes were fixed at that angle , and the propeller worked . The resistance of the water against the inclined vanes would then carry the boat under . A reversal of this method would bring it to the surface again . A tube of mercury was arranged to mark the descent . It had been the design of the inventor to approach near to an enemy , then to submerge the boat and pass under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exploded by means of electricity as soon as it touched the keel . Insufficient depth of water in the harbor prevented this manner of using the boat , however ; and she was then rigged with a long spar at the bow , to which a torpedo was attached , to be exploded by actual concussion with the object to be destroyed . While the " cigar-boat " was at the wharf at Fort Johnson , with some of her crew on board , she was suddenly sunk by the waves from a passing steamer . Days elapsed before she could be raised . The dead bodies of the drowned crew inside were removed , and a second crew volunteered . They made repeated and successful experiments in the harbor , but finally they too went down , and , from some unknown cause , failed to come up . Once more a long time passed before the boat was raised , and then the remains of the devoted crew were taken from her ; nevertheless , still another set of men came forward and volunteered for the perilous duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That night the Federal sloop-of-war Housatonic was reported as having been sunk by a torpedo in the lower harbor ; but of the gallant men who had thus accomplished what they aimed to do , at the risk of their own lives , nothing definite was ever known until after the war , when divers , in endeavoring to raise the wreck of the Housatonic , discovered the " cigar-boat , " with the bleached bones of her crew , lying near the wreck of the noble ship she had destroyed ! OPERATIONS AT SAVANNAH . As in the case of Charleston , the torpedo operations at Savannah were without system , and were left entirely to the discretion of the local military authorities . On March 3 , 1863 , three ironclads and two mortar-boats advanced up the Ogeechee River to attack Fort McAllister , and bombarded it for a whole day , without any practical results . During the action the ironclad Montauk came in contact with a mechanical torpedo , which exploded under her bow , but without serious injury . OPERATIONS IN MOBILE BAY . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ship-channel , but none were operated by electricity . There was no regular system employed . Some of the torpedoes were merely cans of tin containing a small quantity of powder , with a trigger attachment for exploding them . Others were made of sheet-iron , with a fuse which exploded by pressure , the fuse being protected by a cap of thin brass covered with a solution of beeswax . This latter plan was known as the Rains patent ,  --  invented by Brigadier-General Rains , - and was used in various places , both on land and water . Others were made of oaken kegs and barrels , well painted , and arranged to explode by mechanical contact . These barrels were firmly attached to heavy spars anchored at one end , and kept at the proper angle by chains passing through the spars , thus keeping the barrel torpedoes floating about five feet from the surface . In the early part of August , 1864 , Admiral Farragut , commanding the Federal fleet off Mobile , secured the military cooperation of General Canby for attacking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 5th of August the fleet , numbering fourteen steamers and four monitors , carrying in all about two hundred guns , and manned by twenty-eight hundred men , made its entrance into Mobile Bay . In the early light of the morning the attacking fleet moved steadily up the main ship-channel , whereupon Fort Morgan opened on them , and was replied to by a gun from the Brooklyn . A // moment later the Federal ironclad Tecumseh came in contact with a mechanical torpedo , an explosion followed , and she disappeared almost instantaneously beneath the waves , carrying with her her commander , T. A. M. Craven , and her entire crew , numbering nearly one hundred and twenty men , most of whom were drowned . ' No other casualties resulted from torpedoes , and it was a mere chance that the Tecumseh was sunk . No doubt the superincumbent weight of her iron armor carried her to the bottom so quickly , and it is probable that not more than fifty pounds of powder did the mischief . OPERATIONS ON THE YAZOO RIVER . SHORTLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , Mississippi , both by land and water . Anticipating such an event , a few rude mechanical torpedoes were planted in the Yazoo River , about three miles below the city . They were simply common acid carboys filled with powder and arranged to explode by contact with a trigger . On account of the frequent sudden rise and fall of the river , they required considerable attention to keep them in proper position . Here , again , as had frequently occurred at other points , the destructive force of a given amount of powder had been greatly exaggerated . A carboy would contain about twenty-five pounds of powder , and this quantity is insufficient to do more damage than knock a small hole in the hull of a vessel . On the occasion of the attack there was a sudden rise in the river , and some of the light-draft gunboats passed over the torpedoes safely ; but the iron-clad steamer Dc Kaib , the flag-ship , mounting eight guns , and being of heavier draft , struck the trigger of one of the torpedoes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hull . The pilot , as soon as he felt the shock , ran her toward the shore , and she sank in twelve feet of water , close to the river-bank . No one was injured . I have already stated that it was the common belief that summary execution would follow the capture of any person engaged in the torpedo service . Judge of my feelings , then , a few days after the capture of Richmond , to see a lieutenant 1 One can never recount too often the heroism of Captain Craven on this occasion . As the vessel was sinking beneath them , he and the pilot , John Collins , met at the foot of the ladder leading to the top of the turret . Craven drew hack , saying , " Mter you , pilot . " of cavalry , accompanied by two orderlies , present themselves at my residence , with orders from General Terry to conduct me to his headquarters in the Capitol building ! The very fact that it had so early been ascertained that I was in that service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federals to justify common rumor in their intention to make an example of me . However , I went to the Capitol . I was much surprised , however . After a short conversation , General Terry informed me that I must report to Admiral Porter on his flagship , then lying at the wharf in Richmond . I started immediately , escorted this time by the lieutenent only . On arriving at the wharf , I went aboard the flag-ship , - I think it was the Malvern ,  --  and walking into the cabin , found myself in the presence of President Lincoln . After I had introduced myself , and stated the occasion of my visit , Mr. Lincoln called for Admiral Porter . When he came in , Mr. Lincoln said , " Porter , here is the young man you were expecting . " This looked ominous to me . Why had I been expected ? However , in a few minutes we were all three pleasantly engaged in ' conversation . Admiral Porter then informed me of his desire that , in company with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the river and point out where our torpedoes were located , so that they could be removed . " The war is ended , " said he , " and we must clear the river for navigation . " I told him there was no danger whatever to be apprehended from the torpedoes planted by the regular torpedo service , because they could be exploded only by electricity , and our galvanic batteries had been destroyed , and the connecting wires torn up and carried away ; but that there were doubtless many others , planted under the direction of army officers , which were mechanical in their operation , and as likely to be fatal to friend as to foe , and of the location of these I knew nothing . The next morning the Unadilia steamed down the river to the various stations where we had planted torpedoes , and took bearings of the positions . In a few days a regularly organized force had removed all the explosives , and all other obstructions to navigation , and the river was once more safe for travel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was saved . " When I reached the upmost round of the ladder , the vessel seemed to drop from under me . " The Tecumseh lies in the channel to this day. - EDIToa.
