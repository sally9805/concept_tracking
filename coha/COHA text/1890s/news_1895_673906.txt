txt During the last few days the friends of ex-Senator John ? Jarnes Ingalls have set at rest all uncertainties as to the candidacy of that erratic statesman for the seat now occupied by Senator Peffer . Ingalls is in the field , without any equivocation or mental reservation , and all the numerous aspirants for the position will soon so understand it . During the long and varying contest last Winter there was a strong disposition among his friends outside the Legislature to dispel all uncertainty , and solve the situation by making a bold play for Ingalls at the proper time . Numerous petitions , instructions , and requests came from every portion of the State , requesting the Republican representatives to rally on the Ingalls standard , and there was at that time no doubt as to his popularity among the voters of the party . But to all entreaties , and even demands , Ingalls made the same cool , determined reply : " But I am not a candidate for the Senate  --  not now . " Senator Ingalls served eighteen consecutive years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer of that body several years , and the Acting Vice President of the United States , and there are a great number of his party who will now support him because they think that he will quickly force the other States and the rest of the world to acknowledge that Kansas has again- taken her place on the political map of the United States . The announcement of the candidacy of Ingalls will produce no slight effect on the politics of the State , and many of the aspirants will from this time make no move on the Kansas political checkerboard not calculated to build up their ow nchances and at the same time weaken those of Ingalls.
