Finding the doors of his house , at 126 Applegate Avenue , locked , he smashed in a window and climbed in . He entered the parlor , and , placing a revolver at his right temple , pulled the trigger . The ball went lihrough his head . He died in an hour . He had suffered same years from a distressing bowel complaint , and but recently recovered from a severe illness . His sickness undoubtedly unbalanced his mind , as he had been acting strangely for sime time . He was born in Egremont thirty-seven years ago . and leaves a wife and three children .

Those who will join in the protest complain that Mr. Aldridge is put forward by the politicians , and that he might use his office to serve them rather than in the interest of the canals . Lead thieves have been at work on the roof of the Capitol building . About 400 pounds of the lead linings of the gutters have been hacked off with chisels .

They gained access to the roof by going up on the State Library elevator , crossing the garret , and getting out of one of the courtyard windows . The value of the lead stolen Is $20 . The appeal in. the Dr. Buchanan murder case is the third next case on the Court of Appeals calendar , and will probably be argued to-morrow .
