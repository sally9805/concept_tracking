Note : 1Kb Main text EVELYN : But why , why did you put it off till last night  --  or this morning rather  --  when you knew I must sail to-day , and there would be no chance to  --  to  --  to  --  Oh , I do n't see how I can ever forgive you ! Did n't you know ? Did n't I do everything that any human girl could , to show you ? WAYLAND : Yes , dearest , you did ; and I can see it all , now , looking back . I knew , yes , but I did n't dare . EVELYN : That 's what I ca n't forgive you for ; your want of faith in me  --  in yourself . If I were a man  --  WAYLAND : Oh , do n't be a man , darling , not for a single instant ; not even to convince me that I was not a man . I own it , now , but I want you just as you are , just as another woman ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat next him and tenderly crushes her arm and fingers intertwined with his . They are seated on one of the most restricted sofas in one of the remotest embrasures of the music-room on the Anglo-Teutonic-Batavian triple turbine wireless 30,000-ton Ritz restaurant steamer Merseyhaveldam , which is to sail in half an hour . Around their feet , and bulking well up to their knees , lie packages and bundles of farewell offerings , the poignancy of grief in them subdued by the gay ribbons and silken cords of their wrappings ; boxes and sheaves of flowers abandoned hopelessly on the floor exhale a rank sweetness . The music-room seats are all occupied by preoccupied passengers , and there is an incessant coming and going , and laughing and talking everywhere . Tides of leave-takers swell and choke the passages outside , and pass in and out of the music-room . From time to time a young man enters and passes round the place on an apparently unsuccessful tour of discovery , which the couple in the secret nook do nothing to promote . The young man is tall and gangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile of inexhaustible amiability . He carries aloft a long pasteboard box . EVELYN , shuddering against the shoulder of Wayland with a deep sigh of escape , as the unsuccessful explorer makes one of his disappearances : He 's gone again ! Well ? WAYLAND : Was I saying anything ? I thought I was merely feeling . Oh yes ! You do forgive me , do n't you ? EVELYN , smelling the bunch of violets which she presses to her nose with her free hand : Oh yes , yes ! A million times . I only had to have something against you to keep from simply melting and flowing away . Oh , dear , how nice you are , and how wise , even down to these violets ! Any other flowers  --  ' Sh ! There he is . No ! He 's gone again ; he merely glanced in . I suppose , by the look of that long box , he 's got long-stemmed roses  --  American Beauties , of course ; possibly Jacks . He does n't mean any harm , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wandering idiot , and I shall not kill him  --  at least till you 're gone . EVELYN : How funny you are ! I did n't know you had so much humor  --  always so solemn and sententious , till last night . But last night you were funny ! Do you suppose anybody ever made love before in a taxicab ? Or not made it exactly , but worked up to it . With Aunt Bessie there , you could n't really offer yourself , though I do n't believe she 'd have minded . She must have seen it was coming : she 's always adored you ; and I knew she asked to let us drop you just to give you a last chance . And when you came in to say good-night , and she went up-stairs to put off her things and left us in the reception-room , you did n't lose much time , did you , darling ? It was simply an explosion , that was all . But how much time you did lose before the explosion ! No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect it , I do n't want it . If you forgave me you might forget me ; the two always go together , and I want you to keep me in mind every breath , every pulse ! I shall you , and I could n't consent to excel you in anything ; though I could n't excel you if I did consent . EVELYN : Well , then , do n't let 's talk of it any more . We 've only these few minutes left , and we ought to talk about something vital  --  make every word hold a lifetime of meaning ; do n't you think so ? WAYLAND : Yes , and how perfectly you say it , how  --  MRS . WELBY , struggling through the riveted furniture of the music-room , and the flux and reflux of passengers and their laughing , shouting , and talking friends : Ah ! There you are at last ! Oh , my dearest child , what a time I have had ! I thought I never should find you , and the boat would carry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! Well , I can certainly trust him to see that I do n't get left . Guess what I 've brought you ! But no , you must wait to get off before you look . ( She disburdens herself of two boxes which she has been carrying , putting them into the eager hands of Wayland , and then recovering them from him as she sinks into an arm-chair facing Evelyn . ) Oh , thank you so much . The whole joke is in not looking , now . But where 's Mrs. Farlane ? EVELYN : Taking time by the forelock down in her berth . She 's so determined to be sick , you know , that she 's not going to lose a moment . She says if she is n't sick , it will be just so much pure gain . MRS . WELBY : Dear Mrs. Farlane , how funny she is ! So much character , always . Has anybody brought you any of that new mousse chocolate yet ? Not that  --  EVELYN : I love it ! MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them ; but the other is strictly between ourselves , do n't you know . Dear Mrs. Farlane ! If I had only remembered her passion for seasickness , I should certainly have brought her some of those red tablets ; I do n't remember their name , but you know them by their being red . And now  --  ( flinging herself back into her chair with a long sigh of expectation ) tell me all about your where , when , and how . You do n't mean that Mr. Wayland is the only one of your young men that 's come to see you off ? WAYLAND : No , Mrs. Welby ; only the first of them . He exchanges a furtive hand-pressure with Evelyn . MRS . WELBY : And I 'm the second . Well , that 's something . Sally ! ( She launches this cry at a young girl , so long-legged that her skirts have not been able to reach her ankles , who has burst through the vermiculant crowd , and , flushed , rumpled , and panting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stumbles with it at the feet of Miss Matthews . ) Why in the world did n't you leave it with the steward ? SALLY , indignantly : What steward , I should like to know ? There are a thousand stewards , and you ca n't catch one of them . And , besides , after I 'd motored down with it in my lap from Sixty-seventh Street , and kept them from tumbling out with my own hands all the way , do you think I was going to let any steward gobble them ? I do n't call you much of a mother for suggesting such a thing . ( She casts herself upon Evelyn 's neck , with many kisses and tender murmurs . ) I picked them out myself , and there 's one for every kiss ; and  --  How do , Mr. Wayland ! I did n't see you . She gives him her hand . WAYLAND : Oh , I was n't here  --  compared with E  --  SALLY : What ? EVELYN , hastening to cover his confusion : And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of you to think of grapefruit , of all things ! My favorite fruit , and so refreshing , and the very thing at sea . How good and kind of you ! MRS . WELBY : Well , I must say she might have shown more originality . Why , child , do n't you know that they fairly bathe you in grapefruit on these boats ? SALLY : But they 're not your own grapefruit , and  --  EVELYN , pulling her down and kissing her : And that makes all the difference . We 'll have yours at lunch and dinner , and the boat 's at breakfast . SALLY , irrelevantly : I saw Mr. Framer on the outskirts somewhere , with a box as long and narrow as he is , that I guess had American Beauties in it ; and I guess he was looking for you . Oh , there it is now ! She indicates the box , held above the press and making its way irregularly about , as if seeking a positive direction . EVELYN : Oh , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you ! Let him go and leave it with the other things on the saloon table . Ca n't somebody tell him ? Ca n't you , Ra  --  Or , no , that wo n't do ! Oh , dear ! SALLY : There ! He 's gone again . He went out of the door ; you need n't be afraid . But I do n't wonder you were . Why , Nancy ! Well , of all the people ! What have you brought ? But of course I 'm not asking . MRS . WELBY : No , you do n't seem to be , and I 'm very glad you 're so thoughtful , Sally . MRS . EFFINGER : Merely a trifling en tout cas , if you must know , Sally , before the grateful recipient does . ( To Miss Matthews ) No cards . I could n't think of anything you 'd hate to have worse , Evelyn , and I trotted out all your btes noires and counted them . Bob 's coming with something at the last moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel pretty sure I 've beaten him on the en tout cas . Oh , how do you do , Mr. Wayland ? You 're such a shrinking violet I did n't see you behind that basket of grapefruit . Are you holding all the things ? Then why not the en tout cas ? Evelyn does n't seem disposed to grab it . EVELYN : You have n't given me any chance to grab it yet , Nancy . Hand it over . She reaches for it . MRS . EFFINGER , giving it : There . But why we have n't left all our offerings on the altar in the dining-saloon , I ca n't understand . MRS . WELBY : We have no confidence in the attendants of the temple . I feel that they 'd have eaten up every bit of my chocolate mousse  --  MRS . EFFINGER , with a cry to Evelyn : Chocolate mousse ! Oh , give me one , you greedy thing ! When you knew how I adored them ! Actually keeping the box shut ! SALLY : Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EFFINGER : He ? It ? SALLY : Mr. Framer , with a box of American Beauties , as long and lank as he is ! See it moving through the air ! It 's coming this way . ( With a skilful reproduction of the motor-'bus conductor 's manner ) " Elevated road ! All keep your seats ! Bat your heads ! " There , he 's gone again . Evelyn 's saved ! MRS . EFFINGER : Do I understand that Miss Matthews does n't wish to meet the bearers of gifts ? It seems to me that this is a hint to me . Good-bye , you poor thing ! Bon voyage ; many returns of the same . ( She stoops over Evelyn and kisses her . ) Good-bye ! EVELYN : Oh , thank you , Nancy , so much ! MRS . EFFINGER : For going ? EVELYN : For the en tout cas . Stay and see whether Cousin Bob can beat it ! MRS . EFFINGER : For pure banality , it 's inapproachable . But the fates may fight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WELBY : Oh , do n't say such a thing ! She rises . MRS . EFFINGER : He may . ( To Mrs. Welby and Sally ) Coming , girls ? ( To Wayland ) Mr. Wayland ? WAYLAND : Yes , yes . As soon as I can catch a steward to give these things to . MRS . EFFINGER , subtly : Oh . MRS . WELBY AND SALLY , kissing Evelyn : Good-bye , dear . Do n't be greedy with the chocolates . Eat all the grapefruit you can , Evelyn . It will do you good . EVELYN : Oh , can you believe they 're actually gone ? WAYLAND : It does seem too good to be true . EVELYN : Well , now let 's do n't lose any time ! ( You do n't mind my grammar , or ungrammar ? ) They 'll be back in hordes in a moment . Where were we ? ( She vividly presses his hand with each question . ) Where were we ? WAYLAND : I 'm with you , wherever you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean . You were saying something vital ; what was it ? WAYLAND : That I love you better than anything in the universe . EVELYN : And I you . But that goes without saying . Oh , I know , now ! WAYLAND : We must  --  must  --  MUST  --  somehow  --  before we part ; I could n't leave you without  --  It would n't be parting . But with these people  --  EVELYN : Could n't we bend our faces down  --  together  --  and pretend to be looking for something in this rubbish , and  --  WAYLAND : Oh , you darling to think how ! EVELYN : And you do n't despise me for thinking ? WAYLAND , in inexpressible protest : Oh ! They bend over , in pretended scrutiny of the packages at their feet ; a loud , jovial voice arrests them . EFFINGER : Hello ! There you are at last ! I thought you 'd decided not to go , Evelyn ; been all over the ship for you . Hello , Wayland ! What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely : Oh no , I 'm just filling in the time between parting friends . EFFINGER : Well , you wo n't have much time to fill in between me . Ship sails in about ten minutes . EVELYN , with a covert clutch of Wayland 's hand : Oh ! In ten minutes ? EFFINGER : Well , about . Have n't you heard the warning voice of the steward ? EVELYN , convulsively : No ! WAYLAND , indignantly : How can we hear anything in this din ? EFFINGER , glancing round at the dense laughing and shouting throng in the music-room : They do seem to be having rather a good time . ( To Evelyn ) Guess what I 'm holding behind my back , to comfort you on your long five days ' voyage ! EVELYN , wildly : A shoe-bag ? EFFINGER : A shoe-bag ! Is that some of Nancy 's rot ? Do I look like a man that would bring a shoe-bag to a lovely girl leaving friends and home on an oft-tried trip to the Old World ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wake ; breakfast at nine ; bouillon at eleven ; lunch at one ; tea at four ; dinner at seven-thirty : if you do n't have something betweentimes , you simply perish . You ca n't live on flowers and chocolates and grapefruit and en touts cases ( Nancy brought that , I 'll bet ) ; and I 've been to Dream 's , and got you one of his fairy copper baskets ! ( He brings it round in front of him , and Evelyn clasps her hands in a feint of ecstasy as he lifts the lid . ) There ! It 's a Dream itself , is n't it ?  --  full of dreams ! Did you ever see such a load of indigesti-comestibles ? Try one now  --  greatest prophylactic against seasickness , one of these gooey , frosted layer-cakes ! No ? Well , you 'll come to it ; I must be off ; going ashore , Wayland ? What 's the matter ? WAYLAND , with his eyes fastened on a tall form moving on the skirts of the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , I 'm going  --  go  --  EVELYN : Oh , what is it ? WAYLAND : It is ! EFFINGER : Framer ? Why , he 's been looking all over the ship for you . I 'll just go and tell  --  EVELYN : If you dare ! EFFINGER , with intelligence : Oh ! Well , I wo n't then . Come along , Wayland . How do they put you ashore on this line ? I 've heard whistles and gongs and stewards  --  which sounds last ? But no matter . Good-bye , Miss Matthews ; good-bye to Mrs. Farlane , for me ; good-bye , Wayl  --  Why , no , you 're going ashore , too ! WAYLAND : Yes , yes , as soon as I 've signed for these things . Do n't wait for me . ( To a district messenger , bearing a large jar of California figs ) For Miss Matthews ? ( And to a succession of messengers with arm-loads of tulips , branches of bananas , and baskets of oranges , grapes , and apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Matthews ? ( Signing ) Well , why did n't you leave them with the steward ? CHORUS OF DISTRICT MESSENGERS : Could n't find no steward ! EFFINGER , merging himself with the crowd : Well , if you wo n't ! EVELYN , bitterly : But everybody seems to find us ! Oh , I wish I had n't a friend on earth ! WAYLAND : Well , they ca n't hold out much longer . The boat starts now in less than six minutes . EVELYN : Oh , I ca n't let you go ! WAYLAND : Nor I you . But I must , I must ! EVELYN : How cruel you are ! Let me stay with you ! I wo n't  --  I ca n't go ! WAYLAND : And I ca n't stay . I 'm going with you . EVELYN : No , no . I 'll stay . WAYLAND : But you ca n't stay now , dearest . Your Not Wanted on the Voyage luggage is all in the hold . You must go ! EVELYN : Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean ? Now , to part only a few hours after we belong to each other . But I wo n't blame you , at the last minute , so ! WAYLAND : But you 're not ; I 'm blaming myself . EVELYN : But I ca n't let you leave me here alone  --  without Aunt Elizabeth , or anything . Oh , where is she ? How can she be down in her berth at such a time ! WAYLAND : I 'll call her  --  get her  --  EVELYN : No , there is n't time ! Oh , hear those dreadful gongs and whistles and stewards all shouting at you to go ashore ! Where is Aunt Elizabeth ? Oh , there you are  --  just dropped from heaven in the very nick of time ! Oh , Aunt Elizabeth ! WAYLAND : What are you doing here , you crazy things ? Mr. Wayland , I 'm astonished at you . Do n't you know the boat 's just starting ? They 'll be pulling up the gangway . Why do n't you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here from a sick  --  a seasick  --  bed to send you . ( The screaming , laughing crowd is , in fact , melting and ebbing away from the music-room . Mr. Framer vanishes through the door with his tall box of American Beauty roses . ) What are you stopping for ? WAYLAND , very seriously : Mrs. Farlane , I am engaged to Evelyn  --  MRS . FARLANE , with astonishment : Well , I should suppose so  --  after last night ! WAYLAND : I consider her my wife now ; and yet  --  and yet  --  we must part like strangers . WAYLAND : How , like strangers ? What do you mean ? Evelyn , is this some nonsense of yours ? ( With severity ) If it 's a joke , Mr. Wayland  --  EVELYN , whimpering : Oh , do you think he could joke on such a subject ? People have been heaping themselves on us ever since he 's been here , and they stare so  --  stare so  --  WAYLAND : That we ca n't part as we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I could  --  could  --  without making a show of it  --  kiss her good-bye  --  just  --  once  --  WAYLAND : Oh , you poor , poor things ! I 'll stand as close as I can , and cluster round you as thick ! Do you mean here ? She puts herself in position , and moves this way and that so as to intercept the view of the lingering witnesses in the music-room , and Evelyn and Wayland have risen for a parting embrace , when a joyous noise bursts upon them from a troop of young men and girls who come pushing into the place with incoherent cries . THE GIRLS : There you are at last ! Oh , Evelyn , such a time we 've had finding you ! And we 'll be carried off with you , now . Here , last chance ! All the latest publications ! I knew you 'd forget a steamer-chair cushion , and I 've brought  --  Do n't tell me anybody else has given you grapefruit ! And a Dream basket ? Oh , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed it myself , Evelyn ! There is n't a moment ! Hurry , girls ! Oh , good-bye . They drop their gifts at Evelyn 's feet , and crowd Wayland from her with their multitude and successive embraces , while the young men shake hands with Wayland and Mrs. Farlane . THE YOUNG MEN : Never got such time out of three taxies before ! We shall all be up for speeding . Real ambulance gait . Told the mounted cops we had run over these girls , and were taking them to the hospital . If I had n't seen Wayland 's head and shoulders through the window here , we should never have found you . Come ! That 's the last call ! We shall all be left  --  carried off , that is . Come , come ! With wails from the girls and babbled and bubbled farewells , the party join in flight , and carry with them the tall figure of Mr. Framer , who has haunted the background with his box of roses , and , without attempting to leave it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ashore . EVELYN , to Wayland : Oh , go , go ! ( She glances through the window . ) Oh , they 're untying the gangway . Oh , dearest love , go ! Do n't wait for anything ! Throw one to me from the pier ! ( She pushes him wildly from her . ) Everybody 's looking back , and waving . We ca n't . You mus n't ! ( Wayland wavers frantically and then rushes distractedly away . ) Oh , oh ! What have I done ? WAYLAND : A very silly thing ; and he 's done another ! You do n't deserve each other . EVELYN , flying to the window : Oh , there he is on the gangway , just behind Mr. Framer ! And the sailors are lifting it and the men on the pier are pulling it down ! How frightfully it swings in the air ! Oh , I ca n't bear to look ! But I must ! I must ! What a dreadful din the whistle makes ! How can they ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your window ? Yes ? I ca n't ! Where is he  --  where is he ? MRS . FARLANE , at the next window : He 's all right ; he 's on the pier , now . Do n't you see him ? Just beside that idiot with his box of roses . EVELYN : Yes , oh yes , I see him . How good you are , aunty , to find him . And he sees me ! Yes , he does , he does ! And he 's kissing his hand to me ! Oh , he remembered ! Oh , you darling ! Oh , my dear love ! And I 'll kiss mine to you ; I do n't care now if the whole world sees me . She kisses her hand ; then she gives a cry of despair . MRS . FARLANE : What is it , Evelyn ? Are you crazy ? What 's the matter ? Has he fallen in ? EVELYN : No . But Mr. Framer 's got in front of him and he thinks I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his to me . Oh , oh , oh ! She bursts into tears , and cowers away from the window , hiding her face in her handkerchief . Mrs. Farlane strikes an attitude of helpless and hopeless compassion .
