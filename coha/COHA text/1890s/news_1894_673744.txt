txt Chairman Babcock 's recent announcement about , in which he gave the country to understand that he had repudiated it as a party doctrine , does not appear to have made a good impression , or it may have been heard from in one of the sections where is more popular than it is with Reed , Sherman . Allison , Clarkson , and other Republican leaders . There has been some amusement among Democrats at the performances of the Republicans who are discrediting the doctrines , and predictions have been made that the men who were " shy " of protection would be admonished that they were going too far . Babcock has verified the predictions . He has been giving out to-day a statement of what he really believes or will teach about protection , and he appears to have got back to old moorings . The notion is here that the impoverished manufacturers , who hope to get back , one of these days , into their old partnership with the Government , have been intimating that if the Republicans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Party need not expect to " fry " any more " fat " from them for campaign purposes . The men who put up the " fat " a few years ago will have to wait , no matter what the position of ? Mr. Babcock on the tariff question , for more than two years before they can hope to get back their old margin of profits . Before there is a chance to vote for another set of Congressmen , Chairman Babcock will have opportunity to make many proclamations , and it would not be safe to bet that before 1896 he will not have settled down as an advocate of the tariff passed in 1894 . In his statement given out to-day Mr. Babcock says : " What I said was that at the time of the passage of the bill there was not one Republican in five who approved of the extreme prohibitory schedules of the bill , and I cited as one of these the duty on calico , Which was more than the most ardent protectionist could ask for or defend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe to be just , but I did not intend to criticise the measure as a whole , for I gave it a hearty support , and have always been an earnest advocate of protection . I said further that I believed the intelligence of our American people was the foundation of our strength as a nation ; that the people were ever ready to condemn what in their judgment appeared to be unwise legislation , as evidenced by the recent election . " It is proper to state that the careful reporter of the United Press to whom Mr. Babcock 's original statement was made took particular pains to give , as he believed , the exact language used . Twenty-four hours after the interview had been widely published , this same reporter saw Mr. Babcock on another matter , and the Chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee took no exceptions to the published interview . Mr. Babcock even to-day , in conversation , qualified his explanation of what he now says he said by adding the words " or what I meant to have said . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
