AXLE . comes from house . ) MRS . AXLE . You hesitated , but you took my advice . AXLE . Took your advice ? ( laughs ) . I am the brains and master of the Axle family .

Why bloomers , of course . AXLE . Bloomers ! Just blooming , are they ? I wonder what they 'll be like when they 're in full bloom and ripe ? Well , I swan , if that ai n't a make-up ! Did somebody steal your clothes and did you have to borrow some from a man ? MARY . Not much . These are the latest ! You 're not in line if you dress otherwise . This is the proper caper in clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think college would change you so . You return so altered in appearance and speech . MARY . Oh , that 's all right , Ma ! " I 'm in it , " as the saying is ; and I 'm like the rest of the college girls . ( To girls and boys ) How do you think I look ? GIRLS . Oh ! your clothes are simply horrid . We are shocked ! BOYS . You are simply awful ! MARY . Well , it suits me all the same , and you need n't like it . I 'm in the swim . AXLE . You look as if you had just been in a-swimming  --  Oh , Mary  --  MARY . ( interrupts ) Marie , please ! AXLE . I 'll call you Mary . I want no French bullfrog language in mine . MARY . Very well .

I wo n't do a thing to him ; I 'll just shake him into a thousand pieces ! MARY . And he is the idol of the college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , writing , or geography , but he can kick a foot-ball " out of sight . " ( Enter CHARLEY SCRAGGS , L. U. E. He has a growth of hair over forehead ; wears eyeglass , and is attired in a semi-athletic costume . He swaggers on . All the boys greet him and the girls also . He shakes hands with AXLE and MRS . AXLE . Then he sees JOSIAH and comes to him . ) CHARLES . Hello ! Josiah . How are you ? ( He seizes JOSIAH 'S hand and begins shaking it . JOSIAH squirms with pain and capers about , but CHARLES still squeezes his hand and shakes it . JOSIAH finally cries out with pain . CHARLES releases his hand . JOSIAH picks apart his crushed fingers and glares at CHARLES . ) JOSIAH . For a sickly , consumptive grasshopper he squeezes like a giant . I believe he 's crushed all my finger bones . AXLE . Charles , step in and have some lunch . Glad to see you , my boy . You look hearty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes your hair grow on your forehead . CHARLES . Yas ! Glad to see you , old stick-in-the-mud . Have you got any cigarettes about you ? AXLE . Cigarettes ? MARY . Why , Pa , you 're not in it if you do n't smoke cigarettes . AXLE . Cigaroots ! I smoke a clay pipe . CHARLES . You want to be up to the times . Get yourself cigarettes and eye-glasses . Be in it , old codger , be in it . MARY . Yes  --  do n't be off the map  --  get in the procession  --  AXLE . I must say that this new college language stumps me . I ai n't got a map  --  and where 's the procession ? CHARLES . Do n't get off your base ! Get in the push , you know  --  be a blood , not a back number  --  do n't be a jay all your life . AXLE . ( puzzled ) This is a new language to me , but I guess you 're right . I 've got numbers on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of reed birds . CHARLES . Well . Trot out the grub ! Come along , old whiskers , and I 'll do justice to it . Good-bye , girls and boys , I 'll see you later . MARY . Yes , girls , ta , ta ! I 'll behold you more subsequently . Charles , please attach your digits to that contrivance entitled a bicycle and convey it rapidly into the domicile of my paternal and maternal parents , and let it remain in statu quo in close proximity to the receptacle for head gear and inventions to protect us from saturation , caused by a downpour of irrigation sent from the firmament by Jupiter Pluvius . ( AXLE nearly faints . CHARLES takes bicycle into house . MARY waves hands to boys and girls and enters house . ) AXLE . That 's the first time I ever knew that Mary could talk Dutch ! MRS . AXLE . Oh , what an accomplishment and how thankful we should be that we sent her to college ! I 'll go in and prepare the lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her . ( As he starts for the house AXLE waves him back . ) AXLE . Stop ! ( Aside ) I 'll talk Dutch to him too . I 've got some learning but I never showed it . ( To JOSIAH ) Here , you ! Abstract the quadruped 's pedal attachment forged on yonder block of iron , and let it be submerged in the glowing anthracite upon the forge , then fashion it into an article ready to be secured by nails upon the hoof of the equine animal  --  forthwith ! ( Laughs ) I guess I 'm some pumpkins myself if I do have numbers on my back and ai n't been to college . ( Enters house proudly , girls and boys laugh at JOSIAH , who stands L. C. stupefied . Girls and boys exit R. U. E. ) JOSIAH . I guess this whole house is going crazy ! I ca n't understand what they 're talking about . Here 's Mary back again and she does n't notice me , and it 's all on occount of that Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . He 's strong as an ox , but I ca n't lose Mary . What 's to be done ? ( DUSTY RHODES , a tramp , enters from L. U. E. ) DUSTY . Hello , young feller ! Now do n't drive me away and sic the dog on me . I 've walked for six weeks and never let up . Can you give a poor fellow a turkey sandwich ? JOSIAH . Why do n't you go work ? DUSTY . I 'm too strong to work . Besides , I would n't disgrace my profession by doing any work . Man 's a fool to work when he can find something else to do . JOSIAH . You are a tramp , eh ? DUSTY . Not exactly ! I 'm a gentleman , but I 'm not working at it . JOSIAH . What did you do before you became a tramp ? DUSTY . I was a teacher of boxing . I gave lessons in the manly art of self-defense , but since fighters do nothing but talk , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowadays  --  all wind  --  no blows . JOSIAH . So you give lessons in boxing , do you ? ( Aside ) Here 's a chance to get a few points and use them on that foot-ball fellow , Charley Scraggs . ( Aloud ) Will you give me a few lessons if I pay you ? DUSTY . Well I should smoke a chimney ! Fork over a five and I 'll make a fighter of you in no time . JOSIAH . I was saving up for Christmas  --  but here 's a five dollar bill . ( Gives it . ) Now teach me . DUSTY . I have n't got any boxing gloves . JOSIAH . But I have . I 've got them hid in the shop . ( Runs in and gets gloves . ) The old man does n't know about these . I 've had ' em a long time but do n't know how to use them . DUSTY . Put ' em on . ( JOSIAH about to put one on his foot . ) No  --  no  --  put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puts on gloves and JOSIAH does likewise . ) Now then , I 'll give you a few lessons . ( Business of extravagant capering about , which alarms JOSIAH . ) Now , this is an upper cut ( Hits JOSIAH ) and this is a feint and body blow ( Hits him ) . This is a counter blow and a left hander ( Hits him . Tramp has business ad lib. of hitting JOSIAH , knocking him down and explaining blows as he hits him . A funny boxing match can be introduced here until JOSIAH is worn out and battered about by tramp . When JOSIAH is very weak tramp takes off gloves ) . There ! You 're all right ! If you live long enough you 'll be able to whip Corbett or Fitzsimmons . Do n't forget what I 've taught you . ( Tramp laughs and exits R. U. E. JOSIAH gathers up gloves and hides them in the shop . Girls and boys return R. U. E. , all gayly laughing and chattering . Girls are attired in bloomers find boys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bloomers  --  BOYS . And we 're up to date too . ( All cheer and laugh . AXLE comes from house . ) AXLE . Hello ! What 's all this ? Have you all gone crazy ? BELLA . Oh , no ! Mary has set the fashion , and we 're all " in it " same as she is . BOYS . Yes , we 're like Charley Scraggs . AXLE . Well , I do n't know what to make of this . ( Enter MRS . AXLE from house . She wears a grotesque pair of bloomers and also a burlesque imitation of MARY 'S costume . All laugh as she enters . AXLE is astonished . ) JOSIAH . Now I 'm satisfied that the community is going crazy . AXLE . ( to MRS . AXLE ) What 's all this ? How dare you appear in such a costume . Madam , are you aware that I have not been consulted ? MRS . AXLE . How dare you raise your voice to me ? I 've been getting points from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the brains of the Axle mansion , and do n't you forget it . ( Slaps hands under his nose . ) AXLE . Are you aware that you are my wife ? MRS . AXLE . You are to honor and obey me . What is man but an echo of his wife 's opinion ? You are but an echo . Shut up ; do n't talk when I 'm talking , or I 'll slap your face . ( Slaps his face . ) I 'll show you who is master here . Things have changed . I 'm glad Mary went to college ; it 's made a different woman of me . I 'm in bloomers and I 'm going to wear the  --  ahem  --  I 'll wear these ! AXLE . But , my dear  --  MRS . AXLE . Silence ! Do n't you dare raise your voice . You 've been a tyrant long enough , but woman has at last reached her true position in life , and I 've reached mine . ( Enter CHARLEY and MARY from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; assert yourself ; be boss or nothing . ( Sees boys and girls . ) Ah , ha ! You 've got bloomers , have you ! Now get bikes , and you 'll be all right . CHARLES . You 're all in it now , except this Rube over here . ( Points to JOSIAH . ) This country bumpkin will never learn anything . I can dazzle him with a few movements like this . ( Spars wildly at JOSIAH and struts back to MARY . ) Oh , how I wish he could put up his hands . I 'd show you some great sport . ( While he is thus bragging JOSIAH gets the gloves , and , coming behind CHARLES , throws a pair at him . ) JOSIAH . Put them on ! ( CHARLES picks them up . ) CHARLES . It 's a shame to take advantage of a poor fellow like this , but he must be taught a lesson , and the ladies must be amused . So here goes . I 'll be easy with him  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A funny boxing match takes place . Finally JOSIAH lands several blows on CHARLES that daze him . Then follows some rapid action and JOSIAH knocks CHARLES all over the place and then gives him a good upper cut and sends CHARLES whizzing to the ground , where he falls in a funny position . Girls and boys applaud JOSIAH . ) AXLE . ( delighted ) Good ! Josiah , good . I did n't know you could do fine work like that . MARY . Why , Josiah . How you have improved . I think you 're real splendid . JOSIAH . Oh , I do n't go ' round bragging , but I get there with both feet . ( CHARLES rises ) It 's a pity to thump him this way , but the ladies must be amused . I was very easy with him . MARY . Josiah , I always thought a great deal of you , and I think more of you now than ever . AXLE . By George , I like a son-in-law that can take his part , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a good son-in-law . I 'm not going back to college any more . ( JOSIAH and AXLE cheer . ) AXLE . Good ! I think you know enough . MRS . AXLE . And I do n't feel at home in these bloomers . Mr. Axle , you can wear the  --  ahem  --  you know  --  I 'll stick to skirts , and to my sphere in life . MARY . And so will I. I wore this costume to prove that imitators abound in city or country . I brought the bloomers here and said it was the latest style . See how quick my girl friends condemned them , but how soon they went and made some and wore them . I 'm home from college , but I 'm still Mary , without up-to-date notions , or " new " woman ideas . Josiah , when I want a husband I wo n't go looking for one who thinks of nothing but athletic sports , I 'll marry a blacksmith . AXLE . Then you 'd better strike while the iron 's hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I grant my permission . MRS . AXLE . And mine too . ( To AXLE ) Forgive me , Axle , I 'm too old to be a new woman , and I do n't want to begin now . AXLE . That 's right . Let some other brainless people try to do it , we wo n't ; we 'll never quarrel any more . What about Charley Scraggs ? CHARLES . Oh ! I think more of foot-ball than I do of marrying . Do n't let me interfere with this happy scene . I must say that Josiah surprised me . JOSIAH . Yes , paid five dollars for a couple of lessons , and I 'm going to take a few more . I think it agrees with me , do n't you think so , boys and girls ? OMNES . Yes , you are right ! AXLE . And I 'm mighty glad we 're not disappointed in our little Mary . Now give three cheers everybody , because she 's home from college . ( All cheer  --  animated group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
