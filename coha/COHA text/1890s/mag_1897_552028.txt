THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS AND THE GLE FOR FREEDOM . By Rev. William E. Barton , D. D. I T is common to think of slavery as belonging exclusively to the South , and as universally practiced and upheld there . Both ideas are far from the truth . Slavery was in a very important sense national , and the sentiment against it was neither universal in the North nor absent from the South . As late as 1830 there were slaves in every northern state except Vermont . From the beginning , however , it is evident that slavery in the North is doomed to ultimate extinction , and is destined to grow with steadily increasing power in the South . But the increase of slavery in the South was not uniform in all the states . The increase in the white population of Alabama between 1830 and 185o was 236,074 ; the increase in colored was nearly as great , 224 ,  - -  995 . Louisiana made about the same showing , with 166,050 white and 133,221 colored increase . Mississippi showed even a larger gain , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of about 5 , ooo whites , ended the second decade with nearly 15,000 majority colored . In all the above the free colored are excluded , and only slaves are counted among the colored . In the border states , however , the showing was very different ; Kentucky , for instance , with an increase of 243,626 , had only 45,770 slave increase , - less than 20 per cent 65 DANIEL BOONE S FIRST OUTLOOK ON THE BLUE GRASS REGION . // A MOUNTAIN MILL . of the increase among the white population . Slavery in the border states was dying of its own weight . Natural conservatism and social pride , together with the practical difficulties of emancipation , retarded its extinction ; but the system was slowly losing ground . In 1850 a State Emancipation Convention at Frankfort demanded that the new constitution should give the legislature complete power to perfect provisions for the gradual emancipation of all the slaves within the state . It was but a straw , but it indicated a current . We frequently hear of " the Solid South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never solid . Long before the war , there was in every southern state a strong anti-slavery sentiment . This was naturally most marked in the border states , where slavery existed in its less repulsive forms . There , in the free and easy manner of life , slaves were generally well treated , and an honest effort was made on the part of many masters to keep families together and to promote the moral and social welfare of the negroes . In some instances the slaves were members of the same churches with their masters , and at the communion service partook of the same bread and wine , after the masters had been served , from the same ministers and at the same altar . It was the boast of some masters that they never sold or bought a slave except to keep families united , and in some communities slave traders and men who sold slaves without regard for their welfare were looked down upon by their neighbors . But besides this sentiment which softened the rigors of slavery , there was on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men admitted the wrong but professed to see no immediate remedy . Others , convinced of the evil , became the most intense of abolitionists . A MOUNTAIN CABIN . // It is a significant fact , but one which all but universally escapes attention , that it was a section , a large portion of which was but just severed from Virginia , which was first dedicated at the shrine of Freedom . Virginia , for the common good , gave up her claim to the great Northwest Territory , in which slavery or involuntary servitude , except as punishment for crime , was forever prohibited . That which was first true of this territory was made true of the nation ; and the words of the Constitutional Amendment against slavery were taken from the Ordinance of 1787 . It x*ould be too much to attribute this entirely to an antislavery sentiment inherited from Virginia ; yet that there was such a sentiment , and that it had its weight , it would be folly to deny . Such a sentiment the boy Henry Clay inherited or easily attained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age , was considering and advocating a plan for gradual emancipation . With that sentiment he entered upon his public career . Earlier than this , in 1781 , Jefferson most emphatically condemned slavery , and trembled for his country when he remembered that God is just . Jefferson had written in 1785 that antislavery sentiments were held south of the Chesapeake by " a respectable minority . . . which for weight and worth of character preponderates against the greater number who have not the courage to divest their families of a property , which , however , keeps their consciences unquiet . " John Fiske enrolls among the opponents of slavery " all the foremost statesmen in Virginia ,  --  Washington , Jefferson , Lee , Randolph , Henry , Madison and Mason . " In other portions of the South , and chiefly in the border states , antislavery sentiment early manifested itself . It was in 1834 that James G. Birney of Kentucky freed his slaves , BY THE FIRESIDE IN A MOUNTAIiN tIOME. // CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS . career as the father of abolitionism were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountainous section of what was then the undivided Virginia . Although his paper , The Genius of Universal Emancipation , was first published at Mount Pleasant , Ohio , a town barely over the line from the mountains of West Virginia , it was soon removed to Jonesville in the hill country of East Tennessee . This was before the organization of the New England Antislavery Society , which was effected in Boston in January of 1832 by William Lloyd Garrison , returning from his labors with Lundy in Baltimore , whence in 1824 he had removed The Genius . Lundy 's movement was the parent of Garrison 's , as The Genius , which h a d passed its infancy in the southern mountains , was the parent of the Liberator . MR . CLAY IN EARLY MANHOOD . While the South as a w h o 1 e , with its inheriand in J qwq lished , however , in Cincinnati . In 1835 Cassius M. Clay was elected to the legislature , where he was known as a violent opponent of slavery ; and in 1845 he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defending the office with two four-pound cannon and having a keg of powder ready with fuse attached to blow up the building in case a mob should drive the defenders out and obtain possession . The abolition movement may fairly be said to have begun in the mountains of the South , in the labors of Benjamin Lundy , while at Wheeling , West Virginia . There large cargoes of slaves from the Old Dominion passed through to the southward , and the sentiments of horror and disapproval out of which grew Lundy 's IN THE KENTUCKY RIVER VALLEY . // was no growth at all comparable to that on the part of the people of the Southern Appalachians . The conditions of their soil made large numbers of slaves unprofitable , and their poverty and simplicity of life were barriers in the way of their possessing slaves even in such numbers as might have been used to advantage . Another notable contribution of the mountains to the antislavery struggle was the book called " The Impending Crisis , " by Hon. Hinton R o w a n Helper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western North Carolina , December 27 , 1829 , and afterwards made his home at Asheville in the same state . Between 1857 and i86i there were sold 140,000 copies of his book , which was written by a southern man for southern men , and dedicated to " Cassius M. Clay of Kentucky , Francis P. Blair , Jr. , of Missouri , Benjamin S. Hedrick of North Carolina , and to the non-slaveholding whites of the South . " Mr. Helper was no friend of the negro in spirit , but from an economic point of view showed the evil of slavery , bracing his argument with quotations from the most eminent southerners then living , as well as many more dead . The antislavery sentiment in the South was largely based upon the religious convictions of the people . In 1804 six Baptist ministers of some note and others less prominent with many lay members organized a body taking extreme ground against slavery . The Baptist associations declared against them , that it is " improper for ministers , churches or associations to meddle with the emancipation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to have nothing to do with it " in their religious capacity . " Though thus allowed as individuals to hold and proclaim the views they held , the " Emancipators , " as they came to be called , were not content that the church itself should not be committed against the evils of slavery , and withdrew , founding " The Baptist Licking-Locust Association , Friends of Humanity , " which however soon died out . This short lived association , however , was a leavening power within and without the denomination in which it originated . Among the men affected by it was Rev. Jesse Head , a Methodist preacher , who became a strong abolitionist . His abolition views made a strong impression upon young Thomas Lincoln , whom he married to Nancy Hanks , efforts originating in the South , but one probably has left a monument which survives to the present day . Berea College had so large a share in this movement , and is to-day so true an exponent of the principles then championed , that some special attention must be devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bore a share in this movement , none have seen of the fruit of their labors a THE FIRST BUILDING OF BERBA cOLLEGE . // JOHN G. FEE . From a portrait in the early antislavery period . larger harvest than Rev. John G. Fee . He was born in Bracken County , Kentucky , Sept. 9 , i8i6 . His father inherited one slave and bought about a dozen more . The son , who inherited antislavery tendencies from his mother 's side of the house , entered Lane Theological Seminary , and became a pronounced abolitionist . D i s i nherited by his father and frowned upon by Presbytery and synod , he entered the lists against human servitude . Censured " for disturbing the peace of Zion , " taking his young wife with him with a faith like that of Abraham , he went out not knowing whither he went . A tract of land which his father had given him was mortgaged and afterwards sold , to buy a slave which his father was about to sell . Having bought the slave from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breach between him and his father and led to his being cut off with a dollar . From this time on he ran a gantlet of mobs and abuse , but held unswerving to his way . In 1853 an invitation from Cassius M. Clay was accepted to preach in Madison County and settle there on a small farm presented by Mr. Clay . Here with the help of others who gathered about him , Mr. Fee laid the foundations of Berea College . There was little to encourage when he began , the place being really a wilderness ; but the location was good because it was central . The same reasons existed for founding an antislavery school as those which called for the organization of antislavery churches . So in 1855 this school began its work . Its first teachers were William E. Lincoln and Otis B. Waters , students of Oberlin College . During the next LINCOLN HALL , BEREA COLLEGE . // THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS . year Mr. Fee was mobbed several times , but this was no new experience to him . The most violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he went to preach on the subject of Christian Union , being accompanied by Robert Jones , a native of the county , who was acting as colporteur for the American Missionary Association . There was apprehension of danger , and Mr. Fee had been consulted as to the propriety of carrying guns . He said : " No ; if I am disturbed I LADIES ' HALL , will appeal to the courts . " He believed in the right of self-defense , but opposed the practice of carrying arms . The sermon had commenced when an armed mob of sixty men surrounded the house . In answer to their demand that he " stop talking and come out , " he replied : " I am engaged in the exercise of a Constitutional right and a religious duty ; please do not interrupt " - and preached on . A second demand was made in the same words , with the same result : he still preached on . Then they seized him and dragged him out and swore they would hang him to the first tree unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His reply was : " I am in your hands . I would not harm you . If you harm me , the responsibility is with you . I can make no pledge ,  --  dtlty to God and my country forbid . " It had the effect of making them desist for a short time ; then they threatened to duck him in the river as long as life was in him unless he would promise to leave the county . He answered : " I am a native of the state . I believe slavery is wrong . I am acting for the good of my country and all her people . You will know my motives at the judgment . " He had proceeded but a few moments when one exclaimed : " We did n't come to hear a sermon ; let us do our work . " They stripped Robert Jones and gave him thirty-three lashes on the bare back , injuring him so that he could not walk the next day , and said to Mr. Fee : " We will give you five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never to return . " He knelt down and said : " I will take my suffering ; I can make no pledges . " The whip was raised above him , but BERBA COLLEGE . // one cried : " Do n't strike . " The man with the whip replied with an oath : " I feel that I ought to ; but I do n't like to go against my party . Get up and go home . " With Jones on his horse behind him and ruffians in front and rear , he rode three miles , when the mob left him ; and that night he preached again . The church at Berea became terribly alarmed and advised Mr. Fee to leave the state . For four weeks but one man , a brave Kentuckian , entered his yard , and none but women attended his church . The brave Cassius M. Clay , though still friendly to Mr. Fee , notwithstanding their difference on the higher law question ( Mr. Fee holding that a law confessedly contrary to the law of God ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was against his wish and his judgment , so he continued his labors , and the excitem e n t gradually died away . The real founder of the school as such was Prof. John A. R. Rogers , a native of Cornwall , Conn. , who still lives in usefulness and honor , in Hartford . Under him the school grew and prospered , his wife greatly aiding him in his labors . Mr. John G. Hanson , also a teacher in the school , brought to his work full faith in the enterprise , and soon a hundred pupils were gathered . And now the question came up and was long and earnestly discussed , whether if a colored person should apply for admission to the school he should be rejected . Although there was no law in Kentucky forbidding education to free colored persons , or even to a slave with his master 's consent , this question affected the whole community . The opinion of all the teachers and the founder was uniform and decided . " If any one made in God 's image , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will enable him to understand the revelation of God in Jesus Christ , he can not be rejected . " This sentiment not being acceptable to the slaveholding families , few of their sons remained in the school ; but increased difficulties only inspired the corps of workers to greater efforts , and much encouragement came to them , until there occurred in Virginia an event which shook the very foundations of the school , though it did not destroy them . When John Brown made his raid it was felt by some that an opportunity had arisen for the suppression of the school . All northern men were regarded as dangerous , and especially those who openly opposed slavery . It was announced in the newspapers that a box of rifles had been intercepted on its way to Berea . In view of this the boxes containing the household goods of Rev. John Boughton who was then moving to Berea were examined at night . At first all seemed right , but soon there was discovered what was declared to be an " infernal machine , " which however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molds . A mass meeting was held , violent speeches were made , and a committee PRESIDENT WILLIAM G. FROST AND REV . J. A. R. ROGERS . // 73 , of sixty-five of the wealthiest and most " respectable " citizens was appointed " to secure the removal from the state , peacefully if possible , within ten days , of Rev. John G. Fee , Rev. J. A. R. Rogers and such others as the committee think necessary for public quiet and safety . " Those warned to leave met for prayer and HOWARD HALL , BEREA COLLEGE . deliberation . Some thought it wise to go quietly away , while others counseled to remain until forcibly removed . No decision was reached except to appeal to the governor of the state for protection , which they did , though with little hope that it would avail them anything . The governor received the petition courteously , but replied that he could not engage to protect them from their fellow citizens who had resolved that they must go . At last it became plain to all that they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remaining away until the close of the war . One of those dramatic incidents which appear frequently on the stage but seldom in real life occurred at the Berea Commencement in June , 1896 , when Hon. John D. Harris , one of the leaders in the company which drove Professor Rogers from the state , met him on the platform . The incident of their former meeting was related , and the two men clasped hands before the great audience , which cheered to the echo . MOUNTAIN STUDENTS , BEEEA COLLEGE . // UNIVERSITY EXTENSION** LECTURERS . In 1865 the school was reopened , a charter for a college was obtained , students came in , and everything seemed promising , when an old question was brought up , in a practical form . In the early days of the school it had been decided that all persons of good moral character were eligible as pupils ; and now three colored youths applied . But one decision was possible . " All persons included negroes as well as white men ; they were persons of good moral character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three harmless youths walked in , one of them still wearing the blue in which he had been fighting for his country , half the s c h o o 1 walked out . Eventu all y , ho w e v e r , nearly all who left returned and became fast friends of Berea . At present about two-sevenths of the students of the college are colored . The school regulations make no distinction on account of color , and for twenty years there has been practically no discussion on the subject . In i86p Rev. E. H. Fairchild of Oberlin became president ; so continuing until his death in 1889 . During his administration new buildings were erected and the college grew rapidly in popularity and prosperity . Prof. Win . G. Frost of Oberlin , the present president , assumed the headship of the college in 1893 . He brought to his work great ability and enthusiasm , by which he has materially advanced its interests . The advent of the railroad has brought more students from the North , and the good effect of the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent . The healthful climate , the low cost of living , the opportunity for widened social experience and study , and the wholeA BEREA CLASS IN MANUAL TRAINING . // some influences pervading the institution , combine to make Berea increasingly popular among young people of the North who must obtain an education at low cost . These students prove a most wholesome acquisition , and thus make the school a prophecy of the time when North and South shall be lost in the new nation , and Mason and Dixon 's line shall be obliterated by the footsteps of those who cross it . Rev. A. D. Mayo , who for sixteen years has been traveling on educational pilgrimages through the South , exerting a greater influence perhaps than any other man in this field , profoundly believes that the elevation of the entire South , morally and educationally , is involved in the uplifting influences at work among these highlanders , among which influences Berea College stands facile princeps . He says : " In one sense , the two or three millions of white people who occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate rim that separates it from the lowlands is the most favorable point of *pproach for philanthropic effort in this great work . These people were almost unanimous in their devotion to the Union in the War ; and whenever reached by our armies they enlisted , forming of themselves a great army of a hundred and fifty thousand men , who followed the old flag . Their country to-day has a greater outcome in the near future than any region east of the Mississippi . Just on the border of this great educational mission field now stands Berea College , with better equipment , more valuable experience and larger opportunities for doing this work than any school with which I am acquainted . In religion , as in race , it is no respecter of persons . ' Its colony of Northern students is a great addition to the value of the school , and quite without a parallel in institutions of the kind . Its teaching force is superior to that of any school in the South supported by the North ; while , in itself , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive life of one of the foremost southern states . That such a school should exist , founded by southerners , and having large access to the southern people without excluding the colored , is in itself a finger of Providence . " But we must go back a little . With the antislavery sentiment whose history we have studied , there was also in the Cumberland Mountains region a strong patriotic sentiment which , as disunion came to be discussed , was readily molded either into a belief that patriotism meant the AN OUTPOST** SUNDAY SCHOOL TN NARROW GAP . // defense of the constitutional rights of the state , or that it consisted in loyalty to the cause of the united nation . The latter was a much more pronounced and potent sentiment than we sometimes remember . Many Kentuckians , for instance , went into the Confederate army , and for that fact the state gets full credit in the popular mind . But more than twice as many soldiers from Kentucky went into the Union army ,  --  a fact of considerable military significance in itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had scant recognition . When we reflect that Kentucky 's soldiers filled her whole quota , that they came as representatives not of the whole state but of the loyal portion only , that in spite of the large number of men who enlisted upon the other side Kentucky furnished the large number of Union troops which enlisted from her soil without draft or bonnty , we are ready to learn the meaning and spirit of a people from whom we have received this substantial evidence of loyalty . Nor was Kentucky alone in this devotion . Other southern states manifested within their borders the existence of a like spirit . A third of Tennessee remained loyal . Most if not all of the northern tier of states in the Confederacy exhibited the same characteristics , the intensity , breadth and expression of loyal sentiment varying , but never wholly absent . This sentiment found perhaps its best illustration in the case of West Virginia . There had always 1 ) een a natural dividing line between the eastern and western portions of the Old Dominion , a division which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the Ordinance of Secession was adopted by the state as a whole , the majority against it in the northwestern counties was overwhelming ; and early in i86i a convention met at Wheeling to move toward the organization of a new state , to be known as " Kanawha . " In 1863 , West Virginia became a state , with a constitution which provided for the emancipation of all children of slave parents , so that while the slaves then in bondage were to be retained , each child born in the new commonwealth was to be born free . Thus West Virginia passed through two revolutions , by one of which , as a part of Virginia , it passed involuntarily out of the Union , and another by which as a nebulous state evolving from chaos into political autonomy it returned to the Union which in sentiment it had never left . Truly a most picturesque revolution was that in PRIMITIVE MOUNTAIN 5CIIOOL . A BEREA STUDENT INSPECTING scHooLs . // in effect a separate state , lacking only a separate government . That the separation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beyond question .

The entire which a part of a state , denying the state 's right to secede , itself seceded from secession . Now , West Virginia is a part of the Sonthern Appalachian system , which has many claims to be treated as a unit and not alone as a part of the alleged " solid South . " Between this mountainous section and the adjacent portions of the South there are marked differences , geological , social and political . That which was done in West Virginia was done in one way or another in each of the states similarly situated . Kentucky did not secede , notwithstanding a strong proslavery and secession sentiment , partly because all through the state there was more or less of counter-sentiment , but chiefly because one whole section of the state , the southeastern section , embracing a third or more of its territory , was loyal and generally antislavery in its conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the case of West Virginia , withdraw and form a free state ; but the sentiment existed , and East Tennessee , too re- A mote from Mason and Dixon 's line to hang upon its borders as a loyal state opposed separation by a vote of nearly 70,000 to 5o , ooo , and only three delegates were elected .

Harris , however , called a special session of the Legislature , which on May 6th declared an ordinance of separation , THE HOPE OF THE MOUNTAINS . A 5CHOOL OF THE NEWER TYPE .

This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest of East Tennessee , which , in spite of 6,241 votes cast by Confederate soldiers in camp and officially counted for separation , gave a majority of 18,300 for the Union . Some of the counties of this mountainous region sent into the Union army more men than they had liable to military duty . While here and there a man entered the rebel army , the number of those entering the Union army was so large as sometimes to make up by its contribution of boys and old men the entire number that could have been drafted into the Union army ,  --  but all without a draft . There was a certain fierceness in their fighting which was remembered and remarked upon by northern soldiers who came to fight with them . The writer as a boy used to hear the stories told in his native town in a northern state which was very proud of its military record . The men who had gone from that town had first fired their own guns in battle , being forced into the very forefront at Perrysville before they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had seen hard service and acquitted themselves like men .

This sentiment was not imported . It was indigenous , and thrived in the soil out of which it sprang . It had its being before the troops from the N o r t h entered those sections of the South . On May 20 , i86i , occurred the first collision of arms in West Virginia , between the State troops , ** w h o recognized the Confederacy , and the loyal companies , two in number . The Confederate military marched into the town of Clarksburg , in Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t h e courthouse bell as a signal for the assembling of those mountain minute men , who quickly gathered at the county seat , under the command of Captains A. C. Moore and J. C. Vance , who demanded the surrender of the arms of the invaders . Terrified by the demonstration made against them , the rebels surrendered their arms , and then , like the King of France who having marched up a hill marched down again , they marched down from the hills of Clarksville , leaving their weapons in the hands of the loyal mountaineers . In estimating the patriotism of the mountaineers , it must be remembered that they were loyal not only despite the opposition and danger from the Confederate armies , but also without the stimulus of state enthusiasm and support which the northern volunteers received , and which southerners peculiarly missed ,  --  for state pride is strong in the mountains as elsewhere in Dixie . When Lincoln issued his first call for volunteers , Governor McGoffin of Kentucky replied : " Your despatch is received . In answer I say e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing her sister southern states . " But he reckoned in part without the host , for fourteen companies , four more than could be accepted , promptly offered their services to the Secretary of War , through Col. V. T. Guthrie . Nor were subsequent calls for troops less heartily answered , though both the governor , who faGREAT-GRANDMOTHER. vored the South , and the legislature , which was strongly Union , endeavored to preserve an armed neutrality . There was , however , in the case of Kentucky , a serious danger . If held for the Union it must be with the presence of armed troops ; and the sending of troops into the state in the day when it was endeavoring to preserve its precarious balance of " armed neutrality " was certain to be denounced as " invasion " and likely to result in the secession of the state . To lose this important border state // and bring the line of the Confederacy north to the line of the Ohio River and along its entire length would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that to hold the border states was one of our most important a n d difficult problems . Here then will appear the tremendous advantage of having on the ground a body of loyal men under arms : the state could be occupied by Union soldiers without invasion . This effort to preserve the appearance of neutrality became in time a farce , and neither side paid the slightest attention to it . But for a time it was important that it should not be needlessly disregarded . When therefore , the loyal volunteers began to rendezvous at Camp Dick Robinson , and Governor McGoffin protested , the reply of Lincoln was both shrewdly wise and unanswerably true ,  --  that this was no invasion , but the rising of loyal Kentuckians , officered by Kentuckians , commanded by a Kentuckian , Col. Robert Anderson of Fort Sumter fame , to defend their own soil from invasion from the Confederates . The " State Guards " were under command of Gen. S. B.

They afforded no nucleus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guards " soon found their occupation gone , for the Union troops were carefully kept out of Kentucky , except as they volunteered within it , or came , as they were beginning to come , from East Tennessee and states further south . There was nothing that by any pretext could be fought as a northern invasion . The officers of the rebel " State Guards " began to resign and go south , and the body rapidly disintegrated . The Union sentiment grew under this wholesome and sympathetic treatment . The legislature , which at first was uncertain , soon dared to oppose the governor 's measures in behalf of the South and hold him upon his own platform of neutrality . So from the 20th of May until the 3d of S e p t e m b er , Kentucky remained " neutral , " though all the while guarded by loyal Kentuckians under arms . Collins 's Annals of Kentucky , Feb. i , i86i , records : " Preacher Conway is reported to have said in Boston that Abraham Lincoln would like to have ALONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOUNTAIN . // God on his side , but he must have Kentucky . " ' Making due allowance for the hyperbole , it may now be said that Lincoln did not set too high a value upon Kentucky . On April 26 , i86i , President Lincoln in a conversation in Washington with Hon. Garret Davis of Kentucky stated distinctly that he wQuld make no military movement upon any state or section that did not offer armed resistance to the authorities of the United States or the execution of the laws of Congress ; that he contemplated no military operations that would require him to march troops into or across Kentucky , and therefore he should not attempt it ; that if Kentucky or her people should seize upon the United States post at Newport , it would be his duty and he might attempt to retake it ; that it was the duty of Kentucky to furnish the quota of troops for which he made the requisition up6n her , but that he had neither power , right nor ( disposition to coerce her ; and if she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , the latter would make no war upon her . The next day he told Hon. Warner L. Underwood of Kentucky that he hoped Kentucky would stand by the government in the present difficuLties ; but if she would not do that , let her stand still and take no hostile part against it ,  --  and no hostile step should tread her soil . Although it soon became evident that the position of neutrality would prove untenable , the state had come to entertain a strong feeling of kindness toward President Lincoln for respecting it , and was ready for his sake as well as her own to resent the first violation of neutrality , especially if it should come from the Confederates . On September 3 the Confederate General Polk moved across the line from Tennessee , and occupied Columbus , Kentucky , the better to defend himself against a Union force on the Missouri side of the lVlississippi . A few days afterxvard Zolli coffer pushed through Cumberland Gap to Cumberland Ford , and afterward to Mill Spring . The policy of forbearance had prevailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky until it was doubly invaded from the South .

The proclamation was issued . General Polk replied , offering to withdraw if the Union troops would do so , but he was ordered to withdraw unconditionally . The United States flag was raised on the State House at Frankfort , and the state was pledged to active support of the government . General Anderson , who had been in command since May 28 by orders from the government at Washington , now assumed general command by order of the legislature of Kentucky and removed his headquarters to Louisville , and the work of raising troops went rapidly on . Before the close of i86i Kentucky had furnished to the Union army 28 regiments of infantry , 6 of cavalry , and 3 batteries .

McGoffin appealed to Ca*sar , and to C*esar he was compelled to go . But it must never be forgotten that the thing which made it possible to humor the state in its whim until the Confederates themselves invaded it was that the Union had on the ground this strong body of loyal Kentuckians . At this distance , we are able to see that those spoke wisely at the time who endorsed the course of President Lincoln . Among the sensible comments was that of the Albany Evening Journal , which said ( October // i8 , 1862 ) : " Gentlemen endowed with more backbone than discretion continue to speak contemptuously of the loyalty of Kentucky . But they will do well to remember how much the success of our army in the west has been owing to the attitude of that state . They will do well to remember that had she gone over into the ranks of the rebel states the seat of war would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio ; that instead of capturing Memphis and Nashville we should be defending Cincinnati and St. Louis ; that instead of penetrating with our armies into the heart of the insurgent country we should have all we could do during the winter and spring to defend our own frontier . They will do well to remember that Kentucky even neutral would be worth fifty thousand men to us ; that in her present loyal position she is potent almost to decide the fortunes of the war . Let us generously give her credit not only for what she has done , but for what she has prevented . Let us admit that without her aid to-day the Southwest would be irretrievably lost to the Union . " Kentucky did not maintain her neutrality without protests from both sides . That from the South voiced itself in appeals , tender and oft repeated , reminding Kentuckians of the ties of blood and common interest which bound them to their friends in the sister states which had left the Union . A specimen of the poetry of the period in which this feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its literary quality , from the Memphis Appeal : " Kentucky boys and girls have weFrom us ye may not take them ; Sad hearted will ye give them up And for the foe forsake them ? " Oh , Tennessee , twin sister , grieves To take thy hand at parting , And feel that from its farewell grasp A brother 's blood is starting . " It must not be ! - Kentucky , come ! Virginia loudly calls thee ; And Maryland defenseless stands , To share what fate befalls thee . " Come ere the tyrant 's chain is forged , From out the war cloud looming ; Come ere thy palsied knee is bent To hopeless ruin dooming . " But the appeal for the Union was not less strong and tender . A notable example is the following , based upon the inscription on Kentucky 's contribution to the Washington monument in i8*o : " Kentuckyshe was the first state to enter the Union after the adoption of the Constitution , and she will be the last to leave it . " " The first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade and die . ' Oh , first-born daughter of the land , Wilt thou thy sacred vow deny ? By all the lofty memories bright That crown with light thy glorious past* Oh , speak again those words of mightThe first to come , to leave the last . ' " The land for which our fathers fought , The glorious heritage they gave , The just and equal laws they wrought ,  - -  Rise in your might that land to save . No parricidal daughter thou , No stain be on thy fealty cast , But faithful to thy boast and vow , Be first to come , to leave the last . ' " Oh , list not to the siren voice That wooes thee to a traitor cause . But answer , I have made my choice , I will support my country 's laws . ' Go , spurn disunion 's foul cabal . All party ties behind thee cast ; And still at honor 's , duty 's call Be first to come , to leave the last ! ' It is not too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment and sent more than a fourth of the troops she raised into the Confederate army , she should be remembered as a loyal state , and that that which held her for the Union , politically as well as in the result of her military operations , was the loyal sentiment of her own people , scattered throughout her area , but most of all those in the mountainous section of the state . That the Union and antislavery sentiment of the mountains were not // exactly coterminous is illustrated in the career of Parson 3rownlow , who upheld slavery while defending the Union . William Gannaway Brownlow was born in Wythe County , Virginia , August 29 , 1805 , and died in Knoxville , Tenn. , April 29 , 1877 . Left an orphan at the age of eleven , he secured the rudiments of an education , and became first a carpenter and then a Methodist preacher . Preaching in John C. Calhoun 's district , he achieved great notoriety for his opposition to Calhoun and his support of John Quincy Adams , then , in 1828 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Knoxville in the heart of the Tennessee mountains , he became in 1838 editor of the Knoxville Whig . His trenchant editorials , his hot debates , political and religious , and his fearlessness won for him a national reputation . He thus describes himself in 1862 : " I am known throughout the length and breadth of the land as the Fighting Parson ' ; while I may say , without the charge of egotism , that no man is more peaceable , as my neighbors will testify . Always poor and always oppressed with security debts , few men in my section and of my limited means have given away more in the course of each year to charitable objects . I have never been arraigned in the church for any immorality ; I have never played a card ; I never was a profane swearer ; I never drank a dram of liquor , until within a few yearswhen it was taken as a medicine ; I never had a cigar or chew of tobacco in my mouth ; I never was in attendance at a theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed their running , save on the fair grounds of my own county ; I never courted but one woman , and her I married . " Although Mr. Browulow had no sympathy for advocates of abolition , and reviled those who thought that " the chief end of man is nigger , " as he expressed it , his loyalty to the Union was unbounded . As the war approached , his editorials and addresses became more pronounced , if possible , and brought down upon him the opposition of the rebel element . After the Union flag had disappeared from every other building in Knoxville , it floated from his house . His paper was suppressed by the Confederates ; he was driven from his home , captured and imprisoned ; but in the whale 's belly of a rebel prison he proved as uncomfortable an occupant as Jonah , and was spewed forth at length by advice of Judah P. Benjamin , Confederate Secretary of War , to be set within the Union lines . Brownlow announced that he had done more than the devil had ever done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secession . Coming North , he addressed large audiences and awakened great enthusiasm in favor of the enlistment of troops and the vigorous prosecution of the war . He was afterward returned to Tennessee and resumed the publication of the Knoxville Whig , to which he added the sub-title , Rebel Ventilator . On the reconstruction of the state in 1865 , he was elected governor , and served two terms , vigorously enforcing measures to restore the Union , proclaiming martial law in a part of the state during the Ku-Klux outrages , and opposing as a mistake the giving of the ballot to the negro . As a specimen of the style of Parson Brownlow , and an authoritative statement of his principles , the following quotation will be of interest : " You are correct in supposing me free from the taint of abolitionism . I have fought the agitators of the slavery question at the North for the last two and twenty years , during which time I have edited a Whig paper in Tennessee . With my Goveminent , and its Constitution and laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who may be President for the time being . This rebellion is utterly without cause . Nothing but force will put it down , and hence there never was a more necessary . just and lawful war than this , to preserve a necessary , just and noble government against inexcusable , unnatural and villainous rebellion . This rebellion , on the part of the South , originated in falsehood , fraud and perjury , and the men who inaugurated it and are now at its head are as had men as ever agitated the slavery question in New England , or any who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire , for having flagrantly violated God 's law through a long and eventful life of wickedness ! Knowing this , // or rather believing it , as I honestly do , I can have no sympathy with the men in the South who have brought about this war and are urging it on . No mad-dog cry of the invasion of the sacred soil of the South by the vandals of the North can blind my eyes to the facts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon those who are fighting to preserve the government . Men need not talk to me about the unnatural , fratricidal and horrible war Lincoln is waging ! Why is it unnatural ? I think it the most natural thing in the world for a nation to fight for its government against a vile rebellion which has never yet been able to allege an excuse . That any portion of the people should stand aloof from such a cause is indeed unnatural . " 1 never look through telescopes made of cotton stalks . . . . and I tell the misguided men of the South to undeceive themselves . Look at battles as they occur , and at chances as they are . The deception they are imposing upon the honest masses is only temporary . It will become more and more apparent as their humbugged victims draw near to the sober realities of a war which must terminate fatally for the interests of the South . . . . If the Federal Government prevails , it will prove that the Union was a nationality ; if the cotton states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union was a partnership during pleasure . In other words if we have a Government I want to know it ; and this war will determine the issue . That Parson Browniow had opposition in East Tennessee itself need not be taken to imply that the region was disloyal . Such sentiments as his , expressed in the most uncompromising manner , would have met with opposition anywhere in the days just preceding the war . As attention has been directed to the loyalty of West Virginia and Southeastern Kentucky , it will be well to consider not only Parson Browulow , but his constituency , the loyal mountaineers of East Tennessee . As in the case of Kentucky and Virginia , there is a natural line of cleavage between the eastern and western portions of Tennessee . Had the state lain with its length north and south , and with its mountainous end bounded by Mason and Dixon 's line , there would have been another seceding state from the list of the seceded . East Tennessee was once a separate territory . In May , 1783 , North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the failure of which left the new territory in doubt as to its own status . After two years of uncertainty , it elected delegates and organized the State of Franklin . The new state did not long retain a separate existence . There remained , however , a marked difference between the two sections of the state , and it still seems to a resident of the mountainous portion as necessary to say that he lives in East Tennessee , as to a dweller in the now severed portion of Virginia that he lives in West Virginia . The people of East Tennessee-those of them who know about it-are as proud of the fact that the records of Franklin were once hidden by the clerk of the state in a cave as the inhabitants of Connecticut are of the certainly not more historical hiding of their charter in an oak . East Tennessee had few slaves . In i86o they numbered only one-tenth of the population . The fields of cotton there were small and the product was for domestic consumption . When Tennessee began to consider secession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently opposed it , though hooted and burned in effigy in other parts of the South , and not escaping censure in his own part . Still , Andrew Johnson at his best was at that time a fit representative of the best sentiment in East Tennessee , and deserves no little credit for his loyal and outspoken opposition to secession . When Zollicoffer invaded Kentucky , East Tennessee became overrun with Confederate soldiers . The loyal people suffered greatly . Men were arrested on mere suspicion of being loyal , and thrown into prison . Some bridges having been burned to impede the rebels , those suspected of burning them were hanged without mercy , and it appears probable that some thus summarily executed were innocent . Col. XV . B. Wood in a let- // 85 ter to the Confederate Secretary of War , from Knoxville , where he had command of the rebels , enlarged upon his difficulties . The sentiment was hostile to the Confederate government , the people were slaves of Johnson and Maynard , the courts would not convict men who had committed crimes against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated as soon as taken . It is altogether probable that he told the truth , and in no way overstated the difficulties of his position . The oath which the inhabitants were compelled to take on pain of banishment and confiscation of property came to be taken by those who did not flee to the woods ,  --  " from the teeth outward , " as they somewhat grimly said . The Confederate commander at Kno*cville wrote to Secretary Benjamin that the vast majority of the people about him were as loyal to the Union as were the people of Ohio . On April i8 , 1862 , Gen. E. Kirby Smith issued from his headquarters at Knoxville a proclamation to the citizens who had " been misled into the commission of treasonable acts through ignorance of their duties and obligations to their state " and had " fled across the mountains and joined our enemies under the persuasion of supposed friends but designing enemies , " and offered thirty days ' grace to any who would return to their homes and take an oath to support the constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they failed to improve it , their wives and families would be deported from the Confederacy . There was a large promise of protection to all who were quietly cultivating their farms , the occasion of the proclamation appearing to be the fear lest the absence of so many men in the Union army should leave the entire population at home dependent upon the Confederate army for support . The Provost Marshal adds a warning : " All who leave after this date , with a knowledge of the above acts , will have their families sent after them . The women and children must be taken care of by husbands and fathers , either in East Tennessee or in the Lincoln Government . " To homesick soldiers , away from home , far beyond the limits of their own geographical knowledge in many cases , such a proclamation7 communicated with an added burden of home fears and rumors , must have been a temptation to desertion . What an inviting picture it must have presented-the rough little farm on the hillside again under cultivation , and the mountaineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protecting his home ! On the other hand , how dark was the prospect ,  --  the rebel army in possession , the home unprotected , the family about to face starvation or banishment out into the world that had suddenly grown so large , with no prospect of being united again ! Yet the number of East Tennesseans in the Union army did not decrease , but increased , until there were 30,000 bearing arms in defense of the Union . Statistics furnished by the War Department show two things concerning the numbers of soldiers furnished by the border states ,  --  first , that the numbers were very large , and second that the length of service was one of long average . The following figures are official , and indicate the aggregate numbers of soldiers furnished by five of the border states east of the Mississippi containing each a mountainous section : West Virginia 32,068 Maryland 50,316 Kentucky 79,025 31,092 North Carolina 3,156 Total 195,657 Had all these states by draft and bounty filled their entire quota undeV the different calls - a thing which few Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little in advance of these figures-219,33o . Of the 195,657 men who enlisted from // these five states , it is not too high an estimate that I 50,000 were from the mountainous portions ; and to these should be added considerable numbers who moved across the border and enlisted in other states , besides those who entered the Union army from the hills of Alabama , Georgia and Mississippi . When the 195,657 from these five states alone are reduced according to the War Department 's method to a three-years ' standard , there appears an aggregate of 169,371 who entered the army for three years . We sometimes forget how nearly even hung the balance of our fortunes in the late war , and what an advantage the Confederates possessed in having their troops already upon the ground . Can we imagine what it meant to us to have upon the ground , without the delay and uncertainty of transportation and the danger of acclimatization , an army of more than 200,000 men ? It is hardly too much to say that the tide of battle was turned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added them to those of the enemy ,  - -  who can tell what this difference of 400,000 men would have meant to the Confederate army ? At this distance the loyal sentiment of these states , which was strongest and most representative of public sentiment in the mountains , seems to us to have been a sine qua non . It held Kentucky in the Union . It held East Tennessee with its 30,000 soldiers after the state itself had seceded . It divided Virginia , and of the loyal half added a new star to the flag . It removed the war from the Ohio two hundred miles to the southward , and left our own borders relatively secure while we pushed the war into the heart of the Confederacy . It furnished us with more than 200,000 soldiers on the ground , familiar with the region and adapted to the climate , who proved among our best and most aggressive fighters for the preservation of the Union . The mountaineers did not always fight according to the laws of nations . They were fond of ambush and sometimes prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own section of the country , where stores contained something more than the few dollars ' worth of bare necessities found in the average mountain shop , their hearts often yearned for the Babylonish garment for the wives at home . There is no more pathetic fact than that the second thing a mountain trooper sought to secure to carry away with him from the sacking of a store was a bolt of cotton calico , which he hoped amid all the uncertainties of war to carry with him until he should be at home again and therewith attire in a manner beyond the glory of Solomon the wife whom he had seen only in linsey woolsey of her own spinning . This was the second article for which he strove . The first thing he sought for was a pair of baby shoes ,  --  treasures still so rare in the mountains that they must have been almost unknown in those days ,  --  to be stowed away safely in his knapsack in hope of seeing them one day on little feet that pattered bare over the puncheon floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under command of the government , but carried on the war in a manner that suited themselves , and did not stop in every case with the fall of Richmond . Most of the intense mountain feuds of past years , some of them continuing to the present time , are legacies of the war . The writer had occasion to explore the section covered by the Stamper-Underwood war of a dozen or more years ago . He found some even of the new cabins with logs in the loft notched for the poking out of rifles in case necessity should demand the conversion of the house into a fort . He enjoyed the privilege of spending a night with old George Stamper , who had led one faction until the other had // been exterminated , and found him a rather shrewd , sensible and hospitable old man , who gave no indication that his conscience troubled him for fighting out the war to a finish , and with a decided tendency to talk upon religious subjects , being , as appeared , a church member in good standing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher . The mountaineer was no hundred-days ' man . He enlisted for the war and did not always receive notice of its termination . It is not surprising that the extent of this patriotism which existed in the heart of the Confederacy has not been fully realized . Even the Northern soldiers were not in the best position fully to appreciate its scope and influence . Very many of the soldiers were in no mood for too fine discrimination and , especially in the earlier part of the war , when this section perhaps suffered most , regarded all men south of Mason and Dixon 's line as disloyal . There are no stories more sad than those told by some of these mountain families of the disappointment which they experienced when the Union soldiers from other states first came to them . Their professions of loyalty were treated with scorn , their hogs were shot , their fields stripped of the ripening ears , their kitchens and smokehouses robbed , and they were left in deeper poverty after the arrival of their protectors . Fresh pork and green corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on army fare , and the fields of the mountaineers were small and soon stripped . But pork and corn bread were the dependence of the mountain families , some of whom were left face to face with starvation by the same army in which their own brothers and fathers and sons were fighting . Yet they remained loyal . What other people were so sorely tested ? There was an honest effort made by many officers to prevent depredations , and the soldiers did not consider themselves to have taken much because they received so little . But that little was all that many families had . No people felt more heavily than the mountaineers the burden of the war . Its little finger there was thicker than its loins in other sections of greater wealth and free from actual invasion . They had abundant opportunity to alter their convictions and to go with the South . Yet spite of the double disadvantage of their isolated position , their sundering themselves from those who as it seemed at first were better able to understand and protect them , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure of momentous affairs which compelled attention , this section remained loyal . If the fact was overlooked at the time , it deserves recognition now , and that of the most cordial and practical sort . Let us never forget that when the fate of the nation hung trembling in the balance , this secession from secession , this imperium in imperio , cast its sword into the scale and turned it in favor of the undivided nation .
