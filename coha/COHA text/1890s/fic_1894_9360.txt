PREFATORY NOTE In " Barbara Frietchie " and " Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines " , Mr. Fitch continued the picturesque historical vein , so successfully begun in " Beau Brummell " , " Frdric Lematre " , " His Grace de Grammont " and " Nathan Hale . " His love of a period was not an artificial taste with him ; he had the inestimable ability of absorbing atmosphere , and of giving to his detail little intimate touches which resulted in realism amidst romantic action . And even though there is such wide contrast between the first two plays in this volume and " The Climbers " , one can easily detect in " Captain Jinks " , for example , characteristic flashes foreshadowing the satirist of the later social plays . It is not so easy a matter to re-create a period convincingly , however picturesque the details and however romantic the plot . Mr. Fitch 's inventions were always entertaining . But it was because of his ability to make himself a part of the lime , place , and manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Barbara Frietchie " has an intimate touch of the South during the Civil War , without being flamboyantly colored . " Captain Jinks "  --  as excellent in technique as Sir Arthur Wing Pinero 's " Trelawny of the ' Wells ' " , and excelling Mr. Edward Sheldon 's later attempt , in " Romance " , to embody the old-time flavor of New York city ,  --  revealed , without effort or pose , that intimacy and contemporaneousness which are to be found in some old Journal , written by an eye-witness . In such achievements as these " costume " plays , Mr. Fitch showed exceptional ability , and won popular distinction . " Barbara Frietchie " deals delicately with the love romance of Mr. Fitch 's mother and father . In plot it is simple , and it is theatrically effective , as well as theatrically reflective of all the excitement of war , without the panoply of war . As soon as it was announced that Miss Julia Marlowe would appear in the historical rle , the papers began to speculate as to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun already to scold me about lying , " Fitch wrote to some friend . Naturally , it would have been impossible for him to gain much romantic interest by keeping his heroine an old woman , to accord with historical tradition . A concession had to be granted him at the very outset . But there are always exact critics who can allow a dramatist no latitude ; and even before " Barbara Frietchie " was produced , Mr. Fitch found himself opposed by the Press . This necessitated his printing on his program a disclaimer as to the historical exactness of his situation , and declaring his sole ambition to picture the spirit and atmosphere of a particular period , through a delicate , imaginary story . Both the playwright and the actress were amply rewarded . Some of Mr. Fitch 's severest critics could not but recognize in " Barbara Frietchie " much ingenuity and much cumulative effect . In the preparations for the production of this play he exhibited the same particularity , as regards costuming and stage setting , that marked his " Nathan Hale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he based the story of his play on some definite incident or situation brought to his notice or coming under his direct observation . From a mere suggestion he would often gradually evolve his plot . But " Captain Jinks " was inspired purely by his love for an historical period . And we believe that its source of being lay entirely in the fact that he had often declared his interest in the manners and customs of 1872 . The real seeds for this play , in which Miss Ethel Barrymore gained her first distinction as a " star " , are to be found in the popular songs , " Shoo fly ! Do n't bother me " , and " I 'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines . " " The Climbers " marks a definite departure on the part of the playwright , both in technique and in approach . When Professor Brander Matthews was asked to open the Fitch Memorial Lectureship on the Drama , established at Amherst College by the dramatist 's mother  --  during one of the discourses , he said in substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An author knows best the contemporary life immediately about him , and can deal with it easily . But for historical setting , he must reach the ideals through research and reading , and often his estimates are not accurate , and often they are devoid of spontaneity . The drama , based on contemporary life , in time takes on an historical value . In this way , Clyde Fitch 's " The Climbers " will be a definite document to the social historians of the next century . It has the same grasp of existing conditions that is manifested in Howells 's " The Rise of Silas Lapham " and in Mark Twain 's " Life on the Mississippi . " In other words , Mr. Fitch 's most distinctive and his most mature vein began to assert itself in this play  --  his vein of the commonplace raised to a height of refreshing satire , which was brilliant and unusual . In fact , the very unusualness of the opening scene resulted in " The Climbers " being sent travelling from manager 's office to manager 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her a brilliant company for its production . This change in interest , which now marked the work of the playwright , began to find expression in his comments on the theatre . " The plays that have lasted , " Mr. Fitch once wrote , " are valuable to us as literature and as documents . Technique never has kept a play alive through the centuries . Technique alone is machinery , and we improve all machinery year by year . Outside of their literature , many of Shakespeare 's plays are documents of hourly life and manners in the days of Elizabeth , and if you are interested in knowing what life was in town and country before and during the Restoration , read Wycherley , Congreve , Beaumont and Fletcher . You will find there the small human document you wo n't get out of history , per se . So Sheridan reproduces the social Georgian era , Oscar Wilde the late Victorian , and in France , Lavadan , Hervieu , and Capus are giving the Paris and France of the twentieth century for future generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel myself very strongly the particular value  --  a value which , rightly or wrongly , I can not help feeling inestimable  --  in a modern play of reflecting absolutely and truthfully the life and environment about us ; every class , every kind , every emotion , every motive , every occupation , every business , every idleness I Never was life so varied , so complex ; what a choice , then ! Take what strikes you most , in the hope it will interest others . Take what suits you most to do  --  what perhaps you can do best  --  and then do it better . Be truthful , and then nothing can be too big , nothing should be too small , so long as it is here , and there ! Apart from the question of literature , apart from the question of art , reflect the real thing , with true observation and with sincere feeling for what it is and what it represents , and that is art and literature in a modern play . If you inculcate an idea in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you  --  and for your audience . In fact , there is small hope for your play as a play , if you have n't some small idea in it somewhere and somehow , even if it is hidden  --  it is sometimes better for you if it is hidden , but it must of course be integral . Some ideas are mechanical . Then they are no good . These are the ideas for which the author does all the work , instead of letting the ideas do the work for him . One should write what one sees ; but observe under the surface . It is a mistake to look at the reflection of the sky in the water of theatrical convention . Instead , look up and into the sky of real life itself . " Writing from Carlsbad , on June 13 , 1900 , Mr. Fitch said , " I finished ' The Climbers ' today , and I think the last act may be the best thing I 've done . I feel this act has something in it besides the theatre ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of bad taste in the dress-selling scene , and the general critical opinion was that such a situation could never have happened among that " set " of people . But , as a matter of fact , the incident did actually occur in New York city , and no sooner was it told to Mr. Fitch than he used it with an unerring sense of its dramatic effectiveness . Montrose J. Moses , Virginia Gerson . New York , July , 1915 . TO JULIA MARLOWE How much Barbara and I both owe to you ! You crept into her very heart ( and mine ! ) , and like the Good Fairy at the birth of the Princess , endowed her with her best gift , your own Personal Charm !

Main text THE FIRST ACT A Street in Frederick . After Suffer Across the brick pavement , three homes stand facing us , two of red with white trimmings in the early Colonial style of architecture , the other house , on our Right , of wood , painted brown , and placed back from the street , with a small garden and a picket fence . In the garden is a round bed of scarlet geraniums , and a honeysuckle vine grows over the front door . The street turns a corner around the garden , where a big lilac bush grows . The centre house belongs to the Frietchies , and over its steps is a balcony , supported on four Corinthian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the houses in the street are open , and there are lamps lit in many of the lower rooms . The house with the garden belongs to the Royce family ; the house on the left is the home of Col. Negly , his son and daughter . The theatre is darkened , and " Dine " is played once by the orchestra . Then the curtain rises slowly and softly without orchestral music . It is the starry twilight of a languorous Summer night , and the air is tremulous and full of the scent of honeysuckle and jasmine . On the steps of the Frietchie house sit two girls , Laura and Sue Royce . They are pretty , rather thoughtless young creatures , but sweet-tempered and warm-hearted . They wear soft , light dresses , open at the neck , and are bare-armed . Through an open window Barbara is heard at the piano singing " Kathleen Mavourneen . " The light on the stage is soft and dim . On the farther stoop sit Sally Royce and Edgar Strong , a young couple in the heyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first verse of " Kathleen Mavourneen , " and Laura , joining in softly , sings the last line with her . Barbara , after a moment 's strumming , begins singing a second verse . Two small children run past , playing hide-and-go-seek . Hearing Barbara ; they stop to listen beneath her window , holding hands , till she finishes " Kathleen , " when they romp away , continuing their sport . Sue . Sue Royce Calls across to the Negly steps . Sally ! Laura . Laura Royce Leaning over and touching Sue . Sh ! She 's got a beau with her . Sue . Sue Royce No , it 's her brother ! Mammy Lu , a dear old colored woman , comes down the street with a market basket , and passes through the gate into the Royce house . Laura turns her head and watches the Negly steps . Sue calls again . Sally ! Sally . S ally Negly What ? Sue . Sue Royce Come on over on our steps . Sally . Sally Negly I ca n't ; I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Sue . I told you so . The two girls titter . It 's Edgar Strong ! Sue joins in with Barbara and sings with her . Sally and Strong are seen rising on their steps . She follows him coyly to the bottom step , where they linger over a tender good-by . She fastens a spray of honeysuckle from her dress into the lapel of his coat . He starts to go , but stops at the corner of the steps and they say good-by once more . Laura . Laura Royce He 's going ! Craning her neck to see surreptitiously . Sue . Sue Royce I wonder if he 'll pass here ? Barbara , having finished " Kathleen Mavourneen , " sings " Maryland , My Maryland . " Strong , leaving Sally , who goes into her house , comes slowly past the other girls , going down the street . A short distance from Sally 's steps , he turns and looks back , but she has gone in . He comes on , absorbed , unconscious of the presence of Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both " ahem ! " pointedly . He does n't hear them , and turns the Royce corner . The two girls titter . Laura . Laura Royce Laughing . Sally 's got a real stylish beau , has n't she ? A pause . The girls lean back against the railings , fanning themselves . Sue . Sue Royce Getting up . Is Barbara going to sing the whole evening ? Why does n't she come out on the steps ? She leans over the railing , trying to look into the Frietchie parlor window . She calls . Barbara ! A light is seen in an upper window of Sally 's house . Laura . Laura Royce Sh ! She 's very sentimental to-night , and it 's not Jack Negly either . Sue . Sue Royce Turning and leaning with her back against the railing . Who , then ? Laura . Laura Royce Captain Trumbull  --  Sue . Sue Royce The Yankee ! Law ! what a flirt she is ! Why , Jack Negly 's been her acknowledged beau ! Laura . Laura Royce You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as many beaux as she already ! Barbara , having finished " Maryland , My Maryland , " sings " Listen to the Mocking Bird . " Sue . Sue Royce Oh ! if you call walking out to the cemetery every evening with one fellow making him your beau ! But Barbara 's been caught within a week down the Hagerstown pike with two different men 's arms about her . Laura . Laura Royce Well , I reckon you wish you could be caught like that ! Sue . Sue Royce Laughing good-naturedly . Yes , indeedy , I should n't mind a bit ! Sitting down on the top step . The two girls again subside into silence . Barbara 's voice steals out sweetly through the open windows with the " Mocking Bird " refrain . A young couple , arm in arm , stroll absorbedly past , on their way back from the usual Lovers ' Walk of the town  --  where the willows weep and hearts stop beating underneath cool white marble names . Sally . Sally Negly Calls , leaning out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura . Laura Royce Yes . Sue . Sue Royce Come on down . Sally closes the blinds and disappears . Laura . Laura Royce Calls . Barbara ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Inside . Well ? Laura . Laura Royce Sally Negly 's coming over ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Inside . Glad it 's not her brother ! Runs her hand over all the piano keys from base to treble . Sue . Sue Royce Oh , my ! Is n't she airy ! She looks down the street . Here comes Hal Boyd . Laura . Laura Royce What do I care ! Tossing her head . Sue . Sue Royce Oh , what a fine tail our cat 's got ! You seemed to care a good deal at the picnic last week . Laura . Laura Royce You need n't throw any stones ! You were in a glass house at the picnic yourself  --  with Arthur Frietchie . Which way is he coming ? Looking slyly up and down the street . Sue . Sue Royce He is n't ! I was only making believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , you mean thing ! Sally . Sally Negly Who has come out from her house , joins them . She is perhaps more vivacious than the other two . About the wrists of her bare arms she has tied little black velvet bows . It is well known in Frederick that once upon a time she really slapped a young man who kissed her against her will . Why is n't Barbara out ? Sue . Sue Royce Very pointedly . No men here yet ! Sally . Sally Negly Jack 's coming right over . Sitting on the lowest step . Sue . Sue Royce Calls . Barbara , Jack 's coming over ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Inside , emphatically , and accompanying herself with chords upon the piano . Not at home ! She begins singing " Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still . " The Three Graces on the steps exchange glances . Sally . Sally Negly That 's just how she treats Jack now ! Laura . Laura Royce And every one 's talking about Barbara and that ornry Yankee ! Sue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's nice . Sally . Sally Negly He 's your enemy and you ought to hate him ! I sha n't have anything more to do with Bab if she does n't stop seeing Captain Trumbull . Sue . Sue Royce He has a lovely mustache . Sally . Sally Negly It is n't the mustache that makes the man ! N. B.  --  Edgar Strong 's face is very smooth . Jack comes out of the Negly house and approaches . He is a handsome young fellow of twenty . He was a harum-scarum boy , and he is a lovable , impetuous youth , with his heart on his sleeve . Laura . Laura Royce Barbara 's a true Southern girl ; I do n't understand her having him around . Sue . Sue Royce Good evening , Jack . Oh , my , is n't it warm ? They all exchange a greeting . Jack . Jack Negly Stands directly in front of the steps , his back to the audience . Where 's Barbara ? All three motion to the parlor . Laura . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Negly Calls . Barbara ! She stops singing a moment to hear who is speaking . Jack repeats " Barbara ! " She at once begins singing again emphatically , pointedly . He goes up the steps between the girls , and , standing on the top step , calls more loudly . Jack . Jack Negly Barbara ! Laura . Laura Royce She hears you ! Jack . Jack Negly I must see you . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Inside . I 'm not at home  --  to cowards ! A moment 's silence . Jack stands hurt . Sally rises and seizes her brother 's hand , saying " Jack ! " Barbara begins singing again . Then Jack quickly and firmly enters the house , and , a moment after , Barbara 's singing ends abruptly . Sally . Sally Negly Eagerly . Would it be wrong to listen ? Sue . Sue Royce Standing up as near to the window as she can and leaning far over the railing , listens hard . Decidedly ! And , anyway , I ca n't hear a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steps . Two Union Soldiers stroll down the street , one smoking , the other with a rose between his teeth . As they pass the Frietchie stoop the girls stop speaking . Sally . Sally Negly Yankees ! The girls on the lower steps swish their dresses up out of the way of contamination . The soldier with a rose , to tease the Southern young ladies , throws the flower at Laura . She plucks it from her dress , where it falls , and throws it after him with a loud " Eeh ! " of disgust , and at once the three girls together begin singing " Dixie " with unmistakable emphasis , till the laughing soldiers are out of hearing . Sally . Sally Negly Sitting beside Laura . I wish Bab would be Jack 's sweetheart for good and all . We ca n't do anything with him home now . He locks himself up for whole days , and answers so queerly sometimes when you speak to him ! Mother cries about it . Sue . Sue Royce Did Bab ever lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Soldiers ' Ball she danced every schottische with him ! Laura . Laura Royce She 's mad because he wo n't fight for the South . Sally . Sally Negly She 's no right to be mad with him for that , when she 's flirting with a Yankee . Sue . Sue Royce And while they 're in possession of our town , too ! Sally . Sally Negly I wish her brother were here . Sue . Sue Royce Rising proudly . Yes , he would n't allow it . Leaning over again to try and listen . The other two girls exchange amused glances at Sue 's expense . Sally . Sally Negly Of course you think Arthur Frietchie would n't allow anything ! Sue . Sue Royce Trying to listen . Well , Arthur Frietchie 's with Stonewall Jackson , brave boy ! And that 's more than you can say for your beau . Sally . Sally Negly The only reason Edgar Strong did n't go was , I said I 'd never speak to him again if he did ! Sue . Sue Royce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to go all the same . But I kept my word ; I did n't speak to him ! Sally . Sally Negly What did you do ? Sue . Sue Royce Hugged and kissed him ! Laura . Laura Royce The whole town is angry about Barbara . All the vestrymen of our church were at the house , this afternoon , begging Mr. Frietchie to forbid Barbara 's seeing Captain Trumbull any more . Sue . Sue Royce Bab adores her father . I wonder what would happen if she were called on to choose between the two ? There is a sadden loud discord on the piano . The girls look up , Laura and Sally rising . Gracious ! There must be a row ! All three , with their arms linked about each other , lean over the side railing , trying to overhear . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Inside . Oh ! How dare you ! how dare you ! Jack 's voice is heard , strained and harsh , as if speaking beyond his control . Jack . Jack Negly Inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you hear me , Bab ? I 'll go and fight if you want it ! I 'll go ! But not to fight for my country ; understand that ? To fight him ! To kill this damned Northerner who has taken you from me ! You ! Barbara Frietchie , whom I love better than the South , better than my life ! The three girls on the stoop are frightened . After a moment 's silence , the front door is flung back , and Jack comes out , leaving the door wide open . He looks wild and is without his hat . The positions of the girls on the steps block his way . Jack . Jack Negly Out of my way ! Damn all women ! The girls , frightened , make way for him , Sally seizing hold of him by the arm to stop him . Sally . Sally Negly Jack ! Jack . Jack Negly As if he did not recognize her and shaking himself roughly free . Let go ! He strides down the steps . Sally . Sally Negly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps , turns and looks at the three girls , who , frightened , cling together . He speaks bitterly . The Three Graces ! Ha , ha ! That 's what some sentimental idiots would call you ! But the witches from " Macbeth " are what you are ! Ha , ha , ha ! Liars ! cheats ! hags ! all of you ! Laughs again as he goes of down the street past his house . Barbara has come out of the door as he finishes speaking , and stands on the top step . As he goes , she speaks after him in a voice , angry and excited , yet with a certain girlish dignity . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Call us what you like , but remember that we women love the man we honor and give our lips to the man we love ! Barbara is a ravishing young creature , who has more or less wittingly " upset " most of the youth of the town . A loose , delightful curl of her wavy , dark hair lies on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes are large and beautiful and she does what she likes with them . Her soul is wakening within her , however , and her coquetry has seen its best days . She is dressed in a billowy mass of blue gauziness , bare neck , save for a blue cameo , and bare arms , save for two lovely dimples . Another camellia , the color of her lips , is caught at her waist . A bit of a black ankle-strap shows above a tiny triangle of white stocking . Sally . Sally Negly Barbara , do n't mind what he says . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Still indignant . I never gave your brother the right to speak so to me ! Sally . Sally Negly Still trying to pacify . He does n't know what he says . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie How dared he ! Rearranging the short sleeves of her dress , disarranged by Jack 's unwelcome embrace . Sally .

As they leave the steps , Sally moves nearer to Sue and Barbara , and they whisper together . Hal . Dr. Hal Boyd Persuade Sue to go in and play on the piano . Pretend we want to dance out here .

From the Royce house a Figure comes stealthily , wrapped about with a great cloak . It seems like a gaunt woman in the dark . It steals across the garden , keeping close to the side of the Frietchie house , and , when it reaches the Royce fence , leans over carefully and reconnoiters . Then the Figure says " Psst ! " twice , and adds " Barbara " softly , to attract her noting where the voice comes from . She stands still , listening to hear it again . At this moment , Sue calls loudly from the inside , with friendly satire : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Figure draws back in the shadow till Sue has finished speaking , then again leans over the fence and calls " Barbara ! " Barbara hears and turns to see who it is . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie A little frightened . What is it ? Who are you ? What do you want ? The Figure whispers " Sh ! " with a finger on its lips ; then goes swiftly and softly along the fence , out by the gate to the Frietchie stoop . There it staggers , but catches itself by the railing , saying " Sister ! " in a low voice . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Going down a step or two toward him . Arthur ! Arthur Frietchie is a high-spirited young Southern soldier , engaged heart and soul in the War . Arthur .

Trumbull , who has been coming slowly along past the Royce fence , smoking a pipe , reaches the Frietchie steps . He pauses to see who is on the top step . At the same moment , Sue comes out , and the door opening , a flood of light falls on Barbara and Arthur . Sue recognizes him with a cry . Sue . Sue Royce Arthur ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Hush ! Do n't speak his name ! Trumbull , taking his pipe out of his mouth , whistles softly to himself . Be is a tall , slender , handsome Northerner , dressed in the uniform of a Union captain . He is one of those fine-hearted , open-souled men , who are loved as baby , boy , and man by every one , but so unconsciously , so far as themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in the town , rebel or no rebel , could tell you his eyes were blue and his mustache golden . His fellow soldiers swear by his bravery and his comradeship . He stands still a moment and then makes a movement to go up the steps , but stops himself and walks along leisurely back up the street , smoking hard . He soon turns again slowly , however , puts away his pipe , and , going up the Frietchie steps , raps with the iron knocker . As he stands waiting , a Search Gang of eight Union Soldiers , headed by a Sergeant , march to the Royce gate and are led through the garden to the front door . Meanwhile , when Capt . Trumbull has knocked , Col. Negly rises and leans on his side railing , speaking . Col. Negly . Col. Negly Unable to distinguish in the dim evening light . Is that you , Frietchie ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull No , sir , it 's Captain Trumbull . Col. Negly . Col. Negly Angry . Oh , I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The Royce door is opened by Mammy Lu , and the Search Gang enter the house . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Amused . I 'm a Union soldier , sir . Col. Negly . Col. Negly So was I a soldier , sir , in a just cause . I was a colonel in the Mexican War , sir ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull I am glad you are not fighting this time , Colonel . Col. Negly . Col. Negly I 'm not , sir , and I 'll take up the sword again , sir , if they need me . I 'm not too old yet , sir ! I may join the blessed South in a fortnight , sir ! Trumbull knocks again . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Amused . I might keep you a prisoner here , Colonel , and prevent your leaving the town . Col. Negly . Col. Negly The town wo n't be yours , sir , in a fortnight ! There wo n't be a damned Yankee left in the place , sir , in a fortnight ! Trumbull knocks again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , while you Northerners have our dear town , not one of ' em dares to call on my daughter , sir ! Frietchie 's got to stop it , too , sir ! We 're coming to have a word with him . Trumbull knocks louder . Not that I have anything against you personally , sir . I 'm bound to believe if it were n't for the War you might be a gentleman , sir ! The Frietchie door is opened on a crack by Barbara . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Who is it ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull It is I , Miss Barbara . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh ! She puts out her bare arm and they shake hands . There is a pause of embarrassment . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull I 've come to see you . May n't I come in ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Comes out quickly , dosing the door behind her . Oh , yes , indeedy ! Do , Captain Trumbull ; only do n't you think it 's cooler and pleasanter out here ? Trumbull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Nervous , a little alarmed . Why ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Perhaps it 's because I want to see your face ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Or let me see yours . They say you Northerners are all vain . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Miss Barbara , please leave the door open . I have a good reason . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , very well , if you 're going to be melancholy over it ! She opens the door ; the light from the hall floods the steps . Barbara sits in the middle of the top step , her dress spread out as if she were barring the way . Trumbull sits below her . The Provost Guard is seen coming out of the Royce house . They are followed to the gate by Mammy Lu , who is very angry with them . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Is you froo ? Bress de Lawd !

Miss Barbara , do n't close that door ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Recovering herself . Why should I ? I 've nothing to fear from them . They wo n't try to search here . She sits again on the top step . The soldiers pay no attention to the old mammy , who is furious , and , as the last man passes out , the Sergeant calls : " Good night , Venus ! " Mammy Lu .

Sergeant James We have orders , Captain , to search every house in this quarter of the town . Information has reached headquarters that several families in this neighborhood are harboring Union deserters and Rebel spies . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Rises . There is no spy in this house ! Sergeant . Sergeant James How about Union deserters and Rebel soldiers ? At any rate , our orders are to search every house . You will pardon me , madam . He starts up the steps , the men following . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Coming down a step . There is no one here ! Sergeant . Sergeant James Roughly . Stand aside ; your word 's not enough ! Raises his arm to push past her . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull One minute , Sergeant ! This lady 's word is sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Interrupting . I will be responsible for this house , that there is no one in it . You are not to search . Refer to me at headquarters . Sergeant . Sergeant James Going dawn the steps . Very well , Captain . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull By the way , Sergeant ? Sergeant and men stop . Sergeant . Sergeant James Yes , Captain . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull I 'm not responsible for the house next door ; you 'd better search that ! Sergeant . Sergeant James Yes , Captain ! March ! He leads the men to Negly 's steps . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Laughing mischievously . Oh , he 'll be furious ! Sergeant . Serge ant James At Negly 's steps . Halt ! The men halt . Col. Negly . Col.

Sergeant James Will you open the door , sir , or shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you dare break my door , sir ! No , sir ! Come in and search . You 'll find nothing , sir , not even a Southern welcome , sir ! They go into the house . Mammy Lu appears at an upper window of the Royce house , shaking her dust cloth , and muttering angrily at the soldiers , till they are out of sight . Barbara and Trumbull have listened . They laugh gently at Col. Negly . Then Barbara sits on the top step again and holds out her hand to Trumbull . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Softly . Thank you . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Standing before her . If he is a spy  --  Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Who ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Meaningly . If he is a spy , you must keep him prisoner or make him do no spy 's work this visit , for my sake . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie What do you know ? Trumbull .

Captain Trumbull Is that all ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No  --  Teasingly . You 're handsome ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Terribly embarrassed . Miss Frietchie  --  please ! Barbara . Ba rbara Frietchie Of course , for a Yankee , I mean  --  handsome for a Yankee ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull But  --  Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Interrupting . And you 're rather nice  --  for a Yankee ! They 've finished with the Neglys . She rises , and Trumbull also . As the Provost Guard comes out of the Negly house and down the steps , Col. Negly has followed them out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Trumbull The old gentleman is smoking like a house on fire . Both laugh gently . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull By the way , Sergeant , have you heard anything of those two men who deserted last week from my regiment ? Sergeant . Sergeant James Turning to him . What men , Captain ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Fred Gelwex and Tim Greene . Sergeant . Sergeant James Oh , Gelwex and Greene . No , sir . Heard nothing good , sir . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull They have n't been caught ? Sergeant . Sergeant James No , Captain ; but they swore before they cleared out to pay you back some day , sir . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull They were both a bad lot ,  --  always drunk . They 're a good riddance . Sergeant . Sergeant James It 's believed they 're off to join the Rebels at Hagerstown , sir . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull The Rebels are welcome .

What makes you think so ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , you  --  Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Yankee ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Yes . No Rebel would have been rude enough to take that advantage of me ! But I 'll tell you how you can make up for it . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull How ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie By telling me outright what you do think of me . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Oh , no , no ! I dare n't ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Uneasy . Why not ? Trumbull .

Captain Trumbull It 's no more than you asked me ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie But the North is wrong ; the South is right ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Oh ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie You are the aggressive party . We only ask to be left alone ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Left alone to do what you should n't . Barbara .

Not to those blackguard lies from Union papers ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Ah ! you know what I say is true . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Rising , furious . No , lies ! lies !

There used to fly from it an American flag , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war broke out , we tore it down in rags ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Good night . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Still angry . Good night ! Trumbull goes up the street angrily , firmly . Barbara goes to the side of the steps , and , leaning over , whispers timidly : Captain Trumbull  --  Trumbull reaches the Royce corner without turning . Barbara repeats in a whisper , a more coaxing one : Captain Trumbull  --  He hesitates a moment , and then , turning , comes toward her slowly , expecting her to speak . He comes beside the steps . She stands on the top one , leaning against the column of the balcony . " ' T is but thy name that is my enemy ! " Trumbull . Captain Trumbull With his two arms leaning against the railing , not yet understanding that it is a quotation . That 's right , Miss Frietchie . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie " What 's in a name ? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet ; so Romeo would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trumbull Delighted , recognizing the lines now . By George ! yes , that 's it !

Captain Trumbull He was a lover , that 's enough ,  --  and so am I ! But do n't let us be like those unlucky duffers . Let us live and be happy , in spite of the War . You do love me a little , Barbara ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Leaning over and giving him her hand . Come back up on the steps ! Keeping hold of her hand , he comes around the railing and joins her . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Pointing up . You see that star ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Laughing , shakes her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ! Nearly every man in Frederick has tried to show me that star ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull No , I was n't going to play a trick . I do n't want kisses I have to steal from you . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , dear me ! Are n't you particular about your old kisses ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Barbara , will you kiss me ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Ah ! Barbara , will you marry me ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie What ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Will you be my wife ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie After a decided pause , trying to turn from him , not daring to look into his face , lets him seize her hand , and then turns impulsively , lifts her eyes , which are wet , to his , and smiling , whispers : Yes ! He holds her close in his arms for a moment . Then she raises her head , and , half playfully , speaks to him . Step down  --  only one step ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star ? Pointing . Trumbull .

My Rebel ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Yes , my Yankee love , my soldier ! Still a Rebel , though I 'll be your wife . I 've fought against it all I could . I 've been silly and wilful and frivolous with you , but you saw behind my woman 's barricade ! She sits on the top step . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Yes , I saw you ! Sitting on the step below her , and taking both her hands in his . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I love you ! I 've tried not to , but a love like mine must rule even in the heart it dwells in .

He embraces her ; she rests in his arms . Frietchie , coming along the street , reaches the Negly house , and is observed by Col. Negly , who rises . Col. Negly . Col. Negly Is that you , Frietchie ? The lovers start apart , and , rising , listen . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie A handsome old gentleman , with fine face and sympathetic manner . He is such a man as Stuart would have loved to paint ; a noble character , but a poor politician ; stubborn but human . Yes . Have you heard the Northerners are in possession of Hagerstown , too , but our men are going to try and take it back ! Barbara and Trumbull close the front door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col.

Mr. Frietchie Well , what 's your news ? Col. Negly . Col. Negly Clearing his throat . It 's a delicate matter . He hesitates . Barbara . Ba rbara Frietchie Softly to Trumbull .

Col. Negly The whole town 's excited over it . Let 's talk it over inside . They enter the Negly house . Trumbull whistles . Barbara . Bar bara Frietchie Exactly ! Whistle for me , too ! Here come the girls . They 've been for a walk . Sally and Edgar , Laura and Hal , both couples arm in arm , come along the street , past the Negly house . As they reach the Frietchie steps , Trumbull rises . Sally . Sally Negly We 've had a beautiful  --  She stops as she sees the figure of Trumbull Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Sit down ! Laura .

They continue on up the street , singing " Dixie " with marked emphasis , the girls tossing their heads high in the air as they pass Trumbull , turning at the corner to fling back " Dixie " in his face . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie My friends are polite ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull And your father ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , father wo n't be like that ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull No ?

I may be off to Hagerstown to fight in the morning , and I wo n't leave here without telling your father . I 'll not give him a chance to say I stole your heart on the sly , and was afraid or ashamed to ask for it outright . Col. Negly and Frietchie come out of Negly 's house . Both are excited . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Come over and hear me . I 'll give him his cong to-night ! Now ! They come down the steps and go to Frietchie 's house . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie He 's coming over .

You 'd give yourself to this Yankee nobody , who comes here to rob you of all you have , make your father penniless , and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No !

Do as I bid you ; go to your own room ! Your father will take care of you , in spite of yourself . She goes into the house , with a meaning look at Trumbull , who makes a movement toward her , stopped by Frietchie . Come in , too , Negly . Col. Negly goes into the house , giving a loud snort as he passes Trumbull . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull To Frietchie . Sir , if you wish credentials of my character and family  --  Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Turns on top step and looks fiercely at Trumbull . Damn you , sir , good night ! Enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negly Opening the door on a crack . And damn your family , too , sir ! Shuts the door . Trumbull stands a moment undecided . The shutters above , leading on to the balcony , softly open . An Orderly comes quickly around the Royce corner , and , going to Trumbull , salutes him . Trumbull returns the salute . Barbara comes softly out into the moonlight on the balcony . Orderly . Orderly Who speaks with some force , and suppressed excitement . Orders to break and start for Hagerstown at daybreak , Captain , to reinforce General Reno ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Very well . I 'll be with the men at once . Orderly . Orderly General Lee is advancing with his whole army . Expectations of heavy fighting early in the morning ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull That 's bad news , Perkins . Orderly . Orderly Yes , sir . Salutes and goes down the street quickly . Trumbull turns , about to follow him , but stops to take a farewell look at Barbara 's house . He sees Barbara on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , she whispers . More Romeo and Juliet ! Trumbull .

Mr. Frietchie In the house . Barbara ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Over her shoulder , looking back . Yes , father ! She turns again to Trumbull and leans far over . Listen ! I know the Lutheran minister there ! I 'll be at his house at noon . I 'll marry you all the same ! She unfastens the camellia at her waist , kisses it , and throws the flower down to him ; then hurries into the house . Just as Trumbull catches the flower , a distant bugle call is heard . He thrusts the camellia into his coat , wheels about sharply , and goes on straight down the street , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtain Falls THE SECOND ACT The Lutheran Minister 's House in Hagerstown A pleasant-looking room , whose walls are covered with large flowered , green striped paper ; faded strong green rep curtains are at the windows , and the rosewood furniture is somewhat uninvitingly covered with haircloth . A bright , big figured carpet is on the floor . A stand of geraniums in bloom is between the windows , and a canary bird in a cage sings intermittently in one . There are two family portraits on the walls , one of Mrs. Hunter , at the age of six , with a small head and a large hoop , leaning against a marble column that supports a blue but cloudy sky , and a big , troublesome red curtain ; the other portrait , of her father , done by an itinerant artist in exchange for a suit of well-worn clothes , does not admit of description . There are some interesting family photographs in round gilt and black frames . There is a white marble-topped centre table , with a lamp upon it , on a worsted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing to get cool . There are two walnut " what-nots " in the room , boasting of sea shells , small statuettes and other like objets d'art of the period . The clock upon the mantel , flanked by two vases of dyed , dry grasses , points to 11.30 of a sunny morning . Barbara and Sue are seen passing quickly by the windows , and a minute after , Mrs. Hunter shows the two young ladies into her parlor . Mrs. Hunter is a sweet , placid looking woman , with gray hair in smooth bands . She is a motherly creature , and wears a plain morning cap on her head . Barbara and Sue are dressed in their very best , carrying fans and little parasols , and are happily excited . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Come right in here , young ladies , and wait . Barbara .

Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter You must be tired ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , no ! not a bit ! Are we , Sue ? Sue . Sue Royce Well , I do n't suppose you are , but I am ! Mrs. Hunter .

Mrs. Hunter You 're running away ? Barbara nods her head a little timidly . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Yes , sort of  --  something of that sort ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter He 's against it ? Barbara nods her head again , more emphatically . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Blowing dust off the mantel shelf . You ought n't to go against your pa , dear . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I ca n't help it . You 'll be a witness all the same , wo n't you , Mrs. Hunter ? Putting her arm coaxingly about her . Mrs. Hunter .

Barbara Frietchie With her arm still around Mrs. Hunter , and hugging her coaxingly . Oh , Mrs. Hunter , why not ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter What ever will your pa say ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Taking her arm away . Nothing proper for me to repeat , I am sure ! But he 's not a judge of whom I must love , Mrs. Hunter . Coming to behind the centre table again . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Yes , but I 'm afraid the Minister 'll think it wrong . He 's got a strong sense of duty . Coming also to the table . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Sits behind the table , leaning on her arms , and almost crying . Oh , no , Mrs. Hunter , you do n't think he 'd refuse me a little thing like that ? After I 've come all this way just to see him ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Well , my dear , if the Minister 's wife could many you , there would n't be any difficulty . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frietchie What a pity ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Anyway , I 'll just change my cap , so as to be ready in case he is willing . Sits absent-mindedly .

You 'll want to marry him yourself ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Smiling . Heaven forbid ! I 'm not like your pa ! She goes out . Barbara runs to the window , where Sue is . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Looking out with Sue , both their backs toward the room . Is he coming ? Sue . Sue Royce No , but something seems to be going on . Do n't you see all the people ? Barbara .

Oh , Sue , I hope he wo n't think me too  --  too  --  too something , for being here so much before him ! Sue . Sue Royce Amused , teasing her . Of course , Bab , it is more customary for the bridegroom to await the arrival of the bride ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , Sue , do you think he 'll think  --  Looking about her . I wish there were another door ; I 'd go out and come back again , as if I 'd just arrived . Wait ! I 've an idea . Hurry , take my arm ! We 'll pretend he 's late and that I was tired of waiting and we 're about to go ! Pretend we thought the hour fixed was half-past eleven .

Barbara Frietchie Rushing to him and giving him both hers , cries out joyfully : . Will ! I thought you 'd never come . The time was noon , you know ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull I 've been getting a license , hunting up the Minister , and begging him to take the time to marry us . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I knew you 'd manage it . You see , Sue ! Turning to Sue , whom Trumbull then sees . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Our bridesmaid ? Shaking hands with Sue . Sue . Sue Royce With a quick little curtsey . Yes , indeedy ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie And you persuaded Mr. Hunter to marry us ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut . At any rate , he said he 'd follow me in a few minutes . We have n't many . You wo n't mind being married in a hurry ? Taking her hand . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie It 's true , the Southerners are coming ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Letting go , tenderly , of Barbara 's hand . Yes , we are filling the houses along the street with sharpshooters . Men of the Seventy-fourth Connecticut , my regiment , are to take their stand in this house . Sue . Sue Royce Here ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie This house ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Doctor Hunter is out , warning women and children to keep out of danger . I would have sent you word not to come to-day had I known in time . Sue . Sue Royce On a half cry . Oh , I wish you had ! I wish we were home ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I should have come all the same . My place is here , as near you as I can be , with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you women in the house must go into the cellar ; that 's the only place that will be safe from bullets . During this speech , Sue steals softly from the room , to leave the other two alone . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie And you ? Oh , my love , my love ! Resting quietly in his arms , her head on his shoulder , and looking up into his face . You 'll be in the fighting  --  Trumbull . Captain Trumbull The Seventy-fourth shall behave worthy of their Captain 's wife , if I can make them . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie But you ! Oh , just as you are mine ! If you should be  --  should be  --  She can not say the dreadful thing , and comes out of his arms , but keeps close to him , burying her face on his shoulder . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Be brave , dear . If it should be , I 'll fall , loving you and trying to serve my country ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Your country against mine ! Trumbull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South were one in 1776 . They 'll be one again in 1876 . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Yes , in 1776 they were betrothed . This War 's a lovers ' quarrel ; after it , they 'll wed for good , like you and I to-day . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull And then nothing can separate them . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Not even death ! Resting again in his arms , he kisses her silently . After a moment 's pause , she moves to a chair , and , still holding his hand , makes him draw a chair nearer and sit beside her . Will , yesterday I told you I was still a Rebel , after all your reasoning . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull But still my Rebel ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie All night I lay awake and tried to take your point of view , and by the morning  --  Trumbull . Captain Trumbull By the morning  --  Barbara . Barbara Frietchie By the morning it was easier . Perhaps  --  perhaps we 're wrong . But still I 'm torn between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; everything else I love stands on the other  --  and this War , this cruel War blackens our skies with its powder clouds , stains our grass with our own heart 's blood , destroys our homes , and ruins the land we cherish ! What can we women do ? My brother escaped to-day , and will be with our  --  with his troops  --  when they march into Hagerstown this morning . His gun points toward your heart , yours toward his ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull God save his life ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie And yours ! See ! Rising . Trumbull rises . She takes an old , patched American flag from a little beaded bag at her side . This is the flag I told you of last night ; my grandfather 's ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Yes , I remember ; but you told me it was torn . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie It was . I mended it at sunrise . Then I folded it as you see , close and small as I could , and I give it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you must let me place it here . Slipping it inside his coat , on the left side . Over your heart , your wife 's flag , and may it be some sort of shield to save your life for her ! Mrs. Hunter and Sue come in again . Mrs. Hunter has changed her cap and added a white lace " bertha . " She brings a bouquet of flowers , which she has gathered in her garden for Barbara . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I do n't know where Doctor Hunter can be , but I 'm quite ready . Good morning , Captain Trumbull . Giving flowers to Barbara and kissing her . My love and good wishes . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Thank you , Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Take off your bonnet , dearie . It 's bad luck to wed in the house in a bonnet . Taking Barbara 's bonnet , she drops it . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , be careful of it , Mrs. Hunter ! I had n't a new one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know , " Something old and something new , something borrowed and something blue . " Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter This is a sad way for a young girl to be married . Putting Barbara 's bonnet on the sofa . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Barbara is a soldier 's bride , Mrs. Hunter , and she 's going to be brave . Sue goes to Barbara , sobbing . Sue . Sue Royce Oh , Bab ! Bab ! She cries on her neck . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Sue ! Sue ! You 'll be a nice damp bridesmaid ! Putting her away affectionately . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Taking Sue to the window , where they discreetly pretend to be interested in the garden , with their backs turned . Come , sit down ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Taking Barbara 's hand and drawing her to one side . I had no time to get another , so I 'm going to use my mother 's wedding ring . She put it on my finger when I was twenty-one . Showing her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at the ring . No ring in the world would have pleased me half so much . A loud , harsh church bell suddenly begins to clang noisily . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Startled , rises . What 's that for ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull To warn the townspeople that there 's likely to be fighting . Sue rises , frightened . Sue . Sue Royce Oh , Bab ! Sue and Mrs. Hunter come a few steps forward . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull There 's no danger yet , Miss Royce . Mrs. Hunter goes to a window and looks out . Sue follows . As Trumbull has given his answer to Mrs. Hunter , Barbara has clung more tightly to him , and , turning her face up to his , gives him a long look , full of love , but yet fearful for the ordeal ahead . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Coming away from the window . Here comes somebody ; it 's probably the Minister ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie The Minister ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull The Minister ! Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Barbara . She runs , tripping prettily about the room , to make all kinds of unnecessary preparations . Barbara . Bar bara Frietchie Get ready , everybody ! The Bible ! We must have the Bible ! Taking a large book from the table between the windows . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter No ! no ! that 's the photograph album ! Taking it away from her . However , you wo n't need a Bible . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Laughing hysterically . Wo n't need it ? Dear me ! Mrs. Hunter says we wo n't need  --  She interrupts herself to arrange the little party . She changes Sue 's position several times to where she will look " really best , " and gets very confused as to which side of Capt . Trumbull she shall stand , but finally gives a sigh of relief , as , after a final dash for her almost forgotten bouquet , with flushed cheeks , happy eyes and beating heart , she hangs on to the Captain 's left arm , and watches expectantly the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Barbara , and Mrs. Hunter behind the centre table . An Orderly bursts into the room . Orderly . Orderly Captain Trumbull ? Salutes . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull What is it , Perkins ? Orderly . Orderly Sent by General Reno to tell you to join your company with all speed , sir ! The enemy are only a few yards off , and our troops are to leave this end of the town open to them ! Barbara 's bouquet slips unheeded from her hand . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Leave this end ? What 's that for ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull A trap , probably . We outnumber the Rebels . Coming , Perkins . Orderly . Orderly Yes , Captain . I 've a horse here for you . Salutes and goes out . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Going to her Captain . You must go ? Without  --  you ca n't wait for Mr. Hunter ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull He must wait for us to-morrow . Good-by . They stand facing each other , his arms around her , her hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearfully into each other 's eyes . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Going to Sue , whispers . Come . Leads her by the hand to the window , where they stand , half hidden by the curtains , their backs turned toward the room . The bell stops ringing . After Barbara and Trumbull have gazed a few moments into each other 's eyes , he takes the ring he had shown her off his finger , and places it on Barbara 's wedding finger , and then kisses it on her hand . She flings her arms about his neck and kisses him . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Firmly . I must go now . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Clinging to him . Yes , yes ; I know , I know ! Following him toward the door , and holding on to him . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Good-by , little woman . Putting off her hands , tenderly . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie In an agonized whisper . Good-by . Your wife all the same , Will ; your wife , your wife ! Again putting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my wife ! Take care of yourself . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie And you ? Trumbull . Captain Trumbull I 'm going to make you proud of the Seventy-fourth ! Smiling bravely and again putting her hands tenderly from off him . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I know it . I know it ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Good-by . Again clinging to his arm , she starts to go with him out through the door . No , stay here . Do n't come any further . Every minute makes it harder . She stands still . He goes over the threshold . He turns and looks at her . Good-by , girl ! He passes out . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Standing in front of the open door . Good-by , boy ! The outside door is heard to slam . Barbara hurries to the empty window and leans out . She throws some kisses and stands watching . Mrs. Hunter and Sue turn from their window . Sue . Sue Royce Poor Bab ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Yes , indeedy ! I suppose the Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns and speaks quickly , coming from the window . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Now , what can we do ? Surely we can do something ! We can help somehow ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I do n't see what , just now . If any one gets wounded near here , we can  --  Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Interrupting , and sobbing on Mrs. Hunter 's bosom . Oh , Mrs. Hunter , you 're sure , you 're sure there 'll be fighting ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I 've seen one skirmish already , dear , right here in our front yard . Comforting her in her arms . Sue . Sue Royce At the window . Oh ! Our men are coming now , sure ; you can see the dust . Shall we close the shutters ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Yes , quickly ! Moving to the other window , she closes its shutters . Sue at the same time closes the shutters of her window . The sunlight goes from the room when this is done , leaving a dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , lost for the moment in her unhappy thoughts . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Going to Sue . . Would you mind helping me put away some of my best things ? If they should fight outside , everything 's likely to be ruined . Taking the pair of vases with dried grasses off the mantel , and also the clock . Sue . Sue Royce In a half whisper . Look at Barbara ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Let her alone , poor girl ! and take off those tatting tidies , will you , Miss Royce , please ? My Aunt Sarah made ' em , and I treasure ' em highly . Sue takes the tidies off the sofa and chairs , and gets the family Bible and photograph album . Mrs. Hunter moves the jelly jars to the mantel . These soldiers just do n't care what they do . They 'll use everything they can lay their hands on for the wounded , without a moment 's forethought ! There is a load rapping on the wooden shutter of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her reverie and goes to the window , but does not open it . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie What is it ? Boy . Boy The Rebs are coming ! the Rebs are coming ! They 're right here ; there 'll be fighting ! Lookout ! Sue . Sue Royce In hysterical fright . Oh , Barbara ! oh , Mrs. Hunter ! Oh , I wish I were home ! I 'll never go with you to get married again , Barbara Frietchie ! Oh , we 'll be killed ! we 'll all be killed ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Crossing with Sue to the hall door . No ! no ! Come , put those things down-stairs ! I 'll lock the front door , and then we 'd all better go into the cellar . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I shall stay here ! Sue . Sue Royce No , no , Bab ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter You come now , Miss Royce . I 'll be back for Miss Barbara . I want to bolt the front door . Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barbara Frietchie Goes to the window , and , moving the shutter a little , looks out . She shows that she sees the Southern soldiers , and , closing the shutter quickly , calls back into the room . They 're some of them here already in the street ! She looks out cautiously again . A loud knocking on the street door . Barbara quickly closes the shutter and steps away from the window into the room . The knocking is repeated . Mrs. Hunter appears in the hall doorway , frightened . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Some of ' em are at our door ! The knocking changes to pounding of the door with the butt end of a musket . Arthur Frietchie . Arthur Frietchie Voice loud outside . This is the confounded Union Preacher 's house . Beat in the door if they wo n't answer ! Louder pounding on the door . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Had n't we better open ? Shall I go ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter No , I 'll go . She goes out and is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , his arm in a sling , followed by four Confederate soldiers  --  Gelwex , Greene and two others  --  speaking before and as he enters . The four men stand in twos by the windows . We want your house , madam , for our sharpshooters . We wo n't harm you or any of your possessions . He sees Barbara . Barbara ! No ! Barbara ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Equally surprised . You , Arthur ! Thank God ! Taking his hand . Mrs. Hunter enters . Mrs. Hunter , this is my brother . He 'll protect us ! Arthur , this is my friend , Mrs. Hunter . Arthur Frietchie . Arthur Frietchie She 's a Unioner . Her husband is known all over Maryland for his bitterness . What are you doing with them ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , never mind ; they are my friends . You 'll protect them ! Arthur . Arthur Frietchie I can do nothing . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Yes , you can . You wo n't let your men stay in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie But what are they going to do here ? Arthur . Arthur Frietchie They 're sharpshooters . They 'll each take a window that fronts on the street . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Heaven help us ! To Barbara . I 'll go tell your friend ; she 'll be getting frightened . She goes out . Barbara , dazed , sinks into a chair by the centre table . Arthur . Arthur Frietchie The Yankees are up to some trick . They 've left this part of the town open . They imagine , perhaps , we 'll think they 're retreating , and march along into the hell they have ready for us at the other end . But we 're not such fools . We 're going to wait here for them to come back after us ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Do you mean to say you 're going to station your men in these windows , to hide here safe , and shoot out at the unprotected Unioners as they come along ? Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , till we 've discouraged them a little . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Rising . No ! no ! That 's barbarous ! that 's murder ! Arthur . Arthur Frietchie It 's war , sister ! To his men . Clear the windows ! The men tear down the curtains and move into each window a big piece of furniture , which serves as an extra protection to hide behind . Gelwex , with one man at one window , Greene and another man at the other . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie But you , you 'll be here ? Following Arthur around the table as he moves , her hands on his arm . Arthur . Arthur Frietchie No , I must go on at once . This is n't the only house ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie And we women , what are we to do ? Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Get out of reach of the bullets , for God 's sake , and the sooner the better ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Sue 's down in the cellar now . Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue Royce . Arthur . Arthur Frietchie If she should be hurt ! What in Heaven 's name are you two girls doing here ? Tell me ! Very firmly . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Ah ! if you are frightened for her , because you love her , even though she is n't fighting , then you 'll feel for me ! Arthur , be generous . I came here this morning to marry Captain Trumbull ! Arthur . Arthur Frietchie What ! the Northern officer ? Gelwex starts and exchanges a signal with Greene . They listen intently . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Standing in front of Arthur to plead with him . Wait ! Do n't speak yet ; you do n't know him , you 've never even seen him . How can you judge ? He saved you from the search gang last night , though you do n't know it . He 's a good , brave man , and he 's here in the army you 've come to fight ! Oh , Arthur , he 's as dear to me as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! help me ! Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Sympathetically . I can do nothing , Bab , poor old girl . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie At any rate , you 're not angry with me for loving him ? Arthur . Arthur Frietchie With his arm about her shoulders . No , I 'm sorry for you . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Shall I call Sue ? Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Yes . No ! no ! you 'd better not . I must n't see her ,  --  I do n't dare . Give her this for me . Kisses her . He turns to his men . Gelwex , you and  --  What 's your friend 's name ? Greene . Tim Greene Saluting . Tim Greene , sir . Arthur . Arthur Frietchie All right . You two stay here . This is a good chance for you new men to show what you are worth to us . The other two follow me upstairs . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex There ai n't no upstairs , sir : only an attic . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Very well , then ; you men here are enough . He takes a step or two nearer the two men , one at each window . You know your work . Look where you fire ! Pick out your man ! Do n't aim at nothing ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , it 's dreadful ! it 's dreadful ! Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Coming back to her . Good-by , dear ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie In agony . If you two meet  --  my lover and my brother ! Arthur . Arthur Frietchie That wo n't be  --  that ca n't be ! We wo n't even think of it . She presses his hand warmly . He returns the pressure . And before another battle you must make a Rebel of him ! Barbara smiles . Arthur goes . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Speaks after him . Come back safely . Arthur . Arthur Frietchie I 'll try . Take care of Sue . He shuts the door behind him . Barbara stands for a moment looking about her with the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to avert an impending catastrophe . The two men have taken their positions in the left corners of each window , the shutters open on a crack , the men watching , off Right , the direction from which the Union men are to come . Barbara looks at them . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex You 're loaded all right , Tim ? Greene . Tim Greene Looking . All right . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie And you two men are going to carry out your orders ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Right , young lady , if we get the chance . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie If I were a soldier , I 'd fight out fair in the ranks . I would n't hide safe to kill another man from behind a cover ! The two soldiers laugh out loud . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex If you were a soldier , you 'd do what you 're told , Miss . He watches again , closing the shutters . Not that this ai n't our favorite line in the business . Eh , Tim ? Greene . Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barbara Frietchie Noticing their manner and accent . But where do you come from ? You men are not Southern . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex No , we ai n't Southern , b'gosh !

And you sympathize with the South ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Laughing sarcastically . Yes , we sympathize with the South because she pays us for it ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Pays ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex The South 's going to win , Miss , and we 're on the side of the winning party . We come down here with the Seventy-fourth from Hartford . At this , Barbara starts and looks at them in greater surprise and with emotion . And we got licked twice , so we quit . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie In disgust . You 're deserters ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Awh ! call us what you like . Each man must look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it war n't for us they would n't be knowing the Yankees ' plan to-day . Barbara .

But why we done it is ' cause the South 's going to win , and the winning side 's our side ! Eh , Tim ? Greene . Tim Greene Who a moment before has looked out more intently , and listened . Psst ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex At once on the alert . Coming ? Barbara stands still , motionless , alarmed . It 's only some people in the street . By thunder , if our old regiment comes along !  --  eh , Tim ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie To herself in a whisper . Will 's ! Greene . Tim Greene We 'd pay ' em back ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex You bet !

Barbara Frietchie Quickly . Why were you in the guard-house ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Getting sober . I 've a weakness , lady , for good old rye ! Laughing . Barbara . Ba rbara Frietchie As the idea strikes her . Well , rye is not a bad drink . Would n't you like some now ? Greene . Tim Greene No ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Shut up ! Yes , lady ; thank you kindly .

He and Gelwex press closer to the windows . Barbara and Mrs. Hunter stand still a moment , listening . Then Barbara whispers so the two men wo n't hear her . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I 'm sure you have some ; get it . These are two Union deserters ! And the worse of the two is a drunkard . He 's set on the life of my lover ! Oh , for love 's sake , get me liquor , so I may drug him ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I understand . We have some . She starts to go out the door . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie And , Mrs. Hunter , has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what for  --  ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Never mind . Get it ! get it ! Mrs. Hunter goes out . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Sh ! Damn you ! keep still . Yes , they 're coming , sure ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Who ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex The Yankees ! Barbara cries out . Do n't be frightened ; they wo n't be on us for a few minutes yet . But you 'd better go , too , lady . The soldiers watch more closely . The bell begins to clang loudly again . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No ! Listen  --  listen to me a moment ! Is n't there any way in which I can persuade you two men not to shoot out of those windows ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Oh , go down in the cellar ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No ! For Heaven 's sake , wo n't you show some kindness , some pity ? Turn around and look at me ! Look at me ! Running to him and throwing herself upon his gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for a moment . Look into my face ! Gelwex turns his head and looks at her . Now listen ! My life and happiness are coming down that road where your guns point ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex That 's nothing to do with me ! Wrenching his gun away , he turns again to aim out of the window . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Have you no feeling ? Have you never loved any one  --  your mother ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex She left me in the gutter ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Your sweetheart ! Surely you have loved someone ? Greene . Tim Greene Yes , he loved a girl once . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie To Gelwex . And she loved you ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex No ! She married me and left me for another man , taking our baby with her ! Mrs. Hunter enters with the whisky , a bottle and a glass , and with her husband 's gun . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No wonder you 're hard if you 've had such troubles ! Well , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Hunter , taking the whisky and glass from her , and motioning her to place the gun on the centre table , which Mrs. Hunter does . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Good ! A fife-and-drum corps is heard in the distance , playing " We 'll Rally Round the Flag , Boys , We 'll Rally Round the Flag , Shouting the Battle Cry of Freedom ! " Greene . Tim Greene Here they are ! Places his gun . As Barbara starts to pour the whisky out into the glass , a far-off glass ! He seizes the bottle out of Barbara 's hand to drink more quickly . She goes toward the table and puts down the glass . Greene . Tim Greene As Gelwex is about to drink , cries out in great excitement . Fred ! Fred ! Look ! look ! Ca n't you see ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Looks , starts , throws down the bottle , which crashes , and gets his gun ready , shouting like a beast . Yes ! Good ! The Seventy-fourth ! the Seventy-fourth ! Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two more distant shots , and the drum and fife sound louder . Shouts and cries are heard . Greene . Tim Greene Yes , it 's them , sure ! Watching more intently . Trumbull 's voice is heard outside , coming from up the road . He is urging his men on . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Come on , boys ! come on ! For country and for love ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex With strong , fierce emphasis , and tightening his grip on his musket . Do n't interfere with me ! Barbara takes up the Minister 's gun . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Behind her . Pray , Barbara , pray ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie You pray . If he puts his finger on the trigger , I 'll shoot ! Gelwex lifts his gun and shows intense excitement as he takes aim . Barbara covers him with her gun , and holds it steady . As Gelwex puts his finger on the trigger , she herself shoots . With a loud oath from Gelwex , his gun drops from his hold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he turns from the window toward Barbara , who still kneels at the table , and lifts her head defiantly to his look , as The Curtain Falls THE THIRD ACT Two Days Later In the Frietchie house in Frederick . The living room of the house . This is an old Colonial hall , furnished in rosewood , with faded red brocade upholstery , and curtains of the same at the windows ; outside green Venetian blinds . The walls are white , and heavy green-black marble columns support a balcony , which runs across the entire end . From the centre of the balcony comes down a broad , crimson-carpeted staircase , with white spindles and a mahogany rail . Behind the staircase , underneath the balcony , is the front door . Off one end of the balcony , a door leads to other rooms in the house , off the opposite end , a door leads to Barbara 's room . There are big , comfortable armchairs about , and a table littered with magazines beside a window . Ferns and daisies are growing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . There is a general suggestion of disorder ; a bonnet and a pair of woman 's gloves lie carelessly on the mantel ; a man 's cloak has fallen on the floor beside an armchair . It is late in the afternoon . Barbara sits in the middle of the stair-case , listening , sorrowful and tense . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Comes in from the back way , entering by the parlor door at the Left . Miss Barbara , is yo ' hyah , honey ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Turning her head to see who it is . Oh , Mammy Lu ! Is the fighting over ? Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Yaas , Missy , or you would n't have cotched dis ole niggah woman out ! We ai n't heard no shots in our house fo ' dis long time . Barbara .

Mammy Lu Why , I done been tole , Missy , as how all dese low  --  down , ornery niggars of Massa Frietchie 's hez clahed out with the Yankees , and I jes ' felt in my bones as I could do something in the house fo ' you . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie That 's very kind of you , Mammy . How 's Sue ? Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Oh , she 's better ; but she near cotched her death goin ' with you to Hagerstown ! She talk yet exactly like a bull-frog , she does . Missy asked if you 'd seen your pa ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Yes , last night ; but he refuses to speak to me . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Lord o ' massy ! wo n't speak to his own chile ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Rising . Not a word ! He thinks I 'm already married to Captain Trumbull . Now , I want you to go upstairs to the spare room sending Mammy Lu up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimney-closet . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Frightened , stops on the stairs , half-way up . A man ! For Lawd 's sake , Missy ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Do n't be afraid ; he 's a Rebel soldier , wounded . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Going up stairs and along the balcony to the Left . Po ' man ! Done been hurted by some ornery Yank ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No , he was wounded by a woman , Mammy . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Stops , surprised a moment , and then goes on . Bress my soul ! Goes from of the balcony through the door at the Left . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Calls after her . Bring him down here ! She turns as she hears some one enter . Frietchie comes in from behind the stairs as she speaks . He is dusty and dirty ; his clothes are torn . Barbara runs toward him . Father ! Frietchie stops as she comes to him . She looks questioningly at him . He answers her gaze with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ! Frietchie moves up the stage to get past her and go to the parlor door . Barbara steps up the stage at the same time , to keep in front of him and block his way . No , no , father ! The fighting ! is it over ? She waits , but Frietchie does not answer . Barbara puts her two hands on her father , pleadingly . Tell me something . Who is wounded  --  who is safe ? Captain Trumbull ? Frietchie , as she speaks " Trumbull , " deliberately and firmly , but without hurting her , takes her hands off him , and , placing her out of his way , crosses toward the parlor door . Barbara calls after him , almost beside herself . For Heaven 's sake , father , speak to me ! Listen ! I will tell you the truth ! I am not married to Captain Trumbull ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Turning by the door . Is that the truth , or only said to make me tell you something ? Barbara . Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the Minister away , and took Will from me before I could be his wife ! Her father goes to her . Have you news of him ? Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Beside her . No , nothing ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Looking him straight in the eyes . You do n't know if he 's safe , or  --  wounded  --  or  --  She stops . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Better for you if he were among the missing ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Pushing him away from her , throws herself upon the bottom stairs . Oh , you are too cruel ! I love him ! I love him ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie You love your father too , do n't you ? Well , he 's my enemy and your brother 's ; but he seems to have driven love for your brother out of your heart ! I 've not heard you ask about his life ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Eagerly . Oh , yes , Arthur ; have you seen him ? Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Proudly . No , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , where the fighting was hottest ! Ahead , always ahead ! God bless him ! My boy ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie He 's alive ? Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Yes . Jack Negly saw him . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Rising . Thank God for that , for that ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie They gave Colonel Negly his commission yesterday , and Jack enlisted in his father 's regiment . Barbara stands with her arms linked around the newel post of the staircase . Frietchie walks up and down the hall . They say the old war-horse fought well . I envy him ! But even he does n't take away the glory from our boy . Every one I 've seen agrees Frederick owes most to Arthur Frietchie , that she is once more under the Southern flag . Come upstairs with me , and we 'll put the blessed banner out again . At the foot of the stairs he holds out his hand to her to take her upstairs with him . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Hesitating and not giving her hand . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my allegiance to that flag  --  Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Who has started a few steps up , turns . I would n't believe you ! Come , come , Barbara ! Leaning over the railing toward her , he grows more tender . You 've been attracted by a handsome stranger  --  this Yankee officer . You think you love him , but you 're only a girl . I 'm an old man , and I know what such love is worth . Wait till you 're older . Smoothing her hair affectionately with his hands as she stands below him , leaning against the newel post . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie My mother married you before she was my age ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Did she repent it ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No ! Nor will I when I marry Captain Trumbull ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Coming down again to the foot of the stairs . You 'll never marry him ! Your mother 's case was different . She and I grew up together , side by side , and when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barbara , here 's your daughter ! " , she smiled back at me through two big tears and said , " She 's yours ; make her as happy as you 've made me ! " And once again , the night before she died , she called you mine , and said , " Find her a husband , Southern , like her father ; do n't let her go away into the cold North ! Keep her near you  --  to take  --  my place  --  " He breaks down for a second and turns away , but controls himself at once , and turns back to Barbara . Barbara , your mother 's youngest brother , your Uncle Dick , fell in the fight to-day , killed by a Northern bullet  --  Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Taking a step toward him , interjects . Uncle Dick ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie And if they brought here even the dead body of Captain Trumbull , I 'd refuse it resting place under my roof ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Going to him , hand raised to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Enter Gelwex on the balcony , from the door Left . He is in civilian 's clothes , his right arm in a sling , splintered and bandaged . He comes to the top of the stairs . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Who 's this ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie A Rebel soldier I 've been hiding . His name is Gelwex . Gelwex comes down the stairs . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie To Gelwex . Were you fighting to-day ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex No , sir . I come from Hagerstown with the young lady couple of days back . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie You 're wounded ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Quickly and quietly . I did that ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie You ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie In Hagerstown . To Gelwex . Tell him , if you wish . She goes to the window under the balcony on the Left , and stands leaning against it , looking out . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex In a dogged manner . I was a sharpshooter in the Preacher 's house . I hed a grudge against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she shot first ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Outraged , angry . My daughter shot a soldier of the South ! Would to God you 'd killed him first ! It 's he who made the fighting here , to-day , double the work . We almost had the town , when he came on with reinforcements , and fought like a very devil ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Who has come quickly forward through this speech , eager to hear of CAPT . Trumbull . You told me you knew nothing ! Tell me more ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie That 's all I know . The Yankees turned your brain ! You , my daughter , shot a defender of the South ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie What a defender ! A deserter from the North , paid by our troops to betray his own ! I love the South , but I think this time she 's wrong . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Wrong ? Hush ! you 're crazy ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No ! A mother loves her child even when he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only flag I 'll wave is the flag of the Union , the flag my lover fights for ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Silence ! To Gelwex . You know this Captain Trumbull ? Barbara goes and sits on the long bench beside the chimney , watching the two men . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Yes , sir . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Where 's your company now ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Here in Frederick . It 's your son 's , sir . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie You 're ready to rejoin ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Yes , sir ; any minute ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Wait . Come with me ; I want a word with you . Motions Gelwex up the stairs ahead of him ; Gelwex starts . Sue Royce comes in from the parlor . She looks like a scarlet peony upside down , in a very fashionable dress of high-colored , rustling flounces , and hugs a small , three-cornered white worsted shawl tight around her bare shoulders . She shows evident signs of a heavy cold in her head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red as her dress . She sniffles constantly , almost without cessation , and pronounces all her " m 's " like " b 's , " her " n 's " like " d 's " and her " c 's " like " g 's , " etc . Whenever she is n't speaking , she holds a small , damp wad of a handkerchief pathetically , yet gracefully , to her nose . Barbara motions her quickly not to speak , with a finger on her lips and a gesture to Frietchie and Gelwex , who are about to go upstairs , not wishing Frietchie to know Sue has come in . But Frietchie hears the door slam behind Sue , and turns . Ah ! Good afternoon , Sue . Sue . Sue Royce Attempting dignity and politeness , but rather frightened . Good ebening , Bister  --  She sneezes . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Have you seen Arthur ? Sue . Sue Royce Do , sir . I thought berhabs he was here . She sniffles . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Not yet . But Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sue and now adds in an undertone to her . Shame her , if you can , girl , out of her infatuation for this Northerner . Go on , Gelwex . Frietchie and Gelwex go upstairs along the balcony , and enter the room at the Left . Sue . Sue Royce Going to Barbara . They sit together on the bench , where they speak quietly , almost in undertones . Doesn 'd he gnow I wend do Hagersdown with you ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No . Sue . Sue Royce Dell me aboud Arthur ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I only know he was very , very brave . He led his troops where the battle was fiercest . Sue .

Sue Royce He bust be very gradeful to you ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Half amused . Why ? For shooting him ? Sue . Sue Royce Do , for brig'gi'g hib here . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , that was the least I could do afterward . Besides , I thought it would keep him away from Captain Trumbull . Enter Mammy Lu . She comes again through the parlor door , this time with a steaming plate of hot biscuits . She goes to Barbara . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Thought you might be hungry , honey . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Shaking her head . No , thank you , Mammy . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu But your pa says you ai n't eat nothing to-day ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starbi'g , Babby .

Goes through the parlor door with Sue . Barbara starts to follow , calling " Mammy , " but stops as Arthur Frietchie and a Southern soldier  --  haggard , blood-and-powder stained  --  enter , supporting in their arms the body of Capt . Trumbull . He is wounded in the breast , and , wrapped tightly around to staunch the wound , in a narrow , twisted strip , is Barbara 's flag . Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Barbara ! He leans against the newel post to support himself and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . The other soldier goes out by the front door . Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Leaving Arthur 's arm to take a half step toward Barbara ; he is half dazed . Good-by , girl  --  He staggers , half falls . Arthur and Barbara catch him . He lies half on the floor , resting in Barbara 's arms , who kneels beside him , holding his head on her bosom . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Will ! My husband ! Hurt ! hurt ! Trumbull . Captain Trumbull Half raising himself with the force of a man in fever , and thinking he is again in battle . Come on , boys ! come on ! Push ahead ! Take the town and stop the bloodshed , before we make the place full of widows and fatherless ! That 's the only way , even though we must leave some sweethearts and mothers with aching hearts at home . On ! on ! Beat the drum , boy ! Beat with all your might ! Follow the flag ! For country and for love ! Ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ! no ! Go on ! I 've something here 'll staunch the wound and keep my heart beating till I see her ! He pauses a moment , and then adds in an undertone : Good God , Arthur Frietchie ! You fired that shot ! Do n't let her know her brother  --  Do n't let her know  --  He falls at Barbara 's feet . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Rising with a wild cry . Arthur ! you ' ? Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Yes , I  --  Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Beside herself . No ! no ! Arthur .

Arthur starts to speak in contradiction , but Barbara stops him with her hand on his arm . She calls to Frietchie . I 'm coming upstairs , father ; I 'll tell you in a minute ! Arthur . Arthur Frietchie Whispers . Why ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Whispers . Father swore to me just now he would n't let even the dead body of Captain Trumbull lie in this house . Quick !

Going toward the front door , he turns . Hide him well ! They have n't time to argue about how badly wounded a man is . If they find Trumbull , they 'll take him . He goes out into the street . Barbara , leaning against the newel post with Trumbull , her arms about him , holds her face close to his , her cheek against his cheek . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Oh , live ! live ! Mammy Lu re-enters . She starts in sympathetic surprise . Barbara speaks guickly . Not a word , Mammy ! Help me ! Quick ! Get Captain Trumbull up to my room ! Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Your room ?

Open that door for us , and go in . Motioning to the room off the balcony , Right ,  --  Barbara 's room . Gelwex opens the door . He goes into the room , they following him ; Mammy Lu closes the door behind them . Sue comes from the parlor with a lighted lamp , which lights up the hall .

Fred Gelwex Coming to the stairs and starting down them . Yes , sir . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Who is the wounded man in my daughter 's room ? The question stops Gelwex half way down the stairs ; he looks at Frietchie , startled by the question . Barbara steals out from her room , closing the door softly behind her , and listens on the balcony . Arthur and Sue listen , intent and frightened . Gelwex makes no answer . It 's Captain Trumbull ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex You 're right , sir . Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I could n't trust you ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex No , lady ! Did n't you hear ? The old gent guessed it ! Frietchie .

Mr. Frietchie Was n't it enough that the North should come and lay waste our land , that this man should push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ruins ? Do as I told you , Gelwex ! Gelwex starts again to go up the stairs . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Stopping him . No ! Wait ! She turns to her father , and stands behind his back . I ca n't argue with you , father . I can only beg and pray . She sinks slowly and softly to her knees , clasping his hands and arms . Let him stay ! Let him stay ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie No ! Gelwex turns his back discreetly , and watches the street through the window . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Softly . I love him ! If he goes , I go with him . If he dies , I die ! It will kill him ! Let him stay ! Stealing her hand about his , where it hangs clenched tight at his side . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie No ! Drawing his hand away . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Rising . Yes ! yes ! Do n't you remember what you said to me a little while ago ? I can still see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old rosewood bed we all of us knew as mother 's ,  --  I can see her sweet face pale on the great pillow  --  I see you bending over her with a tiny bundle in your arms  --  I see you place me  --  oh , so gently !  --  in those dear , thin hands  --  I hear you whisper , " Barbara , here 's your daughter ! " and I see her smile up at you through her tears and say , " Make her as happy as you 've made me ! " Father , my only happiness , all the joy there can ever be for me in this world , depends on the life of that man upstairs ! Send him out to die in our streets !  --  A pause . You break my heart  --  and  --  and damn my soul ,  --  for , if merciful death should n't come to me , I swear to you before Heaven , I 'd go myself to meet death ! Through this speech , Frietchie has been gradually moved ; Barbara sees this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishes with the threat in almost a whisper ; not an angry tone , but an exalted one . Still Frietchie does not altogether relent , and standing behind him she can not see the tears in his eyes . Her own eyes fitting , and her voice breaking pitifully , she leans her head and hands upon his shoulder , and begs again . Please  --  let him stay !  --  please ! Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Turns and looks into Barbara 's face , his own shamed , and trembling with emotion . He stays ! He takes her in his arms and kisses her . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie To Gelwex . You heard ? He stays ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Yes , lady ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Embracing her father . Oh ! You are twice my father to-day ! . And now one more thing . Arthur says a provost 's guard will come to our house and , if they find Captain Trumbull , will take him . Could you see General Jackson ? Could you keep our house shut to them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frietchie I can see General Jackson , but I wo n't lie to him , daughter ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie You need n't !

Barbara Frietchie Take Gelwex with you , but do n't tell him your errand . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Gelwex , come ! We 'll look for news ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie You 'll make haste , father ? Gelwex goes out behind the staircase . Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Yes . And , Barbara , you wo n't forget while I 'm gone , the master of the house is a Rebel ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No , father . Frietchie goes out . Hal Boyd comes from Barbara 's room and , crossing the balcony , comes down the stairs . Barbara goes eagerly to meet him . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Yes , yes ? Hal . Dr. Hal Boyd He is quieter ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good nurse . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie But he will live ? Hal .

Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Takes his hand . There is hope ! Hal . Dr. Hal Boyd There is always hope , thank God ! Pressing her hand firmly , and then going . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Alone . Absolute quiet  --  that 's what I can do ! I 'll stay here and watch till morning , and then take Mammy 's place . The front door bursts open , and Jack Negly enters . He bears the marks of battle upon him . His appearance is wild and disordered . His disappointed love for Barbara , and his terrible experience of the horrors of war that day , have overturned the boy 's brain . He enters like a small whirlwind , throwing his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of field flowers he has gathered roughly and stuck in his belt . Jack . Jack Negly Shouting as he comes in . Hello , Bab ! We 've won ! We 've won ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Going quickly to him . Hush ! Lower your voice ! Jack . Jack Negly Why ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie We 've a sick soldier in the house ! Jack . Jack Negly He 'll be glad to hear me shouting ! He 'll know we 've won ! Louder . Three cheers for Maryland and Stonewall Jackson ! Hooray ! He is interrupted by Barbara . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Seizing his arm . Hush , I tell you ! Jack . Jack Negly Sings and dances around her in a circle . Ho ! Hey ! My tragedy queen , Barbara , has her fine airs on ! Repeating ad lib .

Will you marry me , marry me , marry me , will you marry me , Babby ? Come ! Let 's go upstairs and see your sick soldier ! I 'll tell him how we won the fight and I won you ! With a movement toward the staircase . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Getting to staircase before him , and blocking his passage . No ! Jack . Jack Negly Then marry me , marry me now ! How I fought ! I wish you had seen me ! I killed three Yankees , one after the other , and all for you ! Do you understand ? Because I love you , and I want to make you love me ! Where 's your Northern lover ? I heard he was there , with his company , pegging away at us ! And I tried to find him , but  --  He breaks of suddenly , and an inspiration flashes over his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha ! That 's good ! He 's the sick soldier upstairs , and no more sick than I am ,  --  but I 'll make him sick ! Pulls out a pistol . Barbara stands at the foot of the stairs , blocking the way . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie With low intensity . Lower your voice ! Jack . Jack Negly Changing . They say I 'm mad ! Well , so I am ! From loving you ! And you made me love you , did n't you ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie I flirted with you , yes , and Heaven knows , I 'm sorry for it ! Jack . Jack Negly Yes ; you flirted with me . You knew I was in love with you , and you led me on . He pauses a moment , but she does not answer . It was fine , was n't it ? As many strings to your bow as you could get ! The more the merrier , for you ! But it was misery and hell for me ! I thought you cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimney . And so you would have he jumps up ; and so you will , my Bab , before I 'm through ! I went into this War to kill that man , and I 'll do it yet . He takes a step toward Barbara ; she stands upright , firm , undaunted , in front of the staircase . A moment 's pause . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie You certainly are mad to think Captain Trumbull is upstairs . Jack . Jack Negly Is n't he ? Col. Negly enters through the front door with a provost guard of six Confederate soldiers . Col. Negly . Col. Negly Miss Barbara , we are going through the houses for Yankee prisoners . If your father is home , his word 'll do that you 've none concealed here . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Wo n't my word do as well ? Col. Negly . Col. Negly No ! yours wo n't !

Jack Negly And he 's there , hidden in Barbara 's room  --  I know it ! Captain Trumbull ! Col. Negly . Col. Negly What ? The dog who came between you two ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No ! It 's a mad idea he has , that Captain Trumbull 's here . Gelwex comes into the hall from the street . Barbara looks at him , frightened . Jack . Jack Negly Ask him ! he knows ! Is n't Captain Trumbull upstairs ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Turns and looks at Barbara a moment . She looks pleadingly into his eyes . No ! Col. Negly . Col.

Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No . Colonel Negly , you shall not pass ! Col. Negly . Col. Negly Out of my way , girl ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie No ! you 'll have to drag me down these stairs ! Use force ! let your men charge bayonets ! for , of my own full will , I will not move ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Hold on , here 's Mr. Frietchie ! As Frietchie enters with a paper . He sees Col. Negly . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Leaning over the stair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old friend ? Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Have you got it ? Frietchie . Mr. Frietchie Yes . Giving her the paper . She hurriedly glances over it . Col. Negly . Col. Negly Frietchie , old friend , I 'm under orders to search your house . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Giving the paper to Col. Negly . This spares you , sir , that disagreeable duty ! Col. Negly reads it , with a smothered exclamation ; gives an order to his men , and goes out , followed by the guard . Jack also seems to follow , but stays hidden behind the stairs . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie To her father . Follow them and guard the front door for me ! This house is my fort now , and I mean to hold it ! Frietchie goes out under the staircase . Barbara turns to Gelwex . And you  --  why did you help me ? Giving him her hand . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex Embarrassed . I do n't know . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Yes , tell me . Gelwex . Fred Gelwex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara Frietchie Why ? Gelwex . Fred Gelwex With a half smile . Do n't know another woman good enough shot to only " wing " me !  --  Indicating his wounded arm . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Smiling gratefully at him , leads him toward the parlor door . Watch this side of the house for me . Let no one in ! Gelwex . Fred Gelwex All right , lady . Looks at her with respectful affection , and goes out . Barbara goes to the lamp . Behind her back , meanwhile , Jack has cunningly and softly stolen along the other side of the staircase , and , when Barbara puts out the lamp , he is at the foot of the stairs , on his hands and knees , ready to crawl up . Barbara , coming slowly forward in the dark , gives a sudden cry as she sees Jack 's creeping figure , in the moonlight , half my up the stairs . Jack hurries as he hears her voice . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie In a tone of command . Jack ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With her hand on the newel post at the foot of the staircase , she looks him straight in the face , trying to impel him by her will-power to obey her ; after a second 's pause , she speaks . Come down those stairs ! He half laughs , half sneers , and turns to go up farther , but a link hesitatingly . She speaks again . Jack Negly ! He turns slowly and faces her , with a half laugh , half sneer ; she fixes him with her eyes ; his own try to shift , but finally are fixed in return upon hers . After a second , and still holding him with her eyes , she repeats in a low but firm , strong voice : Come back ! After a few seconds ' pause , with his eyes still fixed upon hers , he comes slowly down the stairs ; at the foot he sinks down , bursting into sobs . Jack . Jack Negly Oh , Barbara ! Barbara ! you have broken my heart ! Barbara leans over him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Forgive me  --  by not breaking mine ! She gradually influences and leads him away from the stairs , and guides him from the hall into the room where Gelwex is . She shuts the door , and leans against it alone a moment to gather strength . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie One chance in a thousand ! She goes slowly to the stairs , and up them , dragging herself along by the rail ; once she nearly falls . At the top , she rests a moment . I 'll fight for that chance ! She steals softly to the closed door , behind which Trumbull lies . Reaching the door , she kneels beside it , and , pressing her ear close , she listens intently , as  --  The Curtain Falls THE FOURTH ACT The Next Morning The First Scene .  --  Barbara 's room . A large , square bedroom , whose walls are covered with a big pink-flowered paper , chintz of a like color and pattern draping the window , dressing-table and old four-posted bed . A set of rosewood furniture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the cool-looking room of a lovable girl . It is not littered and cluttered with knick-knacks and memorial rubbish , but there are a few photographs of interesting , if not all beautiful , people about , and the dressing-table is strewn with the pretty , useful and ornamental paraphernalia of a woman 's toilet . On the Left is a door which leads out onto the upstairs balcony of the hall , and a window at the back . The bed stands out from the wall on the right side of the room , and by it stands now a small table . On this are some linen cloths , a glass of water , a cup and saucer , and a smallish hand lamp , lit . Beside this table , in a high-backed armchair , sits Mammy Lu , very lightly dozing . The window curtains are closed and drawn , and there is a faint , cold , gray light in the room . In the bed lies Capt . Trumbull . The door opens very slowly and softly , and Barbara steals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disordered , and her hair unbound and disarranged . She closes the door gently behind her , and pauses a second , as Mammy Lu opens her eyes and rouses herself . She sees Barbara , and nods her head slowly but encouragingly , and rising , comes slowly and softly to her . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Whispers when she and Barbara are side by side . The two women speak only in half whispers . He done gone to sleep mos ' quiet-like some time ago , and he have n't moved sence . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Softly . I 'll take your place . Father 's gone down to the hotel . He stayed up all night with me . We kept watch in the hall . And he would n't go to bed now ; he said he wanted to be outdoors and get the air . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Better open the curtains and let in some fresh air here , too . Dis room is jes ' powerful close . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Is it safe to do that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bes ' thing , honey . I 'll put out dis here lamp ; do n't need that no mo ' . Mammy Lu goes to the little table for the lamp ; very softly she arranges the things on the table , blows out the lamp , and comes to meet Barbara . Barbara has meanwhile gone to the window and silently pulled back the curtains . A pallid dawn shines in  --  the sun is about to rise . Barbara comes back and meets Mammy Lu in the centre of the room . She looks sadly at Mammy Lu , who looks back sympathetically , lovingly , at Barbara , and , during this exchange of glances and sympathy , there is a perfect silence . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Lifting her head . How still it is ! Both women stand with their sides toward the bed . They make a movement of the head and eyes to show that they are listening for some sound from Trumbull . A moment 's pause , then Barbara whispers more softly . Ought n't we hear him breathe ? Mammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But do you  --  do you hear anything ? Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Frightened . No , Missy ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Go  --  and see  --  Mammy Lu goes to the bed and leans over ; a pause . Barbara waits in an agony of suspense ; slowly the old woman stands up straight and turns toward her . Barbara reads the truth in her face , and with a cry of " Mammy ! " starts toward the bed . Mammy Lu tries to stop her , taking hold of her kindly . Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Honey ! he 's sleepin ' his last sleep ! Barbara gives a half cry , a half moan , and , going to the bedside , throws herself on the floor , her head and arms on the bed . She cries out pitifully . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Will ! My sweetheart ! my lover ! my husband ! Do n't leave me ! Do n't leave me ! At this moment , from far off , many men 's voices are heard singing " Dixie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing . Turning so she can see Mammy Lu , she questions , breathless , horror-struck , sitting upright in a forlorn little heap on the floor . She speaks in a toneless voice . What is that ? Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu Who has gone to the window at the sound of the singing , and looked out . It 's the Southern sogers , chile , marching through the town . Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Why ? Mammy Lu . Mammy Lu ' Cause they'se done ben victorious ! Barbara . Barbara Frietchie Vict  --  ! Barbara rises sharply , as if struck , to her feet . No ! no ! It ca n't be true ! It ca n't be true ! The soldiers ' voices swell a little louder . She bends over the bed and slowly drags away from Trumbull 's body the blood-stained , ragged flag she had given him ; clasping it to her bosom , breathing with difficulty , and suppressing her sobs , she goes across and out of the room . Mammy Lu follows her , alarmed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childhood , trying to soothe and comfort her . As they pass out of the door , the stage is darkened . The Second Scene .  --  The strains of " Dixie " an heard , mingled with the shouts and cries of excited people and children . The street is seen , the same as in the First Act , but full of movement , commotion , and sound . It is early of a sunny morning . From all the houses , except the Frietchie house , hang Rebel flags and banners . The windows of all the houses are full of men , women and children , even babies in arms ( of large , affectionate , colored nurses ) , in points of vantage . Sally Negly is in an upper Negly window , and Laura in a Royce window . The steps of the houses are full , too , and the red-brick pavement is crowded almost to the curb . A row of boys and girls are sitting on the Royce fence , and two urchins are up in a tree . The soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixie , " and the crowd , shouting " Here they corme ! Here they come ! " go almost mad in the uproar and confusion . They surge forward over the street , from where the procession is expected . A Man . A Man On the Negly steps . Three cheers for Stonewall Jackson ! The Crowd . The Crowd In the street . Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Boy . Boy On the Royce fence . Three cheers for Colonel Negly and Arthur Frietchie ! All . All Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Hurrah ! During these cheers , Barbara opens the shutters leading onto the Frietchie balcony , and comes out . She carries her lover 's blood-stained flag in her hand , and leans against the side of the window a moment to gather her strength . The singing of the soldiers of the stage swells louder , as they come nearer . A Man . A Man On the Negly steps . They 're acoming now ! A Man . A Man On the Frietchie steps . Give it to ' em good ! Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distant soldiers . Barbara has come forward on the balcony and , reaching up , is fastening the Union flag to the staff there . Sally Negly . Sally Negly In her window . Look ! Look at Barbara Frietchie ! Sss ! Shame ! Shame ! All look up who can , and all who ca n't see , crane their necks and lean over . A Young Woman . A Young Woman In a window . Damn the Yankee wife ! A Man . A Man On the Negly steps . Take that flag down ! All . All Take it down ! Ad lib . The crowd surge about the Frietchie house . They shout , and boo , and hiss at Barbara , calling " Shame ! " and " Tear it down ! " " Damn the Yankee girl , " etc. , etc . The men and boys pick up stones and loose bricks , and begin throwing them at Barbara and the flag . The soldiers ' voices off stage swell louder . A small crowd in advance of the procession come rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Man On the Negly steps , shouts excitedly . Here they are ! Jackson ! The crowd , with a wild shout of joy , turn and surge from the Frietchie house toward the advancing soldiers , echoing the cry of " Jackson ! " They are forced back onto the steps and against the houses in crowded rows , to leave room for the procession . They sing and shout , waving handkerchiefs and flags , sticks and hats , bursting into a climax of glad frenzy as Gen. Stonewall Jackson appears . A shower of bouquets fall before and around him from the women in the crowd and in the windows of the houses . His Aides and Staff accompany Jackson , and are followed by a Drum-and-Fife Corps . In the line , two ragged , blood-stained , powder-scorched flags of the Confederacy are carried . The soldiers are many of them wounded , wearing any kind of uniform they can scrape together ,  --  haggard , worn , but a brave crowd of men , rejoicing in a victory for a cause that is blessed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march , the crowd in the street singing with them . As Jackson approaches the Frietchie stoop , the crowd remember Barbara and her flag . Some one in the crowd throws a stone , which is the signal for a fresh outburst . A Man . A Man On the Negly steps . Shoot if she does n't drop it ! Shoot ! This cry is taken up by the crowd , and , with groans and hisses and shouts of " Shoot " and " Damn the flag , " the excited people again surge against the Frietchie house , breaking the window glass with sticks and stones , while a boy climbs a pillar of the balcony and tries to tear down the flag . Barbara , hardly knowing what she does , with the thought of her dead lover in the room behind her , bruised by the stones thrown by the angry mob below her , clings to the flag . It is seen that she is trying to speak , and the crowd , moved by curiosity , suddenly hush to hear her . Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , dearer to me than my own . Shoot , and I 'll thank you ! but spare your flag ! Jackson , passing the house , has seen and heard . He cries out . Stonewall Jackson . Stonewall Jackson Halt ! Who touches a hair of that woman , dies like a dog ! A short pause Pass the word along ! An Aide leaves Jackson , and passes along behind the soldiers . A moment after , a man 's voice is heard in the distance giving this order : " Who harms the girl on a balcony with a Union flag will be shot ! " This is followed by another man 's voice , still further off , repeating the order . Jackson gives the order to continue the march . Forward ! March ! The soldiers start marching , singing at the same time . Barbara , holding on to the flag , half-fainting , supports herself against the balcony railing . Her head is lifted , her expression exalted . The people are half of them singing with the soldiers and half shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , Col. Negly leads on his company , Jack among them . Jack sees Barbara , and , quietly and quickly aiming , shoots her . There is a cry and a gasp of horror from the crowd in unison . The soldiers halt , the singing of those in sight stops . Sue , who sees Barbara , with a wild scream fights her way through the crowd and the soldiers , crying : " Barbara ! Barbara ! Barbara ! " There is a great commotion everywhere . " Dixie " is heard faintly from the soldiers in the distance , who have not yet heard of something happening . Barbara , when shot , has fallen back against the house , still clinging to the flag . After a moment , she staggers forward and falls , kneeling on the balcony , her head and arms hanging over . Col. Negly . Col. Negly Who fired that shot ? Jack . Jack Negly Proudly , quite mad . I did ! He lifts a pistol quickly to his head , but is seized and pinioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in horror at the confession of his dearly loved son . He loses his control for a minute , and can not speak . First soldier . First soldier What shall we do with him , Colonel ? Mammy Lu has come onto the balcony with Sue , and kneels by Barbara . Col. Negly . Col. Negly With a great effort regains his self-control , and , though his voice trembles , he still speaks with the authority of an officer . Carry out your orders ! Forward ! March ! The procession marches on over the flower-strewn pavement , the people and soldiers in silence , the strains of " My Country , ' t is of Thee " in the air , as Back matter The Curtain Falls
