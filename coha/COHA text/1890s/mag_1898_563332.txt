txt TRAVELERS in the Sierra forests usually complain of the want of life . " The trees , " they say , " are fine , but the empty stillness is deadly ; there are no animals to be seen , no birds . We have not heard a song in all the woods . " And no wonder ! They go in large parties with mules and horses ; they make a great noise ; they are dressed in outlandish , unnatural colors : every animal shuns them . Even the frightened pines would run away if they could . But Nature lovers , devout , silent , open-eyed , looking and listening with love , find no lack of inhabitants in these mountain mansions , and they come to them gladly . Not to mention the large animals or the small insect people , every waterfall has its ouzel and every tree its squirrel or tamias or bird : tiny nuthatch threading the furrows of the bark , cheerily whispering to itself as it deftly pries off loose scales and examines the curled edges of lichens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some singer - oriole , tanager , warbler - resting , feeding , attending to domestic affairs . Hawks and eagles sail overhead , grouse walk in happy flocks below , and song sparrows sing in every bed of chaparral . There is no crowding , to be sure . Unlike the low Eastern trees , those of the Sierra in the main forest belt average nearly two hundred feet in height , and of course many birds are required to make much show in them and many voices to fill them . Nevertheless , the whole range from foothills to snowy summits is shaken into song every summer ; and though low and thin in winter , the music never ceases . The sage cock - Centroeercus urophasianus - is the largest of the Sierra game-birds and the king of American grouse . It is an admirably strong , hardy , handsome , independent bird , able with comfort to bid defiance to beat , cold , drought , hunger , and all sorts of storms , living on whatever seeds or insects chance to come in its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant on its desert range . In winter , when the temperature is oftentimes below zero , and heavy snowstorms are blowing , he sits beneath a sage bush and allows himself to be covered , poking his head now and then through the snow to feed on the leaves of his shelter . Not even the Arctic ptarmigan is hardier in braving frost and snow and wintry darkness . When in full plumage he is a beautiful bird , with along , firm , sharp-pointed tail , which in walking is slightly raised and swings sidewise back and forth with each step . The male is handsomely marked with black and white on the neck , back , and wings , weighs five or six pounds , and measures about thirty inches in length . The female is clad mostly in plain brown , and is not so large . They occasionally wander from the sage plains into the open nut - pine and juniper woods , but never enter the main coniferous forest . It is only in the broad , dry , half-desert sage plains that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer , cold in winter . If any one passes through a flock , all squat on the gray ground and hold their heads low , hoping to escape observation ; but when approached within a rod or so , they rise with a magnificent burst of wing-beats , looking about as big as turkeys and making a noise like a whirlwind . On the 28th of June , at the head of Owen 's Yalley , I caught one of the young that was then just able to fly . It was seven inches long , of a uniform gray color , blunt-billed , and when captured cried lustily in a shrill piping voice , clear in tone as a boy 's small willow whistle . I have seen flocks of from ten to thirty or forty on the east margin of the park , // where the Mono Desert meets the gray foothills of the Sierra ; but since cattle have been pastured there they are becoming rarer every year . Another magnificent bird , the blue or dusky grouse , next in size to the sage cock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not in great numbers . They like best the heaviest silver - fir woods near garden and meadow openings , where there is but little underbrush to cover the approach of enemies . When a flock of these brave birds , sauntering and feeding on the sunny flowery levels of some hidden meadow or Yosemite valley far back in the heart of the mountains , see a man for the first time in their lives , they rise with hurried notes of surprise and excitement and alight on the lowest branches of the trees , wondering what the wanderer may be , and showing great eagerness to get a good view of the strange vertical animal . Knowing nothing of guns , they allow you to approach within a half dozen paces , then quietly hop a few branches higher or fly to the next tree without a thought of concealment , so that you may observe them as long as you like , near enough to see the fine shading of their plumage , the feathers on their toes , and the innocent wonderment in their beautiful wild eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon become shy , and when disturbed fly into the highest , leafiest trees , and suddenly become invisible , so well do they know how to hide and keep still and make use of their protective coloring . Nor can they be easily dislodged ere they are ready to go . In vain the hunter goes round and round some tall pine or fir into which he has perhaps seen a dozen enter , gazing up through the branches , straining his eyes while his gun is held ready ; not a feather can he see unless his eyes have been sharpened by long experience and knowledge of the blue grouse 's habits . Then , perhaps , when he is thinking that the tree must be hollow and that the birds have all gone inside , they burst forth with a startling whir of wing - beats , and after gaining full speed go skating swiftly away through the forest arches in a long , silent , wavering slide , with wings held steady . During the summer they are most of the time on the ground , feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the margills of open spots and rocky moraines , playing and sauntering , taking sun baths and sand baths , and drinking at little pools and rills during the heat of the day . In winter they live mostly in the trees , depending on buds for food , sheltering beneath dense overlapping branches at night and during storms on the leeside of the trunk , sunning themselves on the southside limbs in fine weather , and sometimes diving into the mealy snow to flutter and wallow , apparently for exercise and fun . I have seen young broods running beneath the firs in June at a height of eight thousand feet above the sea . On the approach of danger , the mother with a peculiar cry warns the helpless midgets to scatter and bide beneath leaves and twigs , and even in plain open places it is almost impossible to discover them . In the meantime the mother feigns lameness , throws herself at your feet , kicks and gasps and flutters , to draw your attention from the chicks . The young are generally able to fly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly well they are usually advised to run and hide and lie still , no matter how closely approached , while the mother goes on with her loving , lying acting , apparently as desperately concerned for their safety as when they were featherless infants . Sometimes , however , after carefully studyiiig the circumstances , she tells them to take wing ; and up and away in a blurry birr and whir they scatter to all points of the compass , as if blown up with gunpowder , dropping cunningly out of sight three or four hundred yards off , and keeping quiet until called , after the danger is supposed to be past . If you walk on a little way without manifesting any inclination // to hunt them , you may sit down at the foot of a tree near enough to see and hear the happy reunion . One touch of nature makes the whole world kin ; and it is truly wonderful how love-telling the small voices of these birds are , and how far they reach through the woods into one another 's hearts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so full of anxious affection , few mountaineers can fail to be touched by them . They are cared for until full grown . On the 20th of August , as I was passing along the margin of a garden spot on the head-waters of the San Joaquin , a grouse rose from the ruins of an old juniper that had been uprooted and brought down by an avalanche from a cliff overhead . She threw herself at my feet , limped and fluttered and gasped , showing , as I thought , that she had a nest and was raising a second brood . Looking for the eggs , I was surprised to see a strong - winged flock nearly as large as the mother fly up around me . Instead of seeking a warmer climate when the winter storms set in , these hardy birds stay all the year in the High Sierra forests , and I have never known them to suffer in any sort of weather . Able to live on the buds of pine , spruce , and fir , they are forever independent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us trouble , dragging us here and there away from our best work . How gladly I would live on pine buds , however pitchy , for the sake of this grand independence . With all his superior resources , man makes more distractin.g difficulty concerning food than any other of the family . The mountain quail or plumed partridge ( Oreortyx pictus plumiferus ) is common in all the upper portions of the park , though nowhere found in large numbers . He ranges considerably higher than the grouse in summer , but is unable to endure the heavy storms of winter . When his food is buried he descends the range to the brushy foothills , a height of from two thousand to three thousand feet above the sea ; but like every true mountaineer , he is quick to follow the spring back into the highest mountains . I think he is the very handsomest and most interesting of all the American partridges , larger and handsomer than the famous Bob White , or even the fine California valley quail or the Massena partridge of Arizona and Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a lonely mountaineer he is not half known . His plumage is delicately shaded , brown above , white and rich chestnut below and on the sides , with many dainty markings of black and white and gray here and there , while his beautiful head plume , three or four inches long , nearly straight , composed of two feathers closely folded so as to appear as one , is worn jauntily slanted backward like a single feather in a boy 's cap , giving him a very marked appearance . They wander over the lonely mountains in family flocks of from six to fifteen , beneath ceanothus , manzanita , and wild cherry thickets , and over dry sandy flats , glacier meadows , rocky ridges , and beds of bryanthus around glacier lakes , especially in autumn when the berries of the upper gardens are ripe , uttering low clucking notes to enable them to keep together . When they are so suddenly disturbed that they are afraid they can not escape the danger by running into thickets , they rise with a fine hearty whir and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square mile or so , a few of them diving into leafy trees . But as soon as the danger is past , the parents with a clear piping note call them together again . By the end of July the young are two thirds grown and fly well , though only dire necessity can compel them to try their wings . In gait , gestures , habits , and general behavior they are like domestic chickens , but infinitely finer , searching for insects and seeds , looking to this side and that , scratching among fallen leaves , jumping // up to pull down grass heads , and clucking and muttering in low tones . Once when I was seated at the foot of a tree on the head-waters of the Merced , sketching , I heard a flock up the valley behind me , and by their voices gradually sounding nearer I knew that they were feeding toward me . I kept still , hoping to see them . Soon one came within three or four feet of me , without noticing me any more than if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against which I was leaning , my clothing being brown , nearly like the bark . Presently along came another and another , and it was delightful to get so near a view of these handsome chickens perfectly undisturbed , observe their manners , and hear their low peaceful notes . At last one of them caught my eye , gazed in silent wonder for a moment , then uttered a peculiar cry , which was followed by a lot of hurried muttered notes that sounded like speech . The others , of course , saw me as soon as the alarm was sounded , and joined the wonder talk , gazing and chattering , astonished but not frightened . Then all with one accord ran back with the news to the rest of the flock . " What is it ? what is it ? Oh , you never saw the like , " they seemed to be saying . " Not a deer , or a wolf , or a bear ; come see , come see . " " Where ? where ? " " Down there by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree , stretching their necks , and looking up in turn as if knowing from the story told them just where I was . For fifteen or twenty minutes they kept coming and going , venturing within a few feet of me , and discussing the wonder in charming chatter . Their curiosity at last satisfied , they began to scatter and feed again , going back in the direction they had come from ; while I , loath to part with them , followed noiselessly , crawling beneath the bushes , keeping them in sight for an hour or two , learning their habits , and finding out what seeds and berries they liked best . The valley quail is not a mountaineer , and seldom enters the park except at a few of the lowest places on the western boundary . It belongs to the brushy foothills and plains , orchards and wheatfields , and is a hundred times more numerous than the mountain quail . It is a beautiful bird , about the size of the Bob White , and has a handsome crest of four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect at times or drooping forward . The loud calls of these quails in the spring - Pe-checkah , Pe-check-a , Hoy , Hoy - are heard far and near over all the lowlands . They have vastly increased in numbers since the settlement of the country , notwithstanding the immense numbers killed every season by boys and pot-hunters as well as the regular leggined sportsmen from the towns ; for man 's destructive action is more than counterbalanced by increased supply of food from cultivation , and by the destruction of their enemies - coyotes , skunks , foxes , hawks , owls , etc. - which not only kill the old birds , but plunder their nests . Where coyotes and skunks abound , scarce one pair in a hundred is successful in raising a brood . So well aware are these birds of the protection afforded by man , even now that the number of their wild enemies has been greatly diminished , that they prefer to nest near houses , notwithstanding they are so shy . Four or five pairs rear their young around our cottage every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile within four or five feet of the stable door , and did not leave the eggs when the men led the horses back and forth within a foot or two . For many seasons a pair nested in a tuft of pampas grass in the garden ; another pair in an ivy vine on the cottage roof , and when the young were hatched , it was interesting to see the parents getting the fluffy dots down . They were greatly excited , and their anxious calls and directions to their many babes attracted our attention . They bad no great dif // ficulty in persuading the young birds to pitch themselves from the main roof to the porch roof among the ivy , but to get them safely down from the latter to the ground , a distance of ten feet , was most distressing . It seemed impossible the frail soft things could avoid being killed . The anxious parents led them to a point above a spir*a bush , that reached nearly to the eaves , which they seemed to know would break the fall . Anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite coaxing and encouragement got them to tumble themselves off . Down they rolled and sifted through the soft leaves and panicles to the pavement , and , strange to say , all got away unhurt except one that lay as if dead for a few minutes . When it revived , the joyful parents , with their brood fairly launched as the journey of life , proudly led them down the cottage hill , through the garden , and along an osage orange hedge into the cherry orchard . These charming birds even enter towns and villages , where the gardens are of good size and guns are forbidden , sometimes going several miles to feed , and returning every evening to their roosts in ivy or brushy trees and shrubs . Geese occasionally visit the park , but never stay long . Sometimes on their way across the range , a flock wanders into Hetch-Hetchy or Yosemite to rest or get something to eat , and if shot at , are often sorely bewildered in seeking a way out . I have seen them rise from the meadow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four or five hundred feet was reached , then form ranks and try to fly over the wall . But Yosemite magnitudes seem to be as deceptive to geese as to men , for they would suddenly find themselves against the cliffs not a fourth of the way to the top . Then turning in confusion , and screaming at the strange heights , they would try the opposite side , and so on , until exhausted they were compelled to rest , and only after discovering the river cai'ion could they make their escape . Large harrow-shaped flocks may often be seen crossing the range in the spring , at a height of at least fourteen thousand feet . Think of the strength of wing required to sustain so heavy a bird in air so thin . At this elevation it is but little over half as dense as at the sea level . Yet they hold bravely on in beautifully dressed ranks , and have breath enough to spare for loud honking . After the crest of the Sierra is passed it is only a smooth slide down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may rest as long as they like . Ducks of five or six species , among which are the mallard and wood duck , go far up into the heart of the mountains in the spring , and of course come down in the fall with the families they have reared . A few , as if loath to leave the mountains , pass the winter in the lower valleys of the park at a height of three thousand to four thousand feet , where the main streams are never wholly frozen over , and snow never falls to a great depth or lies long . In summer they are found up to a height of eleven thousand feet on all the lakes and branches of the rivers except the smallest , and those beside the glaciers encumbered with drifting ice and snow . I found mallards and wood ducks at Lake Tenaya , June 1 , before the ice-covering was half melted , and a flock of young ones in Bloody Cafion Lake , June 20 . They are usually met in pairs , never in large flocks . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave swimmers , no stream too rapid . In the roaring , resounding cafion torrents , they seem as much at home as in the tranquil reaches and lakes of the broad glacial valleys . Abandoning themselves to the wild play of the waters , they go drifting confidingly through blinding , thrashing spray , dancing on boulder-dashed waves , tossing in beautiful security on rougher water than is usually encountered by sea birds when storms are blowing . // A mother duck with her family of ten little ones , waltzing round and round in a pot-hole ornamented with foam bells , huge rocks leaning over them , cascades above and below and beside them , made one of the most interesting bird pictures I ever saw . I have never found the great northern diver in the park lakes . Most of them are inaccessible to him . He might plump down into them , but would hardly be able to get out of them , since , with his small wings and heavy body , a wide expanse of elbow room is required in rising . Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the northward about Lassens Butte and Shasta , at a height of four thousand to five thousand feet , making the loneliest places lonelier with the wildest of wild cries . Plovers are found along the sandy shores of nearly all the mountain lakes , tripping daintily on the water 's edge , picking up insects ; and it is interesting to learn how few of these familiar birds are required to make a solitude cheerful . Sandhill cranes are sometimes found in comparatively small marshes , mere dots in the mighty forest . In such spots , at an elevation of from six thousand to eight thousand feet above the sea , they are occasionally met in pairs as early as the end of May , while the snow is still deep in the surrounding fir and sugarpine woods . And on sunny days in autumn , large flocks may be seen sailing at a great height above the forests , shaking the crisp air into rolling waves with their hearty koor-r-r , koor-r-r uck-uck , soaring in circles for hours together on their majestic wings , seeming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outspread like a map mottled with lakes and glaciers and meadows , and streaked with shadowy cafions and streams , and surveying every frog marsh and sandy flat within a hundred miles . Eagles and hawks are oftentimes seen above the ridges and domes . The greatest height at which I have observed them was about twelve thousand feet , over the summits of Mount Hoffman , in the middle region of the park . A few pairs had their nests on the cliffs of this mountain , and could be seen every day in summer , hunting marmots , mountain beavers , pikas , etc . A pair of golden eagles have made their home in Yosemite ever since I went there thirty years ago . Their nest is on the Nevada Fall Cliff , opposite the Liberty Cap . Their screams are rather pleasant to hear in the vast gulfs between the granite cliffs , and they help the owls in keeping the echoes busy . But of all the birds of the High Sierra , the strangest , noisiest , and most notable is the Clarke crow ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly two feet in extent of wing , ashy gray in general color , with black wings , white tail , and a strong sharp bill , with which he digs into pine cones for the seeds on which he mainly subsists . He is quick , boisterous , jerky , and irregular in his movements and speech , and makes a tremendously loud and showy advertisement of himself , - swooping and diving in deep curves across gorges and valleys from ridge to ridge , alighting on dead spars , looking warily about him , and leaving his dry springy perches trembling from the vigor of his kick as he launches himself for a new flight , screaming from time to time loud enough to be heard more than a mile in still weather . He dwells far back on the high , storm-beaten margin of the forest , where the mountain pine , juniper , and hemlock grow wide apart on glacier pavements and domes and rough crumbling ridges , and the dwarf pine makes a low crinkled growth along the flanks of the summit peaks . In so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . Everybody notices him , and nobody at first knows what to make of him . One guesses he must be a woodpecker , another a crow or some sort of jay , another a magpie . He seems to be a pretty thoroughly mixed and fermented compound of all these birds , has all their // strength , cunning , shyness , thievishness , and wary , suspicious curiosity combined and condensed . He flies like a woodpecker , hammers dead limbs for insects , digs big holes in pine cones to get at the seeds , cracks nuts held between his toes , cries like a crow or Steller jay , - but in a far louder , harsher , and more forbidding tone of voice , - and besides his crow caws and screams , has a great variety of small chatter talk , mostly uttered in a fault-finding tone . Like the magpie , he steals articles that can be of no use to him . Once when I made my camp in a grove at Cathedral Lake , I chanced to leave a cake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few minutes afterward I saw my soap flying past me through the grove , pushed by a Clarke crow . In winter , when the snow is deep , the cones of the mountain pines empty , and the juniper , hemlock , and dwarf pine orchards buried , he comes down to glean seeds in the yellow pine forests , startling the grouse with his loud screams . But even in winter , in calm weather , he stays in his high mountain home , defying the bitter frost . Once I lay snowbound through a three days ' storm at the timber-line on Mount Shasta ; and while the roaring snow-laden blast swept by , one of these brave birds came to my camp , and began hammering at the cones on the topmost branches of half-buried pines , without showing the slightest distress . I have seen Clarke crows feeding their young as early as June 19 , at a height of more than ten thousand feet , when nearly the whole landscape was snowcovered . They are excessively shy , * and keep away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but when one goes on without seeming to notice them , or sits down and keeps still , their curiosity speedily gets the better of their caution , and they come flying from tree to tree , nearer and nearer , and watch every motion . Few , I am afraid , will ever learn to like this bird , he is so suspicious and self-reliant , and his voice is so harsh that to most ears the scream of the eagle will seem melodious compared with it . Yet the mountaineer who has battled and suffered and struggled must admire his strength and endurance , - the way he faces the mountain weather , cleaves the icy blasts , cares for his young , and digs a living from the stern wilderness . Higher yet than Nucifraga dwells the little dun - headed sparrow ( Leuco. sticte tephroeotis ) . From early spring to late autumn he is to be found only on the snowy icy peaks at the head of the glacier cirques and cafions . His feeding grounds in spring are the snow sheets between the peaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold insects go mountaineering almost as soon as they are born , ascending the highest summits on the mild breezes that blow in from the sea every day during steady weather ; but comparatively few of these adventurers find their way down or see a flower bed again . Getting tired and chilly , they alight on the snow fields and glaciers , attracted perhaps by the glare , take cold , and die . There they lie as if on a white cloth purposely outspread for them , and the dun sparrows find them a rich and varied repast requiring no pursuit , - bees al-id butterflies on ice , and many spicy beetles , a perpetual feast , on tables big for guests so small , and in vast banqueting halls ventilated by cool breezes that ruffle the feathers of the fairy brownies . Happy fellows , no rivals come to dispute possession with them . No other birds , not even hawks , as far as I have noticed , live so high . They see people so seldom , they flutter around the explorer with the liveliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly a mile , to meet him and conduct him into their icy homes . When I was exploring the Merced group , climbing up the grand calion between the Merced and Red mountains into the fountain amphitheatre of an ancient // glacier , just as I was approaching the small active glacier that leans back in the shadow of Merced Mountain , a flock of twenty or thirty of these little birds , the first I had seen , came down the cafton to meet me , flying low , straight toward me as if they meant to fly in my face . Instead of attacking me or passing by , they circled round my head , chirping and fluttering for a minute or two , then turned and escorted me up the cailon , alighting on the nearest rocks on either hand , and flying ahead a few yards at a time to keep even with me . I have not discovered their winter quarters . Probably they are in the desert ranges to the eastward , for I never saw any of them in Yosemite , the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are among the best and most conspicuous of the mountaineers , flashing their ruby throats in countless wild gardens far up the higher slopes , where they would be least expected . All one has to do to enjoy the company of these mountain-loving midgets is to display a showy blanket or handkerchief . The arctic bluebird is another delightful mountaineer , singing a wild , cheery song and " carrying the sky on his back " over all the gray ridges and domes of the subalpine region . A fine , hearty , good-natured lot of woodpeckers dwell in the park , and keep it lively all the year round . Among the most notable of these are the magnificent log cock ( CeophUens pileatus ) , the prince of Sierra woodpeckers , and only second in rank , as far as I know , of all the woodpeckers of the world ; the Lewis woodpecker , large , black , glossy , that flaps and flies like a crow , does but little hammering , and feeds in great part on wild cherries and berries ; and the carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark of trees for winter use . The last named species is a beautiful bird , charmingly familiar and far more common than the others . In the woods of the West he represents the eastern red-head . Bright , cheerful , industrious , not in the least shy , the carpenters give delightful animation to the open Sierra forests at a height of from three thousand to fifty-five hundred feet , especially in autumn when the acorns are ripe . Then no squirrel works harder at his pine-nut harvest than these woodpeckers at their acorn harvest , drilling holes in the thick , corky bark of the yellow pine and incense cedar , in which to store the crop for winter use ; a hole for each acorn , so nicely adjusted as to size that when the acorn , point foremost , is driven in , it fits so well that it can not be drawn out without digging around it . Each acorn is thus carefully stared in a dry bin , perfectly protected from the weather , - a most laborious method of stowing away a crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem never to weary at the work , but go on so diligently that they seem determined to save every acorn in the grove . They are never seen eating acorns at the time they are storing them , and it is commonly believed that they never eat them or intend to eat them , but that the wise birds store them and protect them from the depredations of squirrels and jays , solely for the sake of the worms they are supposed to contain . And because these worms are too small for use at the time the acorns drop , they are shut up like lean calves and steers , each in a separate stall with abundance of food , to grow big and fat by the time they will be most wanted , that is , in winter , when insects are scarce and stall-fed worms most valuable . So these woodpeckers are supposed to be a sort of cattle-raisers , each with a drove of thousands , rivaling the ants that raise grain and keep herds of plant lice for milk cows . Needless to say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When Emerson was in the park , having heard the worm story and seen the great pines plugged full of acorns , he asked ( just to pump me , // I suppose ) , " Why do the woodpeckers take the trouble to put acorns into the bark of the trees ? " " For the same reason , " I replied , " that bees store honey and squirrels nuts . " " But they tell me , Mr. Muir , that woodpeckers do n't eat acorns . " " Yes , they do , " I said , " I have seen them eating them . During snowstorms they seem to eat little besides acorns . I have repeatedly interrupted them at their meals , and seen the perfectly sound , half-eaten acorns . They eat them in the shell as some people eat eggs . " " But what about the worms ? " " I suppose , " I said , " that when they come to a wormy one they eat both worm and acorn . Anyhow , they eat the sound ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the time they store them until they are used they guard them , and woe to the squirrel or jay caught stealing . " Indians , in times of scarcity , frequently resort to these stores and chop them out with hatchets ; a bushel or more may be gathered from a single cedar or pine . The common robin , with all his familiar notes and gestures , is found nearly everywhere throughout the park , - in shady dells beneath dogwoods and maples , along the flowery banks of the streams , tripping daintily about the margins of meadows in the firand pine woods , and far beyond on the shores of glacier lakes and the slopes of the peaks . How admirable the constitution and temper of this cheery , graceful bird , keeping glad health over so vast and varied a range . In all America he is at home , flying from plains to mountains up and down , north and south , away and back , with the seasons and supply of food . Oftentimes , in the High Sierra , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hear the reassuring voice of this fellow wanderer ringing out sweet and clear as if saying , " Fear not , fear not . Only love is here . " In the severest solitudes he seems as happy as in gardens and apple orchards . The robins enter the park as soon as the snow melts , and go on up the mountains , gradually higher , with the opening flowers , until the topmost glacier meadows are reached in June and July . After the short summer is done , they descend like most other summer visitors in concord with the weather , keeping out of the first heavy snows as much as possible , while lingering among the frost-nipped wild cherries on the slopes just below the glacier meadows . Thence they go to the lower slopes of the forest region , compelled to make haste at times by heavy all-day storms , picking up seeds or benumbed insects by the way , and at last all , save a few that winter in Yosemite valleys , arrive in the vineyards and orchards and stubble-fields of the lowlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awakening old-time memories among the white-headed pioneers , who can not fail to recognize the influence of so homelike a bird . They are then in flocks of hundreds , and make their way into the gardens of towns as well as into the parks and fields and orchards about the bay of San Francisco , where many of the wanderers are shot for sport and the morsel of meat on their breasts . Man then seems a beast of prey . Not ev*n genuine piety can make the robin-killer quite respectable . Saturday is the great slaughter day in the bay region . Then the city pot-hunters , with a ragtag of boys , go forth to kill , kept in countenance by a sprinkling of regular sportsmen arrayed in selfconscious majesty and leggins , leading dogs and carrying hammerless , breechloading guns of famous makers . Over the fine landscapes the killing goes for ward with shameful enthusiasm . After escaping countless dangers , thousands fall , big bagfuls are gathered , many are left wounded to die slowly , no Red Cross Society to help them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the most devout of the bird butchers , who go to church . carrying gold-headed // canes instead of guns . After hymns , prayers , and sermon they go home to feast , to put God 's songbirds to use , put them in their dinners instead of in their hearts , eat them , and suck the pitiful little drumsticks . It is only race living on race , to be sure , but Christians singing Divine Love need not be driven to such straits while wheat and apples grow and the shops are full of dead cattle . Songbirds for food ! Compared with this , making kindlings of pianos and violins would be pious economy . The larks come in large flocks from the hills and mountains in the fall , and are slaughtered as ruthlessly as the robins . Fortunately , most of our songbirds keep back in leafy hidings , and are comparatively inaccessible . The water ouzel , in his rocky home amid foaming waters , seldom sees a gun , and of all the singers I like him the best . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a robin , with short , crisp , but rather broad wings , and a tail of moderate length , slanted up , giving him with his nodding , bobbing manners a wrennish look . He is usually seen fluttering about in the spray of falls and the rapid cascading portions of the main branches of the rivers . These are his favorite haunts ; but he is often seen also on comparatively level reaches and occasionally on the shores of mountain lakes , especially at the beginning of winter , when heavy snowfalls have blurred the streams with sludge . Though not a water bird in structure , he gets his living in the water , and is never seen away from the immediate margin of streams . He dives fearlessly into rough , boiling eddies and rapids to feed at the bottom , flying under water seemingly as easily as in the air . Sometimes he wades in shallow places , thrusting his head under from time to time in a nodding , frisky way that is sure to attract attention . His flight is a solid whir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going from place to place along his favorite string of rapids he follows the windings of the stream , and usually alights on some rock or snag on the bank or out in the current , or rarely on the dry limb of an overhanging tree , perching like a tree bird when it suits his convenience . He has the oddest , neatest manners imaginable , and all his gestures as he flits about in the wild , dashing waters bespeak the utmost cheerfulness and confidence . He sings both winter and summer , in all sorts of weather , - a sweet , fluty melody , rather low , and much less keen and accentuated than from the brisk vigor of his movements one would be led to expect . How romantic and beautiful is the life of this brave little singer on the wild mountain streams , building his round bossy nest of moss by the side of a rapid or fall , where it is sprinkled and kept fresh and green by the spray ! No wonder he sings well , since all the air about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a song , and he gets his first music lessons before he is born ; for the eggs vibrate in time with the tones of the waterfalls . Bird and stream are inseparable , songful and wild , gentle and strong , - the bird ever in danger in the midst of the stream 's mad whirlpools , yet seeming immortal . And so I might go on , writing words , words , words ; but to what purpose ? Go see him and love him , and through him as through a window look into Nature 's warm heart.
