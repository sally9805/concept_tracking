txt FACTS are stronger than arguments , and it is little better than a waste of words to reply to the charges which are now from many sides brought against Catholics here in the United States . From the earliest colonial period they have been here and have been loyal and devoted citizens . They have taken part in every phase of private and public life . They have mingled with those of other faiths , in the family , in the professions , in the trades , in commerce , in legislative assemblies , and on battlefields where the nation 's fate has hung upon the issue . Like other men , they have had their weaknesses and their faults , but among these lack of love for America has had no place . They founded one of the thirteen colonies , and were the first in the New World , the first , indeed , in all the world , to make freedom of conscience an organic part of the constitution of the State . Their action marks an era in the progress of mankind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonies with England and which had become a fetter , none more generously than the Catholics hearkened to the trumpet call , and in the darkest days of the struggle Catholics from Europe mingled their blood on our battlefields with that of our fathers . If long tenure , if fidelity , if honorable deeds , have aught of efficacy , Catholics have the right to be here , nor has this right ever become forfeit by any act or attempt of the Catholic Church in America . Whatever controversy there may be as to other times and lands , her course here has been one of honor , of light , of peace , of beneficence . She has devoted herself to works of religion and humanity . She has done and is doing more for education , for the orphan , the aged , the sick and the fallen , than any other church . She has never attempted to dictate to her adherents in civil mat-I // ters , nor has she sought to control political parties ; and if her followers are to a large extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence or interference of priests and bishops , who seldom know or care to what political party the members of their congregations belong . Catholics , though generally Catholic only in name , have been and are busy , often too busy , with politics , especially with municipal politics ; but this is a common right of all American citizens , and in centres where there are great numbers of Catholics , some of them inevitably will be found among the political schemers , and consequently will be more or less implicated in the hypocrisy , trickery , and fraud by which our whole political life is tainted . A bad Catholic is no better than any other bad man . lie is not a Catholic in truth , but since the Catholic Church , whatever those who do not know her spirit may think , is patient , broad , and tolerant , she is slow to expel any one from the fold , loth to pluck up the cockle lest the wheat also be uprooted . The reckless greed of our great money getters has led them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe to come here to supplant more intelligent and consequently more costly workers . These people , many of whom are Catholics , neither understand our language nor have any right conception of our civil and political life , and when they are throivn out of work and brought to the verge of starvation , they sometimes listen to the appeals of Anarchists and resort to violence . The church is not responsible ; her influence , on the contrary , is the only moral and civilizing force which is brought to bear on these poor people . Far from desiring this kind of immigration , the American bishops and priests would be glad to have it cease . Towards our fellow-citizens who are not Catholics our behavior is and has been without reproach . We have never sought to excite prejudice against those who differ from us in religious faith much less have we sought to persecute any man for conscience sake . No body of Catholics in America has ever fostered or in any way encouraged those who wriggle and batten in the filth and animalities of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to city to appeal to the prurient imaginations and corrupt hearts of the vulgar . If here and t*iere these cowardly attacks have led to violence and riot , the employers of the meu whose only argument is outrageous insult are responsible . The // Catholic pastors uniformly advise their flocks to keep away from these men and the places in which they hold their meetings . No body of Catholics , in this country , not under the ban of the church , have ever formed themselves into secret oath-bound societies , for good or evil ends . Our bishops and priests have no hidden policy , no deep laid schemes , of any kind . Our life is undisguised , our churches are open to all , our books may be had by every one , in our schools thousands of Protestants are thrown hourly into nxost intimate contact with our teachers as servants and partners , as friends and relations , we are intermingled with the whole people . Whoever desires information about us has not far to seek . What then is the cause of the abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we seem to be the objects ? Why has it been thought necessary to organize secret societies , which have spread rapidly throughout the country , to oppose and hurt us ? These are far-reaching questions , and to answer them satisfactorilyin brief space is difficult . At the root of all such outbreaks and movements there lies the traditional Protestant view of the Catholic Church , which , though it has long ceased to have any meaning for enlightened minds , still holds sway over those who are too busy or too ignorant to be able to react against inherited prejudice . They still believe that the Catholic Church is the Scarlet Woman and the Pope the Man of sin ; and that Catholics consequently are capable of any crime or baseness which it may occur to any one to impute to them . They believe that Jesuits are cunning hypocrites who are never happy unless they are doing mischief ; that nunneries are prisons , or worse ; that priests sell permission to commit sin and are ever ready to betray any country they may belong to at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whatever else of horrible a perverse or corrupt imagination may be able to conjure up concerning us , the true victims of the Protestant tradition are ready to believe ; and , though such retarded minds are become comparatively few , they are still numerous enough to form a nucleus around which may gather all those who , whether honestly or from motives of self-interest , are glad to enter upon an anti-Catholic crusade . The Orange societies constitute a centre of this kind for the Apaists . No more bitter , blind , or fanatical religious spirit exists than theirs . Its prejudice is unrelieved by a suspicion of doubt , its hatred is as gen // uine as it is unreasoning and unrelenting , and , like a wind-fanned flame , it leaps forth with mad glee whenever there is an opportunity to do harm to Catholics . Here is a force ready at hand , in English-speaking countries , for those who wish to stir up religious strife . What are the causes which have led so many Americans who have no sympathy with Orangeism to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of persecuting Catholics ? The rapid and vigorous growth of the Church in America has , I suppose , excited apprehensions of danger among those in whose minds its influence is associated with ignorance , superstition , and corruption . Our success , too , largely due to immigration , may have aroused jealousy as well as fear ; and I am the more willing to believe this as I observe , on many sides , that the envious rivalry of Protestant denominations among themselves is a chief cause of their weakness . In thousands of villages where one church and one capable minister would find support , three or four congregations representing different sects are established , and they are all feeble . The result is discouragement and indifference . Among Catholics themselves , in the last few years , a certain spirit of boastfulness became , here and there , manifest . When as yet , leaving aside our accessions from Europe , our losses are greater than our gains , some of us began to proclaim that America was to be made Catholic at no distant day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the outburst of a perfervid temper , they aroused unkind thoughts in many whose dislike of us is more genuine than their love of toleration . To make matters worse we began to quarrel among ourselves . National differences of thought , sentiment , and custom , which reach so far and go so deep , threatened to prove stronger than the harmonizing and constructive force of a common religious faith . It happened , as it nearly always does happen when the controversial spirit is let loose , that the real issue came to be not truth and justice , but victory . In the heat of conflict wild words were spoken and overbearing deeds were done . The reporters , who scent a scandal as vultures a carcass , rushed in , and the country was filled with sound and fury . The loyalty of German Catholics was called into question . They were accused of conspiring with a certain Cahensly , a citizen of Prussia , against the interests of this country . Cahensly himself was as powerless as he was unknown , and , if harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by influencing the Pope to do wrong ; and the Catholics who made such an outcry against Cahenslyism seemed really to dread lest the Pope should be induced to do a foolish or wicked thing . Their temper was controversial , but the bigots took them seriously . Intelligent people among us know the Pope would not if he could , could not if he would , hurt America ; but to multitudes the cry of danger from the Papists is as effective as Dalila 's shout to Samson that the Philistines were upon him . The Faribault school compromise , leading as it did to discussions which attracted wide attention , was another cause of alarm . The incident itself was neither novel nor important , and it doubtless would have escaped public notice had not the impression been made that it was the starting of a scheme by which Catholics hoped to get their share of the school fund . It was , in fact , a local affair , as to which there was no preconcerted agreement among the bishops , the far greater number of whom thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view , and all that Rome could be induced to concede was that what had been done at Faribault might be tolerated . Word had gone forth , however , that Faribaultism was a cunningly devised scheme of the Jesuits , by which they expected , while getting financial support for their own schools , to undermine the common schools . The charge was as false as it was ridiculous , but when public suspicion is aroused assertion is as effective as proof . The Faribanlt episode , in itself insignificant , became the occasion of sending a papal envoy here , and of establishing a permanent papal delegation in Washington , which , from whatever point it be considered , is an affair of grave moment . From the beginning the American bishops , whenever consulted , strongly opposed the founding of such an institution here . When the question was put to the archbishops at their rheeting in New York , in the fall of 1892 , it was their almost urfanimous opinion that it would be unwise to appoint a delegate for this country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops , had the matter been proposed to them , would have taken the same view . The question of a delegation is , of course , not a question of faith , or morals , or discipline , or rule , affecting the whole Church ; but one of ecclesiastical policy : and those whose knowledge of the country was most accurate and intimate // believed that the establishment of a papal delegation here would be bad policy . Whether they have been justified by the event , so far as the internal affairs of the church are concerned , it is not necessary here to inquire ; but that the Delegate has been and is a source of strength to the Apaists there can be no doubt . With us , as in the Protestant world generally , anti-Catholic prejudice is largely anti-papal prejudice ; and when the organs of public opinion were filled with the sayings and doings of " the American Pope , " who though a foreigner , with no intention of becoming a citizen , ignorant alike of our language and our traditions , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fresh fuel was thrown upon the fire of bigotry . The fact that his authority is ecclesiastical merely , and concerns Catholics , not as citizens , but as members of the church , is lost sight of by the multitudes who are persuaded that the papacy is a political power eager to extend its control wherever opportunity may offer . This feeling , which has existed among us from the beginning , led our first bishop , Carroll of Baltimore , who was beyond doubt a devoted churchman and a true patriot , to make an official declaration in 1797 , on Washington 's birthday , wherein he affirmed that the obedience we owed the Pope is " in things purely spiritual . " And such has been our uniform belief and teaching , as whoever takes the trouble to read what those who have the best right to speak for us have written on this subject will see . Various causes , more or less intimately related to our religious life , having conspired to produce an anti-Catholic outbreak , the movement received added force from sources apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between employers and wage-earners , capitalists have come to look upon the labor unions as an obstacle to the successful management of their various businesses , and are therefore anxious to weaken or dissolve these associations . When the Orange spirit began to become more active , it naturally occurred to the iiianagers of railways and other enterprises in which large numbers of men are employed , that religious fanaticism might be made use of to divide the laborers and undermine their unions . For this purpose , then , and not from any hatred of the Catholic religion , for corporations being soulless must be indifferent to religion , the Apaists were encouraged and gained much influence in some of our large // carrying and manufacturing concerns . It happened also that the greater number of these fanatics were Republicans , and they became a source of embarrassment to the party . It was impossible to ignore them , and , at first thought , the simplest thing to do seemed to be to connive at them . Very soon , however , they became so strong that connivance ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage or the will to expel them , the party which freed the negro began to encourage the bigots who have gotten up a religious persecution and are striving to deprive Catholics of the rights of freemen . Many Democrats , too , whose hatred of the church is stronger than their love of liberty and fair play , have gone over to the Apaists . From this brief statement of the causes which have led to the rise and favored the spread of the new knownothingism , I turn to consider some of the charges which the leaders of the crusade advance as a justification of their systematic attack upon American Catholics ; and as they are neither new nor true , the discussion of them must necessarily be somewhat uninteresting . There is , first of all , the time-honored objection of a divided and incompatible allegiance  --  the contention that Catholics , since they owe obedience to the Pope , can not be loyal subjects of the state . The answer is obvious . Our obedience to the Pope is confined to the domain of religious faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with us at least , claims no jurisdiction over such matters , there can be no question of conflict . We have , and none are more thankful for this than the Catholics , a separation of the Church from the State . If it be urged that to draw the line of demarcation is difficult , I reply that in the general course of things this difficulty presents itself hardly at all . That it may arise all confess , but it may arise just as easily for Protestants as for Catholics . Al men in our age  --  and this is one of the most far reaching peculiarities of Christian civilization-hold a double allegiance , and are prepared , if needs be , to appeal from men to God , from laws to conscience , from authority to reason , from numbers to justice . " I will obey all the laws of my country faithfully , " says Ruskin , " so far as such laws or commands are consistent with what I suppose to be the law of God ; and when they are not or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose them loyally and deliberately , not with malicious , concealed , or disorderly violence . " The Pope has never attempted to interfere in the // civil or political affairs of this country , and were he to attempt to do so his action would be resented by the Catholics more quickly than by others . One reason why our representative men have always opposed the appointment of a papal delegate for the United States was their unwillingness to give our enemies even a pretext for accusing us , as citizens , of being under foreign influence . The Pope is our religious , not our civil or political , superior . Deeds , more than words , prove , and have proven , both our patriotism and our Catholic faith , and there is no reason why we , more than others , should make protestation of our loyalty . To protest is half to confess , as to exhort is to reproach ; and to urge American Catholics to love their country , which is as dear to them as their heart 's blood , is to imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for patriotism is without blot or stain , and it is not necessary for us to hold the flag in our hands when we walk the streets , to wave it when we speak , to fan ourselves with it when we are warm , and to wrap it about us when we are cold . Let us hope , at least , that in speaking of it we shall never stoop to the vulgar slang of " Old Glory , " which is only a lesser desecration than the shots which riddled it when it floated amid the battle 's smoke upheld by heroic hands . Another charge , which , like the brook with its senseless prattle , goes on forever , is that Catholics are foes of the common schools-as the amiable Episcopal Bishop of Albany puts it , that " they do not love the public school system nor the theory of universal education . " Were it not that most men become the victims of oft-repeated assertion , it would be difficult to explain the continuance of this accusation , for our position on the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed . We believe that religion is an essential element of human nature , and , therefore , of right education ; and where it is possible to do so , we found and maintain schools , in which , along with other things , we teach also what we believe to be religion . Inasmuch as this is not done in the common schools , we find the system defective , but we do not condemn it ; for in a country such as ours no other system of state schools seems to be possible , and we are openly and without reservation in favor of free schools , and , consequently , in favor of a school tax . For my own part  --  and I think I express the Catholic view-I not only would not , had I the power , destroy // the public-school system , but would leave nothing undone to develop and perfect it . I believe in free schools , in universal education , and , wherever public opinion is sufficiently enlightened , in compulsory school attendance . The objections which the bishops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Edwards Law were based upon the fact that these laws were an infringement on the principle of freedom in matters of education . If here and there individuals have made efforts to get public moneys for parochial schools , the Catholic body is not to be held responsible for their acts . The attempt to commit the Catholics of the nineteenth century here in America to all the deeds and utterances of those in the middle ages is futile . We do not hold that the Popes have never been in the wrong ; nor are we bound , to quote Cardinal Newman , " to defend the policy or the acts of particular popes , whether before or after the great revolt from their authority in the sixteenth century . " If the public law of Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries permitted them to declare forfeit the authority of tyrannical princes and emperors , it does not follow that they are permitted to do this now . We are Catholics , but we are also men , and though the essential tenets of the faith are immutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with frank sincerity , with cheerful acquiescence , the principles involved in the rule of the people by the people and for the people , and are content to abide the issue . Why , then , in a country in which all have agreed to make freedom of conscience and liberty of worship inalienable rights , in which it is a fundamental principle of public life and rule that no man shall suffer hurt because of his religious faith , is a secret oath-bound society , whose one great aim is to subvert this primary article of our political creed , suffered to exist and encouraged in its nefarious schemes ? Why have hundreds of teachers been expelled from their places simply because they were Catholics ? Do not Catholics like others pay the school tax ? Is not every career open to talent ? Why are men hired to go from town to town , not to discuss our doctrines and practices , but to insult , mock , vilify , and calumniate us ? No American Catholic certainly can object to the free discussion of his religious beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can have no tendency to advance the cause of truth , provoke to vio // lence , and where there is liberty there should be protection from such wanton and malicious attacks . Let the fair-minded read any of the numerous Apaist newspapers which are sold on the streets of nearly all our cities and towns , and then ask themselves whether a cause which is upheld by such methods and defended with such weapons is not self-condemned . Their creed is a creed of spite and hatred . Their ways are secret and dark ; their arguments are lies and forgeries , and their victims are generally women whose only crime is their intelligence and their religion . In the presence of all this , Bishop Doane , in the spirit of sweetness and light , asks us to take a more conciliatory tone . He would doubtless advise the lamb to conciliate the wolf , for which the only possible conciliation is the having the lamb in its maw . This outburst of anti-Catholic hatred will pass away , of course . The American people love justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very genius is goodwill to men . They are not bigots or fanatics , or persecutors , but in the meanwhile Apaism is hurtful to the best interests of the country , it diverts attention from the momentous problems which are pressing upon us , it separates friend from friend , it sows the seeds of suspicion and distrust , it makes innocent victims , and is doing all that it is possible to do to verify the saying of a well-known Englishman that the only civilized country in which it is less pleasant to live than in the United States is Russia . But I must make an end . One of the disadvantages under which the magazine writer labors is that when he gets well into his subject , the editor , regardless of Macbeth 's curse , is sure to be the first to cry , Hold , enough !
