txt To advise the Republicans in Congress to drop the Dingley-Aldrich Tariff bill and say no more about it is to give a counsel of unattainable perfection . The Republican Party exists for tariff making and can not in reason be expected to abandon the object of its being . Nevertheless , it would be better for the party to drop the Tariff bill . It would have fewer and less powerful enemies now and hereafter . It would be more united There would not be so many old-time Republicans going about proclaiming that they had had enough of . The present angry disposition of the country to punish the party and drive it out of power would be immediately and visibly modified . We suppose nine Republicans out of ten would reply that the party gave pledges in its platform that it would revise the tariff in the interests of American labor and American industries , and that it would never do for Congressmen to go home without having passed a Tariff bill . Democrats talked in that way three years ago after the Wilson bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedeviled that it made tariff-reform Democrats sick . But the Democratic Party would have been better off if the House had put the axe to the perverted measure and postponed tariff revision to a more propitious season . The responsibility of leaving the act in force would have been serious , but less damaging to the Democracy than the ill-repute of that scandalous sugar schedule . The Dingley-Aldrich bill will come out of the conference committee the most shameful and infuriating tariff measure ever put before the country . There will be a disgraceful wrangle over it , and possibly some ugly scandals It may not pass at all . If it does pass , it will doom its makers to certain defeat in the next Congressional elections . And the longer it is in force the angrier the country will get . Better drop it altogether .
