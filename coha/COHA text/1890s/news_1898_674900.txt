If the revolutionary movement is general and extends to very many of the islands , the task presented to the United States military and naval authorities will be one of great magnitude , in the event that it is decided to be incumbent upon us not to restore Spanish sovereignty where it has been lost , but to prevent its overthrow in sections where it is still supreme , and to prevent excesses and outrages at the hands of the insurgents .
