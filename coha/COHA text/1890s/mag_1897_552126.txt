A STEPSON OF NEW ENGLAND . By Joseph M. Rogers . ENGLAND is loved and honored by her children . Proud of their heritage , they have been faithful to her traditions , and she is justified o f them . They have gone forth to conquer , and have kept her banners unfurled . They have sounded her praises until her name has gone out through all the earth . XVhat other sections think of New England is also pretty well known . The positiveness characteristic of her has sometimes provoked antagonisms ; but I do not dwell on them . They have never robbed New England of what is justly hers . What one descended on one side from New Englandso to speak , a stepson of New England-thinks of her is not so commonly divulged , and it may not be without interest . I probably represent many thousands of those whose inheritance runs back to New England , but whose lines have been cast in other places . As there are more Irish in America than in Ireland , so there are more New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if the exiles do not look upon their mother section as do those to the manner born , they yet have an interest in her that is very deep . I propose to give the ideas of a stepson in regard to New England during youth as possibly of some intereist to those who have never left the home . My belief is that New England blood tells even to the third and fourth generations . These impressions were all derived as a stranger , for I have made few journeys to New England-only one-until after reaching man 's estate . My grandfather came of a long line of Connecticut deacons . He inherited his theology from Jonathan Edwards and his business principles from sources now extinct . He was a merchant in Litchfield County , Connecticut , a neighbor of the Beechers , and one of the supporters of the boarding school at Cornwall for the education of the Hawaiian youth . One of my early recollections is of finding in my father 's library a thin , dilapidated book with a title I could not read . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the story of Henry Oobookiah , the first Hawaiian convert to Christianity . He told me his history , and it gave me an interest in 1-Jawaijan affairs which has lasted to this day and made me furious over much in the policy of our government in regard to that nation in 1893 . My grandfather was a man of substance , extensively engaged in the manufacture of buckskin gloves and the like . A business partner , who bought skins in the West , put up a little game  --  the ungodly in some places call it a " Yankee trick " - on my grandfather , so that the firm was embarrassed . Though my grandfather could have escaped doing so , he paid all the debts of the firm of three members out of his private resources , and found himself at forty-five with only a few thousand dollars . Like many others before and since , he then resolved to start life anew in the Ohio Western Reserve , at the time almost a Connecticut colony . My father , who was ready to enter Yale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , for he had set great store by a college education , and Ohio then seemed about as far off as Alaska does today . My youthful days were regaled with the story of this trip by the Erie Canal and Lake Erie to Cleveland , and I looked on my father 720 // as a veritable Marco Paulo . lVly grandfather settled at Oberlin , where the college had a reputation exceeding any in the West for scholarship and any anywhere for notoriety , since it was a hotbed of the anti-slavery agitation . There were two important features about Oberlin College : it was a cheap place to get an education , and it was open to both sexes . The atmosphere was exceedingly religious , the college being under the presidency of Rev. Charles G. Finney , the most noted evangelist of his day , and it was accounted a safe place to send young people . It was there that my father met my mother , a Philadelphia Quakeress ( New Englanders would never call them Friends ) , and in due process of time Puritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antislavery man , but not of the Garrison wing . He believed in prayer and the ballot box , and looked to the Lord to bring about His purpose in His own good time . How many New England people remember the bitterness between the Garrison wing and the Birneywing ? Theformerwas most radical and violent in his theories , while the latter deprecated incendiary methods . Soon after his marriage , my father , then a clergyman , made a visit to central Kentucky , to that portion just south of the rich blue grass plantations , then as now populated by the descendants of the original Virginians , who came over the mountains more than a century ago . Here was a considerable population of the finest physical specimens of manhood the country has produced . In spirit they were like the Swiss mountaineers . Neither they nor their ancestors had ever come into contact with an effete civilization . Their wants were few and easily supplied . The earth yielded of her fruits , and the fruits yielded limited linen for homespun shirts and apple-jack for unlimited consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than the " Mayflower . " The mountaineer blacksmith made the rifles that did service in every war since Boone first trod the dark and bloody ground . A log hut was the Kentuckian 's castle , while nature furnished him abundant food . He was a giant in strength , chivalrous in conduct , quick in choler and swift in revenge . The clansmen of Scotland were not bound together more closely than the families in Kentucky , whose feuds carry on their devastating work to this day . A horse and a rifle were his necessaries of existence ; hunting and revivals his amusements . It was a good race of its kind , but sequestered in the mountain valleys it had let civilization run far beyond it . Of education there was but little . Books and newspapers there were none , and if the traveling parson could read his Bible he furnished all the mental stimulus the community received , except an occasional stump speeech in an exciting campaign . To have heard Henry Clay speak was a liberal education . My father , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . He found among the youth a desire for knowledge which there was no opportunity to satisfy , and he resolved to found an academy where something besides the three R 's could be learned . On the last ridge of the Cumberland mountains he pitched his tents , and laid in the wilderness the foundation of what is today a prosperous college . Professor Shaler of Harvard , in his recent work on Kentucky , has spoken of the wonderful geological characteristics of the state . From this knoll , built of lower measures of the Carboniferous age , the strata dropped in two miles northward through the upper and lower Silurian ages , the latter 's soft limestone being the basis of the wonderful fertility of the Blue Grass country . To the south the mountains showed a remarkable number of outcroppings of the Carboniferous measures rich in coal and fossil remains , particularly on one peak which is the highest point of land from Cumberland Gap to Lake Erie . But I am digressing. // If that well meaning but misguided man , John Brown , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many million people four years to perform , I should have been born a Kentuckian , but in getting ahead of his future , he deprived me of that privilege . My father 's academy was an instant success . Not only youth but grown men flocked to the log cabin , where he taught not only the rudiments , but algebra , chemistry , Greek and Latin . It was the marvel of that age . The thirst for knowledge was remarkable among a totally unlettered people , although the older heads were doubtful of the new learning and had a great prejudice against a man who did not drink whiskey . All good Baptist preachers did that , though some had preached a restriction of one barrel each year to a family , and were known as " Forty Gallon Baptists . " They were not popular . Looking southward to the mountains my father could see nothing but free soil . To the northward , on the fairest acres in God 's earth , lay miles of plantations tilled by a happygo-lucky race of negroes , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always well fed . When it was known that my father was a friend of Harriet Beecher Stowe , it provoked a prejudice against him among the slave-holding population ; but they sent their sons to his school , as there was none other like it in the county . But after John Brown 's raid there grew up a feeling that under cover of education my father was carrying on an anti-slavery propaganda . My father , while fixed in his views , as became a Puritan , was discreet , but some of his associates were less so . Some , goods shipped from the North were opened at the county seat for fear they were Sharpe 's rifles , and the first glance at some candle-moulds so far confirmed the suspicion that the goods were nearly confiscated . I do not think my father ever fired a gun or a revolver in his life , and as for stirring up the slaves to escape or to insurrection - why , he was a disciple of Birney . But the suspicion grew that he was a confederate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . At a mass meeting one County Court day , sixty men , " the best in the county , " which is the oldest in the state , were appointed a committee to notify my father and his associates to leave Kentucky in ten days or decorate the tree in front of the academy . An appeal to Governor Magoffin proving useless , the little caravan moved on Christmas Day , 1859 , my parents taking their two infants on horseback forty miles to the nearest railway station . And so it can*e that my parents crossed the Ohio and settled a few miles from General Grant 's birthplace . Three days before the shot fired on Sumter ushered in the greatest conflict of modern times , I was born as one out of due season on a strange soil on the north bank of the Ohio . If I live to be eighty , I shall take great pride in telling how I was born before the Civil War , though I hope I shall not be expected to give many personal reminiscences of it . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John Morgan 's raids , when that gallant freebooter entered the village and found that every man above fifteen years , except two pensioners of the War of 1812 , had gone twenty miles away to prevent him from crossing the river . On that occasion my mother buried two teaspoons which came over on the " Mayflower " and a tablespoon given one of her remote ancestors by Letitia Penn ; and those treasures remain unto this day . My other recollection of the war is more cheerful . On my fourth birthday I was given a " party . " While regaling myself and friends with lemonade and seed cake on the lawn that evening , I was surprised to see the whole village population gather in front of our house , and with banners waving and loud hussas calling for my father , who made a speech , which seemed to please them immensely . I felt touched at the // honor done me and believed I deserved it . I have an indistinct recollection of hearing some talk about Lee surrendering and the war being over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday was April 9 , 1865 , but that fell on Sunday , so it was celebrated the next day . It was then the news of Appomatox arrived . I do remember the next Sunday . I was taken to church as usual , and was about to regale myself with the usual caraway-seed cakes after the long prayer , when someone rushed in with a newspaper in his hands and cried out " Lincoln 's dead ! " I shall never forget the scene which followed . The church was crowded , and my father was to preach a sermon of thanksgiving at the conclusion of the war . There was silence for a short time , and then everyone burst out crying . I cried too , lustily . I had heard of Lincoln ever since I could remember , and had drunk in admiration for him with my mother 's milk . In fact I had an idea he and Jesus Christ were much the same , and I was badly scared when I heard he was dead . Then my father read from the pulpit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my memory , but I do remember the looks of agony on everyone 's face . Men 's hearts failed for fear . It seemed as if the war must be fought over , and we were right on the border land . Young as I was these impressions endure to this day . The war being over , my father returned to Kentucky and reopened his academy , now dignified by the name of college . The students came trooping back , many of them young men wearing army uniforms . I was put into the lowest class , and had mastered the alphabet ( they taught us our letters in those unregenerate days ) and had proceeded in McGuffey 's First Reader to the chapter beginning " Ned , can you hop so far ? " when a very exciting event took place . There were something over one hundred and fifty students in the large room one morning , when two wee mites appeared and asked to go to school . In ten seconds the room was empty and the young men and women were flying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Now new students came nearly every day , but there was a marked peculiarity about these two : they were colored ! Like a true New Englander , my father decided that as God had " made of one blood all nations to dwell on the earth , " the little freedmen should be admitted , and he was not a little astonished on asking the boy 's name to learn that it was Napoleon Bonaparte , while his sister , black as Erebus , rejoiced in the name of Dove . This , I believe , was the first time that colored children ever entered a white school in the South . It nearly broke up the institution . Some students returned , but more did not , while blacks took their places . Today it is the only college in the country where whites and blacks of both sexes attend in nearly equal proportions . Even the mountaineers who had fought for the Union did not believe in " nigger equality , " and the years that followed were full of trials . The Ku-Klux came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never molested my father . Some of them had gone to the school before the war , and no one who ever knew my father wanted to harm him. * While a child I was never tired of hearing my father tell of his boyhood days in New England - of snowdrifts twenty feet deep , of swimming in the river , of Thanksgiving days where there were one hundred pies , and so on , until I felt that my father was a very foolish man to leave such a delightful place , to come and live in the wilderness . It was Thanksgiving day in 1865 when we reached our Kentucky home . Even then I knew what the day meant , * In the March , s8* ' , number of the New England Magazine Rev. W. E. Barton in an tarticle on " The Cumberland Mountains " gave a foil history of this institution , // and T was greatly disappointed to learn that we were to have no turkey ; and when I found that Kentuckians did not celebrate Thanksgiving at all , I conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and ever afterward we celebrated in true New England style , and the whole neighborhood caught the infection . With the arrival of my grandfather , who came to live with us soon after our reaching Kentucky , my more distinct impressions of New England begin . He was then well past sixty , a clean-shaven , sparely-built gentleman of the old school . His face in repose was stern , looking very much like portraits of Andrew Jackson . But there the resemblance ended . He was a reserved man , but had a most loving nature and a pretty wit . He walked slowly , was methodical in all his ways , but was possessed of old-time notions about bringing boys up to work . My father was a scholar , and his ambitions for his children were in that direction . We all learned paradigms of Greek verbs before we were out of dresses . Immersed in his college work , my father was not a hard task-master , and we grew up with a greater tendency to play than to hoe corn . This my grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five acres , on which was the thickest undergrowth of shrubs the country contained . Four of us were set to work to grub it . My grandfather was a task-master , but a just one . He paid us five cents an hour for our work , but he expected value received . Compared with the work I have done in recent years , I value my services in that field at about sixty dollars per day . Then we planted corn , and potatoes of both varieties . I have never liked sweet potatoes , and I attribute it to the fact that there was a drouth that summer and we were obliged to water the sweet potato " settings " twice a day . The water supply was about sixty rods distant , and my gr*ndfathei had liberal ideas as to the amount of water each plant required . There were no pedometers in those days , but my recollection is that we used to walk about thirty miles a day carrying pails of water which mysteriously spilled about half before we reached the patch . Now my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ideas of study , and watched our record in classes as closely as grandfather did the potato patch . We used to feel terribly abused between the two ; but I now believe that we did less work than we should and played too much . But the boy has erroneous views on the subject . My grandfather bought two fine cows , and the amount of milk they produced astonished the neighborhood . He always cooked their food , gave them warm water to drink in winter , and nearly drove the cook to distraction . The cows were milked three times a day , and what we could not use , give away or sell at six cents a gallon , was given to the pigs . I think the milk must have cost twelve cents a quart . My grandfather always retired early and rose at three A. M. He for some reason conceived a special fondness for me , and showed it by getting me up at the same hour , when I was allowed to churn the butter . When the corn began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woe to the weed that dare show itself ! One of us used to ride the horse while my grandfathet held the handles . He is the only man I ever knew who could cultivate a stony field and keep all the commandments intact . Did you ever ride a horse up and down the rows under a blazing sun ? If there is any more monotonous work in the world I have yet to find it . My elder brother revolted at ancient methods , and-when assigned to this disagreeable duty , put a saddle on the horse , held an umbrella in one hand and a book in the other . This combination disgusted my grandfather completely , and my brother was relieved of further duty in this line , to my own particular sorrow . My grandfather practised the New England method of grinding edged tools . We had a large grindstone , // and my grandfather prided himself on keeping his tools sharp . He never seemed tired , but immediately after dinner would suggest that the axe was dull , and he would grind it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Yankee , and the task of sharpening seemed endless . He would stop and examine it every little while , and IL would look up in joyous anticipation of its being sharp enough ; but seemingly it never was . A few years of this sort of work gave us all some excellent lessons in application . It was genuine New England training , and it did us a great deal of good . The neighbors used to laugh at my grandfather because it cost him more to raise " truck " than to buy it , and blamed him for making the boys work , in strong contrast to the shiftless habits of the Southerners . But I fancy he knew what he was doing and that it was for our moral well being that the corn and potatoes were raised and other tasks performed under circumstances that used to make us think of the Israelites in Egypt . I do not want it understood that he was a harsh man . On the contrary , he was love itself ; but he had some shrewd Yankee sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of work and keep at it uninterruptedly till I finish , I owe it to my grandfather who taught me what work was . And indeed the lesson was worth the toil , which produced little else , since stray cows and adventurous pigs usually robbed us of the just reward of our labor . My grandfather took the " Weekly Tribune , " the " Independent , " and a paper issued by Dr. Jackson at Danville , N. Y. , the headquarters of hydropathy , in which my grandfather was an ardent believer . I know of nothing more beautiful than his faith in Horace Greeley . He had read the Weekly Tribune** since its first issue . He not only believed in the " Tribune , " but he believed Horace Greeley , who was in all things his guide , counsellor and friend , as he was to so many others . We shall never have his like again . Whatever the " Tribune " said was law . When it said that corn should not be hilled , my grandfather would have felt himself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune " said that corn should be hilled , my grandfather hilled his corn religiously without question . Indeed , for more than thirty years he followed Horace Greeley around in all his vagaries , during which timehe was on all sides of many questions , but my grandfather 's faith in him never wavered , and he would not allow that he was ever inconsistent . One summer day , in 1872 , my father came home from the post office and asked my grandfather , who was standing on the porch , whom he supposed the Democrats had nominated for the presidency . After one or two wrong guesses , my father said , eHorace Greeley . " My grandfather looked at him in amazement . " IFlorace Greeley ! " he exclaimed , and sat down as if he had been shot . He brooded over it for days . It was the hardest blow he had ever received . He had voted for Birney for president , but had followed the " Tribune " in its anti-slavery teachings , had made sacrifices for his convictions , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed to be of God 's ordination to wipe out slavery . He had hated Democracy with a perfect hatred for its slavery views ; and after all this for Horace Greeley to turn traitor was more than he could stand ; it almost shook his faith in humanity . When election time came he hesitated long , and finally cast his vote for Grant . It was the hardest political duty of his life . Soon after this he began to grow feeble . Bronchitis , a New England inheritance* set in , and we all knew that the winter was his last . His mind reverted to earlier scenes , and he told us of his father 's career in the Revolution , of his own recollections of the War of 1812 , and of how they feared Napoleon would come here after Waterloo . He was a very religious man , though little given to talking of // it . He was a deacon all his adult years , and he loved to tell us of old New England days when the sermons were long and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their struggles , of his own ancestors , who had been God-fearing men . He read the Bible constantly , and encouraged us to learn chapters by heart . We were all brought up to read two chapters a day , and my father was always careful to see we understood what we read , but grandfather wanted us to learn it by heart , and most of our pocket money came in this way as a reward for doing it . As the end drew near , this blameless man was perplexed with doubts and fears . Jonathan Edwards was a great and good man , but I fear his theology has not been an unmixed good . The terrors of Jehovah , the God of wrath , who was angry with the wicked every day . and the doctrine of original sin were more in evidence in the old New England theology than the God of mercy and love . Weighed down with a feeling of his shortcomings , my grandfather drew to his end full of gloomy forebodings ; but the light came through at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never been so impressed . Just before the end the clouds burst , and it seemed as if the radiance from God 's face was reflected in his ; he died so peacefully , so happy , that it was long before any of us could even weep . I hope I have learned that the end of the righteous is peace , and that old New England theology was better than it pretended to be . But my ideas of New England were not gathered from my grandfather alone . We took the Atlantic Monthly , Our Young Folks and the Youths ' Companion . I learned to read all three together . My father 's culture was distinctively that of New England . He believed in literature next to religion It seemed to us at the time a hardship to be forbidden the weekly story papers then in vogue and the yellow-covered novels . I do not regret it now . At an age when children are now reading fairy tales and trashy novels we were imbibing the classics . We began to study Latin and Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week days , but on Sunday the Bible , Sunday school books  --  the worst sort of trash , which we would n't read  --  and a few other books were all we were allowed . My father kept the New England Sabbath as he had done when a boy ; and a very good Sabbath it was . We also took , I should say , the New York Evening Post , and with the other publications referred to we were not wanting in good current literature . The first continued story I read was " Winning His Way . " I have read it twenty times since , and still maintain it is the healthiest , most interesting book ever written for boys . When the other day I read in the newspaper that Charles Carlton Coffin was dead , I felt as if I had lost a personal friend . My grandfather , like most New England men of his day , had taught school . In his old age he took this up as a missionary work . In the summer vacation he had always one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of the ancient time and very simple . He knew nothing of the relation of the percept to the concept , and was ignorant of all the modern methods which seem so essential . I have been in touch with schools all my life , and at this day when I hear learned discourses on teaching and watch the actual practice in the schools , I wonder how we ever learned anything at all in the days when we ciphered through Ray 's Third Part Arithmetic by set rules , learned the multiplication table , and spelled down twice a day . Somehow I must be prejudiced , for I can not see that the rising generation is so much better fitted for work in the world than past ones . My grandfather followed the good old rule , and he was an excellent tutor . Nothing short of perfection suited him . He would work hours each day over the freedmen , but they had to work in the gar // den an equal number . That was his New England principle . He would have worked twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his generosity knew no bounds , but the ablebodied man must get his education in the sweat of his brow . He made but one failure . A mulatto named Andrew was one of the most earnest seekers after knowledge I have ever known . He was a man grown , had served in war , and was one of the few who escaped from the Fort Pillow massacre . He had a great desire for an education , and my grandfather made a specialty of him for six months , during which time Andrew made the best garden we ever had , and learned nothing at all worth mentioning . How well I remember lying on the piazza in the sultry afternoons watching the orioles and mocking birds in the trees in delicious idleness , while my grandfather inside struggled with Andrew over the simplest rudiments . He had almost no memory or perceptive qualities , for each day was a repetition of the one before , until my grandfather would retire to his room in disgust to get himself composed for another struggle . At such times he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll venture a fourteen thankee he has no brains at all ! " My grandfather believed in education of the most liberal kind ; but he believed in labor , too , not only as a means of revenue , but as a moral force in the world not to be replaced by anything else . Labor was not only dignified and honorable , but a necessity , and he toiled as long as he could , though possessed of means enough to live in comfort without it , and his toil was mostly for others and without direct personal benefit . When I was about ten years old there was a gathering of New England relatives at our home . I was much impressed with the differences between these people and our Southern neighbors . My grandfather 's sister and husband remained and bought a farm in the neighborhood . They made a sensation by introducing New England methods of agriculture . Ensilage was a subject concerning which there was as much ignorance in our neighborhood as there was of the binomial theorem . My great-uncle knew all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He used the first improved agricultural machinery , and I was sent to him to spend long summer vacations for my health . I should judge that I rode horse about a million miles in three summers , to my intense disgust , for I was intensely interested in Hawthorne and Dickens just then and would rather have given the time to them . My great-uncle 's ideas of labor consisted in rising at sunrise and grooming horses until breakfast at six , working until dark , and grooming the horses again until nine or ten . The neighbors all said that his horses were better cared for than his family ; but this was an error . They did not understand why horses should be fed on linseed cake and curried , rubbed and blanketed with as much care as a man gets at a Turkish bath . They used to sit on the fence and discuss these things at great length and aver solemnly that my great-uncle was a fool . They had run farms for years ; the soil was rich , and though they no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to cost to keep them . They supplied all their wants-which were few-easily , and were never worried , while my great-uncle used to work early and late , never went to the county seat on court day , and worked all Saturday . Moreover , he would not go fox-hunting . They conceived him to be a degenerate man , and had no sympathy for him . They were always attributing some ulterior motive to him ; but they borrowed seed corn or his mowing machine regularly . Although his crops were the best in the neighborhood , and he made money rapidly where they made an easy living , they conceived a poor opinion of him . His greatest trouble was with his // help . He paid better wages than anyone else , but could not get the natives to work as he wanted . The colored mv** WOVLId stop th' mc*t urgent work to chase a rabbit for an hour , and Saturday work was a farce . Almost nightly coon-hunts interfered with next day 's work . White help was little better . Such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky way ; and finally this led to my greatuncle leaving Kentucky in disgust . At one time he held Farmers ' Institutes and lectured on drainage , ensilage , rotation of crops , improvements in machinery , and the necessity of better seed and improved stock . All this fell on desert soil . These farmers were on the Blue Grass side of the village , and might have grown rich if they had followed this good advice . Nothing , however , was more apparent than that they did not want to get rich . As for farming , they hiad grown up on lands cultivated since the days of Daniel Boone . They used mules and old bull-tongue plows to cultivate their corn and tobacco , as all their ancestors had done . They had fine blooded horses , but these were for riding or racing only . As to cattle , the bigger plantations raised them for shipment , and milch cows were at a discount . There was not a good dairy farm in the neighborhood . Some of these men were accounted rich according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my great-uncle . They held that to do as he suggested would reduce them to a little better state than slavery , for which money was no compensation . I now perceive a clash of two philosophies in all this , which had for bases two entirely distinct moral , social and political cults ; and they represented the differences between two sections of the country which had existed from the beginning . Thousands of Northern men who went South after the war to rejuvenate that section found too late that the revolution could not be accomplished against social , climatic and hereditary influences . That there was a complete misunderstanding between the two sections for generations there is no longer any doubt nor that it was sincere on both sides . IVloreover it was impossible that military subjugation could change Southern ideas . The North made a great mistake in assuming that it would . The Roundhead Puritan stock that settled New England had certain views of life to begin with . These were increased by the sterility of the soil and the rigors of the climate . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perpetuation of the species . The New Englanders raised poor crops of grain , but a great harvest of men . The Cavalier settled on the rich fields of the South , where nature yielded bountifully at the slightest effort . The climate begat lassitude , while the system of slavery developed a belief that labor was degrading , and those who were compelled to work did as little as possible . and enjoyed the chase , the pipe , and too often whiskey , as much as they could . Leadership was reserved to he wealthy or to the lawyers . The masses not only did not want to lead , but attached themselves by choice fo local leaders , in whom they took great pride . On the great plantations in Kentucky were grown corn and rye for neighborin.g distilleries , tobacco and hemp , mules for the southern market and Devon cattle for the North . These planters were wealthy and constituted the aristocracy of the section . The soil was so rich from the constant flow of water up through the lower Silurian limestone beds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface , that they yielded rich returns even with slipshod methods of cultivation . But the smaller farmers were not so well situated . They made a good living according to their standards , worked little , and worried none whatever . They were contented , and they viewed my great-uncle with distrust because he was always working and worrying . // Besides he was opposed on principle to whiskey and tobacco ; and with such views they had no sympathies whatever . Recently I revisited that section after an absence of nearly twentyyears . I was dumbfounded to find that there had scarcelybeen a changeof anykind . The men looked no older , the houses were the same , and the farms the same . Moreover , everyone seemed as contented as ever . When I expostulated with some of them over the lack of progress , I was asked whether among the people of the East there was more contentment , whether they have any more of their wishes gratified . I was obliged to say no , but did not feel called upon to add that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . They would have misunderstood such a remark . I grew up believing that the finest farms were in New England , and that every boy went to college and every girl to a seminary . This idea was not fully dispelled until a few years ago , when I made my first trip through New England . Although I had read a great deal about the " abandoned farms , " I hardly expected to see agriculture at such a low ebb , or such enormous crops of stone fences . I no longer wondered why New England people worked . While I found that education was more highly esteemed than anywhere else , I was surprised to find that no longer could poor young me get an education as in my grandfather 's days , when two hundred dollars a year was ample at Yale . Recent articles by educators on the cost of an education at Yale and Harvard have somewhat lowered my esteem for New England 's educational views . At the college I attended in the South , two hundred dollars a year was ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , with those of any New England college . One of them is pastor of one of Boston 's largest Congregational churches , while others have made their mark in other walks of life . It is a shock to think that the great New England colleges are so largely for rich men 's sons , while so many poor boys go West and South to get an education . Many of my college mates came from east of New York City . Whether an education at Yale or Harvard or Amherst is worth more than one at the smaller Western and Southern colleges is a matter of opinion on which I have decided views , but any college education is better than none . I grew up in an educational atmosphere redolent with the classics . Greek and Latin were compulsory to the end of the junior year . Mathematics , modern langages and ethics were important , but natural science was not so well taught as now . There was no attempt at individualism . We were all sent through the same course in the expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nowadays each student pursues his own way under slight restrictions . Which is the better system is a matter of opinion , and I suppose the proof will come in twenty years when the crop is fully harvested ; but it is hard to think of a man with a college education who knows more of football than he does of the classics , though he may know a great deal of many equally desirable subjects . Many of our professors came from New England , and they were men of rare culture and entertained lofty views of life . I am willing to set over against twothirds of the advantages a great college affords the benefit which the student at the small college gets from personal intimacy with his professors . Personally I think this advantage outweighs all the others , but am willing to acknowledge one-third as a subject for legitimate debate . New England has furnished a host of professors for Western and Southern colleges . Most of them have been upright , intelligent men , who have sought to impart not only knowledge , but wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been helped more outside the class-room than in it by the men // who have devoted themselves to teaching . Nine years ago I was preparing for my first pilgrimage to New England , when I went to hear Henry Ward Beecher lecture . The theme concerned the condition of Europe . He looked badly , spoke with effort , and seemed to be suffering pain . Near the close of his lecture he mentioned the New England Sabbath . He paused for a long time , and cast his eyes up as if lost in thought . I feared he would fall , and felt nervous . Finally he began to speak with the fluency and rich imagery of his earlier days . He forgot his subject entirely , and launched forth into an apostrophe to the New England Sabbath , which was one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard . He spoke of the days of his youth , when the simple customs prevailed , when labor ceased at sundown of Saturday . I can not attempt a description of his words , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly cast upon it in this day . He spoke of the influence of that old-time Sabbath which had spread throughout the world , and*held it as one of the country 's best institutions . The golden words fell swiftly from his lips , and the audience which had become impatient before was electrified . I have often wished that those words could have been preserved , for a more beautiful tribute to the New England people was never given . Coming back to his lecture , he became labored again , and soon closed abruptly . I think it was his last lecture , for in a few weeks he was dead . This personal narrative is too long . It is only an attempt to hint at how New England influences exert themselves beyond its borders . I have come to have not only an affection for my father 's native country , but to feel a birthright in it . I have learned to reverence its great men , scholars , theologians , statesmen . I have learned to admire its tenacity for what is morally right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and culture . It is nearly twenty years since I left the South for a ten years ' wauderjahr in the West . Wherever I went I found New England people , and wherever I found New England people I found friends . Where I found most culture , most regard for the good , the true and the beautiful , I found that New England influences predominated ; and though for ten years I have lived in my mother 's own city , where there is as much culture , as much love for the good and the true and the beautiful , I have found it less aggressive and less potent than in the far East . No section has a monopoly of the virtues or faults of civilization ; perhaps all have their equal share ; but that New England has made more use of its talent for the general good , will , I think , be the verdict of those whose horizon is not bound by their immediate environment . Even a stepson may partake of the goodly heritage of those who faced without faltering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dark forests of an unknown region that they migl't worship God after the dictates of Their own conscience . Yes , it may descend to generations yet unborn , when the centre of population shall have crossed the Mississippi .
