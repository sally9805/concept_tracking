txt Society 's " swell mob " in the boxes at the horse show had a lot to talk about last evening . The chief topic was the scrimmage that took place early in the day betWeen a couple of men who are well known to the crowd that has packed the Garden all the week Regrets were heard on all sides that the speakers were not Jon hand at noon yesterday so as to see the interchange of courtesies while they were in progress , though , of course , these regrets were all expressed in the utmost confidence and only 4o the personal friends of the speakers , as is the custom with all well-bred people . " Do you really think that there will be a duel , d' you know 1 " was asked by many a bright and charming young lady as she heard the gossip in reference to the altercation of the morning , and then there was added , sotto voce : ? ? That would be a perfectly jolly outcome of the affair , do n't y'know , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in the " hunting set . " in which both the principals , " Bob " Neville and " Sam " Howland , are best known , at once arrayed herself on the side of the one or the other and declared that It was about the jolliest thing of the year , and one that will furnish food for no end of gossip , particularly as the prluoinals are related by marriage . The interchange of courtesies about which all the " swagger " set were talking occurred just before the recess for luncheon and while the few people in the Garden were watching the judging of the pony classee that was in progress in the ring . S. S. Howland , a son-in-law of the late August Belmont . was seated in the box of Secretary ? W. F. Wharton chatting with his friend F. Gray Griswold and the manager of his stook farm  --  Belwood Stud it is called  --  Cape Adams . A young son of Mr. Wharton was an occupant of the box with them . Mr. Howland was at the baok of the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the scene Robert Neville of Washington , D. C. , a member of the Metropolitan Club of that city , a member of the Dumblane Hunt , and a general all-around swell sport of the fast capital set . He bad an umbrella in his hand , a look of determination In his eye in all probability . as well as a cloud of anger on his brow if one had happened to notice it . At all events , he was , in the common language of the masses , mad clear through . Without a word of warning or of salutation he raised his umbrella and struck Mr. Howland a stinging blow across the back . Mr. Howland sprang to his feet , and raising the light cane he had in his hand , he struck Neville across tho face twice before Mr. Griswold or Capt . Adams could interfere . Mr. Rowland 's friends at once hustled Neville out of the way and induood Mr. Howland to forego the further punishment that be was anxious to inflict . The exchange of compliments between the two gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Neville started down the steps leading from the boxes to the promenade about the ring and for the Fourth Avenue entrance to the Garden . Secretary Wharton , who had seen from the ring what had occurred , hurried out and personally gave chase for Neville , reaching the Fourth Avenue entrance in time to order his arrest . He agreed to have a charge of assault preferred against Neville , and finally induced Mr. Howland to mama the charge , although that gentleman was very loth to do so . He did as he was asked only because Cornelius Fellowes , President of the association ; had said that if Howland did not make the charge he should have Neville prosecuted for disorderly conduct , and that the facts in the case would have to come out at all events , as it was absolutely necessary for the managers of the show to press the charge so as to prevent a recurrence of such scenes in the future . Neville , the assailant , was hustled out of the Garden and taken to the Jefferson Market Police Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $300 , bonds being furnished by Dr. Guy F. Whiting , an acquaintance of Neville 's and a member of the Southern Club In this city . People were divided in opinion as to the cause of the outbreak , and Mr. Neville would not enlighten them concerning it . One set who were conversant with the affairs of the two men thought that it was an outbreak caused by a difference between them about a race or the sale of a race horse in which Howland had got the better of Neville . Others were inclined to believe that it was the result of Neville 's anger over the division of some property in which he got the worst of it . The air was full of rumors , and all had their supporters . Neville married the sister of the late Hal Dulaney , who left considerable property . Mr. Howland 's mother was a Dulaney , and the story was afloat that the trouble arose over the division of the original Dulaney estate . That was not the trouble , however . Neville assaulted* Mr. Howland , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that Neville owed $50 to the estate of the late Percy Drayton , that sum having been lost to Mr. Drayton on a wager at raoing . While Neville was in Europe he claimed Mr. Howland insulted him to his friends , and he said on the other side of the water , when reports of what Mr. Howland had said reached him , that he would slap his face at the very first opportunity . That opportunity came yesterday , but Instead of slapping his face he used an umbrella . Neville claims in justification of his act that he had paid the debt , holds a receipt for it , and that klowland 's reflections on his character as a gentleman were the only cause for his action . Clubmen believe there is some reason other than this alleged debt between the two men . Whatever was the cause of the quarrel and the unseemly attack by Neville on Mr. Howland , It will constitute a nine days ' wonder In society until the trouble is aired in the pollee court , the clubs , and elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an overpopular man in the hunting sets , and his attack was very generally denounced as cowardly in the extreme . Neville is a high liver , with the oolor of hair and countenance that is known in society as ' ? ohampagny. " and there were some of his associates who would have it that - Bob " would not have been guilty of such an ungentlemanly act unless he had been overindulging in his favorite tipple . At the Jefferson Market Police Court . where Neville was charged with assault , Mr. Howland stated that he was forty-three years old and lived at the Hotel Logorot , in Sixth Avenue . Noville had struck him , he said , without provocation . He had known Neville , but had out his acquaintance six nlonths ago . j'ehe K. Abney , who appeared as Neville 's counsel , asked that the examination be postponed , and , in spite of the protest of Mr. Howland , who wanted the matter settled at once , Justice Hogan set the hearing for Monday afternoon .
