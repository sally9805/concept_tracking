txt The suit in which the Government asks that the original telephone patent of the Bell Company shall be annulled is still in the court before which it was brought , and has not emerged from the testimony stage , although it is seven years old , and the very patent whose validity is involved has expired after living for its allotted time of seventeen years , There is also pending the new snit against the Bell Company 's Berliner patent , which was begun by Attorney General MILLER . The Electrical Angineer publishes some interesting comments upon the attitude of the company toward these suits , and expresses the opinion that in the case of the new suit the defendants have a stronger motive for seeking dispatch than for securing delay . The Berliner patent , " which on its face seems fundamental in respect to nearly all existing forms of microphone transmitters , has not yet bad the judgment of any court as to its scope or validity . It is not at all likely , therefore , " continues the Lagineer , " that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not they have a sound patent . Moreover , the exceptional control of an entire art enjoyed by the Bell Company for seventeen years , because of the unprecedented scope of the Bell patent , which would have protected it against the use of the Berliner invention had that invention been in other hands , would probably be deemed by any court of equity a good reason for turning a deaf oar to any plea of urgency on the part of the Bell Company iu dealing with an alleged infringer . " Therefore the Engineer thinks that any unnecessary delay in this new snit will be chargeable to the Department of Justice rather than to the Bell Company . The people have a right to expect that Attorney General OLNEY will be dillput in the prosecution of this important case .
