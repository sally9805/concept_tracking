txt Excitement confusion , heavy strain , and hard work have characterized this , the last legislative day of the Fifty-fifth Congress . In the Senate , at times the confusion was so great as to render the transaction of business almost impossible . Business that ordinarily would have the undivided attention of every Senator on the floor was transacted amid so much noise that it was next to impossible to follow the proceedings . Toward midnight it looked as though order was being evolved from the seeming chaos of the early part of the day and evening , and the prospect was fair that Congress would adjourn at noon to-day with its absolutely necessary work completed . Great opposition , however , developed against the conference report on the River and Harbor bill . The persistence of the opposition in debate indicated to some of the Republican leaders that the menace of an extra session of Congress was greater than it had ever been since it was first suggested . It is possible the fight over the River and Harbor bill may cause the failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate convened at 11 o'clock yesterday it faced the task of considering two of the great appropriation bills  --  that for the Army , and for supplying- the general deficiencies . The former carries appropriations exceeding 880,000,000 , and the latter about $20,000 , n00 . With a determination to complete the appropriation bills , the Senate began immediately at 11 o'clock in the morning to consider these measures , and at 8 o'clock at night the Army bill was passed , the deficiency bill having been passed nearly three hours before . A conference report on the Alaska Criminal Code bill was presented and agreed to . A partial report on the Sundry Civil Appropriation bill was agreed to , but the inability of the Senate conferees to secure an agreement on the Hawaiian cable proposition created a heated discussion , in the course of which Speaker Reed was alluded to in uncomplimentary terms . The Toledo Exposition bill , carrying an appropriation of 4500,000 , was passed without debate . SCENES IN THE HOUSE . Crowded galleries looked down upon the struggling memberS of the House yesterday as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being enacted . Step by - step the leaders in charge of the appropriation bills pushed them through the final stages , and during every lull in the consideration of conference reports members clamored for recognition for belated local bills in the vain hope of res- cuing - them from death on the calendar . At times the House was like bedlam . Pound as the Speaker would with his gavel , it was almost impossible to preserve order , and to the casual visitor in the gallery the proceedings on the floor must have been about as intelligible as an exciting day in the wheat pit would be to a parish priest . The noise and confusion on the floor , punctuated with the constant banging of the Speaker 's gavel or backgrounded with the droning voice of the Clerk ; irate members facing each other and talking at the same time , pages scurrying up and down the aisles  --  all this was utterly distracting . But the people in the galleries staid on , and there were a dozen persons in line in the corridors , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying Congress . When the great beacon light on the dome blazed forth as darkness fell , thousands upon thousands were attracted to the brilliantly illuminated wings of the Capitol , where the two houses were to sit out the night . The big questions in dispute between the two houses being naturally the last to be adjusted , were postponed far into the night . From time to time short recesses were taken These were simply breathing spells , however , and soon the leaders were at it again harder than ever . Slow progress was made on conference reports . The District of Columbia Appropriation bill was sent back to conference . FIGHT ON THE NAVAL BILL . The naval conferees presented a partial report , which was agreed to . It carried agreements only on routine features . The questions of armor plate and new ships are still open There was a sharp exchange between Mr. Boutell ( Rep. , Ill. , ) and Mr. Bailey ( Dem. , Texas , ) when the former sought to get the bill back to conference on the remaining disagreements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receding from each disagreement . " Then you will kill this bill ! " exclaimed Mr. Boutell . " I understand , " retorted Mr. Bailey , hotly , " that your side proposes to take up a contested election case . I will oppose that by delaying this bill . " Mr. Boutell said that he knew nothing of such a plan . If Mr. Bailey obstructed the Naval bill he wuold have to assume responsibility for crippling the naval defense . A lengthy debate followed on the first disagreement on the Gathmann gun . A motion to concur in the Senate amendment for the Gathmann guns was defeated . Announcement was made by Mr. Crum-packer ( Rep. , Ind. , ) that the Brown-Swanson contested election case would not be brought forward . Thereupon , Mr. Bailey withdrew his notice that he would obstruct the Naval bill . Mr. Underwood ( Dem. , Ala. , ) moved to concur in the Senate amendment authoriz4 ing a Government armor factory . After a . port debate the yeas and nays were ordered . The motion was lost by a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conference .
