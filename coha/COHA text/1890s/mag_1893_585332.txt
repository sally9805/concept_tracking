txt THE late Marquis de Chambrun ( Charles Adoiphe Pineton ) was born at the Chateau de CarrR*re , near Marvejols , France , on August 10 , 1831 . He was a graduate of the i*cole des Chartes and of the law faculty of Paris . Though a liberal , he was , from family traditions , attached to the legitimist branch of the royalist party that centred around the Comte de Chambord . Under the empire , to which he was opposed , he left France and came over to the United States early in 1865 , where he became an intimate friend of Charles Sumner , to whom his friendship for Alexis de Tocqueville was known . He accompanied President Lincoln on his journey to City Point and Petersburg . The following article was written in French shortly after Mr. Lincoln 's death and remained among the Marquis 's papers , where it was found at his death , which occurred in September , 1891 . It was toward the close of February , 1865 , at one of the weekly receptions at the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Entering the drawing-room , I found him standing . As the crowd was great , each entering visitor was made to pass quickly before him . When my turn came , I briefly expressed the interest I took in the Northern victories . I added that , so far as I could judge , they concerned in the highest degree all nations who enjoyed liberty , or who aspired to possess it . He seemed grateful for this cordial adhesion which I gave to his views , and answered that he was particularly happy to hear them expressed by a Frenchman . These were the only words we exchanged on that day . From this first interview I could naturally only bring home a very superficial impression of the man I had thus seen . On March 4th , the day appointed for Mr. Lincoln 's second inauguration , I was able to observe him more closely . This inauguration was to take place under memorable circumstances . By Mr. Lincoln 's re-election the American people had clearly signified its political intentions : the war was to be carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the solemn and decisive utterances of the national will , and it had endowed the Union armies with a new and irresistible impetus . As the Vice-president is by right President of the Senate , it is by his admission to office that the inauguration solemnities begin . Vice-president Johnson was still speaking when Mr. Lincoln entered the Senate chamber . He crossed it slowly and took his seat at the foot of the President 's chair . From his seat he faced the assembly . Hardly had he seated himself , when I saw him close his eyes and abstract himself completely , as though absorbed in deep meditation . Far from seeking the glances of those who sought his own , he seemed suddenly to become sad . When the Vice-president had been duly sworn into office , the procession marched onward , the President heading it , escorted by those appointed to introduce him to the people . Following came Chief Justice Chase , who also , according to custom , was to administer the oath of office . Then , regardless of order or precedence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we had crossed the rotunda , the President advanced upon the platform amid enthusiastic applause . A scene indeed new to us , and momentous to America , was then before us . At the horizon of that applauding multitude were arrayed those battalions which Grant had summoned for the campaign about to open , and among them several negro companies . Between these lines of men and the colamns which upheld the platform , the eye met a compact mass , the aspect of which was rough and energetic ; in its midst stood a multitude of negroes but w // yesterday freed , and for the first time admitted to take part in a national solemnity . When the hurrahs had ceased , Mr. Lincoln began reading his address , and hardly had he read its first sentence , when none could question its immense success . The utterance , in almost a religious manner , of his thought , seemed to speak out the very sentiments of all his listeners , and the condemnation of slavery which he was pronouncing , intermixed here and there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prophets . " Fondly do we hope , " he concluded , " fervently do we pray , that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away . Yet , if God wills that it continue until the wealth piled by the bondman 's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and that every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword , as was said three thousand years ago , so still it must be said , The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether . ' " With malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right , as God gives us to see*the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle , and for his widow and his orphan  --  to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almighty on behalf of the holy cause he was defending , little did he know how near his eloquent prayer was to being granted . On or about March 20th , General Grant had completed the concentration of his forces ; at that moment the Army of the Potomac presented a new aspect ; many unmistakable signs indicated that the final struggle was about to begin . Mr. Lincoln started for the headquarters , which were at City Point . He had deemed his presence there necessary , in view of hastening the last arrangements , of being in personal readmess should any propositions come from Richmond , or of conveying his own political instructions to the Lieutenant-General On the 25th , or about , the army began its march forward . It was at City Point , on Wednesday , April 6th , that a small party of invited guests , which comprised members of the Cabinet and distinguished Senators , and in which Mrs. Lincoln had been kind enough to include me , came to join the President . We found him established on board the River Queen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome boat . Curiously enough , it was in that very drawingroom , two months previous , that there had taken place , between Stephens , Hunter , and Campbell , delegates from the Richmond government , on the one hand , and Messrs . Lincoln and Seward , on the other , the conference called that of Hampton Roads . Mr. Lincoln showed us the place that each delegate had occupied , and spoke a moment about the details of that historic interview , which took place , as he himself told us , unrecorded by any secretary , the five men present not even having with them a pencil or bit of paper to note down what had been said or done . But he remained silent regarding the questions agitated during the conference . One of the few confidants of Mr. Lincoln 's thoughts , however , added , indicating the place occupied by Mr. Campbell at the interview : " From there came the only serious proposition . " He was alluding to the proposed war with Mexico , which the rebel government had submitted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drawing then from his pocket a bundle of papers , the President read to us the despatches he had just received from General Grant . In the midst of this reading he paused a moment , and went to fetch his maps . He soon returned holding them in his hands , and spreading them on a table , he showed us the place of each army corps , indicating further the exact spot where , according to General Grant 's precise messages , it was certain that the rebels would lay down their arms . // It seemed evident that his mind was satisfied and at rest ; but in spite of the manifest success of his policy it was impossible to detect in him the slightest feeling of pride , much less of vanity . He spoke with the modest accent of a man who realizes that success has crowned his persistent efforts , and who finds in that very success the end of a terrible responsibility . He had visited Richmond , he said to us ; the reception given him there did not seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of wiping out the consequences of the civil war , and to drive the war itself from the memory of all , nay , even of its criminal instigators ; far then , from feeling any resentment against the vanquished , he was rather inclined to place too much confidence in them . After having thus explained to us the state of affairs , which seemed so satisfactory , Mr. Lincoln left us and went ashore to the headquarters . He was obliged , he told us , to draw up instructions for the Lieutenant-General We then spent the entire forenoon visiting the Federal encampments . City Point two years before was still an ordinary farm ; but Nature seemed to have destined that lonely spot for the great events , the theatre of which it was to be . And , as a matter of fact , it is precisely at that point that the Appomattox River , which flows from Petersburg , an.d the James , that sweeps by Richmond , unite . These two streams outline the natural limits of this geometrically designed area . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the basis and City Point the apex . At that point the banks of the James are particularly high . When stragglers leave the beach to ascend the cliffs they are obliged to climb an immense stairway , at the top of which appears a first cluster of log-houses , forming a rectangle . At the centre of these , one somewhat higher than the rest attracts the eye . There , were the headquarters . Four tables , a few chairs , charts and maps covering the wooden walls , were all the furniture they possessed . Beyond this first group of log - houses extends a vast plain bordered at the horizon by long lines of pines . The many trunks of trees , half uprooted , noticeable on looking at the plain , attested that a year before welluigh all this cleared space had been woodland . It was in this newly cleared plain that one of the Federal encampments had stood . Each corps , each regiment , was there located on a space of ground systematically assigned to it for camping purposes . In each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . Soldiers accustomed to clearing off woodland , as the Federal soldiers often were , had quickly made room for themselves in these woods ; they had camped there as though it had been in a far Western forest . When we visited this large encampment , however , it had been vacated . Nearly the entire army was with General Grant in pursuit of Lee . We even saw passing before us a number of negro regiments , marching onward to the scene of conflict . These were the last remaining available forces in the camp . General Grant had wired two hours before to direct them toward Burkesville . He needed them there , he said , not for fighting purposes , but to hem in the rebel army , which he was sure to capture entire . As Mr. Lincoln had asked us to accompany him that day to Petersburg , we went to join him on the banks of the James . A train was in readiness . Strange as it may justly seem , in fact , Petersburg had fallen only six days before into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad connected it with the camp . Our car was an ordinary American car , and we took seats in its centre , grouping ourselves around Mr. Lincoln . In spite of the car 's being devoted to Mr. Lincoln 's special ' use , several officers also took their places in it without attracting any remark . Curiosity , it seems , also had induced the negro waiters of the River Queen to accompany us . The President , who was blinded by no prejudices against race or color , and who had not what can be termed false dignity , allowed them to sit quietly with us . For several miles the train followed the outer line of Federal fortifications w // which extended at our left ; we were a half hour without noticing them ; at the end of which time we reached a place known as Fort Steadman ; there a battle had been fought less than a fortnight before . General Lee had made desperate efforts to break in the Federal lines at that point ; the fight had been bloody , and its result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorderly retreat ; the ground before us had been strewn with the dead . Since then , however , both armies had buried their dead and carried away their wounded . The ground , foot-trodden and here and there broken up by the wheels of artillery wagons , had retained no other traces of a past so recent and so terrible . Farther on we crossed the Confederate lines of defence that had protected Petersburg eight days ago ; the guns were yet on their mountings , but no human sound troubled any longer that solitude . Soon Petersburg loomed up in the distance . Mr. Lincoln gazed a while on its first houses , which had been partly destroyed by Federal bullets . When we had passed these the train slackened its speed ; it had been hardly possible to open us a path through this mass of ruins ; at our left the depot buildings were torn down , on the right the railroad bridge had been wrenched by the explosion of a mine . It was Lee 's army , said the President , which , on retiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrived at Petersburg we inspected the town , in which everything bespoke desolation . All the houses were closed , the shops abandoned or pillaged ; crowds of darkies were in the streets greeting and cheering loudly the author of their independence . Every now and then a white man could be seen hastening to take refuge in some house , in order to escape the sight of his conqueror . Here and there were seen houses burned by the explosion of shells or torn by bullets . The headquarters were located at the w other end of the town ; we drove over to them . They occupied a prettyhouse , around which the vegetation of spring was already luxuriantly developing in this Southern climate . While Mr. Lin coin was in conference with the generals commanding the garrison , we visited this house without a master , and its gardens carefully laid out , but now abandoned . I asked one of the officers who escorted us the name of the former occupants of the place ; I have now forgotten it . I only remember the following words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we regained our carriages . While we were on the road which was to lead us back to the train , Mr. Lincoin noticed on the roadside a very tall and beautiful tree . He gave orders to stop the carriage , looked a while at the tree with particular attention , and then applied himself to defining its peculiar beauty . He admired the strength of its trunk , the vigorous development of branches , reminding one of the tall trees of Western forests , compared it to the great oaks in the shadow of which he had spent his youth , and strove to make us understand the distinctive character of these different types . The observations thus set forth were evidently not those of an artist who seeks to idealize nature , but of a man who seeks to see it as it really is ; in short , that dissertation about a tree did not reveal an effort of imagination , but a remarkable precision of mind . When the carriage again moved on , the topic of conversation changed , and Mr. Lincoln imparted * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Animosity in the town is abating , " said he ; " the inhabitants now accept accomplished facts , the final downfall of the Confederacy , and the abolition of slavery . There still remains much for us to do , but every day brings new reason for confidence in the future . " The inspection we made of the hospitals , on the afternoon of April 8th , was to show us war scenes under a different aspect , and Mr. Lincoln in a light altogether new . In the most salubrious portion of the vast plains where the encampments were located a large area had been reserved for ambulances . These were organized according to a plan as simple as it was // logical Each army corps had its separate ambulance space . This consisted of a large rectangle of ground divided by open corridors placed at equal distances from one another . Between these corridor* stood a row of tents or of frame huts , each of which was capable of containing about twenty wounded . One side of these corridors was given up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each rectangle of ground was located a pharmacy , a kitchen , and that which Americans consider as always essential  --  a postoffice . Those who have visited one of these tents or of these frame huts have seen them all . A Bible and newspapers were to be found on nearly every bed . The Christian Commission had distributed in each tent Bible verses printed in large type , and these had been hung on the walls . Our visit began with the hospitals of the Fifth Corps . Mr. Lincoln went from one bed to another , saying a friendly word to each wounded man , or at least giving him a handshake . It was principally the Fifth Corps 's mounted infantry which had been in battle under Sheridan during the preceding days ; it had fought incessantly from Petersburg to Burkesville , over a distance of more than a hundred miles , and the enemy 's fire had made cruel havoc in its ranks . The greater number of wounds were located in the abdominal regions , and w* therefore of a serious character , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture makes one nearly lose all sell-control , the American displays a sort of stoicism which has nothing of affectation . A control , nearly absolute , over himself is the distinctive trait of his nature ; it manifests itself in all phases of his life-in the depth of the wilderness , as well as upon the field of battle . His life is an incessant struggle , and when he falls in that struggle in which his life is at stake , he will suffer without complaining , for by complaining he would deem that he is lowering himself . Strange men they are , whom many approach and can not understand , but who explain to him who does understand them the true greatness of their land . Following Mr. Lincoln in this long review of the wounded , we reached a bed on which lay a dying man ; he was a captain , aged twenty-four years , who had been noticed for his bravery . Two of his friends were near him ; one held his hand , while the other read a passage from the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and took hold of his other hand , which rested on the bed . We formed a circle around him , and every one of us remained silent . Presently the dying man half-opened his eyes ; a faint smile passed over his lips . It was then that his pulse ceased beating . Our visit to the ambulances lasted over five hours . We inspected , with Mr. Lincoln , that of each corps . As we were visiting the wounded of the Ninth Corps , passing before the kitchen , one of the surgeons who accompanied us invited me to enter . In the midst of five or six servants stood a woman whose dress barely distinguished her from them , and who seemed to share the same labor they performed . On seeing her the surgeon went to her , spoke with marks of profound respect , and presented me . Soon after she left us a moment to give an order ; then the officer said to me : " Miss G- belongs to one of the wealthiest families of Massachusetts ; when the war broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to devote herself to the following of those regiments which New England sent over to join the army . Since then she has lived with us , and her occupation has been to tend the wounded . " Just then Miss G came back , and when I expressed to her the particular admiration which that sort of heroism awakened in me , " There is nothing peculiar in that , " she answered . " You are not aware then , that nearly all our regiments are accompanied by women who share camp life in order to minister to the suffering soldiers . You would have found them in the Tennessee campaign , at the siege of Yicksburg , and as far as the Red River , just as you see me at the Potomac encampments . " Before me was standing one of the most perfect types of New England womanhood . It was my first acquaintance with these women , whom I have often // since had occasion to study ; women in whom it may be said that the Puritan flame lighted some two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of deeds most heroic , remain stiff and proud ; who sustain themselves by efforts of stoical fortitude , and not by the more tender feelings of charity ; who accomplish by a yearning of the mind what women of other countries would accomplish by a yearning of the heart ; who aspire to command admiration , rather than to awaken gratitude ; women , in short , whom the wounded must thank , but whom he can not bless . Finding Mr. Lincoln near by , I spoke to him of my encounter , and we returned together to the kitchen . Miss Gurged the President to enter into what she was pleased to call her room , and invited us to enter with him . It was a small room adjoining the kitchen , in which was a soldier 's bed , a table which stood on four rustic legs , and several tree-stumps in lieu of chairs . While the conversation was in progress I noticed a book lying on a small table at the bedside . Finally I deciphered its name . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often read . Possibly *Miss Gsought in it , from preference , those texts w1 the Almighty is represent ed as m*hing along witli the chosen people , mingling , so to speak , its cause with His own , and crushing down His enemies by acts of His omnipotence . She had doubtless seen in such descrip tions a jaithful reproduction of the American people , imagining that same God stretching out His protecting hand over the Federal armies , and , in such a religious view , she had derived a firmer conviction in the holiness of the North ern cause , and in its final triumph . She observed the sort of curiosity which the sight of that book stirred in me , and spoke of it to Mr. Lincoln . " That is not my only book , " she added ; " here is another I found in the pocket of a German soldier who died a few W days ago . " We looked at the book . It , too , had been often read . The title was : " How to Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this poor German to meditate ; he who , dreaming of wealth , perhaps of liberty , had come to Virginia to die ! It was in the midst of these scenes , so varied in their character , that Mr. Lincoln revealed himself to me . Amid the many incidents that filled these few days , I was able to study him at leisure ; a study easy enough to make , indeed , for Mr. Lincoln would have scorned that sort of art which consists in showing one 's self to a looker-on in a carefully-prepared light . At this stage of my narrative I wish to explain how I have understood him . I have seen many attempts at portraits of Mr. Lip , coln , many pI*iotographs ; neither lilA portraits nor his pholographs have reproduced , or are likely ever to reproduce , the complete expression of his face ; still more will they fail in the reproduction of his mental physiognomy . He was very tall , . but his bearing was almost peculiar ; the habit of always carrying one shoulder higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformed . He had also a defect common to many Americanshis shoulders were too sloping for his height . But his arr*is were strong and his complexi&amp;n sunburned , like that of a man who hasispent his youth in the open air , exposed to all inclemencies of the weather and to all hardships of manual labor ; his gestures were vigorous and supple , reveali* great physical strength and an extraordinary energy for resisting privation and fatigue . Nothing seemed to lend harmony to the decided lines of his face ; yet his wide and high forehead , his gray-brown eyes sunken under thick eyebrows , and as though encircled by deep and dark wrinkles , his nose straight and pro *nounced , his lips at the same time thick and delicate , together with the furrows that ran across his cheeks and chin , formed an ensemble which , although strange , was certainly powerfuL It denoted remarkable intelligence , great strength of penetration , tenacity of will , and elevated instincts . His early life had left ineffaceable marks upon the former rail-splitter , and the powerful President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to // conceal what he had been under what he had become . That simplicity gave him perfect ease . To be sure , he had not the manners of the world , but he was so perfectly natural that it would have been impossible I shall not say to be surprised at his manners , but to notice them at all . After a moment 's inspection , Mr. Lincoln left with you a sort of impression of vague and deep sadness . It is not too much to say that it was rare to converse with him a while without feeling something poignant . Every time I have endeavored to describe this impression , words , nay , the very ideas , have failed me . And , strange to say , Mr. Lincoln was quite humorous , although one could always detect a bit of irony in his humor . He would relate anecdotes , seeking always to bring the point out clearly . He willingly laughed either at what was being said to him , or at what he said himself . But all of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , and all his features would at once bespeak a kind of sadness as indescribable as it was deep . After a while , as though it were by an effort of his will , he would shake off this mysterious weight under which he seemed bowed ; * his generous and open disposition would again reappear . In one evening I happened to count over twenty of these alternations and contrasts . Was this sadness caused by the warnings and threats in the midst of which Mr. Lincoln lived ? by those letters which , soon after , were found carefully classified on his table under the general heading of " Assassination Letters ? " I am inclined to think not . No one more than he possessed that confident audacity so common among Americans , and which can not be termed courage , because it is not the result of determination . Was it owing to the constant auxieLies of his first years in office ? to the civil war scenes cruelly disturbing the peaceful s*oul of this descendant of Quakers ? These questions remain unanswered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyone hearing him express his ideas , or think aloud , either upon one of the great topics which absorbed him , or on an incidental question , was not long in finding out the marvellous rectitude of his mind , nor the accuracy of his judgment . I have heard him give his opinion on statesmen , argue political problems , always with astounding precision and justness . I have heard him speak of a woman who was considered beautiful , discuss the particular character of her appearance , distinguish what was praiseworthy from what was open to criticism , all that with the sagacity of an artist . Lately two letters in which he speaks of Shakespeare , and in particular of Macbeth , have been published ; his judgment evinces that sort of delicacy and soundness of taste that would honor a great literary critic . He had formed himself by the difficult and powerful process of lonely meditation . During his rough and humble life he had had constantly with him two books which the Western settler always keeps on one of the shelves of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed that religious color in which he was pleased to clothe his thoughts ; with Shakespeare he had learned to reflect on man and passions . In certain respects one can question whether that sort of j**lltl culture be net more peneti*g than any other , and if it be not more particularly suited in the development of a gifted mind to preserve its native originality . These reflections may serve to explain Mr. Lincoln 's talent as an orator . His incisive speech found its way to the very depths of the soul ; his short and clear sentences would captivate the audiences on which they fell . To him was given to see nearly all his definitions pass into daily proverb . It is he who , better than anyone , stamped the character of the war in these wellknown words , spoken some years before it broke out : " A house divided against itself can not stand ; this government can not continue to exist half free and half slave . " It would not be true to say that he was a man gifted with creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // and terrible geniuses who , being once possessed of an idea , apply it , curbing and sacrificing other men to the imperious instinct of their will . No ; but , on the other hand , he knew better than anyone the exact will of the American people . Amid the noisy confusion of discordant voices which always arises in a free country at moments of crises , he would distinguish with marvellous acuteness the true voice of public opinion . He had , however , nothing in common with these politicians , ever on the track of what seems to them to be popular caprice . His firm will , his exalted nature , above all , his inflexible honesty , always kept him aloof from those lamentable schemes ; yet he well understood that he was the people 's agent , and that his duty obliged him to stand by his principal ; for he was well aware of that close union which must exist in a free democracy between the authority representing the nation and the nation itself . If he was guided by like general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , it can not be doubted , however , that the tendencies of his mind were all liberal To him slavery seemed unquestionably unjust , and for that reason he hated it . He had found in the Declaration of Independence the principles of liberty and equality for all men , and already , long before his elevation to the Presidency , in a celebrated controversy , he had openly declared his firm adhesion to these principles . The emancipation proclamation , which assures the immortality of his name , was , therefore , not a concession made to the aroused feelings of the moment , or a measure of war destined to stab the enemy in the heart ; no , it corresponded to the generous tendencies of his mind and realized the yearnings of his soul Such a nature was admirably constituted to direct through the vicissitudes of an heroic struggle a people proud enough to prefer a guide to a chief , a man commissioned to execute its will to one who would enforce his own . And when success had at last crowned so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln a single sentiment , I shall not say of revenge , but even of bitterness , in regard to the vanquished . Recall , as soon as possible , the Southern States into the Union , such was his chief preoccupation . When he encountered contrary opinion on that subject , when several of those who surrounded him insisted upon the necessity of exacting strong guarantees , at once on hearing them he would exhibit impatience . Although it was rare that such thoughts influenced his own , he nevertheless would evince , on hearing them expressed , a sort of fatigue and weariness , which he controlled , but was unable to dissimulate entirely . But the one point on which his mind seemed most irrevocably made up was his action in regard to the men who had taken part in the rebellion . Clemency never suggested itself more naturally to a victorious chieftain . The policy of pardon and forgiveness appeared to his mind and soul an absolute necessity . In our presence he received a despatch from General Grant announcing for the 10th or 11th of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia . The Lieutenant-General added , that possibly he might capture at the same time Jefferson Davis and his cabinet . This possibility thus announced troubled greatly Mr. Lincoln , and in a few remarks , full of force , he pointed out to us the extreme difficulty in which this unfortunate capture would place the government . One of the persons present , who enjoyed the privilege of speaking freely before him , said : " Do n't allow him to escape the law ; he must be hung . " The President replied calmly , by that quotation from his inaugural address : " Let us judge not , that we be not judged . " Pressed anew by the remark that the sight of Libby Prison forbade mercy , he repeated twice the same biblical sentence he had just quoted . On foreign questions I found him a fervent advocate of peace . I questioned him several times regarding the good relations existing between France and the United States , then imperilled // by our Mexican expedition . He always answered me : " There has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , thank God , I count for something , and during my second term there will be no more fighting . " Possibly Mr. Lincoln was mistaken in his plans for immediate reconstruction of the South ; but what was this first impression , if not the generous impetus of the victor prone to forgiveness ? The space of time , so short , that elapsed between April 3d , the date of the taking of Richmond , and the dreadful catastrophe which , only twelve days later , was to change the course of events , deserves special attention on the part of historians . On the day of triumph the whole North appeared magnanimously to forget that it was the victor . The morrow 's preoccupations , the intricate problems , the impending solutions of which remained , did not present themselves at first to it in all their magnitude . It seemed to rely upon the vanquished for the achievement of its work . The only sentiments then expressed were those of forgiveness , forgetfulness , and clemency . In the life of nations there exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence to drown confficting passions . The word on every lip is that of magnanimity ! France , at an early stage of her revolutionary history , was permitted to feel once or twice the pure effects of such inspirations . She seemed suddenly to forget the course of events , to pour water over the flaming passions ; then her children appeared reconciled to one another and to lay the foundations of a new and more perfect friendship . Unfortunately , such hours pass quickly away ; but , however rare and fleeting , they are none the less memorable . The sentiments which then animated Mr. Lincoln were echoed throughout the American Union . The very words that fell *from his lips I have heard uttered at the bedside of the wounded ; I have heard them expressed by a Massachusetts colonel , who , I remember , had just gone through the amputation of one of his legs . Not only did he forgive , but he wished the United States to forgive those who , five days before , in the affray of Plank Road , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the policy and character of Mr. Lincoln I shall limit myself in this narrative . Certainly I have had a close insight into his family life ; but when to a stranger is given the privilege of lifting a corner of that sacred veil , he must , out of respect , let it fall again , lest he be tempted to express that which he has been allowed to see . We were to leave City Point on Saturday , April 8th . A few hours prior to our leaving , the military band came from the headquarters on board the River Queen . We assembled to hear it . After the performance of several pieces , Mr. Lincoln thought He ordered it to be played . Delighted with it , he had it played a second time . " You must , however , come over to America , " said he to me , " to hear it . " He then asked me if I had ever heard " Dixie , " the rebel patriotic song , to the sound of which all their attacks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added : " That tune is now Federal property ; it belongs to us , and , at any rate , it is good to show the rebels that with us they will be free to hear it again . " He then ordered the somewhat surprised musicians to play it for us . Thus ended that last evening ; at ten o'clock our boat steamed off . Mr. Lincoln stood a long while looking at the spot we were leaving . Above us were these hills , so animated a few days ago , now dark and silent ; around us more than a hundred ships at anchor were silent proofs of the country 's maritime strength , testifying to the great efforts made . Mr. Lincoln 's mind seemed absorbed in the many thoughts suggested by this scene , and we saw him still pursue his meditation long after the quickened speed of the steamer had removed it forever from him . On Sunday , April 9th , we were steaming up the Potomac . That whole day i*. // the conversation dwelt upon literary subjects . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare . Most of these were from " Macbeth , " and , in particular , the verses which follow Duncan 's assassination . I can not recall this reading without being awed at the remembrance , when Macbeth becomes king after the murder of Duncan , he falls a prey to the most horrible torments of mind . Either because he was struck by the weird beauty of these verses , or from a vague presentiment coming over him , Mr. Lincoln paused here while reading , and began to explain to us how true a description of the murderer that one was ; when , the dark deed achieved , its tortured perpetrator came to envy the sleep of his victim ; and he read over again the same scene . Evening came on quickly . Passing before Mount Vernon , I remember saying to him : " Mount Vernon and Springfield , the memories of Washington and your own , those of the revolutionary and civil wars ; these are the spots and names America shall one day equally honor . " This remark appeared to call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How happy , four years hence , will I be to return there in peace and tranquillity ! " Arrived at the Potomac wharf , our party was forced to disperse . Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln , Senator Sumner , and myself drove home in the same carriage . We were nearing Washington when Mrs. Lincoln , who had hitherto remained silently looking at the town a short distance off , said to me : " That city is filled with our enemies . " On hearing this the President raised his arm and somewhat impatiently retorted , " Enemies ! We must never speak of that . " This was on the evening of April 9th . On the following day , the 10th , all the papers were announcing victorious news . General Grant had written to General Lee : " The result of the last weeks must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in this struggle . I feel that it is so , and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate army known as the Army of Northern Virginia. ** Several letters were then exchanged between the two generals , letters more glorious for Grant than his most successful battles , for they place him among those rare chieftains who , after having wielded their country 's sword , have known how to increase the lustre of victory by magnanimity toward the vanquished . At the close of this correspondence General Lee signed his capitulation , and is credited with these words on putting down the pen which had written his name : " Now you can march all through the South as in this room ; you will encounter no further resistance . " Thus the war was nearing its end . All minds seemed electrified by these great events . On Monday , April 10th , began a long series of public rejoicings which were to last until the following Sunday . The first days of the week the joy of the American people manifested itself in varied and tumultuous ways . At this solemn moment of his life , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and find in the consciousness of duty fulfilled , and in the unrivalled part he was justly entitled to claim in the general success , a well-deserved compensation for the troubles and anxieties of his first term in office . His war policy was now justified . It was he who had called the American people to the country 's defence , and the immense armies created at his call were now on the point of returning to their homes after having saved the Union . His selection of persons was equally justified . He had intrusted the Department of War to Mr. Stanton , and in spite of many enmities and attacks preferred against him , Mr. Lincoln had stood by him against all . Mr. Stanton , whose name America now utters with pride , had armed and equipped a million men . As was said of a Frenchman of our revolutionary period , " he // had organized victory . " It was again Mr. Lincoln who had discerned in the modest colonel of the Twenty-first Regiment of Illinois the future victor of Donelson , Vicksburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfuL In the midst of hesitations , ignorant prejudices , and animosities , Mr. Lincoln had seen the decisive moment and had evoked from the calamities of war the pure glory of slavery 's abolition . Despite all this , however , no successful man was ever more modest and retiring . On the morrow of Lee 's surrender , when the war was practically terminated , sealing irrevokably the freedom of the negro race , as a portion of the population of Washington came to congratulate Mr. Lincoln , these were the modest words he spoke : " We meet this evening , not in sorrow , but in gladness , of heart . The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond , and the surrender of the principle insurgent army , give hope of a righteous and speedy peace , whose joyous expression can not be restrained . In the midst of this , however , He from whom all blessings flow must not be forgotten . A call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared and will be duly promulgated . Nor must those whose painful efforts give us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be parcelled out with others . I myself was near the front , and had the sincere pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you ; but no part of the honor , for plan or execution , is mine . To General Grant , his skilful officers , and brave men all belongs . " The remainder of this speech is devoted to the development of his plan of reconstruction for the rebel States , or rather to the making known his first impressions regarding the same . Then , as I have since done , I do not hesitate to say that that plan for reorganization was quite insufficient . On that day Mr. Lincoln seemed to limit his view to the horizon of a material restoration ; he did not seem to see that an entire moral and social transformation of the South was the only safeguard for a peaceful future . I only see in that enunciation of ideaa an effort made to fathom the depths of public opinion , with a view perhaps to awake contradiction . On that day the President was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the close of the war ; he was , so to speak , summing up facts , and before deciding upon his own line of conduct , awaited the people 's answer to his words . I do not in that speech find Mr. Lincoln 's personal ideas expressed fully . They seem to me far better summed up in a letter he wrote in 1864 to General Wadsworth , one of the victims of the civil war , in which he said : " The restoration of the rebel States to the Union must rest upon the principle of civil and political equality of both races ; and it must be sealed by general amnesty . " Words truly worthy of him who declared , in 1863 , at Philadelphia , in the very hall in which the Declaration of Independence had been elaborated , that all his political opinions originated from careful meditation on the sentiments first expressed in that hall , which have since become the world 's inheritance . The morning of April 14th seemed to prophesy a happy day for Mr. Lincoln . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a portion of the Union armies ; on it also Mr. Lincoln welcomed home his eldest son , Captain Robert Lincoln , who was returning to his studies , and whose coming seemed to his father a sure sign of peace . At half after four o'clock in the afternoon Mr. Stanton called at the White House ; he had just received a communication from Thompson and Sanders , two rebel agents in Canada , whose names have since then become sadly notorious , asking leave to pass through the Union States . Mr. Stanton was opposed to granting this leave . But after a moment 's thought , Mr. Lincoln said : " Let us close our eyes , and let them pass unnoticed . " The President afterward drove out with Mrs. Lincoln . He seemed unu* sually animated ; his wife was almost frightened on noticing this , and said : w // " I have seen you thus oniy once before ; it was just before our dear Willie died . " This allusion made to his son 's death saddened him a moment , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future , of the easy task that was left him to perform , and of the happy days so many signs seemed to announce . That Friday evening , April 14th , was entirely given up to rejoicing ; many houses were illuminated ; torch - light processions were in the streets , and the sound of music passing was heard in the distance . But to the eye of the keen observer that public gladness was far from being unanimous throughout the city of Washington . On the day of the taking of Richmond I had seen among other things a " gentleman " purchase a newspaper which contained one of the first telegrams announcing the capture of the town , then crumple it , and throw it violently to the ground . Many infallible signs indicated that the city contained a large number of inhabitants who regretted slavery and who sided with the slaveholders . It was in the early part of the evening , and at that very moment near the rejoicing groups , that a few miserable wretches , filled with the sanguinary passions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch to what they termed " The Confederacy 's Revenge . " For four years past had the thought of assassination germinated and developed in the South . The President 's murder had become a topic of common conversation . Many spoke of it in the camps , many spoke of it through the streets of Richmond . And all these cowardly passions , all this blood-thirstiness , had found their exponents in that band of assassins . In Tenth Street they were posted to await their victim ; they stood close by the happy crowd which passed before them , and whose triumphant shouts doubtless seemed to them so many goads to vengeance , if they yet hesitated to strike . At about nine o'clock that evening Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln entered the Tenth Street Theatre . At half-past ten a man passed into the Presidential box unnoVOL . XIII. -5 ticed , approached Mr. Lincoln from behind , applied a pistol to his ear , fired his shot , then leaped upon the stage and escaped , informing the spectators that he had slain him whom he dares call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was at once carried over to one of the neighboring houses opposite the theatre . Instantly the news spread through the city . At eleven o'clock I was myself standing before the house in which Mr. Lincoln was lying . The crowd was rapidly increasing ; squads of soldiers were coming , too , and soon formed in line on the pavement . At that moment all were silent , and no one exactly knew what had happened . Suddenly I heard Booth 's name muttered by the crowd : he was the assassin , it was said . A few minutes later we heard that Mr. Seward had been murdered at his house , and soon after rumors were current of similar deeds perpetrated upon Mr. Stanton and General Grant . Then the aspect of the crowd changed all of a sudden . Until then it had seemed panic - stricken ; all at once it became infuriated . Everyone thought himself in the presence of mysterious enemies hidden in the darkness of night , and from whose murderous steel it became incumbent to save those who were yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln had just been carried was composed of three rooms , opening on the same corridor . It was in the third , a small room , that the dying man lay . His face , lighted by a gas-jet , under which the bed had been moved , was pale and livid . His body had already the rigidity of death . At intervals only the still audible sound of his breathing could be faintly heard , and at intervals again it would be lost entirely . The surgeons did not entertain hope that he might recover a moment 's consciousness . Judge William T. Otto , a thirty years ' friend of Mr. Lincoln 's , was standing at the bedside holding his hand ; around the bed stood also the Attorney-General , Mr. Speed , and the Rev. Mr. Gurhey , pastor of the church Mr. Lincoln usually attended . Leaning against the wall stood Mr. // Stanton , who gazed now and then at the dying man 's face , and who seemed overwhelmed with emotion . From time to time he wrote telegrams or gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured the preservation of peace . The remaining members of the Cabinet and several Senators and generals were pacing up and down the corridor . Thus the night passed on . At last , toward seven o'clock in the morning , the surgeon announced that death was at hand , and at twenty minutes after seven the pulse ceased beating . Everyone present seemed then to emerge from the stupor in which the hours of night had been spent . Mr. Stanton approached the bed , closed Mr. Lincoln 's eyes , and drawing the sheet over the dead man 's head , uttered these words in a very low voice : " He is a man for the ages . " On that same Saturday morning , April 15th , at ten o'clock , Chief Justice Chase went over to the hotel where Vice-president Johnson had taken up his residence , and there , in a small chamber , administered the oath of office to Mr. Lincoln 's successor . In the midst of such tragical events the transmission of supreme power took place in aperfectly natural manner . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the entire North . Hardly had he come into power , when he found himself in possession of an authority almost irresistible . The unanimous regrets bestowed upon his noble predecessor , did not impede for one moment the exercise of his function . Nothing revealed to me more clearly the true greatness of America . The voice of public opinion was already placing . the man who had governed during the civil war beside the man who had commanded during the struggle for independence ; the honest and pure liberator of slaves beside the one whose sword had made the nation freeLincoln beside Washington ; and already the people was wending its way toward its destiny , which no one can fathom without being convinced of its greatness . Thus while I stood motionless and awed with sadness before Mr. Lincoln 's bloody remains , his country had already recovered self-possession . I then understood and realized that a nation may place her confidence in a chief without giving herself wholly to him ; and that room still is left for great chara*ters and great virtues in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and noble those to whom it intrusts governmental honors may be , itself remains greater yet than they.
