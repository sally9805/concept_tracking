txt Ex-Senator Warner Miller of Herkimer is at the United States Hotel . He is in this region on private business , and will leave for his mills in the Adirondaeks in the morning . When asked about the letter of Cornelius N Blise , be said : " I have always said that I would support Bliss if he were the Republican candidate for Governor , because he is my friend , and because I believe he can bring out the whole vote of the party . " No , I did not know that he had written a letter stating that he would not accept a nomination , and I do not know whether he has written one or not . " I can not tell you who will be the choice of the Republicans if Mr. Bliss has refused to run . I know that Messrs . Wadsworth , Sloan , Saxton , Fassett , and a lot of other men have been mentioned as possible candidates , but I can not say that I have any preference for any one of those gentlemen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will vote for the man who receives the nomination from my party . I have no candidate or man whom I would wish to be a candidate , and I have emphatically declared already that I would decline the nomination were it tendered to me . " I think that the Republican Party has a firstrrate chance to elect a Governor in this State if Hill be renominated , or if any man who has Presidential aspirations be nominated by the Democratic Party this time . In other words , I think that there is no man at present before the public as a possible or probable nominee of the Democratic , Party for Governor of this State whose candidacy Will not be more or less affected ? by the schemes growing out of Presidential probabilities . I decline to say any more on this point because . I do not think it wise or proper to tell my opponents in the other party what I think would be a safe course of action for them . The Republicans have a first , rate opportunity this year . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to Europe in two weeks to join my family in Paris . I will return in time to vote with my party . I will be away so long that I do not suppose I can take any aotive part in the campaign . ? My reason for not being at the Clarkson dinner to-night might be explained in this way : I ? had to come to this region to meet the Directors of my mills and to attend to my personal affairs which have been suffering for four years . I was obliged to be in this region to-day . That 's allthere is about it . A man must not neglect his business forever . " No , I can not even guess or tell you the name of any man who might please nao or stand a fair chance of receiving the Republican nomination for Governor . I do not oars to guess or speculate . I do think , however , that Mr. Bliss world have brought out the ' whole vote of the Republican Party . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
