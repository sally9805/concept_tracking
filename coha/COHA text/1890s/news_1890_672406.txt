txt From the language and the tone of the explanation he has made we judge that the editor of the Christian Advocate sincerely regrets the pablination in the Advocate of May 8 of a blackguard . advertisement that has attracted . some attention . But the editor 's regrets only in part atone for the offense his religions journal committed and his explanations will fill the candid . reader - with amazement . The whole affair is about on a level with chicken stealing accompanied . with abuse of the owner of the chickens . The **27;0;TOOLONG of the Methodist Episcopal Church , and according to its editor 's guarded statement , is " the medium through which the Book Concern makes its announcements . " In an advertisement publishe d inthe Advocate of May 8 , Messrs . HUNT &; EATON , " Agents of the Book Concern , " set forth the merits of a pirated book about STANLEY 'S African explorations .

Remember that you can . arrange with . an editor for just as strong notices of your book , if you care to pay for them , because the business of an editor is to make money for his paper , and as long as you pay him for what you desire inserted he " will treat you just as kindly as he will any one else . " The obvious inference from this is that if publishers are not content with the publicity attainable in those columns of the Christian Advocate which Messrs . HUNT &; EATON have in charge , they must " see " the editor of the paper with a view to " strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Christian Advocate , nor is it true of any respectable newspaper , and the making and uttering of such a statement is discreditable in about equal measure to the Methodist Book Concern , to its " Agents , " and to the Christian Advocate . A Book Concern that publishes pirated books should . conduct its business with all possible stealth and . suavity , and a religious newspaper that is the organ of a great denomination ought not even in one instance to become the . medium of an immoral advertisement . That is almost as bad as the publishing of a Sunday newspaper , about which the religious press is so frequently in pain .
