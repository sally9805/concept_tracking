In fact , this is the first time members were ever appointed for any fixed term or at the expiration of any term .

The rotting machinery on the isthmus has been puttied up and whitewashed or painted to make a showing , but the impression prevails in Panama that the company is only playing a game to procure an extension of the concession . We have heard a suggestion that an inquiry concerning the present ownership of the Panama Railroad would throw some light upon the real motives and aims of the new company . If the old company 's interest in the road was turned over to the new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession , the old ditch , and the decaying plant .
