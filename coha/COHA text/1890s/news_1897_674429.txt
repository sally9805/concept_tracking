txt - It seems that the Great Eastern was just forty years in advance of her time . She was launched in 1857 , and , if she had not been by chance extremely well adapted to the business of laying submarine telegraph cables , she would have been entirely useless . She was only the imperfectly realized dream of a naval engineer , not a practicable sea-going ship . But since her time ocean steamships have been growing bigger and bigger , as well as faster and faster . Now at last in the new steamer building for the White Star Line , - the " Leviathan , " as ' it was at first proposed to call the Great ? Eastern , has been considerably exceeded in one dimension , that of length . How marked a stride has been taken in the latest addition to the transatlantic fleet may be judged from the fact that whereas the new ship is some fifteen feet longer than the Great Eastern , the longest practicable ships now afloat , the big Cunarders , are seventy feet shorter . The tonnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder of an earlier generation , and even the Oceanic will come short of the old " record " by about 1,000 tons . But the additional tonnage of the Great Eastern lay in a beam which would now be regarded as entirely excessive , and which she owed to the assumption prevalent when she was built that a - sea- going steamer must be able to take care of herself under canvas . Moreover , she was impracticable on account of her depth . Sandy Hook bar may be said to regulate the draught of great commercial steamers . On her last visit to these shores , the Great Eastern was forced to traverse Long Island Sound and come in through the East River because there was not enough water on the bar to float her . It is unlikely that the length of the Oceanic will be exceeded , or the other dimensions of the Great Eastern more nearly approached , for many years to come .
