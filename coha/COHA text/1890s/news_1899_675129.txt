txt The lack of a quorum prevented a meeting of the Executive Committee in charge of the " dollar dinner " yesterday , and , in consequence , the plans , for that feast are at a standstill . Some of the members of the committee that gathered at the meeting place , 91 Centre Street , were of the opinion that a plot was in existence to defeat the project of celebrating Jefferson Day and doing honor to William Jennings Bryan , and all of them agreed that unless more energy were injected into the arrangements the affair would fizzle out . A report printed in a morning newspaper to the effect that John C. Sheehan , - who is In Hot Springs , Ark. , had expressed himself as favoring the " dollar dinner , " gave rise to suspicions that Tammany influences were at work to nullify the effects of Mr. Bryan 's friends to start a new boom for the Nebraskan . Mr. Sheehan 's differences with Richard Croker were lost s'ght of in the remembrance that he is a Tammany Hall leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sheehan as being still less of a Democrat than Perry Belmont , who has heretofore been the chief object of the attacks of the silierites . The man who thus " exposed " Mr. Sheehan is J. W. Hughes of 1 Madison Avenue , and his sentiments were generally approved by his colleagues on the committee . As a result it is extremely doubtful whether Mr. Sheehan will be invited to the cheap dinner , and inasmuch as he has already declined to take part in the Democratic Club 's feast , it is probable that he either will not honor Democracy 's patron saint or will pay his homage in private . While waiting for the members of the committee to arrive. , Mr. Hughes made this statement to the reporters who were in at-tendance : " Sheehan is not as good e Democrat as Mr. Belmont . I got a letter from Coin Harvey , Chairman of the National Ways and Means Committee of the Democratic Party , on Jan. 3 lest , in which he asked me to ' size tip ' the political situation here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the alleged Democrats with whom I conferred was Mr. Sheehan . I told him of the desires of the Ways and Means Committee , and also complimented him upon his bravery in challenging Mr. Crokere I was not a little surprised when he said : " ' Mr. Hughes , understand me . I do not ' wholly indorse the Chicago platform . I do n't believe in the sixteen-to-one plank . The ratio should be left to Congress . ' " I told him Congress had for twenty-five years been unable to settle upon a ratio , and that if we adopted his plan the matter would be unsettled for another fifty . years . 1 told him we would not consent to any such arrangement . " Now , . there is a clever plot all arranged to gel the best of us . They know we can beat them in an open fight , for DU per cent . of the rank and tile of Tammany Hall are loyal to the Chicago platform and Mr. Bryan . The scheme is to have Sheehan as a professed believer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . He is then to come out openly in opposition to Mr. Croker , and Mr. Croker will go abroad as he die in lelei and Sheehan will lead Tammany Hall  --  in mere . " Croker and the corporation influences of the Belmonts , Whitneys , will in reality control the organization . Mr. Sheehan demonstrated once before that he was merely Mr. Croker 's tool . " Thomas W. F. Scanlon , who was the Chicago platform candidate for Congress in the Second District in the last campaign , said : " I am utterly and absolutely opposed to Mr. Sheehan and to permitting him to either manage or take part in this dinner . Sheehan is a member of Tammany Hall and is controlled more than any man in it by Croker . His opposition to the latter is only feigned , and it is part of a scheme . " After the committeemen had waited on their tardy colleagues for two hours , they left the meeting place without deciding upon a date for another meeting . They were all of the opinion that the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the silver men appeared to be . and it was agreed that the next meeting should be held on the call of Eugene V. Brewster , the head of the dinner movement . Mr. Brewster said yesterday that he had received many requests for invitations , and altogether he felt that the success of the affair was secured . He made public a letter which he had received from M. Dammeyer , Secretary of the German-American Double Standard Club of 7 Third Avenue . Mr. Brewster looked on the letter as Indicative of the anti-Tammany , anti-plutocracy sentiment of the people who sympathize with Mr. Bryan . Mr. Dammeyer 's letter follows : Dear Mr. Brewster : Your expression as to no surrender meets with full approval . We want to eliminate every black sheep from our ranks . and now is the time to do it . No true Jeffersonian Democrat must associate with those who have proved traitors to our cause , no matter under what pretense . No black sheep Croker and Belmont plutocrats must be admitted to our ranks under any circumstances . We have fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboring with great exertion and expense for the cause of true Democracy so dear to the plain people , and to surrender one iota to Corrupt Tammany bosses anu traitors would be political suicide on our part . There is no doubt that the Guggenheimer type of Croker stoolplgeon would like to see us eating what is left of the plutocrats ' dinner . A. few months ago Mr. Guggnheimer wanted the people of New York that were less fortunate than himself in regard to swell dinned-eating to satisfy their appetites with the swill of Fifth Avenue , but the people are working out their own salvation , and this is , glory to say , the beginning of the end of the most disgraceful and plutocratic reign any people has had to suffer in any city . Kindly reserve twenty-five tickets for officers and members of the German-American Double-Standard Club . Mr. Brewster said that a friend of 0 . H. P. Belmont had suggested that that gentleman be invited to the dollar dinner , be- ? cause he believes in the Chicago platform with the exception of the silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Belmont would be invited , and would undoubtedly accept The committeeman said Mr. Belmont might make a speech , but that this wa.3 not certain .. Mr. Belmont announced yesterday that he had made no effort to secure the invitation . This step , he said , had been taken by certain of his friends , and he had known nothing of it until he read of it in the newspapers . At the Democratic Club last night it was said that several club members who had been tardy in applying for dinner tickets had been ' turned down " because of the fact that all the seats at the tables have already been disposed of . Seats in the boxes and galleries , however , will be placed at the disposal of club members , but as yet the manner in which these seats will be distributed has not been decided upon . A letter which has been received by a. member of the Democratic Club from ex-Gov . Hill says that Mr. Hill will not accept the Invitation to the Democratic Club 's dinner .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
