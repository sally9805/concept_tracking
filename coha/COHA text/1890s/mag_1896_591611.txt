THE YOUNG SHAKESPEARE : A STUDY OF ROMEO . THE plays of Shakespeare marshal themselves in the beyond . They stand in a place outside of our deduction . Their cosmos is greater than our philosophy . They are like the forces of nature and the operations of life in the vivid world about us . We may measure our intellectual growth by the new horizons we see opening within them . So long as they continue to live and change , to expand and deepen , to be filled with new harmony and new suggestion , we may rest content ; we are still growing . At the moment we think we have comprehended them , at the moment we see them as stationary things , we may be sure something is wrong ; we are beginning to petrify . Our fresh interest in life has been arrested . There is , therefore , danger in an attempt to " size up " Shakespeare . We can not help setting down as a coxcomb any man who has done it to his own satisfaction . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want him , you can lay your hand on him . He has written an autobiography . // He has " sized up " himself . In writing about Shakespeare , it is excusable to put off the armor of criticism , and speak in a fragmentary and inconclusive manner , lest by giving way to conviction , by encouraging ourselves into positive beliefs , we hasten the inevitable and grow old before our time . Perhaps some such apology is needed to introduce the observations on the character of Romeo which are here thrown together , and the remarks about the play itself , the acting and the text . It is believed by some scholars that in the second quarto edition of Romeo and Juliet , published in 1599 , Shakespeare 's revising hand can be seen , and that the differences between the first and second editions show the amendments , additions , and corrections with which Shakespeare saw fit to embellish his work in preparing it for the press . If this were actually the case ; if we could lay the two texts on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare 's draft or acting copy , and the other Shakespeare 's finished work ; and if , by comparing the two , we could enter into the workshop and forge of his mind , it would seem as if we had at last found an avenue of approach towards this great personality , this intellect the most powerful that has ever illumined human life . No other literary inquiry could compare in interest with such a study as this ; for the relation which Shakespeare himself bore to the plays he created is one of the mysteries and blank places in history , a gap that staggers the mind and which imagination can not overleap . The student who examines both texts will be apt to conclude that the second is by no means a revised edition of the first , but that ( according to another theory ) the first is a pirated edition of the play , stolen by the printer , and probably obtained by means of a reporter who took down the lines as they were spoken on the stage . The stage directions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatist as to what should be done on the stage , but seem rather the records of an eye-witness as to what he saw happen on the stage . The mistakes of the reporter ( or the perversions of the actors ) as seen in the first edition generally injure the play ; and it was from this circumstance - the frequency of blotches in the first edition - that the idea gained currency that the second edition was an example of Shakespeare 's never failing tact in bettering his own lines . Perhaps , after all , it would little advance our understanding of the plays , or solve the essential puzzle , - that they actually had an author , - if we could follow every stroke of his revising pen . We should observe , no doubt , refinement of characterization , changes of stage effect , the addition of flourishes and beauties ; but their origin and true meaning , the secret of their life , would be as safe as it is at present , as securely lost in the midst of all this demonstration as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theatre . If we must then abandon the hope of seeing Shakespeare in his workshop , we may , nevertheless , obtain from the pirated text some notion of the manner in which Shakespeare was staged in his own day , and of how he fared at the hands of the early actors . Romeo and Juliet is an exceptionally difficult play to act , and the difficulties seem to have been about the same in Shakespeare 's time as they are to-day . They are , in fact , inherent in the structure of the work itself . As artists advance in life , they develop , by growing familiar with the conditions of their art , the power of concealing its limitations , - a faculty in which even the greatest artists are often deficient in their early years . There is an anecdote of Schumann which somewhat // crudely illustrates this . It is said that in one of his early symphonies he introduced a passage leading np to a climax , at which the horns were to take up the aria in triumph . At the rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth their message of victory , there was heard a sort of smothered braying which made everybody laugh . The composer had arranged his climax so that it fell upon a note which the horns could not sound except with closed stops . The passage had to be rewritten . The young painter is frequently found struggling with subjects , with effects of light which are almost impossible to render , and which perhaps an older man would not attempt . It is not surprising to find among the early works of Shakespeare that some of the characters , however true to life , - nay , because true to life , - are almost impossible to be represented on the stage . Certainly Romeo presents us with a character of the kind . Shakespeare 's knowledge of human nature seems to have antedated his knowledge of the stage . In imagining the character of Romeo , a character to fit the plot of the old story , he took little thought for his actors . In conjuring up the probabilities which would lead a man into such a course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probabilities and facts in real life rather than the probabilities demanded by the stage . Romeo must be a man almost wholly made up of emotion , a creature very young , a lyric poet in the intensity of his sensations , a child in his helplessness beneath the ever varying currents and whirlpools of his feeling . He lives in a walking and frenzied dream , comes in contact with real life only to injure himself and others , and finally drives with the collected energy of his being into voluntary shipwreck upon the rocks of the world . This man must fall in love at first sight . He must marry clandestinely . He must be banished for having taken part in a street fight , and must return to slay himself upon the tomb of his beloved . Shakespeare , with his passion for realism , devotes several scenes at the opening of the play to the explanation of Romeo 's state of mind . He will give us a rationalistic account of love at first sight by bringing on this young poet in a blind chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise connected with the story . It is perfectly true that this is the best and perhaps the only explanation of love at first sight . The effect upon Romeo 's very boyish , unreal , and almost unpleasant lovesickness of the rejection ( for which we must always respect Rosaline ) is to throw him , and all the unstable elements of which he is made , into a giddy whirl , which , after a day or two , it will require only the glance of a pair of eyes to precipitate into the very elixir of true love . All this is true , hut no audience cares about the episode or requires the explanation . Indeed , it jars upon the sentimental notion of many persons to this day , and in many stage versions it is avoided . These preparatory scenes bring out in a most subtle way the egoism at the basis of Romeo 's character , - the same lyrical egoism that is in all his language and in all his conduct . When we first see Romeo , he is already in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and absorbed in himself . On meeting Juliet he passes from his first dream into a second dream . On learning of the death of Juliet he passes into still a third and quite different dream , - or stage of dream , - a stage in which action is necessary , and in which he displays the calculating intellect of a maniac . The mental abstraction of Romeo continues even after he has met Juliet . In Capulet 's garden , despite the directness of Juliet , he is still in his reveries . The sacred wonder // of the hour turns all his thoughts , not into love , but into poetry . Juliet 's anxieties are practical . She asks him about his safety , how he came there , how he expects to escape . He answers in madrigals . His musings are almost impersonal . The power of the moonlight is over him , and the power of the scene , of which Juliet is only a part . " With love 's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls ; For stony limits can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dares love at-tempt ; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me . Lady , by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops - It is my soul that calls upon my name : How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears . " These reflections are almost " asides . " They ought hardly to be spoken aloud . They denote that Romeo is still in his trance . They have , however , another and unfortunate influence : they retard the action of the play . As we read the play to ourselves , this accompaniment of lyrical feeling on Romeo 's part does not interfere with our enjoyment . It seems to accentuate the more direct and human strain of Juliet 's love . But on the stage the actor who plays Romeo requires the very highest powers . While speaking at a distance from Juliet , and in a constrained position , he must by his voice and gestures convey these subtlest shades of feeling , throw these garlands of verse into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asides " in such a manner that the audience feels they are in place , even as the reader does . It is no wonder that the role of Romeo is one of the most difficult in all Shakespeare . The demands made upon the stage are almost more than the stage can meet . The truth to nature is of a kind that the stage is almost powerless to render . The character of Romeo can not hope to be popular . Such pure passion , such unreasonable giving way , is not easily f orgiven in a man . He must roll on the floor and blubber and kick . There is no getting away from this . He is not Romeo unless he cries like a baby or a Greek hero . This is the penalty for being a lyric poet . Had he used his mind more upon the problems of his love , and less upon its celebration in petaled phrases , his mind would not have deserted him so lamentably in the hour of his need* In fact , throughout the play , Romeo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of becoming contemptible . For one instant only does he rise into respectability , - at the moment of his quarrel with Tybalt . At this crisis he is stung into life by the death of Mercutio , and acts like a man . The ranting manner in which it is customary to give Romeo ' s words in this passage of the play shows how far most actors are from understanding the true purport of the lines ; how far from realizing that these few lines are the only opportunity the actor has of establishing the character of Romeo as a gentleman , a man of sense and courage , a formidable fellow , not unfit to be the hero of a play : - " Alive , in triumph ! and Mereutio slain ! Away to heaven , respective lenity , And fire-ey 'd fury be my conduct now ! Now , Tybalt , take the villain ' back again That late thou gav'st me ; - for Mercutio 's soul Is but a little way above our heads , Staying for thine to keep him company : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with him . " The first three lines are spoken by Romeo to himself . They are a reflection , not a declamation , - a reflection upon which he instantly acts . He assumes the calmness of a man of his rank who is about to fight . More than this , Romeo , the man of words and moods , when once roused , as we shall see later , in a worser cause , - when once pledged to action , - Romeo shines with a sort of fatalistic spiritual power . He is now visibly dedi // cated to this quarrel . We feel sure that lie will kill Tybalt in the encounter . The appeal to the supernatural is in his very gesture . The audience - nay , Tybalt himself - gazes with awe on this sudden apparition of Romeo as a man of action . This highly satisfactory conduct is soon swept away by his behavior on hearing the news of his banishment* The boy seems to be without much stamina , after all . He is a pitiable object , and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tide of his feelings has turned again , and by one of those natural reactions which he himself takes note of he wakes up unaccountably happy , " and all this day an unaccustom 'd spirit lifts him above the ground with cheerful thoughts . " It is the lightning before the thunderbolt . " Her body sleeps in Capel 's monument , And her immortal part with angels lives . I saw her laid low in her kindred 's vault , And presently took post to tell it you . " Balthasar makes no attempt to break the news gently . The blow descends on Romeo when he least expects it . He is not spared . The conduct of Romeo on hearing of Juliet 's death is so close to nature as to be nature itself , yet it happens to be conduct almost impossible to be given on the stage . He does nothing . He is stunned* He collapses . For fully five minutes he does not speak , and yet in these five minutes he must show to the audience that his nature has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry is broken . His words are gone . His emotion is paralyzed* but his mind is alert . He seems suddenly to be grown up , - a man , and not a boy , - and a man of action . " Is it even so ? " is all he says . He orders post-horses , ink and paper , in a few rapid sentences ; it is evident that before speaking at all he has determined what he will do , and from now on to the end of the play Romeo is different from his old self , for a new Romeo has appeared . He is in a state of intense and calm exultation . All his fluctuating emotions have been stilled or stunned . He gives his orders in staccato . We feel that he knows what he is going to do , and will certainly accomplish it . Meanwhile his mind is dominant . It is preternaturally active . His " asides , " which before were lyrical , now become the comments of an acute intellect . His vivid and microscopic recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apothecary , his sudden violence to Balthasar at the entrance to the tomb , and his as sudden friendliness , his words and conflict with Paris , whom he kills incidentally , absent-mindedly , and , as it were , with his left hand , without malice and without remorse , - all these things show an intellect working at high pressure , while the spirit of the man is absorbed in another and more important matter . There is a certain state of mind in which the will to do is so soon followed by the act itself that one may say the act is automatic . The thought has already begun to be executed even while it is being formed . This occurs especially where the intent is to do some horrid deed which requires preparation , firmness of purpose , ingenuity , and above all external calmness . " Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion , all the interim is Like a phantasma , or a hideous dream : The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council ; and the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then The nature of an insurrection . " This is the phase through which Romeo is passing on the way from Mantua to Yerona . His own words give us a picture of him during that ride - " What said my man when my hetossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ? " He has come like an arrow , his mind closed to the external world , himself in the blind clutch of his own deadly pur // pose , driving on towards its fulfillment . Only at the end , when he stands before the bier of Juliet , sure of his will , beyond the reach of hindrance , alone for the first time , - olily then is his spirit released in floods of eloquence ; then does his triumphant purpose break into speech , and his words soar up like the flames of a great bonfire of precious incense streaming upward in exultation and in happiness . The whole course of these last scenes of Romeo 's life , which are scarcely longer than this description of them , is in the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things so difficult to present on the stage as to be fairly impossible . The very long , the very minute description of the apothecary 's shop , given by a man whose heart has stopped beating , but whose mind is at work more actively and more accurately than it has ever worked before , is a thing highly sane as to its words . It must be done quietly , rapidly , and yet the impression must be created , which is created upon Balthasar , that Romeo is not in his right mind . A friend seeing him would cross the street to ask what was the matter . The whole character of Romeo , from the beginning , has been imagined with reference to this self-destroying consunimation . From his first speech we might have suspected that something destructive would come out of this man . There is a type of highly organized being , not well fitted for this world , whose practical activities are drowned in a sea of feeling . Egoists by their constitution , they become dangerous beings when vexed , cornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no training in the painful constructive processes of civilization . Their first instincts , when goaded into activity , are instincts of destruction . They know no compromise . If they are not to have all , then no one shall possess anything . Romeo is not suffering in this final scene . He is experiencing the greatest pleasure of his life . He glories in his deed . It satisfies his soul . It gives him supreme spiritual activity . The deed brings widespread desolation , but to this he is indifferent , for it means the destruction of the prison against which his desires have always beaten their wings , the destruction of a material and social universe from which he has always longed to be free . " 0 , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inanspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh . " How much of all this psychology may we suppose was rendered apparent to the motley collection of excitable people who flocked to see the play - which appears to have been a popular one - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gathered by an audience to-day from a tolerable representation of the piece . The subtler truths of Shakespeare have always been lost upon the stage . In turning over the first quarto of Romeo and Juliet , we may see that many such matters were pruned ruggedly off by the actors . The early audiences , like the popular audiences of to-day , doubtless regarded action as the first merit of a play , and the stage managers must have understood this . It is noticeable that , in the authentic text , the street fight with which this play opens is a carefully-worked-up scene , which comes to a climax in the entry of the prince . The reporter gives a few words only to a description of the scene . No doubt , in Shakespeare 's time , the characters spoke very rapidly or all at once . It is impossible that the longer plays , like King Lear , should have been finished in an evening , unless the scenes moved with a hurry of life very different from the declamatory leisure with which our actors move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story was evidently the chief aim of the stage managers . The choruses are finger-posts . It is true that the choruses in Shakespeare // are generally so overloaded with curious ornament as to be incomprehensible except as explanations of things already understood . The prologue to Romeo and Juliet is a riddle to which the play is the answer . One might at first suppose that the need of such finger-posts betrayed a dull audience , but no dull person was ever enlightened by Shakespeare 's choruses . They play variation s on the theme . They instruct only the instructed . If interest in the course of the story be the first excitement to the theatre-goer , interest in seeing a picture of contemporary manners is probably the second . Our chief loss in reading Shakespeare is the loss of the society he depicts , and which we know only through him . In every line and scene there must be meanings which have vanished forever with the conditions on which they comment . A character on the stage has need , at the feeblest , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something we know in real life . The types of Shakespeare which have been found substantial enough to survive the loss of their originals must have had an interest for the first audiences , both in nature and in intensity , very different from their interest to us . The high life depicted by Shakespeare has disappeared . No one of us has ever known a Mercutio . Fortunately , the types of society seem to change less in the lower orders than in the upper classes . England swarms with old women like Juliet 's nurse ; and as to these characters in Shakespeare whose originals still survive , and as to them only , we may feel that we are near the Elizabethans . We should undoubtedly suffer some disenchantment by coming in contact with these coarse and violent people . How much do the pictures of contemporary England given us by the novelists stand in need of correction by a visit to the land ! How different is the thing from the abstract ! Or , to put the same thought in a more obvious light , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How Germanized does he come forth from their libraries and from their green-rooms ! We in America , with our formal manners , our bloodless complexions , our perpetual decorum and self-suppression , are about as much in sympathy with the real element of Shakespeare 's plays as a Baptist parson is with a fox-hunt . Our blood is stirred by the narration , but our constitution could never stand the reality . As we read we translate all things into the dialect of our province ; or if we are not great enough to be modest , let us say that we translate the dialect of the English province into the language of our empire ; but we still translate . Mercutio , on inspection , would turn out to be not a gentleman , - and indeed he is not ; Juliet , to be a most extraordinary young person ; Tybalt , a brute and ruffian , a type from the plantation ; and the only man with whom we should feel at all at ease would be the County Paris , in whom we should all recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we should cry . " Why , he s a man of wax ! " John Jay Chapman . // COMMENT ON NEW BOOKS . HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY . Richelieu , by Richard Lodge , M. A. , Foreign Statesmen Series . ( Macmillan . ) The average quality of the numerous historical series published in the last few years has been , all things considered , rather surprisingly good ; but no one of them , perhaps , shows such nniformly admirable work as the Twelve English Statesmen , so that readers will be ready to give an especial welcome to a new series on similar lines , devoted to some of the most eminent statesmen of Continental Enrope , of which this volume is the earliest issue . Precedence can well be given to the life of the man whom his biographer justly styles the greatest political genins France has ever produced , while Professor Lodge 's masterly treatment of his subject makes his monograph no ill model for its snccessors . It is perfectly proportioned ; the narrative , if condensed , is neither dry nor bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tortuons diplomacy , the confusing wars and rumors of war of the time ; it is steadily interesting , and often suggestive . It will be the reader 's own fault if he does not gain from the book a definite conception of the deep and enduring impress left by Richelien on his country , and also of the momentousness of the principal shortcoming of his policy , his failure to reform the financial mal-administration of France . The second volume of the series , Philip Augustus , by William Holden Hutton , B. ID. , though not so noteworthy a book , is a well-arranged , clearly-written , and , we may add , readable brief history of Philip the Conqueror . The author very modestly owns his indebtedness to the French and German historians who have studied his subject in the last fifty years , his conclusions drawn from an examination of the original authorities being generally anticipated by these scholars , so that he has had no choice but to follow in their footsteps . A later edition will probably correct a few slips in names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Harriott lorry Ravenel . ( Scribners . ) This is the third volume in the series of Women of Colonial and Revolutionary Times ; and if those bands of women known today as " Dames " and " Daughters " are as plentiful as the reports of their doings , we may well believe that the book-counters are lined with purchasers waiting for just such books as these . What is more , they are good books . This last volume presents a capital picture of the best Southern life before and during the Revolution . Fortunately for the biographer , Mrs. Pinckney left a mass of letters such as no woman to-day could find time to write . They are letters that picture clearly not only the social life of the time , but the strong and womanly personality of their writer . It is interesting , also , to observe how many names that figure in them are names of constant and honored recurrence in American history . - Jeanne d'Arc , Her Life and Death , by Mrs. Oliphant . Heroes of the Nations Series . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maid with sympathetic insight and fervent enthusiasm we need hardly say , or that she expends no efforts in trying to give naturalistic explanations of the mystical elements in the history . She is not disturbed by the apparition of the saints " there is in them an ineffable appropriateness awl fitness , against which the imagination , at least , has not a word to say . " She finds it more incredible that the devout peasant girl should have shown the genius of a soldier ; while at her trial she appears " a far greater miracle in her simplicity and noble steadfastness " than even in the wonders she had wrought . Mrs. Oliphant attempts nothing more than to retell , faithfully and vividly , the familiar story , for which , considering the distance in time , such astonishingly abundant and authentic materials e*xist . We know of no popular life of her heroine which would be so likely to attract young readers . Like all the books of this series , the volume is generously illustrated . - The Mogul Emperors of Hindustan , A. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Scribners . ) A collection of miniatures of the Mogul Emperors having come into Professor Jiolden 's hands , he was led to devote " the spare hours of a long and harassing winter " to the study of their history ; the result being // certain magazine articles , here reprinted in a revised and extended form . Remembering that history is the author 's recreation , and not his serious pursuit , we find in these sketches of the Great Moguls which come to us from the Lick Observatory many commendable qualities . Much varied information is brought together and systematized in a volume of moderate compass ; excellent judgment is shown in the selection of illustrative extracts from the authorities used , and in the choice of the authorities as well , while the writer 's conclusions drawn therefrom are temperate and just , and set forth in a lucid , unaffected style . The work is well illustrated , some of the portraits being reproduced for the first time . But surely the miniature of the Empress " buried in the Taj-Mahal , " which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 128 ) , represent the same woman . Perhaps , however , the face of the latter , assuming the genuineness of the portrait , became the conventional model to which supposed pictures of later queens conformed . - The Education of Children at Rome , by George Clarke ( Macmillan ) , presents succinctly the educational theories which dominated the Roman school system , and deals practically with such matters as the kinds of schools founded by the Romans , their equipment and their curricu la . There are many larger works on this subject , but none which form more pleasant reading . - The Cambridge of Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-Six , edited by Arthur Gilman . ( The Riverside Press , Cambridge . ) The further title of this handsome octavo is , A Picture of the City and its Industries Fifty Years after its Incorporation . Here is a city with a population of over eighty thousand , and a valuation of over eighty million , which indicates in its memorial volume the relative value it sets on ideas and on things . Three fourths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiske and A. MeF . Davis , sketches of life by T. W. Higginson and others , notes on Harvard University by President Eliot , John Trowbridge , Bishop Lawrence , Dr. Sargent , and others , and further inquiry into those features of the city which have to do with the health , education , religion , philanthropy , and self-government of the citizens ; while only the last quarter of the book is devoted to the business of the city . This is putting the horse before the cart , and on prudential grounds alone is the most admirable advertisement the city could have . After all , people really wish to know a good place to live in , not merely a place to make money in. - Quaint Nantucket , by William Root Bliss . ( Houghton . ) Mr. Bliss has been singularly fortunate in the amount of material at his command . His narrative is used merely to link together delightful clippings from old letters , records , and sea - logs , unspoiled by any deviation from their original spelling and phraseology . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bliss justly styles " Quaint Nantucket , " but the quotations from documents of successive epochs give us pictures which we would not willingly exchange for photographs from the life . Separated from the mainland by a broad sound , the island folk kept their types more pure than their brethren on the continent . The history of their civilization is like a scientific experiment . Possible causes of change are introduced singly , and their relations to consequent effects are curiously evident . - The Messrs . Putnams have fitly incorporated in the Heroes of the Nations Series their illustrated edition of Irving 's Life of Columbus , as condensed by the author from his larger work . LITERATURE . Mr. Knight 's definitive edition of the Poetical Works of William Wordsworth ( Macmillan ) has reached the sixth volume , and in the chronological order embraces those poems written and published between 1814 and 1820 . Thus the final group is Memorials of a Tour on the Continent . Nothing is lacking which the reader may think he requires for the correct knowledge of all the circumstances under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for a comparison of texts ; and hardly anything is lacking which a tolerably ignorant person would require for the elucidation of the facts imbedded in the verse . - Rnbaiy*t of Omar Khayy4m , English , French , and German Translations , comparatively arranged in Accordance with the Text of Edward Fitzgerald 's Version , with further Selections , Notes , Biographies , and other matter . Collected and edited by Nathan Haskell Dole . ( Joseph Knight Co . ) As comprehensive as this title are 715 // the two teeming volumes of Mr. Dole 's Variorum Editioii of Omar . All we know , and all we need to know of the Persian poet , is to be found somewhere in one of the two books . Nothing is omitted , from the ripe fruits of German scholarship down to the green apples of " occasional verse . " If Mr. Dole 's diligence and ingenuity had been employed as judiciously in arranging this mass of material as in collecting it , nothing but enthnsiasm could greet his performance .. As it is , he has rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that has been said of him and done with him . It is merely with the matter of arrangement that fault might not unreasonably be found . For a single example , Fitzgerald 's notes on the Rub*iyat of his translation do not appear in any one easily accessible place . They all seem to be there , but one must use one 's own ingenuity in finding them . The books are handsomely made , without and within , and , for their wealth of contents , should certainly meet with a generous welcome . - The Lesser Bourgeoisie ( Les Petits Bourgeois ) , belonging to Scenes from Parisian Life , and the lust published of its author 's novels , has appeared in Messrs . Roberts ' edition of Balzac , translated by Miss Wormeley . This book was not given to the public till 1854 , three years after Balzac 's death , though it would seem it was nearly ready for the press ten years earlier . It has been surmised that M. Rabou gave the finishing touches to the work . - Mr. Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works a volume of Essays do Nature and Culture .

( Macmillan . ) Intelligently used , this little book will go far toward making the school study of Homer humane and profitable . - The Works of Max Beerbohm . ( Scribners . ) Seven brief essays from the Omnia Opera of Mr. Beerbohm ; and , alas , the final words of his book are these " I shall write no more . Already I feel myself to be a trifle outmoded . I belong to the Beardsley period . Younger men , with months of activity before them , with fresher schemes and notions , with newer enthusiasm , have pressed forward since then . Cedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For to be outmoded is to be a classic , if one has written well . I have acceded to the hierarchy of good scribes , and rather like my niche . " To express delight in such a passage , by one who tells us that in 1890 he was a freshman at Oxford , would be to confess one 's self incapable of enjoying it . With discretion , too , must one read the essay of historical research upon the year 1880 , and be thankful for such training as one has already received in the spirit of decadence . - Matthew Arnold 's review of Stopford Brooke 's Primer of English Literature and his Essay on Grny , and John Morley 's address to the University Extension students on the Study of Literature , form a group of papers in a small volume designed apparently to quicken zeal in the study of literature . ( Macmillan. ) - The Interpretation of Literature , by W. H. Crawshaw , A. M. ( Macmillan . ) The merits and faults of this little treatise , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are such as usually attach to work which has taken form in the classroom : on the one hand , perfect clearness and sanity ; on the other , over-elaboration of plan , and a formalism of tone which is inharmonious with the essay idea . PERIODICALS . A periodical is generally founded for one of two purposes , - the making of money or the expression of ideas . After it is well on its feet , it may accomplish both of these ends . We have before us recent volumes of The Yellow Book , The Evergreen , and The Chap - Book . The purpose of The Yellow Book ( Lane , London ; Copeland &amp; Day , Boston ) has sometimes been considered a puzzle . Its continuance upon the lines on which it was first framed appears to have been abandoned . Its yellow is as bright without , but far paler within . The cult of which it was originally the prophet is expressing itself far more quietly , at least here , and The Yellow Book is correspondingly less exciting , both to Philistine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Seasonal ( Patrick Geddes and Colleagues , Edinburgh ; 716 // J.

The Evergreen seeks " to stimulate the return to local and national tradition and living nature . " To this end it brings together the work of Scottish writers and illustrators in volumes of striking beauty of type , paper , and binding . In the summer volume , essays , fiction , poetry , and decoration are all chosen with the spirit of summer as a guide ; in the autumn volume , the same note of the season is consistently struck . One may not care for all the art , of pen and pencil , which the books set forth , - indeed , one does not in many instances ; yet the " seasonal " has something of sincerity about it which smacks of its northern air , and the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college settlement , make their periodical but a part of a general attempt to develop whatsoever things are lovely in Edinburgh leaves one wishing well to this enterprise , which can hardly have financial gain as one of its motives . S. R. Crockett , William Sharp , Sir No*l Paton , and others equally well known are among the contributors . Each number contains pages of French , - not so much , we fancy , for the reason that leads Cosmopolis to the same course , as to emphasize the historic sympathy between France and Scotland . From these foreign growths we turn to Volume IV . of our own little Chap-Book . ( H. S. Stone &amp; Co. , Chicago . ) Like life itself , it stands compact of error and truth , wisdom and folly . The notes are nearly always readable and pointed , the illustrations are often decadently bizarre and poor , the verse is amazingly unequal , the criticism is frequently capital . A paper by Mr. Norman Hapgood , An Intellectual Parvenu , is especially good . One class of niodern Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking over Mr. Hapgood 's remarks ; and for publishers of new magazines , whether in Chicago or in Britain , there is much virtue in the wise words with which Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie brings his contribution to the Chap-Book to an end : " The new impulse in literature , when it comes , will evidence its presence neither by indecency nor by eccentricity , but by a certain noble sun plicity , by the sanity upon which a great authority ultimately rests , by the clearness of its insight and the depth of its sympathy with that deeper life of humanity , in which are the springs of originality and productiveness . " FICTION . Weir of Hermiston , an Unfinished Romance , by Robert Louis Stevenson . ( Scribners . ) A Romance Begun would be a more truthful description of this charming fragment , for the word " unfinished " carries with it an impression that the end was not far off . Putting together what Stevenson finished and what the Editorial Note tells us was to have been done , we may safely calculate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written when its untimely end came . There is abundantly enough to convince us that Stevenson had begun one of his very best performances ; and there is enough to show clearly , again , why it is that our generation , especially its younger element , cares so very greatly for the writer who is gone . No one spoke more unmistakably than he the most characteristic language of our day . His mind , like his pen , worked in the medium which it provides ; and one great sorrow is that nobody is left so completely the interpreter of a spirit which now must be content with a less satisfying utterance . - Disturbing Elements , by Mrs. Birchenough M. E. Bradley . ( Macmillan . ) A pleasing and readable tale , whose unobtrusive virtues will cause it to be overlooked , we hope , only by the hardened readers of the highly colored , strongly flavored fiction of the hour . The contrasting characters of the charming , well - bred , clever , and sophisticated Mrs. Lanion , one of those women who instinctively prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , college-trained , and quite unsophisticated granddaughter , are drawn with admirable truth , as is the household of the French branch of their family , and especially the old lady who is its efficient and domineering head . The author 's good sense and good taste are grateful to the reader , who soon finds that she can tell a story as well . - The Massacre of the Innocents , and Other Tales , by Belgian Writers , translated by Edith Wingate Rinder . ( Stone &amp; Kimball . ) A dozen tales by some writers of to-day , of whom only one has a European reputation , selected by the translator as re 717 // presentative of " the contemporary Belgian Renascence . " Two of the sketches , The Massacre of the Innocents , by Maeterlinck , and The Denial of St. Peter , by iDemolder , are Scripture stories with a Flemish setting , - literary versions , as it were , of old Dutch Biblical pictures . Three of the tales are by M. Georges Eekhoud , sometimes called the Zola of Flanders , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than the tenderness and pathos of Ex-Voto , would entitle him . Realism , so called , is the prevailing quality of these studies , grimly tragic for the most part . Judging from this book , we should conclude that the Belgian fin de siicle raconteurs are quite without the grace of humor . We are told that The Beleaguered City may help us to comprehend L'Ame Errante , but we fail to discover , in manner or spirit , the least affinity between M. Richelle 's fantasy and Mrs. Oliphant 's beautiful tale . - Lives that came to Nothing , by Garrett Leigh . Iris Series . ( Dent , London ; Macmillan , New York . ) In this vague tale , or rather sketch , we meet the characters , to whom we are never really introduced , at a seaside resort , where they indulge in much epigrammatic and allusive talk , the conversations being varied by fragments of letters . As we go on , we become slightly acquainted with the several characters , and begin to comprehend how unfortunately the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " the little woman , " who , like Charlotte , is a married lady , and whose Werther is also a moral man . The book is a singular mixture of cleverness and crudeness , and , to all appearance , is a youthful production . - In the Valley of Tophet , by Henry W. Nevinson . ( Holt . ) The Valley of Tophet is a typical mining district in England , of the worser sort , and the dramatis person*e of the dozen stories composing the volume are drawn from the overworked and underfed workers of the iron mines . As befits the stage and actors , . the trend of the book is pathetic . The author , evidently familiar with the models from which the characters are drawn , but influenced by a laudable desire to champion their cause , has idealized his portraits , and demands a little more pity than we care to bestow on persons not made like as we are . At times , however , all trace of overdrawing disappears , and we involuntarily yield the sympathy no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel show Mr. Nevinson at his best , and his best is admirable .
