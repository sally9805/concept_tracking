By Samuel Eliot . THE sketch here attempted is one of character rather than biography . Its subjectisa personality . But as some of its readers may desire a thread of dates as helping them to read it , a few are recorded at the outset . William Hickling Prescott , son of William and Catherine Green ( Hickling ) , was born in Salem , May 4 , 1796 . At the age of sixteen , being then an undergraduate in Harvard College , he lost the sight of the left eye and the free use of his right eye , from a blow inflicted by a piece of bread thrown , not at him , but at mere hazard , in a Commons Hall frolic . No other event in his life was more influential than this calamity ; and those who knew anything about him knew of the effect which it produced on all his pursuits . Nor does any other event illustrate more vividly the generosity of his spirit , for he knew from whom the blow came , and though no expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , and an opportunity of helping the person who did it was nobly improved in later life . After much suffering and confinement , Prescott went abroad , returning when twenty-one years old , wrote an article for the North American Review , but it was rejected , and he pronounced himself " a fool to send it . " On his twenty-fourth birthday he was married , and soon after came to a definite resolution of pursuing a literary career . He wrote for the North American several articles which were not rejected , while studying and composing his first history , that of " Ferdinand and Isabella , " published at Christmas , 1837 , 515 and immediately successful . " The Conquest of Mexico " appeared in 1843 , " The Conquest of Peru " in 1847 , and " Philip II . " in 1854 and 1858 . His first attack of apoplexy was early in 1858 , his second and fatal one on Jan. 28 , 1859 , at the age of sixty-two . One may be remembered as a writer , and forgotten as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even be actively bought and sold , issued in fresh editions , and referred to in later books on the same or kindred themes , while he himself becomes more and more shadowy , until his personality vanishes from the eyes and from the thoughts of men . This is their great loss . If the man was merely equal to his books and the books are good enough to last , he is good enough also . If he was better than they , brighter , sweeter , more human and more attractive , then his memory is all the more to be cherished , not only for his sake , but for that of the generation following him , to whom his nobler traits are capable of ministering almost as much as if he were still on the earth . At all events , the few who knew him personally can not but be moved to make him known to others as they have opportunity , and it is from an impulse of this sort that the following pages are written , not certainly Prescott 's *irthpIace at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with the hope that they may be suggestive as a sketch of a very delightful man . " If I were asked , " said a lifelong friend of Prescott , " to name the man whom I have known , whose coming was most sure to be hailed as a pleasant event by all whom he approached , I should not only place Prescott at the head of the list , but I could not place any other man near hi ...... Foremost among the qualities in his character was his universal , constant , and extreme kindness of heart , and its fitting exponent in as sweet a temper as ever man had . . . . All whom he came near felt , what he never seemed to feel , that there was , if not some renunciation of right , at least a charming forgetfulness of self in the way in which he asserted no superiority over any , but gave himself up to the companion of the moment , with the evident desire to make him as happy as he could . And his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His gayety became theirs . He came always bringing the gift of cheerfulness , and always offering it with such genuine cordiality that it was sure to be accepted and returned with increase . No wonder that he was just as welcome everywhere as sunshine . " It was not only cheerfulness that he could bring , but when tender tears were more befitting , he brought them . One of the earliest recollections of him which the present writer possesses is his standing by the window in a house of mourning , and wiping his eyes after taking his last leave of the lifeless form which he had come to assist in burying . A spirit as bright as his own had been called away , one whom he had ' greatly loved , and the sight of his deep and outpoured sorrow has been a lasting memory to the child who witnessed it , and to whom it still breathes love and tenderness from the unseen world where the early friends have long since been reunited . Here was a man ripe for joy and ripe for sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed . Surely they who shared his sympathies may wish that he may be remembered for what he was , and not simply for what he wrote . The one spot now most closely linked with him is that which he most delighted in , that which more than any other influenced him , and that in which he appeared to many of his friends more thoroughly himself , " Old Pepperell , " as he called it , " dearer to me than any other spot I call my own . " His diary , his letters , like his familiar conversation , bore continuous testimonies to his affection for this place . " I am now , " he wrote one autumn , to an English friend , " about forty miles from town , on my old family acres , which do not go back to the time of the Norman conquest , though they do to that of the aborigines . . . . It is a plain New England farm , but I am attached to it , for it is connected with the earliest recollections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around look at me with old familiar faces . " " What endears it most to me , " he wrote to another , " is that it has been the habitation of my ancestors . " The ancestors dwelling there did not go very far back . He who built the original farmhouse , and ploughed and reaped the not overprolific farm , was but the grandfather , the colonel of Eunker Hill , and after his retirement from the army a representative in the Massachusetts Legislature , and a man of wide public influence . " Will he fight ? " asked Gen. Gage of the colonel 's brother-in-law on the morning of I3unker Hill . " To the last drop of his blood , " was the reply ; and soon after , the American officer thus The Bedford Street House , Boston . // answered for was saying to his men at the redoubt , " Let us keep the works we have thrown up , and never be relieved . " A strain of kindred heroism breathes in the story of the women who put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , and , armed with muskets and pitchforks , kept guard at Jewett 's Bridge between Groton and Pepperell , arresting a traveller whom , as they found suspicious papers in his boots , they sent a prisoner to the Provincial Committee of Safety . Dear were these traditions to the historian grandson . His library in Beacon Street , Boston , contained nothing he valued more than his grandfather 's sword , crossed with the sword of his wife 's grand father , who commanded the British sloop " Falcon , " and directed his guns at the works on Bunker Hill , while the infantry were crossing in boats from Boston . But dearer still to our friend were the memories of his father , son of the colonel , and as resolute in all the trials of his profession , which was the law , and in all the public questions of his time , as any soldier ever was in war . Judge Prescott , as he was always called from middle life , was born at Pepperell , and there he was wont to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem exactly what he really was , the soul of gentleness and honor . The son loved the old place for his father 's sake , even more than for his own , and in his eyes it was like a framework to his father 's life . About a year before the old man died , he had at Pepperell a paraalytic stroke from which he never entirely recovered . It was then that the son wrote one of the most touching tributes ever paid to a father : " It has filled me with a sadness such as but one other event of my life ( the death of a little daughter ) ever caused ; for he has always been a part of myself ; to whom I have confided every matter of any moment ; on whose superior judgment I have relied in all affairs of the least consequence ; and in whose breast I have been sure to find ready sympathy in every joy and sorrow . I have never read any book of merit without discussing it with him , and his noble example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances and perplexities of life . " Of the wife of this man , the mother of the historian , the friend of all his friends , the friend of the poor in Boston as in Pepperell , a woman of the brightest nature , full of spirit , quaint in her speech , quick to see failings , but very compassionate towards them , in whom great gayety , great charity , and great dutifulness were singularly mingled , we have no portrait from the son 's pen . But he delighted in her as every one who knew them could see and hear whenever with them ; and when she died , midway between her husband 's death and her son s , his gratitude to her blended with his grief for her in affecting expression . Hers was not so lifelong an association with Pepperell as her husband 's , whose birthplace it had been , but next to him she was its ornament while she lived , and its precious memory when she died . The three of whom mention has been made are enough to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to explain the peculiar love he bore to their dwelling-place , and the peculiar power it seemed to exert upon him . There , Judge WWiam Prescott . // though not there only , he shone out , not the famous author so much as the cheery head of the household , the husband , the father , the host , the friend . Conventionalities dropped off . All that might possibly veil him , even transparently , in other pl:ces , was blown away , as may be said , by the country breezes . While the studies for a history , or the composition of it , might be going on for part of the day , these labors no longer seemed the principal interest . It was the enjoyment of the family , and the friends forming a portion of the family ; it was the drive or the walk under the bright sky of autumn , the season which was usually spent at Pepperell ; it was the gay dinner , perfectly informal , and for the most part without a single distinguished guest to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued late , sometimes with readings , but oftener , and more delightfully , with games and songs ; the songs either sentimental or jovial , but always of the olden time , the games old or new , but hilarious to the last degree . There was one game which he particularly enjoyed and constantly called for , if it did not come of itself . It was named Albano , because brought by some young friends who had played it in Rome , and was merely another form of Puss in the Corner . The names of places which the different players took , and to which they were obliged to respond by running as soon as called , were from the four quarters of the globe , but that which he chose , and which was never cried but with a sort of tumult , was Nissitisset , the stream flowing fast by the farm . Most of the voices then raised in joyous shouts are hushed , and not one of the surviving forms can dart from one side of a room to another now ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and it seems as if we could not rest till we were deep in the game once more . No one went deeper into it than our host , the prince of frolickers , as every one of us thought him . In an article he wrote on Lockhart 's Scott , he used words as applicable to himself as to his subject : " If the report of travellers be true , we Americans , at least The Prescott House at Pepperell. // the New-Englanders , are too much perplexed with the cares and crosses of life to afford many genuine specimens of bonkommie . However this may be , we all doubtless know some such character whose shining face , the index of a cordial heart , radiant with beneficent pleasure , diffuses its own exhilarating glow wherever it appears . " And again : " Give me an honest laugher , ' said Scott . His manners , free from affectation or artifice of any sort , exhibited the spontaneous movements of a kind disposition , subject to those rules of good breeding which Nature herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prescott to Scott , or Pepperell to Abbotsford , there are certainly some points of strong resemblance . Every one with grateful memories of the American home may be glad that it has nothing of the painful traits which marked the Scotch one , and he may be glad also that hospitality , kindness , and mirth were as characteristic of the one as of the other . He had two seashore houses , one at Nahant , which he shared with his father and mother , and another at Lynn , for which he forsook Nahant after his mother 's death . He liked Nahant , where he spent parts of twenty-five summers , and yet he disliked it . He thought it relieved the dyspepsia from which he suffered , and found it favorable for exercise , chiefly in the saddle , and for historical labors . But it was too much of a watering place to suit him in the long run . He had more visitors than he liked , especially of a kind he could not escape in the neighborhood of a hotel then visited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , " in a sort of whirligig , - company morning , noon , and night . " One day there came an Englishwoman with a title , and settled herself for what has since been known as an interview . She proved free and easy in expressing her opinions , and among others , those she had formed about the use of English in America . One of the words she thought perverted here was snarl , which ought not , she insisted , be made to mean confusion or tangle . " What , " said her rather weary host , " do n't you say your ladyship 's hair is in a snarl ? " As her ladyship 's hair was in exactly that condition , the question was apt , but unfortunate . He had a way of saying things that had better not have been said , and his wife 's constant watchfulness over lapses of this sort was often in vain . " What have I said ? " he would ask with a puzzled air , and so lay additional stress upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One evening at a small party he asked what was the name to avoid in addressing a lady recently separated from her husband . Let us call it Boylston , and the maiden name she had resumed , Beacon . " Not Boylston , but Beacon , " he was told , " and Beacon is perfectly familiar to you , so that you ca n't miss it " ; whereupon he instantly crossed the room , and exclaimed , " Mrs. Boylston , I 'm glad to meet you ! " So , one day , a lovely bride from the South , who desired to see nothing in Boston so much as him and his library , was introduced at an hour he had appointed . Before she came he had been drilled in calling her , let us say Newbury , but the sight of her seemed to drive the sound away , and she was Mrs. Newburg , Mrs. Newton , Mrs. Newell , anything but Mrs. Newbury , while she stayed . Approach to the Prescott Houoe , Pepperell. // The library which the stranger had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , to which he moved from Bedford Street , after his father 's death . That removal seemed strange for him to make . With his historic bent , one would William H. Prescott . FROM RICHMOND 'S CRAYON , OWNRO BY THR EARL OF CARLYLR. have supposed he would cling to the old home , beneath beautiful trees and in a quiet neighborhood , sacred with his father 's presence , and with that of the daughter whom he had lost from sight many years before , while it was memorable to him for his studies of more than twenty years , and his early triumphs as a historian . But , like most of us , he would not linger in the paternal house , and almost made haste to transfer himself to a more modern dwelling in the then fashionable quarter . This he enlarged by an addition in which his library and study were generously provided for , and in these rooms he spent most of his working hours in Boston during the remainder of his life . The new home was full of hospitality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the familiar guests the change was not altogether for the better , and one can not but conjecture that the historian often found that a charm had vanished from his town house , which no number of distinguished visitors or elaborate dinners could replace . Whatever it lost in contrast with the old-fashioned delightsomeness of Bedford Street , it was still a very attractive house , and most of all to those who were privileged to enter it on easy terms . A warm welcome was always given , and as years went by , and the house took on the wonted look of one long occupied , it ceased to be compared with any other , and fulfilled its own office as a handsome and yet wholly unostentatious residence for its owner and his family . lie greatly enjoyed . the hospitalities he received at the hands of his friends . " One of the most remarkable traits , " said a friend who knew him from youth , " was his singular capacity of enjoyment . " How he showed it all his life , and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember him ; but no description brings it back more vividly than one by a very near friend , printed in George Ticknor 's well-known biography : " It was a party so small that it hardly deserved the name . Prescott and two intimate friends , besides myself and my family , were all who filled a small round table . . . . From the beginning he was in one of his most lively and amusing moods . The ladies were induced by it to linger longer at the table than usual . When they had left , the whole company was reduced to only a party of four , but of very old friends , each of whom was stored with many reminiscences of like occasions , running far back into younger days . Prescott overflowed with the full tide of mirth belonging to those days . It was a gush of rare enjoyment . After nearly five years , the date at which I write , I can not recall a thing that was said . Probably nothing was said in itself worth recalling , nothing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that quicl&amp;wittedness , lively repartee , sparkling humor , exceeding vaive/e* , and droll manner of saying droll things , for which he was so remarkable when he let himself out with perfect freedom , were brought into full play . // And then he laughed as he only could laugh , at next to nothing when he was in one of these moods , and made us inevitably laugh too . " He was full of friendship . It mattered nothing whether one were known or unknown , a favorite of society or the reverse , old or young , grave or gay , he was cherished from the moment he became a friend , he and his children after him . Some of those he most enjoyed are unmentioned in the only real biography we have of him , while of persons whom it does mention , and whose letters it gives , there was more than one whom Prescott did not and could not admit to any intimacy . The writer recalls friends whom the world at large never heard of , but whose names were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of Prescott 's age , a near neighbor both to Bedford Street and to the cottage at Nahant , of abounding sympathy and never-failing kindliness , was like a playmate to the historian when they met , and their faces and voices alike expressed their pleasure in being together . " What have you got for dinner to-day ? " one would shout from his Nahant piazza to the other , and the reply would often gleefully boast of something rare which the inquirer would make fun over in rejoinder . Another friend , a woman , young enough to be the historian 's daughter , as gentle and lovely a being as was known in Boston society , interested and delighted him as hardly any did outside of his own family . It was a pleasure to took upon them when together , he half fatherly , half cavalierlike , and she smiling with the gratification which his invariable goodness invariably gave . They were once seated side by side in a box at the opera , and when approached as the curtain fell upon an extremely sentimental song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were found to be in tears , " my opera tears , " the historian used to call them . The list of his friends , men and women and children all unknown to fame , might be much extended . Let us at least revive the recollection of his loyalty to those whom othe*s around him , others whom he deeply valued , cast away for public or private reasons , but to whom he clung , determined that no outside storms should ruffle the still waters of his kindly feeling . We used to wonder at his forbearance . All who have spoken of him with any care dwell upon his regular habits . One of his secretaries wrote " There was a uniformity , regularity , and order in his mode of living that I have never seen equalled by any other man . One day was very much the counterpart of another ; and I sometimes thought he had reduced life to such a system , and regulated his every action so much by rule , that there was danger of merging volition in a mechanical clockwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts : " Nothing was The Pepperell House , east side . The Nissitisset River , Pepperell. // omitted , however trifling . For example , when out walking he bought an apple , an extra from a newsboy , a pair of gloves , and gave a quarter to a beggar , whom he judged to be really in want , down they would go on his return : apple , * newspaper , 2 ; gloves , $i ; charity , 25 . Generally , however , the smallest expenditures were lumped together . " The same system prevailed in all his habits . " His walks at Nahant , " writes the last-quoted secretary , " never varied . In the morning and evening , unless it was stormy , he walked through the main street to the long beach , turning back when he reached a certain rock . In the middle of the day , or when the mornings were hot , he resorted to a meadow where there were trees enough to give some shade , and paced backward and forward a certain number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , he would put on his hat , take his cane , and walk on the veranda . Several times during the summer , when the hour of intermission from twelve to one arrived , the weather was so stormy that neither of us cared to go forth , even to the veranda . On these occasions he would put on his hat , take his cane , and opening the door of the study , walk briskly to and fro across the room and along the adjoining entry . " The entire day , indeed one may say the entire year , was mapped out with great definiteness . Such an hour for rising , such hours for meals and exercise , such for reading and writing , and the reading and writing themselves carefully divided among newspapers , novels , general literature , special works , and manuscripts , or among letters , reviews , and the history upon which he was employed . His secretary or his wife would be reading a novel aloud . It began and ended within the prescribed time , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In vain the reader , or some other listeners besides the historian , might plead for keeping on , were it only long enough to get through a love scene , or see where a crisis would end , he was gayly inexorable . His clothing and his diet were all regulated by careful rules . Many a time has he been heard to tell with laughter how he had been called in the morning , and informed of the weather by the weight of the trousers , he should put on ; so many ounces if it were warm , so many if it were cold ; and his wardrobe , at least the outer part of it , was known to him and his attendant , not by material or cut , but by what each piece might weigh . His shoes were a peculiar feature , as he always had a singularly large number in readiness for use , and these , too , were graded with precision . He was bent on keeping to the same round in all his ways , to the same walks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same arrangement of pens , papers , and the wired frame he used in writing . Method was law to him . Yet he broke it , and not infrequently . Though the condition of his health required caution in eating and drinking , he had a theory that occasional want of caution was a good thing . It was often more than occasional . " How can you eat that , William ? " his wife would exclaim ; hut he laughed away her warning , and went on with what was almost sure to trouble him . An early travelling companion of his used to tell this story . Prescott had been advised by a Paris physician never to take more than two C The Villa at Lynn . // curious scheme of penalties which he glasses of wine a day . He promised qwq in the least degree unbecoming a gentleman . Who that ever sat at his table , or entertained him as a guest , but was delighted at the ease with which he gently broke his vows of abstinence and shared the feast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more mirthful to see the smiles and hear the jests by which he would have excused himself . We may linger awhile on this apparent contradiction , that while he was always under rule , he was sometimes above it . The contradiction was more than apparent . It came out not only in the trivial round , but in the great purposes of his life . He was industrious , and yet indolent . He loved work , and yet shrank from it . When beginning a new subject or a fresh chapter , he would linger long , " loafing , " as he sometimes said , and yielding not to enthusiasm for his theme , not to desire of service , but to a but I ca n't make up my mind yet to sit in my un-easy chair , and be read to in outlandish gibberish at the rate of an octavo a week . Were I well entered , I Prescott 's Boston House , 55 Bescos Street . THE PRESCOTT HOU5E IS THE LEFT OF THE TWIN HOUSES IN THE CENTRE OF THE PICTURE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't make up my mind to undertake such a huge subject as Philip II . blindfold . " This extract shows that infirmity of sight entered largely into the irresolution of the historian ; and there are many reasons for wondering how , with such an infirmity , he could ever be other than irresolute . But it remains true that he was often a prey to long periods of what one hesitates to call idleness , perhaps it would be fairer to say repose . In this frame of mind he found it very hard to rouse himself . His ambition was dormant , his wish for praise or for the profits of a fresh publication , to which he was never insensible , was suspended , and he was once more the gentleman of leisure that he had been in early manhood , rather than the laborious scholar of succeeding years . His lifelong friend , from whose recollections this paper has already borrowed , speaks of " the beginning , " even in college days , of " a process of frequent self- examination and moral selfcontrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all example that has come under my observation in cases of like constitutional tendency . It was , I conceive , the truly great point of his moral character , and the chief foundation of all he accomplished in after life as a literary man ; a point which lay always concealed to transient observers under lightness and gayety of manner . " Here , then , in the under currents of his natute , we must find the strength and resolution which were not always on the surface , but which evidently had an existence somewhere , or his whole life would have been another from what it was . The story has been told more than once , but it may be told again , of what his mother said when she revisited the house where the family resided when her son , then a youth of nineteen , was confined for months with a rheumatic affection which began in the right eye that had been injured when the left was destroyed , a year or two before at college . " This is the very room , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so many months in utter darkness . In all that trying season , when so much had to be endured , and our hearts were ready to fail us for fear , 1 . never in a single instance groped my way across the apartment to take my place at . his side , that he did not salute me with some hearty expression of good cheer , . al if we were the patients , and it was his . place to comfort us . " Such fortitude at such a time may be believed to have been the groundwork of his character , nor could it ever fail him in the comparatively slighter ailments of after life . Notwithstanding all that has been touched upon , it should be perfectly clear that here was a man of strength , not of weakness , of prevailing energy , of dominant sense of duty . What he was in youth , that he was also in manhood and on the brink of old age . Old age and he , however , can hardly be associated . He was sixty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least until the attack which came the year preceding his death . " A gentleman from Paris , " he wrote a week after his Bust of Prescott , by Greessugh. // sixty-first birthday , " who called on me this morning was polite enough to say he did not believe I was older than forty-five . So I shall take sixteen years off . " It was not the outer man only who retained his freshness . His spirit was singularly youthful . He thought and spoke as few men of fifty or sixty retain the power of doing . The young were his chosen companions , his children 's friends were his friends , and they associated with him as with one of their own age , not from the least want of respect , for their respect was heightened by his willingness to be as one of them . " I must be permitted , " said his classmate , President Walker , a few days after his death , " to say one thing which was true of him from the first to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have never known one so little changed by the conventionalities of society , and the hard trial of success and prosperity . At college , and on the morning of the day he died , he was the same in his dispositions , the same in his outward manners , the same in his habits of thought and feeling , the same to a remarkable degree even in his attitudes and looks . " And as he was unchanged so he was unspoiled . Fame seemed to have no power over him . He shed all its evil influences , as his Nahant cliffs shed their breakers , and showed a simplicity utterly impenetrable . That he enjoyed his great success , its commonplaces as well as its higher ranges , was a matter of course . But they could not harm him ; they could not make him pretentious or proud ; they could not infuse the smallest strain of envy or censoriousness into his thoughts or words ; they could not take away one charm from the simple and unconscious elevation of his character . As one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were continually finding expression , especially in intercourse with young people , the one line that seems to describe him best is the poet 's , - " Nor lose the childlike in the largcr mind . " A few words more must be said about his playfulness . It has been already touched upon , and more than once , but we have not quite done with it . His secretary relates that when he was beginning to describe a battle , he would often hum , to arouse , as he declared , his military ardor , the air of " 0 give me but my Arab steed " It is an illustration of many similar ways . His daughter-in-law remembers a scene at Pepperell with one of the old friends , a friend of many others also , Isaac P. Davis , Uncle isaac as he was familiarly called . Mr. Davis was deaf , and made no secret of it . Mr. Prescott said he himself was quite as deaf , and there was a deal of fun over the competition between them . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter after they left the table . So she hung an old-fashioned watch of enormous size on a hook at the end of the room , and bade her husband and his rival in deafness walk abreast towards it , in order to prove which should first hear its ticking . They started with great solemnity . At every step Prescott would ask , " Do you hear it , Davis ? " and each time the answer was , " No . " When nearly up to the watch , Prescott 's face changed , and turning to his wife with a smile that soon expanded to laughter , he cried out , " Susan , the thing is n't going . " This , too , is a specimen of numerous passages like it . More touching , more pathetic , is the playfulness of the last words he ever spoke to his wife , when she recalled a name he and his sister had both forgotten , " How came you to remember ? " and with a laugh and a snap of the fingers he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blow which proved fatal . It is no part of this sketch to describe , or attempt to describe , the historian ; but it must refer to the historian 's purposes in order to attain to any descrip Prescott 's Study . // tion of the man . " Gentle Sir Philip Sidney , " wrote Thomas Nash , " thou knewest what belonged to a scholar ; thou knewest what pains , what toil , what travail conduct to perfection . " All this Prescott knew and practised . More than all this , however , is needed to acquaint us with him , and with the spirit in which this bustling , money-getting world , who takes an interest in my peculiar pursuits . " In 1835 he records : " There is no happiness so great as that of a permanent and lively interest in some intellectual labor , to say nothing of the comfortable consciousness of directing my powers in some channel worthy of them , UNDERNEATH THE CHURCH IS PRESCOTT S TOMB . he labored . He was the last man to boast himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but from time to time he said something quite modestly and naturally from which we can gather his ideals . " You are the only friend I know , " he writes to George Ticknor in 1824 , " in and of contributing something to the stock of useful knowledge in the world . " In i 844 he writes " I feel as if my studies , family , and the sight of a few friends would answer all my desires , and best keep alive the best source of happiness in me , - literary ambition , not the Zr --  I - // mere ambition of fame , - I have obtained that , - but of advancing the interest of humanity by the diffusion of useful truth . " Such in his own words , which might be multiplied , were his ends . The means he used , apart from merely literary or historical considerations , were of an open-minded character . John Quincy Adams said to one of Prescott 's secretaries that " he possessed the two great qualifications of an historian , who should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the history should not show the political or religious bias of the historian . " On the proper standard of historic judgment , Prescott wrote , in relation to a review of his " Conquest of Mexico " : " The immorality of the act and of the actor seem to me two very different things ; and while we judge the one by the immutable principles of right and wrong , we must try the other by the fluctuating standard of the age ; the real question is whether a man was sincere , and acted according to the lights of his age . " One more extract may be enough to complete this outline of personal traits , as they are found in his authorship ; it was written when he had finished his " Ferdinand and Isabella , " but before its publication : " What do I expect from it , now it is done ? I do not flatter myself with the idea that I have achieved anything very profound , or , on the other hand , that will be very popular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . I know the public too well , and the subject I have chosen , to expect the latter . But I have made a book illustrating an unexplored and important period , from authentic materials obtained with much difficulty , and probably in the possession of no one library , public or private , in Kurope . As a plain , veracious record of facts , the work therefore , till some one else shall be found to make a better one , will fill up a gap in literature which , I should hope , would give it a permanent value . " Remembering not only what manner of work was thus humbly spoken of ; but what the emptiness of American historical literature was at the time , more than half a century ago , we may draw safe inferences as to the temper and the principle of the writer . In Prescott 's histories there is not much of himself . His tastes , his love of adventure and romance , his admiration of lofty natures , and his great forbearance towards base ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subject , these and other traits are there ; but after all , one would be puzzled about his personality , if there were no other knowledge of him than could be found in his pages . In nothing is there a greater puzzle , or a greater contrast between him and his works , than their subjects , if we except Ferdinand and Isabella . Mexico , Peru , and Philip II . are themes which it would seem as if his gentle and compassionate disposition would have shrunk from , nor does his disposition appear in anything like its natural strength as he proceeds with all sorts of sanguinary details . He had just completed a chapter in his " Peru , " when he wrote of it in his diary : " As good , I suppose , as the raw material will allow , it is not cloth of gold by a long shot ! " Like Don Roderick : - " He climbed into a hilltop the highest he could see , Thence all about of that wide rout his last long look took he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts of Spain ; But all were fled except the dead , and who could count the slain ? Where'er his eye could wander , all bloody was the plain . " Of course there are many peaceful domains within his realm , where the descriptions of scenery , the analysis of institutions , and the portraits of men and women with whom he could profoundly sympathize , reveal more of himself than the narrative of conquests , or any deeds of violence could show forth ; yet even in these there is not very much personality . He has been thought , especially in later years , to have been a recluse . Public affairs never drew him into an active participation in them , nor was he much interested in such as concerned a party or a politician , rather than the country . But when a crisis , or something like it , came and men were moved for the sake of principle , and not merely // for that of partisan or selfish aims , he entered into it . Let the following letter to an Englishwoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had most alarming doings here lately in the fugitive slave line . . . . A regiment of the militia was called out , the streets in certain quarters were closed against passengers , and swords and muskets were flashing in our eyes as if we had been in a state of siege . I am rather of the conservative order , you know , but I assure you it made my blood boil to see the good town placed under martial law so unceremoniously for no other purpose than to send back a runaway negro to his master . It is a disagreeable business at any time , and it was only a strong conviction of the claims which the South had on us by virtue of the Constitution which made us one nation , that induced our people , as I suppose you know , to sign the famous Compromise Act of 1850 . But the Nebraska Bill , which I suppose you know all about , as you allude to it in your letter , looks to us so much like double dealing in the matter , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own part of the contract . Then the thing was carried here with such a rash hand . The town was turned over to the military by the mayor . . - . Every petty captain of a militia corps was left to act at his own discretion . In one case the guns were levelled to fire on the multitude without any notice to warn the people of their danger ; and it was by a mere accident that a bloody fray did not take place , which , if once begun , would have put us in mourning for many a day . Old Boston has rather a relish for rebellion , and when it lay in the path , as it seemed to do here , it required some restraining grace not to pick it up . . . . I am told the government was quite willing we should dip our fingers in rebellion . It knows it can not have any support , and for that reason would be very glad to put us in the wrong with the rest of the country . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Free Soil or Abolition , is so near akin to them that they can all work in the same harness . " And in that harness he went to the polls , broke with the political traditions of his life , and voted for Fremont in 1856 . He had a moderate share in the institutions to which Bostonians like him are apt to devote themselves . His most effective service was rendered to the School for the Blind , of which he may be called one of the founders , and for which he wrote an article on the education of the blind . With this work he naturally had more sympathy than with any other of an educational or charitable nature . He took an interest , though not an active one , in the Athen*eum , and wrote an account of the attempt made in 1853 to sink that proprietary library in the Public Library : " We have had a little excitement in our Commonwealth from this proposal . . . . Showers of missiles were let off on one side and the other in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , of the members , over six hundred , when a vast deal of patriotic glow was exhibited in favor of the timehonored institution , and after some sparring it was unanimously voted not to give up the old ship . I could not but think , if a subscription paper had made its appearance , how soon the hall would have been cleared of those zealous friends of the institution . I was one of those who could not make up their minds to throw open the doors to the many headed . " The ironical touch in these words , perfectly good-natured , and without any assumption of superiority , is very characteristic of his way of looking at public movements . He was apt to stand on the brink , and smile at the fervor of those who plunged in , often , as he thought , without knowing what they were after , and almost always in an excitement which he regarded as unaccountable . He would ask the same question , if not in the same words with Emerson s " Why so hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " He never aspired to become the representative of a new movement or a new idea . He was content to be himself . " This seems entirely true . Not what is termed original or originative , not ambitious to be a leader or capable of being one , he chose his path according to his opportunities and abilities , and followed it with pauses here and there , occasionally breaking from it , yet eminently consistent on the whole . His entries in his diary , published in his biography , show him alive to his own faults , but never content with them , always resolving to get the better of them , and succeeding as well as all but the faultless can hope to do . Alive also to his own achievements , with these he was content , not because he saw no imperfection in them , but because he thought them all he could expect to reach , and so , without hungering for // more , and without a particle of envy for what others had the power to accomplish , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their experiences , and this was one of his very chief graces , high above all littleness , all irritability , all ingratitude . Is this the place to speak of him as he lived in the bosom of his family ? Perhaps not ; and surely there is no need of doing it . His biography is full of his affections . As son and brother , husband , father , and grandfather , he was the light of his household . Thinking of the numbers of men , distinguished men , who were like shadows upon those nearest them , we cast a parting glance with gladness as well as reverence on this man , to whom his home , and all within it , and all admitted to it , turned with never-shaken attachment . Fame withers , the praises of men become inaudible or perhaps cease , but the hearts which one like Prescott wins , beat on forever , and make the heavenly life more heavenly with their love . One chief source of his charm to all who knew him well was the cheerfulness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore the almost lifelong loss of sight . It was not blindness , but a ceaseless restriction , a shadow always darkening his daily occupation , always rendering him helpless as a reader without the service of other eyes than his own . Yet it was hard to believe that he was ever suffering , or that he felt the inevitable drawbacks of such impaired vision , so brightly did he bear himself . This was originally from courage , subsequently from habit , and he seldom seemed to be really sensible of his privations . We knew them , it sometimes appeared , better than he knew them himself . It was not merely that he rarely spoke of his troubles , or that he never magnified then but that they did not seem to affect him deeply . They certainly did not affect him permanently , and when we saw the quiet acquiescence , the uncomplaining use of the powers that remained to him , we had repeated proofs of the brave and happy spirit which was his crowning gift . There is no trait of his character to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmity , nay more , this simple steadiness which turned a thorn into a flower .
