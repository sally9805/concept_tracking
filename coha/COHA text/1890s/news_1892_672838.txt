txt The investigation of the attack upon the Baltimore 's sailors is still in progress before the Judge of Crime in Valparaiso , but there is very little hope that It will result in a manner satisfactory to the United States Government . A number of Chileans have been arrested , and a half dozen of theta have been identified as having been engaged in the assault on the sailors . The Commission of Surgeons appointed by the court has also agreed that Riggin , one of the Baltimore 's victims , was shot with a rifle and not with a revolver , which is a practical admission that the shooting was done uy a policeman , although no policemen have yet been identified as assailants . Cant : ichley has informed the Navy Department of a fact which has just come to his knowledge . A German physician who lives in Valparaiso says that he saw Riggin shot by a police officer . lie went into a drug store where Riggin was taken to see if be could assist him , and two policemen were present at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they would get into trouble for having shot the sailor . The policemen replied that it made no differentia , as the man was only a ? Yankee . and they intsnded to shoot more of them . Efforts are boiug made now to have this testimony produced in court . An unfortunate circumstance occurred a week ago in connection with this investigation which the Judge of the court lost no opportunity in using to the disadvantage of the Americans . Two of the Baltimore 's sailors who had testified before the court were excused for afew hours , with instructions to return and sign their testimony , which was to be written out in the meantime . When the men returned to the court they were intoxicated , and the ollieer who wits present and had been occupied in the courtroom assured the Judge that the men weal , : be severely punished aboard the ship for the mark of disrespect . But on the foie wing day the Judge took occasion to write a long letter to the Intendente of Valparaiso , in which he recited the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishing the men , and thou concluded his letter by asserting that this incident was a very fair indication that the disturbance on ( let . It% in which two of the Baltimore 's sailors were killed and eighteen others were wounded , was duo to the same causes , thus intimating that the whole affair was merely a drunken fight among the sailors . This letter was given to the newspapers of Valparaiso for publication . and they all published comments anon it freely , ineuenciug public opluion by criticising the attitude talten by the United States in the matter . The Judge wrote this letter while the investigation was in progress before hint . He will be obliged to deliver his official decision of the case very soon , but Americans here consider that he has already outlined his decision in this open intimation that the trouble was due to the drunkenness of the American sailors .

This Judge is a man named Foster , and he is a soil of Julio Foster . who is now iu the United States , and who has been indulging in free criticisms of the conduct of American officials in Chile . The mails from Now-York arrived here three days ago . bringing American newspapers up to Nov . I. containing numerous publications in regard to the attack upon the Baltimore 's sailors and the Chilean situation generally . The tone of the American press has created considerable consternation here , and the local newspapers are publishing translations of the principal articles . It is believed that they will have a decided effect in influencing public opinion here , and at least they have directed attention to the possible action of the United States Congress in regard to Chilean affairs . Thu principal attention has been directed to the attitude of President Harrison . as expressed in the publications in several American papers , and there ie it great desire to learn what he may have to say upon .
