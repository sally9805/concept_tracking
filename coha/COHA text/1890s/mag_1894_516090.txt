BY P0ULTNEY BIGELOW. 4 ' -4 RUSSIA has more than a third of all the Jews in the world , and she is doing her best to reduce this number . Official statistics are not quite reliable on this subject , but it is assumed by the bestinformed that Russia must have close on to 3,000,000 of the Hebrew race . The United States and England are shocked by the measures which the Czar is taking against these people , and charge him with reviving religious persecution . The Czar replies to this by pointing out that the United States deliberately closed its doors against emigration from China , whose subjects were represented in America to the extent of only about 100,000 souls , mostly upon the Pacific coast . In this matter , moreover , the Czar moves in harmony with the overwhehning majority of his people , high and low ; and were his people to-morrow to proclaim a republic , VOL . LXXXVJTJ. - No. 526-57 one of the few laws which it would not repeal would be that which excludes the Jew from Holy Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and is therefore better qualified to legislate on the subject . The general outhurst of indignation which greeted the anti-Jewish legislation of Russia since the accession of the present Czar may be accounted for in many ways . The newspapers and banks of Europe are largely in Jewish hands , and this power was of course quickly evoked to create public sympathy for their persecuted co-religionists . The popular sentiment was , however , most intelligent and most effective in the countries immediately bordering upon Russia , whose people wasted little time in theorizing on the rights of man or the beauties of tolerance , but organized with a view of protecting themselves against an influx of unwelcome immigrants . Castle Garden is not the only point to which the Jew of Russia has fled for comfort . He is equally keen in his desire to find a home in western Europe , where he can live in towns , pursue his life as broker , and not be too far away from the headquarters of his religious inspiration . America , England , France , Spain , Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comparatively speaking , and they are pretty well distributed . The stranger walking down Broadway , guided by the signs over the shops of jobbers and importers , might conclude that the Jews own New York , yet what we have is a mere nothing to what one country of Russin alone - Poland - has , whose Jewish population , according to the last census , was about 800,000 . In England , Jews are met in every walk of life-in the army , the diplomatic service , the cabinet , the House of Lords , and amongst the boon companions of England 's future King . As with us , they have cast off every distinguishing badge of their race , and it is frequently only by accident that we learn the nature of their religious creed . in Russia , however , it is totally different . There the Jew is as distinct a type as is with us the negro or the Chinaman . You can distinguish him as far as you can see , not merely by the face and form , so // graphically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home , but in certain peculiarities of dress , to which he clings as pertinaciously as does the Apache to his blanket or the Mexican to his sombrero . The Jew of Kovno , Warsaw , Kiev , and wherever else Ihave run across him in Russia , wears a curious curl that hangs down in front of each ear , sometimes to his chin . His cap of black alpaca or cloth sits far back on his head , close to his ears , with a visor as large as those once fashionable amongst our brakemen and conductors . His coat of black cloth or alpaca is modelled after that in which Dundreary is usually portrayed , reaching down to his ankles , and assisting to give him the long , lean , hungry look of the Shylock type . On his feet are boots worn outside of his trousers , in one hand an umbrella , in the other a valise ; for the Jew in Russia is usually moving from place to place on business , unless he is so poor as to be forced into menial occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , but a thoroughly practical man of affairs , told me that next to the Jew 's love of money was his devotion to the Talmud and its expounders . Strange as it may seem to us , who think of the Jew as wandering into all the corners of the world , guided solely by the desire of making money , we find that , on the contrary , he is fastened to Russia by the holiest of ties , that he wears his peculiar dress as proudly as a Highlander does his kilt , and that he does everything in his power to remain at home and discourage others from leaving . To draw the orthodox Jew , educated in the school of the Talmud , away from the centre of his religions education , if not inspiration , is to him a serious matter . We propose to place before the inquiring reader a short sketch of the manner in which the Jew is regarded to-day by those who dread his westward migration , and to brine , together some of the reasons put forward by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia has limited the territory in which Jews are allowed to live to a narrow strip , beginning in the Baltic provinces near Riga , and ending at the Black Sea , following , roughly , the western frontier of the empire , along the borders of Prussia , Austria , Hungary , and Roumania . These four countries  --  or rather three , if we regard Austria and Hungary as oneknow more of the Jews by actual contact than any other people ; for , according to the last census on the subject , there were in Austro - Hungary 1,643,708 ; German Empire , 567,884 ; Roumania , 400,000 . The same census gave for Great Britain and Ireland only 46,000 Jews ; France , 49,439 ; Norway , only 34 ; Spain , 402 . In fact , as compared with Russia 's neighbors , the n umber of Jews in other countries is hardly worth mentioning . The Chinese question in America was settled with reference purely to the Chinaman as he was known in California , and did not take into consideration the best class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew from his stand-point as it affects himself personally , and not from the stand-point of an Englishman or an American , who has in view Jews of a nobler type . The Jew of Russia shades off into the Polish Jew , then into the German Jew , and it is a mixture of these two that is now besieging Castle Garden for American citizenship . How many Jews emi*rate from Russia every year is not known , for large numbers smuggle themselves over the frontier , and are most difficult to identify , because of the similarity in feature and dress of all the Chosen People along this Jewish strip . When I was in Kovno I came in contact with a Jew who told rue that his whole business in life was smuggling his co-rehigionists out of the country at a fixed price per head . The present alleged persecution of the Jews in Russia consists not so much in the making of offensive regulations against them as in enforcing laws of long standing , which the Jews have evaded by the assistance of the police , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited Jews in general from settling in Russia proper , exception being made only in certain cases , covering artists , scholars , physicians , and specially privileged merchants . But so clever were the Jews in manipulating the officials , or , perhaps it is equally true to say , so greedy were the officials for an addition to their scanty salary , that in all the towns of Russia proper Jews had notoriously congregated who were theoretically outlaws . Moscow and St. Petersburg , for instance , had each as many as 40,000 contrabands of this description . The Jews must have been a // source of great profit to the officials , or they would not have been so long tolerated ; and , on the other hand , there must have been large opportunities for making money , or this race would riot have exposed itself to so many dangers and sacrifices by placing itself in a position to be periodically raided by the police . That the Jews are now being forced to conform to the law of Russia is an indication not merely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that the financial burdens laid upon the Jews in Russia are greater than they are willing to bear ; in other words , they are too poor to purchase the immunity of former years . " Why do you hate the Jew ? " I one day asked my Russian friend . " Because , " said he , " the Jew brings nothing into the country , he takes all lie can out of it , and while he is here lie makes the peasant his slave , arid lives only for the sake of squeezing money out of everything . " This was a strong statement , but lie went on to amplify it by a variety of illustrations . After the Polish insurrection of 1863 , the Russian government set to work energetically to russify that country , and particularly Lithuania . The principal means they employed , aside from actively persecuting the heterodox in religion arid politics , was to colonize large numbers of peasants from the interior of Russia upon farms which had been confiscated . Agricultural implements were fn rnished to these peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to form a nucleus of Russian life in the midst of the disloyal provinces . Twenty years have passed since this great russifying measure was put into force , and what is the result ? If , as a traveller , you come into a Russian village , it is dirtier , if possible , than those of the neighboring Lithuanians and Poles . You ask for horses to continue your journey , and are quickly supplied by these Russians ; the price is fixed , and you are about to pay it to the Russian who brings your carriage to the door . He , however , refuses to take it , and begs that you will pay the money not to him , but to the proprietor of the tavern . You ask why . He answers that he is not allowed to take any money , that the horses he has brought belong to the Jew . You begin to inquire , and you find that the Jew not only owns the tavern , but trades in all the articles which the peasants have to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly every peasant for miles around , and has a lien upon everything which that peasant may grow upon his land . You find that the peasant cnltiyates his land not for himself , but for the Jew , and that all his reward is the privilege of bare existence . There are many patriotic and humane Russians who have given it to me as their deliberate opinion that the Russian peasant would be better off to-day had he never been emancipated . He is dreamy , good-natured , unpractical , and very ignorant . When he is hard pressed for money , it is only too easy for him to accept the loan which the accommodating tavernkeeper offers him , particularly if he has one or two glasses of vodka inside of him . Like a child , he thinks little of the ultimate consequences and much of the present enjoyment . He signs the paper which is placed before Ii im , and believes , of course , that he will easily pay off his debt with the next harvest , particularly as the Jew promises to be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends , of course , the produce of his farm to the Jew , who acts as broker for him , and reserves his commission , and what he is pleased to consider the interest on his money ; and by some mysterious method of calculation the peasant is always the debtor , and the Jew always happy to accommodate him still further on the same terms . As my Russian friend explained the situation , it reminded me forcibly of several statements of the same kind made to me in Georgia and Alabama a few years ago , where I visited some friends , who knew the condition of their communities very well , and were in no sense Jew-haters . There I was told that the freedom which the Northern States had purchased for the negro at the cost of so much blood and treasure hind been since sold to the Jew . The . same Jews who had learned to play upon human nature by intercourse with emancipated serfs , found in the Southern States exact* ly the material best suited for their purposes . The Jew opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards making himself agreeable to the negroes by // letting them have whatever they choose without paying for it . In this manner an account soon runs up , in regard to which the negro is rarely prudent enough to keep an exact tally . When it has reached a proper figure , the Jew presses for payment , and of course the ne*ro has no money . But the Jew assures the negro that nothing is further from his purpose than to do anything that might seem greedy . He waives the question of money entirely , and asks only that the negro pay him in cotton , or perhaps by handing over a mule or a cow , and by promising to continue trading at his store . This seems very magnanimous to the ne* ro , and he cheerfully signs away future crops , to say nothing of the very farm he is working . Thus the negro works from year to year , always tied to the soil by the debt he owes the Jew , and as little capable of independent action as he or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in Russia , the liberal stranger naturally asks , " Why do not the peasants themselves , or the negroes , organize their own shops , and thus protect themselves against extortion and practical slavery ? " It is a question easily asked , but the actual fact is that they do not , and that in both Russia and the United States blacks and peasants are bound to the soil by a slavery that is more galling than that they were formerly subjected to , because they are mocked with the title of free men . It was not until after the emancipation of the serfs , in 1861 , that the Jew question began to take on serious proportions ; for up to that time the peasant had , in his landlord , a protector who was able to shield him from the consequences of his improvidence . After the emancipation , however , the gulf between peasant and proprietor became as wide as that which separated the black from his former master ; and between these two classes there entered an army of Jews , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants became easy victims , owing to their improvidence and love of drink ; but the proprietors soon found that they could accomplish nothing without the assistance of the money-lender , and , above all , the only man who could control the labor market . Jews were , to be sure , not allowed to acquire real estate , but in the western provinces they took charge of landed property as agents in such a manner that they had all the substantial benefits of ownership with none of the drawbacks . All the supplies for the estate were bought of themselves and charged to the unlucky proprietor ; by their hold upon the peasants they were able to enforce labor at nomiMal rates , and nothing prevented them from exhausting the soil as rapidly as possible , cutting down all the timber , and when they had squeezed the last kopeck out of the property , moving off to some other estate and commencing the same process over again . It is to the multiplicity of such cases that we must refer some of the present distress in Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am informed on good authority that , in spite of laws to the contrary , a very large proportion of the land within the pale is practically in Jewish hands , to say nothing of the peasants who work upon it . To how great an extent this is the case is as difficult to find out as to give the exact number of Jews in Russia , for they have a direct interest in deceiving the government in regard to both of these matters , and have , so far , succeeded very weLl . A witty German once said , sneeringly , of the Russians , that " every nation is afflicted with the sort of Jew best suited to its condition " ; but if this is true , it is the most damning verdict upon the Poles , whose Jews appear to be upon the lowest level of human existence which it has been my fortune to meet with . This aphorisrn mi*ht be l ) araphrased by saying that each country has the Chinaman best suited for it , and that therefore California should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public sentiment of Europe , at least the eastern portion of it , might have been measured in the Berlin conference after the Russo-Turkish war , when Lord Beaconsfield made his notable effort in favor of the Jews . His proposals did not fall upon sympathetic ears , and the utmost he accomplished was to cause the powers to bully Roumania into a formal recognition of the Jews as equal in citizenship with the rest of the people . But even in Roumania the law is almost a dead letter by reason of a series of regulations subsequently passed . The Roumanian to-day dreads an increase of his Jewish population almost as much as an invasion of Russian troops , and if the papers of his country cry out against Rus // sian intolerance , it is not because he sympathizes with the Jews , but because he fears lest further persecution in Russia will make it mere difficult for him to keep them out of Roumania . Germany and Austria can look on with something like ec*uanimity while isolated Jews filter across the frontiers and merge into the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerance to all creeds , but it would be hazardous to say how long this attitude can be safey maintained . Russia has not yet given the signal , but it is not beyond the realm of probability to ima me religious fanaticism so harmon* ith popular hatred as to produce a law not simply confining the Jews to Russian provinces on the western frontier , but actually expelling them by thousands and hundreds of thousands out of the country . Could Germany and Austria look with equanimity upon such an immigration into their already crowded countries ? Or , aside from governmental action , can we suppose that the people of these countries would endure such a Jewish movement with any more kindliness than was manifested in San Francisc9 towards the cargoes of Chinamen ? Germany and Austria know that Russia has an almost inexhaustible supply of this undesirable population , all living along a single strip of territory , and united by centuries of common language , traditions , and family ties to such a degree as to make them a state within a state , as much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish communities have been allowed to govern themselves according to their own peculiar laws and customs , much as the Chinese manage their own affairs in Chinatown . These peculiar privileges are now abolished , but custom and tradition amongst them , notably their religious preceptors , have so complete an ascendency over them that the effect of the Russian law upon them does not go far beyond the presence of the policeman . My Russian friend , who had given considerable attention to the history of the Jews , as well as to their present condition in Russia , called my attention to the great difference between the Jew of Russiathat is to say , the Jew who calls into existence the anti - Semitic movement in Germany  --  and his co-religionist who was driven out of Spain about the time that Columbus discovered America . The Jews of Spain , whom Ferdinand and Isabella expelled from the country , stood upon a relatively high plane of intellectual as well as material development . In that age of monkish superstition the Jews stood forth pre - eminent as masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with highly refined people , had absorbed the artistic spirit , which no one could escape who lived in the Spain of that time . The short-sighted fanaticism which drove them out into the world called forth much sympathy for them ; and the fame of their learning , particularly in the natural sciences , did much to atone for the prejudice against their money-making propensities . Then , too , these Spanish refugees did not all move to one country , nor did they come from a land that might furnish additional supplies in the future . The Jews of 1492 scattered themselves broadcast into nearly every country of western Europe , notably Italy , England , Holland , South Germany , and France . The Popes of Rome extended their protection to them , and in spite of occasional outbursts of popular ill-will , they prospered , and with their prosperity gradually took on the color of the society in which they moved , and lost correspondingly the peculiar characteristics which are so conspicuous in the Russian Jew . The Jews of four hundred years ago , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naples , Venice , Marseilles , Genoa , Rome , brought to all these cities talents which the people there knew how to appreciate . Their appearance there might almost be compared to that of the clever artisans and manufacturers who came to England and Prussia after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes-in the sense that the best people of the country regarded them as a source of economic strength . But the Jew who to-day comes from the Russian border to Berlin or Buda - Pesth represents in no sense a man of learning , or even the master of an art whose acquisition is envied by the people amongst whom he settles . He represents to them unscrupulous greed for money , a marvellous facility in deception  --  a man whose object in life seems to be to subordinate every consideration to that of material success . All England has only about as many Jews as the capital of Prussia alone , and the Jew question as it appears to the German is intensified by the reflection that the Jew // who comes to him from the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who has left behind him so vast a number of his co-religionists that if they once start upon an invasion of western Europe they will soon be in a position to dictate terms in every Christian capital . The Spanish Jew and the Russian Jew are , of course , allied , if we go back far enough ; but no Russian or German finds any comfort in reflecting upon the excellence of the Jews in the days of Columbus . His apprehension springs eatirely from observing the Jew of to-day . Said my friend to me : " Wherever the Jew has control of the press  --  and that is saying a good deal-you find that he strenuously preaches tolerance , in order that he may profit by it . To read the articles by Jews in newspapers and reviews , one would suppose that the only truly liberal spirits to-day were the members of synagogues . If you xviii take my word for it -  --  and I think I know what I am talking about-there is no church domination that can be more narrow and relentless than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who occupy both sides of the Russian frontier between the Baltic and the Black Sea . " In 1877 a Jewess named Ida Katzhandel chose to turn Roman Catholic and marry a Pole . The pair lived happily for about a year , when one fine day the relations of Ida turned up while the husband was away , took her from the house , *nd drowned her in the river Wieprz-a stream which runs into the Vistula near Ivan-Gorod . The guilty ones had taken , of course , every precaution against discovery ; but the police managed , somehow or other , to trace the crime home , and the murderers were brought to trial in Lublin about three years after the murder . Two of them were convicted ; one was sentenced to two years ' penal servitude , the other to two years ' confinement ; with regard to the remainder the evidence was so faulty that they had to be set free , although there was no doubt in the minds of the people in the neighborhood as to who had committedthis outrage . But stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this trial the space about the court-house was filled with violent Jews , who praised the murderers as martyrs to their religion , and who greeted those , who had been released as men to whom every honor was due . My Russian friend assured me that the picture of brutal fanaticism furnished by this one instance is typical of the great mass of Jews whom the German has in mind , as well as the Pussian , when he discusses the Jew question . One can scarcely conceive of gi osser religious intolerance than this in Spain of 1492 or Mexico of 1892 . It is a picture for which , I confess , I was little prepared , and it is obvious that the Jew of Lubhin has but a distant blood-relation with those who produced a philosopher like Spinoza . Russians have told me that it is almost impossible to catch the Jews for military service , owing to the facilities they enjoy of changing their domicile . The railways have been in Russia the greatest possible blessing to the Jews , in that they give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transacting business in parts of the country where they are forbidden , and disappearing with their profits to a place of safety before the government has become aware of what has happened . Forged passports are readily procured , and with these they move from point to point , sleeping on the train , and transacting their business through the day . They avoid as much as possible spending any time in a town where they might be called to account by the police . When the recruiting authorities come to hunt up their Jews for the military service which all Russians have to render , they are usually away from home , or have been enrolled in some other town or village . If they are finally caught and brought before the military authorities , they usually have papers certifying that they are either too young or too old for the service ; in fact , the military authorities regard it now as pretty well proved that of the three million Jews in the Russian Empire , hardly one is of military age . In this matter of deceiving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish officials , whose duty it is to register births and grant certificates of this kind ; but the matter at last went to such ridiculous lengths that the Russians have gone to the other extreme , and now attach no importance whatever to any document which the Jew may produce , but draw their own conclusions by looking at him , and pronounce him of military age or not according to his appearance or their inclinations . I ventured to point out to my friend that there was little inducement // for the Jew to enter the army , where he was not apt to be treated with much consideration , but my friend replied that the behavior of the Jew in regard to his military service was analogous to his behavior in regard to all his obligations to the state and every community except his own . " I do not know how it is with you in America , " said he , " but with us , whenever you see a Jew who is rich , you may be pretty sure that he has either contracted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been several times bankrupt . You would have great difficulty in discovering a rich Jew who has not been bankrupt at least once . " The attitude of Germans towards Jews is necessarily most intimately connected with the treatment of them by the Czar , which illustrates , what I believe to be the fact , that the Germans who discuss this question without religious bitterness are prepared to treat fairly the Jews now in Germany , but dread the political consequences of a further immigration from the east . It is notable that the anti-Semitic movement sprang into existence in Germany at the same time that Alexander III . became Czar , and has been growing in proportion as that sovereign has shown a disposition to rid himself of them at the expense of his western neighbors . Fairminded Germans have over and over again repudiated the idea that they could object to Jews , or any one else , on religious grounds , and protested that in approaching this question they did so strictly as practical politicians dealing with a political state of things gravely affecting the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jewish invasion from the west , for that Jew is no longer the Jew of Poland , but the Jew who has conformed in many ways to the life and thought of his neighbors in Holland , Belgium . England , and France . The Jew question in Germany could be easily settled if England would agree to accept them first after they left Poland , and send them on to Germany only after they had spent a generation on her soil , far from the influences that oppress them in Warsaw and Kovno . That the Jew question in Germany has reference to fears for the future rather than anxiety in regard to the present is illustrated to some extent by the fact that in Germany all religious denominations are treated as equal before the law , and if a Jew in Germany complains that his position in society is not as desirable as he could wish , it is a complaint that might just as well be made in America , or even in England . The German Jew complains that his coreligionists are not often selected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal before the law . The Jew is not often found as an officer in the German army simply because the majority of German officers do not desire to serve with him . If the officers of a Prussian regiment desired a Jew to become one of their number , there is no law in the country that would stand in the way ; for in this matter of becoming an officer the Jew stands on a footing as good as and no better than a Christian .. Every candidate for epaulets in the German army submits his name to the regiment in which lie desires to serve , and has to be elected into the regiment , much as though he were applying for hdmission into a rowing club , or any other semisocial organization . The present German custoum is an excellent one , and the Jews who complain against it only advertise the fact that they have not yet reached a point where their fellow-countrymen regard them as the most desirable leaders of troops . Germany , with a population less than fifty millions , has , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle over one per cent . of the population , and a larger number than the whole of her standing army . Of this number Prussia alone has 372,058 , yet nowhere have the Jews more enlightened champions than amongst Germans who are not even of the Jewish faith , notably the editors of such papers as the Nation and the Freisinnige , both of whom are active members of the German Parliament . These men and the party they represent scout the idea that so small a proportion of the whole population can possibly become a danger , and they loudly urge the government to appoint Jews to the most important military and judicial posts-in other words , to treat a Jew not as an alien , but as a thorough German . But these statesmen have not yet convinced the great mass of the people that the Jew , by becoming a citizen of the German Empire , necessarily becomes a German other than in name and speech . Prussia , in 1850 , made her citizenship equal to all , irrespective of religious denomina // tion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least before the law , and the Imperial Constitution of 1871 was framed in the same spirit of toleration . German politicians who to-day champion the cause of the Jews tell us that during the wars of liberation against Napoleon I. five and a half per cent . of the Jews who were of the military age entered the Prussian army as volunteers , and that one of the first soldiers to earn the Iron Cross in those wars was a Jew . From that day to this the Jews in Germany have borne a good record in the ranks of the army , although few of them have become officers . Dr. Phillippson has raised a monument to German Jews in connection with the war of 1870 by publishing the result of investigations made amongst his co-religionists in 132 communities . His conclusions are that the Jewish population furnished its full complement to the active army during that struggle , and earned a very respectable number of Iron Crosses as the reward of bravery . The Jews have warm friends in Germany , both in Parliament and in the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly discussed there from every point of view . In no community is religious toleration so much a matter of principle as in Germany , and the idea of making a distinction between Jew and Christian on religious grounds never entered the mind of a practical German legislator . Every Ger man school-boy is brought up to regard the greatness of Prussia as owing largely to the refuge it has afforded in past ages to the persecuted of all other countries , whether Protestants from France or Jews from Spain . But even amongst liberal Germans there is growing up a feeling that the Jews of their country are more than their mere numbers represent ; that they are to some extent a political society whose organization covers the world , and whose aims are not altogether those of the citizens amongst whom they are protected . No Protestant German has ill-will towards his fellow-citizen of the Roman Catholic faith , and if Lutherans ever show a disposition to depart from their principle *f toleration it is when they have reason to dread the influence of Jesuits as a political power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire . The Jewish question is growing in importance amongst Germans , as it has grown in importance in Hungary , in Roumania , and , above all , in Russia . It is bound to go on increasing in proportion as the Jews decline to identify themselves completely with the people amongst whom they traffic and make their money . It is not a trifling matter that the people of these countries regard the Israelite as one of a different nation and race , but it is vastly more serious when amongst these people there develops a widespread fear that the supply of Jews from Russia may assume proportions still more disastrous .
