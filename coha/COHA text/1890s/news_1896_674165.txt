txt Mr. CLEVELAND yesterday issued an Executive order bringing under the civil service rules and the merit system practically all the offices previously excepted to which the rules can be applied . From the offices that are filled by the advice and consent of the Senate down to the day laborer , only a very few places can now be filled except on open competitive examination . The excepted places are those of a strictly confidential nature , and even these are very closely defined . Apart from the sweep of this order , there is a searching provision of equal importance . Places are no longer enumerated by title , but are classified according to the duties reouired , so that no officer can take -a place out from under the rules , by changing its name , without change in either the duties or the pay . How great is the extension of the reform can be seen when we say that the number of places under the rules is increased from 55,736 to 85,138 , or by over 52 per cent. , and the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by over GO per cent . This is the extent . The character of the change is well understood by our readers . It is in effect the emancipation of the public service from an ignoble subjection to the mean and petty tyranny of a class . It protects American citizens in the employ of the*Government from influences and exactions as degrading to manhood as those that obtain in the seraglio-managed Government of Turkey . It takes out of our politics , to a very marked degree , a force that has been corrupt and corrupting . It restores to the people the right to have their work done well and at reasonable cost by those best fitted for it . It gives to citizens who seek it equal rights to share in the service of the United States , and to be judged fairly by their fitness , and not to be deprived of all opportunity by the influence of politicians upon the venal favor of appointing officers. , The reform , in its nature and purpose and in its methods and operation , is thoroughly American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before England had the courage to adopt it , its principles had been defined by JEFFERSON and applied by WASHINGTON . If equa'ity and justice , honesty , sense , and economy , are riot American , it is not easy to see what is . The use of offices to promLte party ends is as English as WALPOLE or Lord NORTH , and there has never existed in Great Britain a privileged class so greedy , unscrupulous , stupid , and reactionary as the spoils brokers of whatever party in the United States . And nothing in the great service which Mr. CLEVELAND has rendered to his country shows more clearly his close sympathy with the people , his faithful devotion to their essential interests , his clear and unshaken conception of their general rights , than his stubborn fight for the merit system against the spoilsmen of all parties . Nor is this tile least of the ties that bind him to the hearts of his countrymen . It is one of the secrets of that great power against which the politicians have contended in vain that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily , defied them in the name and on behalf of the ' people . We have from time to time believed it right to criticise Mr. CLEVELAND with regard to civil service reform : There have been occasions when it seemed to us that he could have stood more firmly by the logical consequences of the steps he had already taken , and when we thought that he could have gained more by open resistance than by conciliation with political leaders whose pursuit of patronage was more eager than their love of principle . But no one can now fail to see how far he has advanced the cause of refoi-rn . Only the future can reveal to the American people the very great benefits that he has , in so doing , conferred upon them . It may well be that these will not generally be recognized , for when the reform shall be accomplished , and orderly and intelligent administration shall be the unvarying experience of the people in the executive offices of this Government , it will be bard to recall the state of things that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measuring the claims of duty by the recognition which the performance of duty brings . In this matter , he must have the approval of his conscience and the lasting gratitude of all who can understand the great work he has done .
