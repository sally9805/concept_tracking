txt Wilhelm A. Lippert , or W. A. Layard , who is charged by the authorities of Cape Colony , through the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , with gigantic forgeries in South Africa in 1889 and 1890 , is a prisoner in Ludlow Street Jail . The precise charges on which he was arrested at Cincinnati Wednesday are that on Dee . 21 , 1889 , he forged indorsements purporting to be those of P. P. A. Belt and Max Michaelis to a promissory note signed " W. A. Lippert &; Co. , " in favor of the cashier of the Union Bank ' of Cape Town for ? 104,035 , with the intent to defraud the bank . A like transaction , Feb. 12 , 1890 , was in amount ? 53,300 , and one precisely the same on May 31 , 1890 , involved ? 11,400 , a total of ? 168,735 , or $843,675 . Lippert is further charged with having , on Dec. 21 , 1859 , " forged and uttered " the initials " M. M. " on certain list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the first forged note for ? 104,035 . Lippert fled from South Africa when detection and arrest were imminent , and the home authorities were appealed to to find him . Scotland Yard furnished his description and portrait , and the British Consul General here employed Pinkerton 's agency to look after the fugitive . C. E. Vannetta , a Pinkerton operative , got on Lippert 's track two weeks ago . Lippert then lived at 219 Race Street , Cincinnati , as a bachelor and in comfortable circumstances , although he was looking for employment , he having lost his situation as bookkeeper for the Chicago Publishing Company . Vannetta became sure last week of Lippert 's identity and kept him under constant surveillance . , Meanwhile , notice of the discovery of Lippert 's hiding place was sent to the British Consul , Percy Sanderson , and his attorneys , Marbury &; Fox , arranged for the arrest with United States Marshal McCarty , who sent Marshal J. B. Bostwick to Cincinnati . Lippert was captured in the street . He betrayed no emotion , but said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send for persons to identify and clear him , and said that if he had to go to New-York to answer a criminal charge he would offer no opposition . His rooms were searched , but nothing was found to indicate that he had ever been in South Africa . He had no money when arrested , but was allowed to draw from a bank $102 , which he had on deposit . Bostwick and his prisoner ? left Cincinnati on the 12:01 P. M. Chesapeake - and Ohio train Wednesday , and Lippert talked little on the way here , saying nothing about his antecedents or the accusations against him . He slept soundly Wednesday night and was entirely docile . Arraigned before United States Commissioner Shields , in whose office were Consu Sanderson and Messrs . Marbury &; Fox , soon after his arrival here , Lippert declined to say anything , pleading that he was not represented by counsel , so he was remanded until 10 A. M. to-day . In Marshal McCarty 's office Lippert was . given every facility to secure a lawyer , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him Lippert talked with a reporter for The New-York Times . The prisoner is a bearded , studious-looking man of fifty , gentle in manner , and he talks with a refined English accent . So far from denying his identity he acknowledged that his name was Lippert . While he would not talk of the accusations against him , he said he had been in the United States four years , and read with intense interest a newspaper story of his career . " Of what nationality are you , Mr. Lippert ? " the reporter asked . " Please do n't ask me anything , as I shall have to appear impolite . You see l have not seen a lawyer , and I ought not to talk . " " Have you a family ? " The man 's lower lip trembled and hi : - eyes filled with tears at once . Presentl ; he said , very gently : " I have . " " Wife and children ? " " Yes  --  wife  --  and children . " " Here in this country ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this time tears were streaming over the prisoner 's face , and he walked to a window to hide his emotion . When Lawyer Rose came , however , Lippert had an animated conversation with him for half ' an hour . As Mr. Rose left he announced : " My client will be silent by my advice . I say nothing . I may talk to-morrow . The defense at present is that it 's a case of mistaken identity . " Lippert was taken to Ludlow Street Jail . Full particulars of Lippert 's career and of the forgeries are expected from England by Consul Sanderson . So far as is at present known , Lippert was born at Hamburg , but was trained in England to occupy a position with his father , a rich German merchant . He filled this acceptably , but was ambitious , and to gratify him his father furnished him with capital for a business venture in South Africa . At Cane Town he was soon identified , through his Means and introduction , with the best people in society and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimberley , the diamond fields centre . Here he developed into one of the boldest and most active speculators of , - the colony , and his transactions- appeared to be ar lucky as they were prodigious . Had ht. been prudent he would soon have returned home with a vast fortune , but he lived up to his prosperity , keeping up an establishment that was the wonder of the richest people in South Africa . Reverses found him with an impaired capital and no resouces , but he did not change his luxurious fashion of living , and the forgeries , it is claimed , were committed to retard the day of reckoning with his creditors . How he fled is not yet fully known . One day Cape Colony was convulsed by the scandal of his collapse and the stories of crimes , and he was sought for . The first trace of Lippert. in America was the discovery that he had been in Louisville , in a book store . He was afterward traced to Cleveland .
