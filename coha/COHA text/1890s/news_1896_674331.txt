txt A report finds it way into print here that many Southern gold-standard Democrats will seek appointments under President , and it is said Chairman Hanna promised assistance , in several instances , to Southern men who would help to bring about Bryan 's defeat . The argument to be made to suport the demands of Southern men for " recognition " is that the attitude of the gold Democrats served to so split the Democracy as to permanently disable it ; that large numbers of conservative business men who refused to co-operate with the Democratic Party may now seize an opportunity to become leaders in a reorganized Republica.n Party , and that the new party will contain more white men than the old Republican organization , while it will hold all the negro vote hitherto identified in most contests with the Republicans . In Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee , and , perhaps , in some other States , is expected to name gold Democrats for offices , giving them , it is suggested , a majority of the available places . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office some of the gold Democrats now in , or to be appointed . One of these appointments is said to be that of Revenue Commissioner Forman of Illinois , who was the gold-standard candidate for Governor against Altgeld , and an aggressive leader of the National Democracy . The number of cases of this kind can not be very large , and it is not likely that there will be much more than " recognition " of the gold Democrats . There is no expectai tion here , so far as can be ascertained , that a gold Democrat will be asked into the Cabinet .
