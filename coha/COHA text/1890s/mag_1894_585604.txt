txt I MUST now endeavor concisely to relate a circumstance the consequences of which were very afflicting to me , and brought me to the brink of the grave . An American vessel , belonging to Philadelphia and commanded by Captain Ballenger , had been captured on the coast of Africa by a British man-of-war , and , as she contained a cargo of slaves , had been sent , contrary to the laws of the United States , as a prize to Kingston for adjudication , and the investigation was then pending . I had understood from Captain Ballenger that the supercargo and mate had in vain persuaded him to swear to some spurious papers in order to save the vessel , and that his peremptory refusal had caused a bitter animosity against him . In order , therefore , to revenge themselves and get him out of the way , they secretly informed the government , on oath , that Captain Ballenger was one of the Hermione men ; that is to say , one of the American seamen on board the British frigate Hermione when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British crew in a mutiny in which they murdered all the officers . The American seamen then on board , to the number of about forty or fifty , who were there as prisoners taken from captured merchant vessels , were accused of having assisted in the mutiny , and had been hunted up all over the world for the length of ten years . Any Am*rican , therefore , accused in any part of the world where there were British authorities , was put in chains , sent to England , recognized and sworn to by such of the British crew as had remained neutral during the mutiny and were fed and paid by government to assist recognition ; after which the unfortunate man was hung without further ceremony . It was positively asserted at Kingston at that time , that already more men , both English and American , had been hung than the original crew of the Hermione consisted of . I myself saw three men hanging on Gallows Island , off Port Royal . This short digression I have deemed necessary in order to make clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had stepped into the counting - house of a merchant with whom Captain Ballenger was acquainted , I observed three suspicious men , at short intervals from each other , making inquiries after the captain , and I learned that they were police officers in search of him . I determined at once to hunt him up , give him warning , and if possible prevent the calamity which threatened him . I learned that he had that morning gone to a board - yard about a mile and a half from the city , on private business . To this place I proceeded at a rapid pace , and at midday in June , when the rays of the sun were nearly perpendicular . There I found him and communicated to him all that I had seen and heard , and he appeared to be much agitated . I told him that it was not my purpose to inquire whether lie had ever been on board the Hermione or not ; or if he had been , whether he had participated in the mutiny or not ; my object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly moved , but assured me , in the most solemn manner , that he had never had any concern with that vessel , and that the accusation was a fabrication of the supercargo and mate in revenue as before related , and for the purpose of getting rid of him . We stood in a distant and private part of the yard , exposed to the heat of the day , but my mind was so much engaged that nearly three hours passed imperceptibly away in consultation . It was ultimately re // solved upon that he should remain at the board - yard or its neighborhood until ten or eleven o'clock in the evening , and then proceed to my lodgings and my room to spend the night . In the meantime , I would return home and privately consult with Mr. Kraft , Captain Hathaway , and Captain Christy , the latter being then in Kingston . With Mr. Kraft I would arrange the means to procure him a temporary shelter at the plantation of his motherin-law , Mrs. Cole , a retired spot about two miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Captains Hathaway and Christy I would consult on the most effective means to spirit him away from the island on board of some departing American vesseL This agreed upon , I departed on my return . I had not been long on the road , when I began to feel the consequences of my fatigue , exposure , and agitation of mind . I felt a slight pain in the back of my head , a dry heat without perspiration , and a lassitude and pain in my limbs . When I reached home and told my host how I felt , he recommended a glass of hot punch and retiring immediately to bed . I observed that I would do the former , but could not do the latter , as I had still some business to attend to . I strove hard against the growing malady , and succeeded in keeping up until I had had an interview with my friends , who promised to execute the arrangements made relative to Captain Ballenger . From the rapidly increasing symptoms , I felt convinced that I had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from exposure , heat , and over-exertion . Still I was not alarmed . I had no sooner retired and assumed a horizontal position than I began to vomit at short intervals , and my first care was to send for an eminent physician . Accordingly Dr. Macglarthy , a Scotch gentleman , took me in hand . Although I felt much distressed that evening , I remained perfectly sensible , and well remember the arrival of Captain Ballenger between eleven and twelve o'clock , and his great uneasiness at remaining in my room until daybreak . His fear of taking the yellow fever was so great that for a time he hesitated between that disorder and the gallows . However , his better sense prevailed , and he stayed until daybreak , when Mr. Kraft , according to arrangements , took him away . From that day until some weeks after I was not in a condition to be informed of what became of him , and only learned the proceedings when I was deemed to be out of danger . The attendance of my excellent doctor was unremitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of the crisis of my disorder , which was to determine my fate . His skill was great , and his delicacy in no way inferior . When I was so ill that I thought I could not possibly survive without some prompt relief , I informed Dr. Macglarthy that I was not afraid to die , and that the knowledge of my fate would therefore not hasten my departure . I entreated him , therefore , if he had no hope of my recovery to acquaint me with the fact . I stated to him that I had property both in Cuba and in the United States , and that I ought , while yet able , to arrange these worldly affairs . He listened to me with much emotion , and was in silent contemplation for a considerable time . He at length said , " Sir , it is not possible for me now to comply with your request ; but of one thing you may rest assured , that in case of the worst I will give you such notice as will leave you time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed on the subject , but from then ceforward I examined his countenance whenever I was able to do so , expecting the result of his promise . In this manner about a week elapsed , during which I had been frequently delirious , when during one night I had the most horrible feelings and sensations that I ever experienced , and my nurse subsequently said that from hour to hour she did not expect me to live for many minutes . It is remarkable that my senses and recollections during the period were perfectly alive , but troubled with an acute distress and fantastic appearances . Whether my eyes were open or shut , I saw the room full of the most frightful visages glaring at me as the central object . Toward morning I fell asleep , and when I awoke found myself in the first perspiration during my illness , and // the doctor sitting alongside of my bed feeling my pulse . I was so weak that I could scarcely speak or give an answer to his question how I had spent the night . It appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my waking and was well informed of what had passed . I thought he looked less *rave than usual , though I felt apparently much worse than ever . Hitherto nothing had remained on my stomach , nor had I had any evacuation except by a tificial means . He asked whether I felt an appetite for anything in particular , and I responded that I should like to taste a glass of Rhenish wine , if the article could be obtained . It was immediately brought , and about half a wineglassful did not alone taste grateful , but remained with me undisturbed . The doctor remained with me the greater part of the morning , and with much sympathy and tenderness announced to me that he did not think it necessary this time that I should make my last wilL The crisis of my disorder had taken place the preceding night and the result was favorable . From that day I began very slowly to recover , but it was more than two weeks afterward before I felt strong enough to walk . During this state of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then learned the fate of Captain Ballenger . He reached the country-seat of Mrs. Cole in safety and unsuspected early on the morning of my illness . There he remained perfectly secluded for three or four days , notwithstanding a proclamation had been issued by the Governor , Sir Eyre Coote , offering a reward of one hundred pounds for his arrest , and issuing strict orders to the Fort at Port Royal that no vessel or boat should be permitted to put to sea without having undergone a strict search . Notwithstanding all this se verity and caution , my friends suc ceeded in making him escape in safety . They waited for the clearing of an American vessel , the captain of which was in the secret , and made the follow - . ing arrangement : The captain , after ar riving at Port Royal in the afternoon and having been duly searched , should put to sea at sundown , and his course being easterly he would , in a couple of hours , find himself again opposite Kingston , with the strip of land forming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . There he should hover about under easy sail , showing lights , but not so near the shore as to create suspicion . In the meantime preparations had been made by my friends on shore . A light clinkerbuilt boat was in readiness , stowed away among the mangrove and laurel bushes on the sea side of the Pahisadoes , nearly in a line with Mr. Kraft 's house in Kingston . On the evening appointed , Captain Ballenger having been transported from Mrs. Cole 's to Mr. Kraft 's house , was from there , in the disguise of a black man , conveyed in Mr. Kraft 's common boat in company with 1*Ir . Kraft only , whom Ballenger rowed across the harbor to his hut on the Pahisadoes . This circumstance could not have given the slightest suspicion , even if they had been watched , as Mr. Kraft frequently went ten times a day to the Pahisadoes on business of his own . At the hut they were waited for by Hathaway , Christy , and another American captain , who had preceded them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this place is scarcely one-quarter of a mile broad , embarked in their little pilot-boat , and had the good fortune to discover the ship in waiting . Captain Ballenger arrived safely in the United States , and I have often seen him since in Philadelphia and received his warm acknowledgments for the part I acted in this dramatic romance of real life . I have before mentioned that I had contracted a friendship with Captain Brown , of the British Navy . During my recovery he spent much of his time in my room , and his attention was particularly engaged in my description of my adventures at Baracoa , especially that part in which the two British frigates passed the harbor and fired at the town . It having been for years my particular pleasure , when at sea , to make draughts of the shores we passed and to take bearings and distances , and when on shore to investigate the location of harbors and forts , with no // other possible object but information and amusement , I showed him , in our various nautical conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but minute description , of the port of Baracoa , which he wished me to give him . This I declined because I did not want to break my collection , but having much leisure , offered to give him a copy of it . This I made and addressed it to Captain Brown , of the British Navy . It filled one sheet of fool's-cap paper in my own handwriting . You may perhaps wonder that I am so particular in minutely describing a circumstance of apparent insignificance-so much so that it is likely I myself should never afterward have remembered the fact , if by the fatalities and freaks of fortune this very paper had not placed me in the most difficult and alarming position I ever experienced in the course of my life , the particulars of which will soon be narrated . When I at length began to gather some strength , some of my friends proposed to accompany me by water to Port Royal for the benefit of the fresh and invigorating air , and Captain Brown volunteered his services to support me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a quarter of a mile and were in sight of the place to choose a boat for embarkation , when , as usual , we were surrounded by a number of watermen each praising his boat and each trying to obtain the job . While this was going on , my eye suddenly lit on a smart mulatto man , in whom I instantly recognized the runaway cook who had robbed me . Weak as I was , I sprang forward to catch him ; but our recognition had been simultaneous , and before I could seize him , he sprang backward and bolted . I hallooed , " Seize that thief and I will reward you ! " and my gallant Captain Brown was the first who pursued him with great energy . The fellow , however , gained on him every moment , and , as the last resort , Brown two or three times stooped to pick up stones , which he flung after him without effect . This was the first and last glimpse I ever had of this knave after his second desertion and robbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE shortly afterward prepared to leave Kingston , but as Captain Hathaway and myself had unfinished business in Cuba , we endeavored to find a chance , first to cross oyer to Santiago de Cuba and from there proceed to the United States . This proved more difficult than I imagined , since the intercourse between the two islands was cut off in consequence of the hostilities which existed between England and Spain . The British Government , however , winked at the illicit traffic which was carried on between Cuba and Jamaica , because it was profitable , but suffered all the risk to fall on the opposite parties . Adventurers residing at Santiago , Havana , and other Cuban ports , would laden a small schooner with profitable articles for the Kingston market , and ostensibly clearing their vessel for some DanMi market , would enter Kingston in distress and be permitted to sell their cargo . On their return , they were always prepared with false papers in order to pass the Morro Castle ; for the rest , there was a private understanding between them and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another interruption , which they did not always escape . Another set of adventurers , but always Spaniards , poor , bold , and wicked , and generally consisting of dilapidated privateersmen as officers and the refuse of piratical seamen as crew , would make application to the governor for license to guard the coast and harbors against illicit traders . If they obtained such permission they would fit up the long-boat of a ship , place a small carronade at her bow , man her with a crew of from ten to twenty persons armed at all points , and go forth in pursuit of prey . These licensed armed boats went generally by the name of picaroons , and it was notorious that they did not confine themselves to the limits of their commission ; and if they could not fall in with illegal traders , would rob and plunder other vessels , and sometimes do even worse for fear of detection . // We found an opportunity to take passage on board a small schooner from St. Barts , bound for Santiago , which had touched at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the character of the vessel . But even if we had known otherwise , it would have been a matter of indifference , since we , as American citizens and having no concern in either vessel or cargo , had an undoubted right to avail ourselves of the opportunity of a passage . While I was preparing my trunk and books and clothes , I recollected that I had lent the second volume of Ossian 's Poems to Captain Brown , which I obtained in a few minutes by stepping into his room , and packed in my trunk without further examination . After taking leave of our numerous friends , especially the Kraft family , Captain Christy placed in my hands a lady 's gold watch and a gold neck-chain , requesting inc to deliver them to some lady at Santiago whose address he gave me . Having no time to lock them up I placed them in my pocket . We at length got under way , Captain Hathaway , a French gentleman , and myself being cabin passengers , and about fourteen men , of doubtful appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spaniards , had their accommodations in the hull of the schooner . When within about forty miles of Santiago , and just in sight of the high mountains , our captain descried a small object at the distance of about ten miles , which he made out to be an armed boat , such as I have described before . After some observations he ascertained that it made directly for us , and convinced himself that it was a Spanish picaroon . He instantly turned about ship and stood back again . It appeared that this little vessel brought with her a breeze from the north , which had not yet reached us , and consequently gained sufficiently for us to ascertain her character with the naked eye . The steerage passengers seemed greatly alarmed , but the * captain kept of good cheer , observing that the breeze which they brought along would strike us before they could come within three miles of us , and that VOL . XV. - 52 then we should soon be out of sight . His prediction proved to be correct , for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance between us , until about 3 P.M. , when the boat became invisible to the naked eye . During this chase and flight the courage of the alarmed passengers was so greatly reanimated that they behaved themselves in the most preposterous man - ner , jumping and capering on deck , swearing at and defying the pirate or picaroon with clenched fists and indecent postures of the body . But , alas ! this mirth was not of long duration , and their subsequent fear was equal to their extravagant joy . About 3 P.M. the wind died away and left us a dead calm , while the breeze a few miles to the north of us still continued , and soon after our indefatigable pursuers hove in sight again , and we found that they must ultimately come up with us . I asked the captain respecting the quality of the boat in pursuit of us , and he informed me that she was a picaroon , who , no doubt , would rob and plunder us - which I could not discredit , as I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before described . Under these circumstances I asked him whether he would submit or resist . On this subject he was dubious , entertaining still a hope to escape . Captain Hathaway and myself offered him our services , provided he had any arms and ammunition on board , stating that we mustered twenty and they but fourteen persons , and that if we made a determined show they would not risk boarding us . On examining his armament , however , we found that there were but three muskets on board , not in the best condition , and not sufficient powder to charge them more than a dozen times . Besides , no reliance could be placed in the courage of the fourteen steerage passengers , recently so brave , but now crestfallen and desponding . Under all these circumstances we advised the captain to submit at the proper time , be guided by circumstances , and make the best of a bad bargain . The hour of our trial was now fast approaching , for when within half a mile of us , they fired their pivot-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our captain , still faintly hoping that a sudden breeze might yet enable him to escape , disobeyed the signal , the boat in the meantime laboring hard with twelve oars . When within a quarter of a mile of us , another shot was directly fired at us , and the captain hauled in saiL We were then all on deck , and although not armed , made a show of twenty men . The armed boat did not approach nearer than speaking distance , when the commander got amidships , and hailed us through the speaking-trumpet , ordering the captain and two hands to lower the boat and come on board with his papers ; commanding in the meantime that everybody on board except the mate and helmsman retire below deck . No sooner were these orders received than the valiant fourteen sheltered themselves below in quick time . I told Captain Hathaway that I was determined to remain on deck , let the consequence be what it would , in order that I might observe their further proceedings and thus be enabled to act according to circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated ourselves in the most conspicuous part , namely , on the top of the companion slide , each smoking a cigar . In the meantime the captain had got the boat ready and was on his way to the armed vesseL While this was passing , the captain of the privateer , observing that all had not gone below as directed , jumped up , snatched a loaded musket , and deliberately fired it at us . I saw the captain fall , but it was but for a moment . The whistling of the ball , which passed very near him , made him dodge and lose his balance , but he was instantly again at my side . I kept my eyes fixed upon the person who fired , and observed that when he saw that neither of us was hurt , he stooped down to pick up another musket , when his arm was arrested by an officer who drew his attention to the arrival of our boat . This saved us from the repetition of a shot . We could plainly see that on the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in irons and kept prisoners in the stern of the armed boat . Our boat then , without loss of time , was manned by six men and an officer , all armed to the teeth , who on arrival simultaneously jumped on board , with drawn swords in their hands , a carabine on their backs , two large pistols at their belts , and a double - edged knife which they carried in a sheath in a pantaloon pocket on the right thigh . They divided themselves as follows : two at the stern , near the helmsman , two amidships , and two at the bow , the officers commuiucating with and taking the orders of the commander of the armed boat . We kept our seat , and were no further molested , but our actions probably closely watched . The hatches of the hold , with all the steerage passengers , were bolted , and the cabin locked , which latter contained only the French passenger , who was probably the owner of the cargo . While these preparations were making it got , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We steered again in the direction of Cuba , but as we outsailed the boat , and the few remaining men in her , being probably very tired from a whole day 's rowing , and the commander being afraid to let us sail without his close attendance , he ordered the boat to be taken in tow , and thus we proceeded during a fine night . It was very natural that Captain Hathaway and myself did not feel sleepy after having witnessed such stirring scenes , and not knowing what was yet to come . We , therefore , after everything was still and under proper arrangement , gently left our seats and leisurely walked up and down the quarter-deck . I , at length , occasionally made some few commonplace observations to the officer in Spanish , which were civilly answered by him in tolerably good English . This was great encouragemen t for me , and seemingly without any notion than to pass away the still and tedious hours of the night , we by degrees got into an interesting conversation . I gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident we became passengers on board the schooner , with whose captain , crew , and remaining passengers we were totally unacquainted . I took care , also , accidentally to mention that we were personally acquainted with the Governor of Santiago , the king 's interpreter // Jirady , Mr. Casamayor and others , and that our friends expected us and knew we were coming by the first opportunity . He listened very attentively , asked various questions relative to the schooner and its genuine papers , which he said must be hidden somewhere on board . To all this I could of course give him no satisfactory answer . It appeared , notwithstanding , that this conversation had made a favorable impression on him , as his demeanor was more respectful and less suspicious than before . He said he had suspected that we two were stubborn Yankees for not going below when ordered on pain of being fired at , and added that he was the person who arrested the arm of the captain , when in the act of firing the second time , seeing no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly for this act of humanity , and a friendly and civil intercourse between us was the result . We had thus conversed for some time , when we were suddenly disturbed by many loud voices and a violent surge of the sea at our stern , followed by a crash . The officer sprang on his feet , looked over the stern , and exclaimed that the privateer boat was missing . But the speaking-trumpet of its captain soon informed him that she had not gone to the bottom . The case was thus  --  the wind had freshened during the night , and while the boat was guided by the helmsman to keep in our wake , he , from drowsiness or some other cause , shifted his helm , which suddenly laid her broadside behind our stei'n , and had the tow-rope not that instant parted from the great resistance , the boat must inevitably have upset and the whole of them probably drowned . As it was they had shipped considerable water . We were ordered to lay to ; and after they had fixed themselves again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another tow , but ordered us to stand on under easy sail and not part company . Thus passed the night away , and when at the dawn of day , though far from shore , I examA med the bearing of the mountains , I felt assured that we did not steer for Santiago , as pretended , but that our course would bring us at least thirty miles below it . This circumstance gave me considerable uneasiness , and I resolved if possible to get some information on the subject from my new friend . In this I was , however , mistaken . I asked him , carelessly , if we were bound for Santiago . He answered " To be sure . " I then ventured to tell him that I was acquainted with the coast , and that I believed that our present course would bring us to the leeward of it . He seemed somewhat offended and merely answered , " You know nothing about it . " I dropped the subject , knowing that I should soon have the mystery solved without him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small inlet , which led to smooth water , defended on the sea side by a ridge of rocks , and having on the land side a gently rising sand beach , and thus forming a secure but almost entirely hidden harbor . The place itself was an uninhabited wilderness , and well calculated for the perpetration of undetected rapine and murder . These reflections , however , did not trouble me much , being by that time convinced that this armed boat acted under some authority from government , and that the officers , however abandoned and rapacious , could be made amenable for their conduct , especially by Americans acquainted at Santiago . They went to this place under pretence of making a thorough search for false papers , but in reality to commit petty plunder of such money and articles as they might find in possession of passengers , who would from fear submit to their conduct . On our arrival we found the armed boat already at anchor , and we now expected the first visit from her commander . The cabin and hold had now been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck , and help themselves as well as they could to the first meal since the preceding afternoon . I was rather anxious to observe what effect our disobedience might have on this ferocious marauder . His first visit was therefore very interesting to me . He at length made his appearance , and I must confess that the outward appearance of the man was very unprepossess // ing . He was tall and rawboned , armed like the rest , except that he carried no carabine , and had his sword in its sheath . His complexion was swarthy and his countenance fierce and stern . He bore no marks of distinction about him , no uniform , and his habiliments were coarse , soiled , and the worse for wear . He however appeared to take no particular notice of Captain Hathaway and myself , but went down in the cabin with our prize-master , where they had a long consultation . Having settled between themselves the subsequent mode of proceedings , he returned for a while on board his boat . Shortly after this , orders were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 's papers . Hitherto , and from the first moment we were boarded , I had put Captain Christy 's watch and gold chain , entrusted to my care , in my watch-fob under my own watch , and also put the chain and seal out of sight ; but as soon as I heard this order , I pulled out the chain and seal , and left them hang outside in the usual way . The proceeding of this examination and search was as follows : Two officers ( or ruffians who called themselves such ) occupied the cabin , and the passengers were called down singly and in turn to be searched by them . I was the third or fourth person ordered to go below , which I accordingly did . I found these two men standing at the far end of the cabin , and immediately halted . One of the men stepped toward me , but I stretched out my arm , and requested him to stand back for a moment . I then asked him to state to me explicitly the purpose for whi*Ji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to ascertain whether I had secreted about me the genuine papers of the vessel of which I was , or pretended to be , a passenger . I responded , if this was the case , it would give me pleasure to convince him that I had not . Suiting the action to the words , I pulled off my hat , and handed it to him for examination , and in rotation divested myself of shoes , stockings , neck-kerchief , and jacket vest I wore none ; until I was left in my pantaloons and shirt . I offered to take off the latter , but he waived his hand in token that he did not require it . I then took out my watch , wound the chain around my forefinger and placed what money I had in the fiat of the same hand , and turned my pantaloon pockets inside out , except my watch-fob . I held these objects up to his view and said , in a decided tone : " You must be convinced now that I have no papers of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand are my own personal property , with which I do not intend to part without violence . " They whispered with one another for a moment or two , and the spokesman said he was satisfied . I returned my valuables and dressed myself leisurely , and thus ended my search . On mounting the deck , I whispered to Hathaway , " Be bold and determined , and you will keep your own . " I subsequently learned from some of the other passengers that all their personal property except their clothes had been detained under pretence that it would be returned to them on arrival at Santiago , and they had suffered themselves to be searched by these two men . No concealed papers relative to the vessel having been discovered by this operation , orders were issued after dinner to have all the trunks and baggage of the passengers brought upon deck for examination , which was accordingly done , and I witnessed the examination of several trunks and bundles , and found that all written papers were abstracted , looked at , and indiscriminately put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open for that purpose . I did not care how they ransacked my trunk of clothes and books , but I had with me a small and curiously iron-bound chest , made in Russia and brought with me from Europe , which had a double lock and was very safe . In this trunk I carried all valuable papers relative to my concerns . I was determined not to have these papers disturbed , or ( what was worse ) have them thrown into this twobushel bag , among a multitude of other papers . When my turn came to have my trunks examined , I pointed them out , took the small one by the handle , and presented myself before the captain , with whom hitherto I had not exchanged one word . I informed him briefly that that trunk contained my appeal and other private papers , entirely uncon // nected with any of the concerns of the schooner . That I could not submit to have them disarranged , much less allow them to be mixed with the multitude of papers deposited in the large bag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them examined in court after our arrival at Santiago . I therefore should refuse to open the trunk or deliver the keys , unless forced to do so by actual violence . I informed him that I did not *want him to credit my assertion , but that I was willing to deliver up the trunk to his care before all the witnesses , keeping possession of the keys , and was willing , when called upon by the court at Santiago to open it in his presence and have it examined . I further stated that it contained papers and vouchers , not worth one cent to anybody , but the loss or want of which would prevent me from recovering $30,000 from the British Admiralty Court at Kingston , and that therefore I should hold him responsible for that amount , until the trunk and papers were again put in my possession . This speech had the desired effect ; he accepted the charge of the trunk , and I kept the keys . I now thought that my trials were ended , and that I could look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fate , however , ordained it otherwise . My large trunk was now brought forwa'rd for examination and cheerfully opened by me . The same process as with other trunks was continued : the clothing was examined piece by piece , and several papers and bills , which for want of time I had put on the top of the clothes , but which were of no consequence to me , were first opened and then deposited in the bag . Next came my travelling library . The books were taken out one by one , opened , held by the cover and shaken . Among the first few books thus handled was the second volume of Ossian ' s Poems , which it will be remembered I had taken from the room of the British officer just before I departed . When this book was shaken , a sheet of fool'scap paper folded in four dropped from it , which I instantly recognized as a minute description of the harbor of Baracoa , with my opinion that this harbor might easily be taken by a couple of British frigates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the author of that writing , and had given it to a British captain of the Navy , rushed upon me like lightning , and never in my life did I make a greater effort to overcome my feelings than on this occasion . The captain eagerly snatched it up , opened it , and held it before the prize-master , asking him what were the contents of that paper . He could not read English , and therefore could not tell . Another officer and several of the passengers were appealed to , for the same purpose , but luckily for me none of them could read English , if they could read at all . The captain then asked me what paper it was ; I carelessly answered him , it was a paper of no consequence , but it belonged to my affairs in Kingston , and had accidentally been placed in that book . Being unable to get any further information , he refolded it and placed it in the sack . I followed the action with the keenest glance , in order , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bottom of the bag where this paper was dropped . The rest of the examination , which lasted a couple of hours more , had no interest for me . Although I had escaped instant detection of apparently plotting against the safety of the Island of Cuba with the enemies of Spain , still this very paper would find its way to a Spanish court at a place where my handwriting was known , and it was therefore necessary to prevent such a result at all risk . I therefore closely watched the bag , which , after the examination was finished , was given in charge of the prize-master , who , after tying it with a string , deposited it in a corner of the cabin . My anxiety continued to be great , which I had to keep all to myself with an outward appearance of cheerfulness , for I did not even dare to venture to communicate my dilemma to Captain Hathaway , for fear of alarming him and thus creating suspicion . I did not relish the idea of being sentenced to the mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a discovery . I therefore plotted in silence , and reviewed several schemes to remove the paper or have it destroyed // at all events . I came to the conclusion that if all other means failed , I might perhaps succeed in throwing the whole bag out of the cabin window during the night . I had by this time become friendly , and almost intimate , with our prizemaster , to whom I had made a few trifling presents the day before . On him , therefore , I determined to operate in the first place . The captain of the armed boat had returned to his post , and orders were given to get under way for Santiago . About nine o'clock in the evening I joined the prize-master on deck , and as he was fond of talking with me I opened the conversation on several indifferent subjects , and by degrees entered upon my troubles in Kingston , observing that I had made many payments there for which I had a claim against the underwriters in Philadelphia . I then lamented that six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag , and that , unless I received them back again , payment would be refused me , and in consequence I should be the loser of some hundreds of dollars without anyone being benefited , and I carelessly observed that I would willingly give a small compensation to have these vouchers returned to me . He reflected a while and said , it would take too long a time to find these vouchers , even if he consented to go down with me to look for them . Finding him not averse to favor me , I rejoined that , as my trunk had been the fourth or fifth which was examined , my papers could not be above five or six inches from the bottom , and that consequently it would not be difficult to find them ; and if we did not succeed within a reasonable time I must take my chance of searching for them at Santiago . He observed that it was a pity I should be subjected to a probable loss of such an amount , or even part of it , and as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single paper relative to the prize vessel , at least not the concealed papers they were in search of , he could have no objections to my looking for my vouchers . We accordingly went down into the cabin together , where we remained alone . By his permission I re moved the bulk of the papers , until , as I thought , we came sufficiently near the depth where my paper had been dropped in . I then commenced my examination . For a considerable time I handled various papers , looked at some and rejected them , looked at others and sometimes pocketed them as some of the ones looked for ; but in reality not knowing or caring what they contained , hut solely for the purpose of making it appear that I was near the place where my papers were lodged . During the search my anxiety was so great that my mouth parched and my tongue got dry . It was the only chance I should probably ever have to recover this paper , and still it was indispensable that I should appear cool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper ; I knew it by the feeling of its shape before I saw it , and after glancing at it to make myself sure that r was not mistaken , I pocketed it without further observation . Not to create any possible suspicion , I continued the search for a few minutes longer , pocketed a couple of small papers more , and then pronounced myself satisfied , and after everything was rearranged we went again on deck . Much had now been gained , but as long as the paper was in existence , I was not free from danger . The strict search which had been made for the ship 's papers would have made it dangerous to tear up even a slip of paper with writing on it , which no doubt would have been seized , and the fragments preserved . It was therefore necessary to accomplish this in privacy ; I went therefore in the starlight night , and while under sail , over the side of the ship , and stooped down in the chains , and there , unobserved by anyone on deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the deep . I now felt relieved as from an incubus or a nightmare , but still my feelings remained so unsettled that , notwithstanding my fatigues , both of body and mind , and the want of sleep for two nights , I felt no inclination to go to rest . I again joined the prizemaster , and after conversing with him a little longer , slipped a quarter Joe ( a four-dollar gold piece ) into his hands , 4 // telling him in the meantime that his indulgence would now enable me to recover upward of a hundred dollars from the underwriters . Before daybreak we arrived outside the Morro Castle , at the mouth of the harbor of Santiago de Cuba ; but as no vessel is permitted to enter during the night , we stood off and on till daylight . When we , in the course of the morning , reached the city , both vessels were anchored in the stream , and none of the passengers permitted to go on shore . I , however , succeeded in sending a note on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to procure Hathaway 's and my release without loss of time , and a few hours afterward he himself , my friend Maurice Rogers , accompanied by several of my friends , brought an order for us to land . A few days after , according to previous arrangements made , I was cited before the court to have my little iron-bound trunk opened and examined . I found alongside the judge the king 's interpreter , Mr. Ilrady , who , after silently examining many of the papers , declared them all to be my private commer cial papers and unconnected with any of the concerns of the prize schooner . The box and papers were consequently locked up and placed again in my possession . Thus ended one of the most extraordinary adventures I ever met with . The time had now arfived when Captain Hathaway and myself parted company . Notwithstanding our late misfortunes at Kingston , we settled all our accounts and transactions in the most friendly manner , and I had the gratification of receiving his acknowledgment for the important assistance I had rendered him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of Russia duck and sheetings , converted the funds into doubloons , and took passage for Rhode Island . I remained at Santiago to await the arrival of Captain Grafton , with whom I intended to return . He arrived in January , 1807 , and nothing further of any importance occurred at Santiago , until I ultimately embarked for the last time for Philadelphia . Our voyage was unattended by any accidents , and we arrived safely on April 23 , 1807.
